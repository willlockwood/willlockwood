BIES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">BOBBY, WARDEN <em>v</em>. BIES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x93598.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 27, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 1, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">In <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Prior to <em>Atkins,</em> mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty.  See <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a>.  Nearly a decade before <em>Atkins, </em>respondent Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy.  Instructed at the sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evidence of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggravating factors (including the crime\xe2\x80\x99s brutality), the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, each concluding that Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation was entitled to \xe2\x80\x9csome weight\xe2\x80\x9d as a mitigating factor, but that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  Bies then filed an unsuccessful petition for state postconviction relief, contending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of a mentally retarded defendant.  Soon after Bies sought federal habeas relief, this Court decided <em>Atkins.  </em>The opinion left to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to determine<em> </em>when a person claiming mental retardation would fall within <em>Atkins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 compass.  Ohio heeded <em>Atkins</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em> </em>call in <em>State</em> v. <em>Lott.</em>  The District Court then stayed Bies\xe2\x80\x99 federal habeas proceedings so that he could present an <em>Atkins</em> claim to the state postconviction court.  Observing that Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation had not previously been established under the <em>Atkins</em>-<em>Lott</em> framework, the state court denied Bies\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment and ordered a full hearing on the <em>Atkins</em> claim.  Rather than proceeding with that hearing, Bies returned to federal court, arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from relitigating the mental retardation issue.  The District Court granted the habeas petition, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on <em>Ashe</em> v. <em>Swenson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/436/index.html">397 U. S. 436</a>, the Court of Appeals determined that all requirements for the issue preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause were met in Bies\xe2\x80\x99 case.  It concluded, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Ohio Supreme Court, on direct appeal, had decided the mental retardation issue under the same standard that court later adopted in <em>Lott</em>, and that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental state had been necessary to the death penalty judgment.  When the Sixth Circuit denied the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc, a concurring judge offered an alternative basis for decision.  He opined that, under <em>Sattazahn</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/101/index.html">537 U. S. 101</a>, jeopardy attaches once a capital defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cacquitted\xe2\x80\x9d based on findings establishing an entitlement to a life sentence; reasoning that the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation findings entitled Bies to a life sentence, he concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred any renewed inquiry into Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental state.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Ohio courts from conducting a full hearing on Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The alternative basis for decision offered by the concurring opinion at the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rehearing stage is rejected.  The State did not \xe2\x80\x9ctwice put [Bies] in jeopardy,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the core constitutional sense.  <em>Sattazahn</em> offers Bies no aid, for there was no acquittal here.  Bies\xe2\x80\x99 jury voted to impose the death penalty.  At issue is his attempt to vacate that sentence, not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase his punishment.  Nor did the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation determinations entitle Bies to a life sentence.  At the time of his sentencing and direct appeal, <em>Penry</em>, not <em>Atkins</em>, was the guiding decision, and the dispositive issue was whether the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The issue preclusion doctrine, on which the Sixth Circuit panel primarily relied, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded under <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Lott</em>.  The doctrine bars relitigation of issues actually determined and necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding.  Initially, it is not clear that the issue of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation was actually determined under the <em>Lott</em> test at trial or on direct appeal.  Nor did the State concede that Bies would succeed under <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Lott</em>, which had not then been decided.  More fundamental, it is clear that the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 statements regarding Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity were not necessary to the judgments affirming his death sentence.  Instead, those determinations cut against the ultimate outcome.  In holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit conflated a determination necessary to the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not outcome determinative.  The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on <em>Ashe\xe2\x80\x99</em>s statement:<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  397 U. S., at 443.  Bies\xe2\x80\x99 case does not involve the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cultimate fact\xe2\x80\x9d addressed in <em>Ashe.  </em>There, the State was precluded from trying Ashe for robbing a poker player because he had already been acquitted of robbing a different player in the same poker game, and the acquittal was based on a determination that Ashe was not a participant in the poker game robbery.  Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted, and determinations of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.  Moreover, even if the core issue preclusion requirements had been met, an exception to the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s application would be warranted due to the intervening <em>Atkins </em>decision.  Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation under <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Lott</em> are discrete legal issues.  One difference is that mental retardation, urged as a mitigating factor, may instead \xe2\x80\x9cenhance the likelihood that [a jury will find] the aggravating factor of future dangerousness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em> 536 U. S., at 521.  This reality explains why prosecutors, pre-<em>Atkins</em>, had little incentive to contest retardation evidence.  Because the change in law substantially altered the State\xe2\x80\x99s incentive to contest Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity, applying preclusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.  The federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 intervention in this case derailed the state-court proceeding.  Recourse first to Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s courts is what this Court envisioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing <em>Atkins</em>.  The State acknowledges that Bies is entitled to such recourse, but rightly seeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under the <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott </em>precedents.

S. 304</a> (2002), this Court held that the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual punishments\xe2\x80\x9d bars execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Prior to <em>Atkins</em>, the Court had determined that mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty.  See <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a> (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1992, nearly a decade before the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Atkins</em>, respondent Michael Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy.  Instructed at the sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evidence of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggravating factors (including the brutality of the crime), the jury recommended a sentence of death, which the trial court imposed.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s appellate courts affirmed the conviction and sentence.  The Ohio Supreme Court, in its 1996 opinion on direct review, observed that Bies\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cmild to borderline mental retardation merit[ed] some weight in mitigation,\xe2\x80\x9d but concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State</em> v. <em>Bies</em>, 74 Ohio St. 3d 320, 328, 658 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 754, 761\xe2\x80\x93762.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After this Court decided <em>Atkins</em>, the Ohio trial court ordered a full hearing on the question of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity.  The federal courts intervened, however, granting habeas relief to Bies, and ordering the vacation of his death sentence.  Affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that the Ohio Supreme Court, in 1996, had definitively determined, as a matter of fact, Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation.  That finding, the Court of Appeals concluded, established Bies\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9clegal entitlement to a life sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bies</em> v. <em>Bagley</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa03d 324, 334, n.\xc2\xa06 (CA6 2008).  Therefore, the Sixth Circuit ruled, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution barred any renewed inquiry into the matter of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental state.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Sixth Circuit, in common with the District Court, fundamentally misperceived the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause and its issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) component.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  First, Bies was not \xe2\x80\x9ctwice put in jeopardy.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was sentenced to death, and Ohio sought no further prosecution or punishment.  Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cserial prosecutions by the government[,] this case involves serial efforts by the defendant to vacate his capital sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bies</em> v. <em>Bagley</em>,<em> </em>535 F.\xc2\xa03d 520, 531\xe2\x80\x93532 (CA6 2008) (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, mental retardation for purposes of <em>Atkins</em>, and mental retardation as one mitigator to be weighed against aggravators, are discrete issues.  Most grave among the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s misunderstandings, issue preclusion is a plea available to prevailing parties.  The doctrine bars relitigation of determinations necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding.  The Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 recognition of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental state as a mitigating factor was hardly essential to the death sentence he received.  On the contrary, the retardation evidence cut against the final judgment.  Issue preclusion, in short, does not transform final judgment losers, in civil or criminal proceedings, into partially prevailing parties.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For his part in brutally causing the death of a ten-year-old boy, Bies was convicted by an Ohio jury of attempted rape, kidnaping, and aggravated murder with three death penalty specifications.

Winter, who had evaluated him at the court\xe2\x80\x99s order during the guilt phase and again before the mitigation hearing.  App. 191, 202.  Bies did not qualify for a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, Dr. Winter concluded, because he knew the difference between right and wrong at the time of the offense.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 51, 198\xe2\x80\x93200.  Bies\xe2\x80\x99 IQ, she further reported, fell in the 65\xe2\x80\x9375 range, <em>id.</em>, at 211\xe2\x80\x93212, indicating that he is \xe2\x80\x9cmildly mentally retarded to borderline mentally retarded,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 32, 199\xe2\x80\x93200, 213.  Dr. Winter also observed: \xe2\x80\x9c[Bies] goes about the community, unassisted [and] carries out the activities of daily life fairly independently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 199.  The State responded to Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mitigating evidence by emphasizing the brutality of the murder and the risk of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 future dangerousness.  Instructed to weigh the mitigating circumstances against aggravating factors, the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 88\xe2\x80\x9389.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ohio Court of Appeals and Supreme Court each independently reviewed the evidence and affirmed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 84\xe2\x80\x93108; <em>Bies</em>,<em> </em>74 Ohio St. 3d 320, 658 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 754.  Neither court devoted detailed attention to the issue of retardation.  Both concluded that Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mild to borderline mental retardation merited \xe2\x80\x9csome weight\xe2\x80\x9d in mitigation, as did his youth and lack of a criminal record.  App. 105\xe2\x80\x93106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 762.  The aggravating circumstances, each court found, overwhelmed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  App. 106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 762.  We denied Bies\xe2\x80\x99 petition for a writ of certiorari.  <em>Bies</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/1238/index.html">517 U. S. 1238</a> (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bies then filed a petition for state postconviction relief, contending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution prohibits execution of a mentally retarded defendant.  The trial court agreed that Bies was \xe2\x80\x9cmildly mentally retarded,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>but concluded that, under then-governing Ohio precedent, \xe2\x80\x9ca mildly mentally retarded defendant may be [p]unished by execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 153.  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, <em>id</em>., at 175\xe2\x80\x93176, and the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed Bies\xe2\x80\x99 appeal without an opinion, <em>State</em> v. <em>Bies</em>, 87 Ohio St. 3d 1440, 719 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 4 (1999) (Table).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bies next filed a federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Soon after that filing, this Court held, in <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 536 U. S., at 321, that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Our opinion did not provide definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person who claims mental retardation \xe2\x80\x9cwill be so impaired as to fall [within <em>Atkins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 compass].\xe2\x80\x9d  We<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0le[ft] to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ohio heeded <em>Atkins</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em> </em>call six months later in <em>State</em> v. <em>Lott</em>, 97 Ohio St. 3d 303, 2002\xe2\x80\x93Ohio\xe2\x80\x936625, 779 N. E. 2d 1011 <em>(per curiam)</em>.  At an <em>Atkins </em>hearing, the Ohio Supreme Court held, a defendant must prove: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3) onset before the age of 18.\xe2\x80\x9d  97 Ohio St. 3d, at 305, 779 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 1014.  \xe2\x80\x9cIQ tests,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, \xe2\x80\x9care one of the many factors that need to be considered, [but] they alone are not sufficient to make a final determination [of retardation].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court also announced \xe2\x80\x9ca rebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally retarded if his or her IQ is above 70.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court stayed its proceedings on Bies\xe2\x80\x99 federal habeas petition while Bies presented an <em>Atkins</em> claim to the state postconviction court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a.  Bies there moved for summary judgment, arguing that the record established his mental retardation, and that the State was \xe2\x80\x9cprecluded and estopped\xe2\x80\x9d from disputing it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 104a.  The state court recognized that <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott </em>had materially changed the significance of a mental retardation finding.  The court observed that mental retardation had not previously been established under the <em>Atkins</em>-<em>Lott</em> framework; given those precedent-setting decisions, the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a serious issue as to Mr. Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental status.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 104a.<em> </em>Accordingly, the court denied summary judgment and ordered a full hearing on the <em>Atkins</em> claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than proceeding with the hearing directed by the state court, Bies returned to the Federal District Court.  He argued that the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Double Jeopardy Clause, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, barred the State from relitigating the issue of his mental condition.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 81a.  The District Court granted the habeas petition and ordered vacation of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 death sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 68a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  519 F.\xc2\xa03d 324, 342.  It concluded that Bies\xe2\x80\x99 case was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled by\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ashe</em> v. <em>Swenson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/436/index.html">397 U. S. 436</a> (1970), which held that the doctrine of issue preclusion \xe2\x80\x9cis embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 332 (quoting 397 U.

It concluded, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Ohio Supreme Court, in resolving Bies\xe2\x80\x99 direct appeal, had decided the issue of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation under the same standard later adopted in <em>Lott</em>.  519 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336.  Further, the Court of Appeals held, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that Bies qualified as mentally retarded had been necessary to the judgment imposing the death sentence. \xe2\x80\x9c[D]etermining which mitigating factors are actually present,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cis a necessary first step to determining whether those factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals denied the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc.  535 F.\xc2\xa03d 520.

Under that decision, he noted, jeopardy attaches, and relitigation is precluded, once a judge or jury has \xe2\x80\x9cacquitted\xe2\x80\x9d a capital defendant \xe2\x80\x9cby entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to [a] life sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 522 (quoting <em>Sattazahn</em>, 537 U.

In Bies\xe2\x80\x99 case, Judge Clay concluded, the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 determination of mental retardation \xe2\x80\x9centitle[d]\xe2\x80\x9d Bies to a life sentence, and thus the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from disputing the issue of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation.  535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 523\xe2\x80\x93524.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Sutton dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  <em>Sattazahn </em>was inapposite, he maintained, because Bies was never \xe2\x80\x9ctwice put in jeopardy.\xe2\x80\x9d  535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Const., Amdt. 5, in the core constitutional sense.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he touchstone for double-jeopardy protection in capital-sentencing proceedings is whether there has been an \xe2\x80\x98acquittal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sattazahn</em>,<em> </em>537 U. S., at 109.  <em>Sattazahn</em> offers Bies no aid.  In that case, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s first capital jury had deadlocked at the penalty phase, and the court, as required by state law, entered a life sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 104\xe2\x80\x93105.<em> </em>This Court held the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar the State\xe2\x80\x99s request for the death penalty at the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retrial, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cneither the judge nor the jury had acquitted the defendant in his first \xe2\x80\xa6 proceeding by entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 108\xe2\x80\x93109 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, as in <em>Sattazahn</em>, there was no acquittal.  Bies\xe2\x80\x99 jury voted to impose the death penalty.  At issue now is Bies\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csecond run at vacating his death sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d 535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 531 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase his punishment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor did any state-court determination of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation \xe2\x80\x9centitl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d him to a life sentence.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 523 (Clay, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).<font b="1">  At the time Bies was sentenced and on direct appeal, <em>Penry</em>, not <em>Atkins</em>, was this Court\xe2\x80\x99s guiding decision.  Under <em>Penry</em>, no single mitigator or aggravator was determinative of the judgment.  Instead, the dispositive issue, correctly comprehended by the Ohio courts, was whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bies</em>,<em> </em>74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 762.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals panel relied primarily on the doctrine of issue preclusion, recognized in <em>Ashe </em>to be \xe2\x80\x9cembodied in\xe2\x80\x9d the Double Jeopardy Clause.  397 U. S., at 445.  Preclusion doctrine, however, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded under <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Lott</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of \xe2\x80\x9can issue of fact or law\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cis actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and \xe2\x80\xa6 is essential to the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa727 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement).  If a judgment does not depend on a given determination, relitigation of that determination is not precluded.  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa727, Comment <em>h</em>.  In addition, even where the core requirements of issue preclusion are met, an exception to the general rule may apply when a \xe2\x80\x9cchange in [the] applicable legal context\xe2\x80\x9d intervenes.  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa728, Comment <em>c</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, it is not clear from the spare statements of the Ohio appellate courts that the issue of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental retardation under the <em>Lott</em> test was actually determined at trial or during Bies\xe2\x80\x99 direct appeal.  No court found, for example, that Bies suffered \xe2\x80\x9csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lott</em>, 97 Ohio St. 3d, at 305, 779 N. E. 2d, at 1014.  Nor did the State concede that Bies would succeed under <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Lott</em>, which had not then been decided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More fundamental, it <em>is</em> clear that the courts\xe2\x80\x99 statements regarding Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity were not necessary to the judgments affirming his death sentence.  A determination ranks as necessary or essential only when the final outcome hinges on it.  See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74421, p. 543 (2d ed. 2002).  \xe2\x80\x9cFar from being necessary to the judgment, the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 mental&amp;nbhyph;retardation findings cut against it\xe2\x80\x94making them quintessentially the kinds of rulings not eligible for issue-preclusion treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 533 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In finding the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to [the] judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d 519 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 342, the Court of Appeals panel reasoned that the Ohio courts determined Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity pursuant to their \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory duty\xe2\x80\x9d to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  <em>Id.</em>, at 338.<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[W]eighing [aggravators against mitigators],\xe2\x80\x9d the panel explained, \xe2\x80\x9ccould not have occurred unless the court first determined what to place on either side of the scale.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> This reasoning conflates a determination necessary to the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not outcome determinative.  Issue preclusion cannot transform Bies\xe2\x80\x99 loss at the sentencing phase into a partial victory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reason, the Court of Appeals erred in its repeated reliance on the following passage in <em>Ashe: </em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 331\xe2\x80\x93333 (quoting 397 U. S., at 443).   Bies\xe2\x80\x99 case does not involve an \xe2\x80\x9cultimate fact\xe2\x80\x9d of the kind our decision in <em>Ashe </em>addressed.<em> </em>There, the State sought to try Ashe for robbing a poker player even though a jury had already acquitted him of robbing a different player in the same poker game.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s second attempt was precluded, we held, because the first jury had based its verdict of acquittal upon a determination that Ashe was not one of the participants in the poker game robbery.  <em>Id.</em>, at 445.  Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted\xe2\x80\x94and, as already observed, determinations of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if the core requirements for issue preclusion had been met, an exception to the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s application would be warranted due to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s intervening decision in <em>Atkins</em>.  Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation under <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Lott</em> are discrete legal issues.  The <em>Atkins </em>decision itself highlights one difference: \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 321.  This reality explains why prosecutors, pre-<em>Atkins</em>, had little incentive vigorously to contest evidence of retardation.  See App. 65 (excerpt from prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument describing as Bies\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hief characteristic\xe2\x80\x9d his \xe2\x80\x9csensitivity to any kind of frustration and his rapid tendency to get enraged\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 39\xe2\x80\x9354 (cross-examination of Bies\xe2\x80\x99 expert witness designed to emphasize Bies\xe2\x80\x99 dangerousness to others).  Because the change in law substantially altered the State\xe2\x80\x99s incentive to contest Bies\xe2\x80\x99 mental capacity, applying preclusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.  See Restatement \xc2\xa728, Comment <em>c</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 intervention in this case derailed a state trial court proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to determine whether Bies ha[s] a successful <em>Atkins</em> claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 534 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Recourse first to Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s courts is just what this Court envisioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing the <em>Atkins</em> decision.  The State acknowledges that Bies is entitled to such recourse, but it rightly seeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under the postsentencing precedents set in <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eplac[ing] a more confusing lexicon,\xe2\x80\x9d the term \xe2\x80\x9cissue preclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d in current usage, \xe2\x80\x9cencompasses the doctrines [earlier called] \xe2\x80\x98collateral estoppel\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98direct estoppel.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Sturgell</em>, 553 U.
