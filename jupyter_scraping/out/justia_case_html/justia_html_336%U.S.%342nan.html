JUSTICE RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The principal question is whether a lessee of mineral rights in allotted and restricted Indian lands is immunized by the Constitution against payment of nondiscriminatory state gross production taxes and state excise taxes on petroleum produced from such lands.  In effect, the issue is whether this Court\'s previous decisions in <em>Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co.,</em> 247 U.S. 503; <em>Large Oil Co. v. Howard,</em> 248 U.S. 549, and <em>Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/521/case.html">296 U. S. 521</a></span>, invalidating such taxes as applied to like lessees, have been so undermined by later decisions, in particular <em>Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/376/case.html">303 U. S. 376</a></span>, that they should now be overruled.</p>\n<p>With certain exceptions, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the lands from which was extracted the petroleum sought to be taxed are held in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 336 U. S. 344</a></p><p> trust by the United States, pursuant to allotments made under the General Allotment Act, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] for various members of the Pottawatomie, Apache, Comanche, and Otoe and Missouria Tribes. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  All the lands are located within the State of Oklahoma, and, at all material times, they were restricted [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] against alienation by the Indian <em>cestui</em> owners without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  He </p><p><a class="page-number" name="345">Page 336 U. S. 345</a></p><p> approved each of the leases now in question.  The respondents Texas Company (No. 40) and Magnolia Petroleum Company (No. 41) acquired their leases before Oklahoma levied the assessments now in issue, either as original lessees or by assignment from non-Indians who were such lessees.  The companies thus became owners of all right, title and interest in their respective leases, subject only to the one-eighth royalty interest reserved to the Indian lessors, and were such owners at the times of the respective assessments.  It may be taken that they have operated the leases in conformity with the applicable regulations of the Department of the Interior [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and of the Oklahoma, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] except for the payment of the state taxes in question. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Oklahoma gross production tax requires payment of five percent of the gross value of production, including royalty interests.  It is imposed on every person engaged in the production in Oklahoma of petroleum, crude oil, or other mineral oil, and natural gas and casinghead gas.  The tax is exacted in lieu of all taxes by the state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 336 U. S. 346</a></p><p> and its political subdivisions on property rights in minerals and mineral rights, producing leases, machinery used in connection with any oil or gas well, the oil and gas during the tax year in which it is produced, and any investment in any leases, minerals, or other property.  The statute authorizes the state board of equalization to raise or lower the rate of tax to equate the amount payable with the amount which would be payable if the general <em>ad valorem</em> property tax were assessed against the property of the producers subject to taxation.  The board\'s rate changes are subject to review by the state supreme court. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In consequence of these provisions, the tax has been construed consistently by the state courts to be a tax on the lessee\'s property, not an occupation or excise tax. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 336 U. S. 347</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The petroleum excise tax requires payment of one mill, formerly one-eighth of one cent, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] per barrel on every barrel of petroleum produced in Oklahoma.  The statute was enacted first in 1933 to defray the expenses of administering the state\'s newly adopted proration law, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and has been reenacted at each subsequent session of the legislature. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The tax, unlike the gross production tax, is construed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court as an excise tax on the production of oil.  <em>Barnsdall Refineries v. Oklahoma Tax Commission,</em> 171 Okl. 145, 41 P.2d 918, <em>aff\'d,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/521/case.html">296 U. S. 296</a></span> U.S. 521.</p>\n<p>In No. 40, the Oklahoma Tax Commission, petitioner here, assessed both gross production and petroleum excise taxes against the Texas Company for production, less royalties to the Indian lessors, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] during September, October </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 336 U. S. 348</a></p><p> and November, 1942.  In No. 41, the commission likewise assessed both taxes, less royalties, on the Magnolia Company\'s production for various periods between June 1, 1942, and March 1, 1946.  The orders were entered after the cases were consolidated for hearing before the commission, and were thus heard by it.</p>\n<p>In No. 40, the Texas Company paid the taxes under protest, and brought suit to recover them in an Oklahoma trial court.  After hearing, that court sustained the commission\'s demurrer to the company\'s amended petition and ordered it dismissed.  Appeal was duly taken to the state supreme court.  In No. 41, following a different statutory procedure, the Magnolia Company appealed from the assessments against it directly to that court.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, with one judge dissenting, held the assessments invalid.  The decisions rested flatly on the ground that the lessee was an instrumentality of the Federal Government, and, as such, under prior and controlling decisions of this Court, particularly in the <em>Large Oil, Gipsy Oil,</em> and <em>Barnsdall Refineries</em> cases, <em>supra,</em> not subject to the taxes in question. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In the Texas Company case, the court expressly distinguished <em>Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., supra,</em> on the ground that the decision in that case related </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 336 U. S. 349</a></p><p> to income taxes assessed against the lessee there situated as were the lessees here.  The opinion, indicating the writer\'s personal view that reconsideration of the earlier decisions well might be sought, nevertheless stated:</p>\n<p>"But it is thought beyond the power of this court to now engage in such reconsideration, in view of the cited decisions of the higher authority which thus far wholly sustain the claim of [the Texas Company] to immunity from the tax here involved."</p>\n<p>"Upon questions of federal law, citizens and their attorneys have the right to rely upon decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, and, upon such questions, it is our fixed duty to follow such decisions, leaving to the United States Congress or or Supreme Court the making of the necessary changes in such legal rules."</p>\n<p>From the state supreme court\'s decisions, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] the Oklahoma Tax Commission filed appeals in this Court.  We dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction.  But, treating them as applications for certiorari, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] we granted the writs and consolidated the cases for argument.  333 U.S. 870.  The Solicitor General was requested to file a brief as <em>amicus curiae.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>But for the course of decision here from <em>Choctaw, O. &amp; G. R. Co. v. Harrison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/235/292/case.html">235 U. S. 292</a></span>, decided in 1914, to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 336 U. S. 350</a></p><p> <em>Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/521/case.html">296 U. S. 521</a></span>, decided in 1936, the problems of taxation and intergovernmental immunity these cases present would seem subject to solution on well settled or fairly obvious legal principles.</p>\n<p>It has long been established that property owned by a private person and used by him in performing services for the Federal Government is subject to state and local <em>ad valorem</em> taxes. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  And the oil and gas produced is, of course, subject to such taxation.  <em>Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/325/case.html">288 U. S. 325</a></span>.  Both by the substance of the statute\'s explicit provisions and by the consistent construction of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] that state\'s so-called gross production tax, in its presently applicable form, is a tax on the lessee\'s property used in carrying out its contractual obligations with the Federal Government, and on the oil and gas during the tax year in which it was produced.  The tax is levied expressly in lieu of all property taxes which the state might constitutionally impose in <em>ad valorem</em> form, the gross production levy being a tentative measure for the value of that property.  To guard against that measure\'s being utilized to lay in effect a tax not actually of that character, the state board of equalization is authorized, indeed is required upon complaint, to equate the amount payable with what would be payable if the general <em>ad valorem</em> tax were assessed against the property of the producing lessees subject to taxation, with provision for judicial review of the board\'s action.</p>\n<p>Unembarrassed by some of this Court\'s prior decisions, therefor,e Oklahoma\'s so-called gross production tax </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 336 U. S. 351</a></p><p> would seem to be sustained by the well established line of decisions cited above. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if the status of respondents as federal instrumentalities, in the sense in which they use the term, were fully conceded, it seems difficult to imagine how any substantial interference with performing their functions as such in developing the leaseholds could be thought to flow from requiring them to pay the small tax Oklahoma exacts to satisfy their shares of the state\'s expense in maintaining and administering its proration program.  That system works for respondents\' benefit in performing their producing function, as it does for the benefit of all other producers, by stabilizing production, eliminating waste, and preventing runaway competition in an industry notorious for those evils in the absence of some such control.  <em>Cf. Railroad Commission of Texas v. Rowan &amp; Nichols Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/573/case.html">310 U. S. 573</a></span>; <em>Republic Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/62/case.html">334 U. S. 62</a></span>, dissenting opinion Part III,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/62/case.html#89">334 U. S. 89</a></span>.  Indeed, respondents do not claim they are exempt from the plan\'s regulatory features.  They claim only that they are constitutionally immune from contributing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 336 U. S. 352</a></p><p> to the plan\'s support.  As a matter entirely fresh, the contention would not seem weighty.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>But neither issue is fresh.  Each is complicated by this Court\'s prior decisions squarely ruling that the taxes are invalid as unconstitutional intrusions by the state upon the performance of federal functions.  Those decisions have not been explicitly overruled.  But it is strongly urged that our later decisions, especially in <em>Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., supra,</em> have stricken the foundation from beneath the <em>Gipsy Oil, Large Oil</em> and <em>Barnsdall Refineries</em> decisions, <em>supra,</em> so that the latter no longer can stand in reason and consistency with the former.</p>\n<p>It is true that this Court\'s more recent pronouncements have beaten a fairly large retreat from its formerly prevailing ideas concerning the breadth of so-called intergovernmental immunities from taxation, a retreat which has run in both directions -- to restrict the scope of immunity of private persons seeking to clothe themselves with governmental character from both federal and state taxation.  The history of the immunity, by and large in both aspects, represents a rising or expanding curve, tapering off into a falling or contracting one.</p>\n<p>Our present problem lies on the constitutional level.  It requires reconsideration of former decisions specifically in point, together with later ones deviating in rationale.  It is of substantial importance both for the states\' powers of taxation and for the subjects on which they may impinge.  Moreover, even though the immediate questions are closely related to federal policies concerning  Indian lands, they are equally tangent to considerations affecting other types of situation raising questions of immunity.  For these reasons it will not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 336 U. S. 353</a></p><p> be amiss to consider the questions in the context of two conflicting courses of decision.</p>\n<p>Before we turn to the survey, however, two delimitations of the specific issues should be made.</p>\n<p>These cases present no question concerning the immunity of the Indian lands themselves from state taxation.  There is no possibility that ultimate liability for the taxes may fall upon the owner of the land.  <em>Cf. Wilson v. Cook,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/474/case.html">327 U. S. 474</a></span>, dissenting opinion,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/474/case.html#489">327 U. S. 489</a></span>.  Nor, as has been noted, do the cases involve challenges to the immunity from state taxation of royalty oil, the Indian\'s share of production. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Despite the possibility that the prospect of taxation by the state may reduce the amount the United States might receive from the sale of its property, it is well established that property purchased by a private person from the Federal Government becomes a part of the general mass of property in the state, and must bear its fair share of the expenses of local government.  The theoretical burden which state <em>ad valorem</em> property taxation thus imposes upon the Federal Government is regarded as too remote and indirect to justify tax immunity for property purchased from that Government.  <em>New Brunswick v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/547/case.html">276 U. S. 547</a></span>; <em>Forbes v. Gracey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/762/case.html">94 U. S. 762</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/89/527/case.html">Tucker v.

Also subject to local <em>ad valorem</em> taxation, as has been noted above, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] is property owned by a private party and used by him in performing services for the Federal Government.  Where oil produced by a private lessee from restricted Indian lands was owned solely by the lessee and had been removed from the leased lands and stored in the lessee\'s tanks, it was held subject to state <em>ad valorem</em> taxation.  <em>Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/325/case.html">288 U. S. 325</a></span>. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  And equipment used by a lessee of restricted Indian lands has been held subject to the same sort of exaction.  <em>Taber v. Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/1/case.html">300 U. S. 1</a></span>.  <em>Cf. Thomas v. Gay,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/169/264/case.html">169 U. S. 264</a></span>, sustaining a state tax on cattle grazing on tribal lands leased from Indians by the non-Indian owner of the cattle.</p>\n<p>Anomalous in the light of these rulings was the evolution of a line of decisions of this Court condemning forms of taxation which would have imposed no more direct or substantial burden upon the United States than would an <em>ad valorem</em> property tax applied to property purchased from the United States.  Private lessees of restricted or tribal Indian lands came to be held "federal instrumentalities" like the lands themselves, and so immune from various forms of state taxation ranging from a gross production tax on production from the leased lands to a tax upon the lessee\'s net income.  The theory of the Court was the one which was rejected in directly analogous cases:  a state tax on the lessee, the lease, or the profits from the lease would be "a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 336 U.

The development is an outgrowth and a progressive extension of early rulings that tribal lands themselves are immune from state taxation. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  More immediately, it stems from the later ruling that allotted Indian lands held in trust by the United States were "an instrumentality employed by the United States for the benefit and control of this dependent race," and so were immune from state taxation.  <em>United States v.

The state did not challenge </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 336 U. S. 358</a></p><p> the implied constitutional immunity, but pitched its argument on the ground of statutory exemption. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>The instrumentality doctrine has been applied to confer a correlative immunity upon private lessees of state-owned lands.  The Texas rule that oil and gas leases are present sales to the lessees of the oil and gas in place caused this Court to sustain the imposition of the federal income tax upon income of the lessee derived from the sale of oil and gas produced from lands leased from that state.  It was observed that</p>\n<p>". . . the remote and indirect effects upon the one government of such nondiscriminatory tax by the other have never been considered adequate grounds for thus aiding the one at the expense of the taxing power of the other."</p>\n<p><em>Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v.

A tax on income would be no greater burden where, under applicable state law, "title" to the oil did not "pass" until the oil was removed from the ground.  And although Justices Brandeis, Stone, Roberts, and Cardozo contended that the <em>Gillespie</em> decision could not stand consistently with the principles which had been reaffirmed in the <em>Group No. 1 Oil</em> case, a majority of one in <em>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/393/case.html">285 U. S. 393</a></span>, provided a corollary to the rule of the <em>Gillespie</em> case.  This was done by holding that the Federal Government was barred from taxing the income of a lessee of state lands, as the state was barred from taxing the income of the lessee of federal lands.</p>\n<p>A parallel immunity from state occupational or privilege taxes was once accorded private contractors with, or agencies of, the Government, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/226/404/case.html">Williams v.

And they insist that a sharp line should be drawn between what they call lessees performing a governmental function and independent contractors doing work for the Government. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  The latter distinction is largely, if not altogether, verbal in the context of the fact situations in these cases.  As for the former difference, although the Court explicitly overruled only the <em>Gillespie</em> and <em>Coronado</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 336 U. S. 363</a></p><p> cases, the groundings of the <em>Mountain Producers</em> decision do not permit limiting its effects to so narrow an application. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>The language last quoted above is as applicable to the present cases as it was to the <em>Gillespie</em> and <em>Coronado</em> decisions.  The taxes here are nondiscriminatory.  The respondents are "private persons" who seek immunity "for their property or gains because they are engaged in operations under a government contract or lease."  The functions they perform in operating the leases are hardly more governmental in character than those performed by lessees of school lands or, indeed, by many contractors with the Government.  The lessees in the <em>Mountain Producers</em> case stood identically with the respondents in all these respects.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the burdens of the taxes here, if any of a character likely to interfere with respondents in carrying out the terms of their leases, are as appropriately to be judged by "regard . . . to substance and direct effects," and as inappropriately to be determined "by merely theoretical conceptions of interference with the functions of government," as were those in the <em>Mountain Producers</em> case. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  True, as respondents say, a net income </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 336 U. S. 364</a></p><p> tax may be a step farther removed from interfering effect than a gross production tax or excise tax on production.  But this all depends upon the rate at which each tax is levied.</p>\n<p>To the adaptation of Marshall\'s oft-quoted aphorism made by Mr. Justice McKenna in <em>Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma,</em> 240 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/240/522/case.html#530">240 U. S. 530</a></span>, and followed by Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Gillespie v. Oklahoma,</em> 257 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/501/case.html#505">257 U. S. 505</a></span>, namely, that "[a] tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them," Chief Justice Hughes, in the <em>Mountain Producers</em> case, did not explicitly make the rejoinder given by Holmes in another connection, "The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits."  <em>Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/218/case.html">277 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/218/case.html#223">277 U. S. 223</a></span>.  But this was the effect of the <em>Mountain Producers</em> decision when, in a single paragraph, it challenged both the aphorism and the assumption that "a tax upon the profits of the leases" was "a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards."</p>\n<p>The <em>Mountain Producers</em> case was not decided on narrow, merely technical or presumptive, grounds.  Its very foundation was a repudiation of those insubstantial bases for securing broad private tax exemptions, unjustified by actual interfering or destructive effects upon the performance of obligations to or work for the government, state or national.  The decision came as the result of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 336 U. S. 365</a></p><p> experience and of observation of the constant widening of the exempting process from tax to tax to tax.</p>\n<p>Since that decision, as we have noted, the process has been reversed in direction.  True, intergovernmental immunity remains, for the most part.  But, so far as concerns private persons claiming immunity for their ordinary business operations (even though in connection with governmental activities), no implied constitutional immunity can rest on the merely hypothetical interferences with governmental functions here asserted to sustain exemption.  In the light of the broad groundings of the <em>Mountain Producers</em> decision and of later decisions, we cannot say that the <em>Gipsy Oil, Large Oil,</em> and <em>Barnsdall Refineries</em> decisions remain immune to the effects of the <em>Mountain Producers</em> decision and others which have followed it.  They "are out of harmony with correct principle," as were the <em>Gillespie</em> and Coronado decisions and, accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled.  This accords with the result reached in <em>Santa Rita Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. State Board of Equalization,</em> 112 Mont. 359, 116 P.2d 1012.  Moreover, since the decisions in <em>Choctaw, O. &amp; G. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra,</em> and <em>Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra,</em> rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the <em>Gipsy Oil, Large Oil,</em> and <em>Barnsdall Refineries</em> decisions, indeed, supplied those foundations, we think they too should be, and they now are, overruled.</p>\n<p>We do not imply by this decision that Congress does not have power to immunize these lessees from the taxes we think the Constitution permits Oklahoma to impose in the absence of such action. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  The question whether immunity shall be extended in situations like these is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 336 U. S. 366</a></p><p> essentially legislative in character.  But Congress has not created an immunity here by affirmative action, [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>] and "[t]he immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication."  <em>Oklahoma Tax Commission v.

[I]f it appears that there is no ground for implying a constitutional immunity, there is equally a want of any ground for assuming any purpose on the part of Congress to create an immunity."</p>\n<p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court appears to suggest, though the opinions do not flatly so state, as a possible alternative support for its conclusion in these cases, that "Congress has acted on the theory that such immunity exists in the case of leases of this character unless waived" -- that is, several congressional enactments permit Oklahoma to impose a gross production tax on minerals produced from the lands of the Osages, [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>] the Kaws, [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>] the Quapaws, [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>] and the Five Civilized Tribes, [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>] and authorize payment of taxes due on account of the Indians\' royalty interest.  But Congress\' purpose in enacting these statutes was the removal of the immunities of the Indians themselves, immunities which are not challenged in these cases; the action was occasioned by the favorable economic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 336 U. S. 367</a></p><p> position of the particular Indians. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  The resulting removal of the immunity of private lessees of those Indian lands was an incidental effect of this legislation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we refuse to infer from mere congressional silence approval of the doctrine of immunity enunciated in the <em>Choctaw, O. &amp; G.

However, it was conceded at the argument here that the assessments were valid insofar as they applied to interests in lands owned, when the assessments were made, by non-Indian owners or by Indian owners not under restriction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>24 Stat. 389, 390, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 348, 349.  <em>See</em> Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 108-109 (1942).
