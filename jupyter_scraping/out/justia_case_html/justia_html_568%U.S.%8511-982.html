Already denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of Nike\xe2\x80\x99s Air Force 1 trademark.  While the suit was pending, Nike issued a \xe2\x80\x9cCovenant Not to Sue,\xe2\x80\x9d promising not to raise any trademark or unfair competition claims against Already or any affiliated entity based on Already\xe2\x80\x99s existing footwear designs, or any future Already designs that constituted a \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable imitation\xe2\x80\x9d of Already\xe2\x80\x99s current products.   Nike then moved to dismiss its claims with prejudice, and to dismiss Already\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the covenant had extinguished the case or controversy.  Already opposed dismissal of its counterclaim, contending that Nike had not established that its covenant had mooted the case.  In support, Already presented an affidavit from its president, stating that Already planned to introduce new versions of its lines into the market; affidavits from three potential investors, asserting that they would not consider investing in Already until Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark was invalidated; and an affidavit from an Already executive, stating that Nike had intimidated retailers into refusing to carry Already\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.  The District Court dismissed Already\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, concluding that there was no longer a justiciable controversy.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  It explained that the covenant was broadly drafted; that the court could not conceive of a shoe that would infringe Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark yet not fall within the covenant; and that Already had not asserted any intent to market such a shoe.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0This case is moot.

The voluntary cessation doctrine was not disavowed in Deakins v. Monaghan, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193\n.  There, the Court employed precisely the analysis the test requires, finding a case moot because the challenged action\xe2\x80\x94pursuing a claim in court\xe2\x80\x94could not be resumed in \xe2\x80\x9cthis or any subsequent action\xe2\x80\x9d and because it was entirely \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speculative\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that any similar claim would arise in the future.

The covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.  It prohibits Nike from filing suit or making any claim or demand; protects both Already and Already\xe2\x80\x99s distributors and customers; and covers not just current or previous designs, but also colorable imitations.  Once Nike demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of Already\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unlawful conduct, it became incumbent on Already to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans to engage in activities that would arguably infringe Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark yet not be covered by the covenant.  But Already failed to do so in the courts below or in this Court.  The case is thus moot because the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur.  Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., \n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, and Altvater v. Freeman, \n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359\n, distinguished.

Already argues that as long as Nike is free to assert its trademark, investors will hesitate to invest in Already.  But once it is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely clear\xe2\x80\x9d that challenged conduct cannot \xe2\x80\x9creasonably be expected to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d Friends of the Earth, supra, at 190, the fact that some individuals may base decisions on conjectural or hypothetical speculation does not give rise to the sort of concrete and actual injury necessary to establish Article III standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555\n.  Already worries about its retailers, but even if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will take action against the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s retailers, the covenant here extends protection to Already\xe2\x80\x99s distributors and customers.  Already also complains that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sue in the first place has led Already to fear another suit.  But, since Nike has met its burden to demonstrate that there is no reasonable risk of such a suit, this concern is unfounded.  Already falls back on the sweeping argument that, as one of Nike\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, it inherently has standing because no covenant can eradicate the effects of a registered but invalid trademark.  The logical conclusion of this theory seems to be that a market participant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a competitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\xe2\x80\x94e.g., a trademark or the awarding of a contract\xe2\x80\x94but this Court has never accepted such a boundless theory of standing. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlready\xe2\x80\x99s policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to bully small innovators does not support adoption of this broad theory.  Granting covenants not to sue may be a risky long-term strategy for a trademark holder.  And while accepting Already\xe2\x80\x99s theory may benefit the small competitor in this case, it also lowers the gates for larger companies with more resources, who may challenge the intellectual property portfolios of more humble rivals simply because they are competitors in the same market.  This would further encourage parties to employ litigation as a weapon against their competitors rather than as a last resort for settling disputes.

Already has had every opportunity and incentive to submit evidence in the proceedings below.  It has refused, at every stage of the proceedings, to suggest that it has any plans to design a shoe that violates the Air Force 1 trademark yet falls outside the covenant.  And while the courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary cessation standard, their analysis addressed the same questions this Court addresses here under that standard.

But then Nike dismissed its claims with prejudice and issued its covenant, calling into question the existence of any continuing case or controversy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder our precedents, it was Nike\xe2\x80\x99s burden to show that it \xe2\x80\x9ccould not reasonably be expected\xe2\x80\x9d to resume its enforcement efforts against Already.  Friends of the Earth, supra, at 190.  Nike makes a halfhearted effort to avoid this test.  Relying on Deakins v. Monaghan, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193 (1988)\n, it argues that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a defendant makes a judicially enforceable commitment to avoid the conduct that forms the basis for an Article III controversy, there is no reason to apply a special rule premised on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered ability to \xe2\x80\x98return to [its] old ways.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 42.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNike\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Deakins is misplaced.  In Deakins, the Court did not disavow the voluntary cessation doctrine; the Court employed precisely the analysis required by that test.  It found the case was moot because the challenged action\xe2\x80\x94pursuing a claim in court\xe2\x80\x94could not be resumed in \xe2\x80\x9cthis or any subsequent action\xe2\x80\x9d and because it was entirely \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative\xe2\x80\x9d that any similar claim would arise in the future.  484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 201, n.\xc2\xa04 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It distinguished that situation from one in which a defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cfree to return to his old ways.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is the question the voluntary cessation doctrine poses: Could the allegedly wrongful behavior reasonably be expected to re- cur?  Nike cannot avoid its \xe2\x80\x9cformidable burden\xe2\x80\x9d by as- suming the answer to that question.

The covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.  Beyond simply prohibiting Nike from filing suit, it prohibits Nike from making any claim or any demand.  It reaches beyond Already to protect Already\xe2\x80\x99s distributors and customers.  And it covers not just current or previous designs, but any colorable imitations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition, Nike originally argued that the Sugars and Soulja Boys infringed its trademark; in other words, Nike believed those shoes were \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable imitations\xe2\x80\x9d of the Air Force 1s.  See Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), \xc2\xa732, \n\n60Stat.\n437, as amended, \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71114.  Nike\xe2\x80\x99s cov- enant now allows Already to produce all of its existing footwear designs\xe2\x80\x94including the Sugar and Soulja Boy\xe2\x80\x94and any \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable imitation\xe2\x80\x9d of those designs.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that \xe2\x80\x9cit is hard to imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe [Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark] and yet not fall under the Covenant.\xe2\x80\x9d*  663 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 97.  Nike, having taken the position in court that there is no prospect of such a shoe, would be hard pressed to as- sert the contrary down the road.  See New Hampshire v. Maine, \n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742, \n749 (2001)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Davis v. Wakelee, \n\n156 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680, \n689 (1895)\n)).  If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed to it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it, and we cannot conceive of it.  It sits, as far as we can tell, on a shelf between Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s ruby slippers and Perseus\xe2\x80\x99s winged sandals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven Nike\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration that the covenant encompasses all of its allegedly unlawful conduct, it was incumbent on Already to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans to engage in activities not covered by the covenant.  After all, information about Already\xe2\x80\x99s business activities and plans is uniquely within its possession.  The case is moot if the court, considering the covenant\xe2\x80\x99s language and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s anticipated future activities, is satisfied that it is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely clear\xe2\x80\x9d that the allegedly unlawful activity cannot reasonably be expected to recur.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut when given the opportunity before the District Court, Already did not assert any intent to design or market a shoe that would expose it to any prospect of in- fringement liability.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (find- ing that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno indication\xe2\x80\x9d of any such intent); 663 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 97, n. 5 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of record evidence that [Already] intends to make any arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously covered by the Covenant\xe2\x80\x9d).  The only affidavit it submitted to the District Court on that question was from its president, saying little more than that Already currently has plans to introduce new shoe lines and make modifications to existing shoe lines.  It never stated that these shoes would arguably infringe Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark yet fall outside the scope of the covenant.  Nor did it do so on appeal to the Second Circuit.  And again, it failed to do so here, even when counsel for Already was asked at oral argument whether his client had any intention to design or market a shoe that would even arguably fall outside the covenant.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\xe2\x80\x938.  Given the covenant\xe2\x80\x99s broad language, and given that Already has asserted no concrete plans to engage in conduct not covered by the covenant, we can conclude the case is moot because the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe authorities on which Already relies are not on point.  In Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., we affirmed the unremarkable proposition that a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to rely on one of two possible alternative grounds (noninfringement rather than invalidity) did not strip it of power to decide the second question, particularly when its decree was subject to review by this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, \n98 (1993)\n.  In essence, when a court has jurisdiction to review a case, and decides the issue on two independent grounds, the first half of its opinion does not moot the second half, or vice versa.  Here the issue is whether the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the claim in the first place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case is also unlike Altvater v. Freeman, \n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359 (1943)\n.  There, patent holders brought suit against licensees for specific performance of a license.  The licensees counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents were invalid.  The Court of Appeals, after finding that the license was no longer in force and the devices at issue did not infringe, dismissed the licensees\xe2\x80\x99 counterclaim as moot.  We reversed, finding the contro- versy still live because the licensees continued to \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactur[e] and sell[ ] additional articles claimed to fall under the patents,\xe2\x80\x9d and the patent holders continued to \xe2\x80\x9cdemand[ ]\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. royalties\xe2\x80\x9d for those products.  Id., at 364\xe2\x80\x93365.  Here of course the whole point is that Already is free to sell its shoes without any fear of a trademark claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlready argues, however, that there are alternative theories of Article III injuries that save the case from mootness.  First, it argues that so long as Nike remains free to assert its trademark, investors will be apprehensive about investing in Already.  Second, it argues that given Nike\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sue in the first place, Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademarks will now hang over Already\xe2\x80\x99s operations like a Damoclean sword.  Finally, and relatedly, Already argues that, as one of Nike\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, it inherently has standing to challenge Nike\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual property.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe problem for Already is that none of these injuries suffices to support Article III standing.  Although the voluntary cessation standard requires the defendant to show that the challenged behavior cannot reasonably be expected to recur, we have never held that the doctrine\xe2\x80\x94by imposing this burden on the defendant\xe2\x80\x94allows the plaintiff to rely on theories of Article III injury that would fail to establish standing in the first place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe begin with Already\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark registration \xe2\x80\x9cgives false color to state and federal trademark claims which expose [Already\xe2\x80\x99s] business to substantial and unpredictable risks,\xe2\x80\x9d deterring investors.  Brief for Petitioner 31.  To demonstrate this, Already presented affidavits from potential investors stating that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit dissuaded them from investing in Already or prompted them to withdraw prior investments, and that they would \xe2\x80\x9cconsider\xe2\x80\x9d investing in Already only if Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark were struck down.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a.  Already argues that like the plaintiffs in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365 (1926)\n\xe2\x80\x94 who had standing to challenge an ordinance because it re- duced their property value\xe2\x80\x94Already should have standing to challenge the trademark because its mere existence hampers its ability to attract capital.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut once it is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely clear\xe2\x80\x9d that challenged conduct cannot \xe2\x80\x9creasonably be expected to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d Friends of the Earth, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 190, the fact that some individuals may base decisions on \xe2\x80\x9cconjectural or hypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d speculation does not give rise to the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cac- tual\xe2\x80\x9d injury necessary to establish Article III standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, \n560 (1992)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  In Euclid, we reasoned that, assuming the merits of plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinance, in effect, constitutes a present invasion of [plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] property rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 386.  Here there is no such present invasion; in fact there is a covenant promising no invasion.  In addition, unlike the plaintiffs in Euclid, Already does not claim that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s Air Force 1 infringes any of its property rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlready has also pointed to an affidavit from a vice president stating that Nike has \xe2\x80\x9csuggested\xe2\x80\x9d to Already\xe2\x80\x99s retailers that they refrain from carrying Already\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, lest \xe2\x80\x9cNike .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cancel its account or take other actions against the retailer, e.g., delay shipment of the retailer\xe2\x80\x99s Nike order or \xe2\x80\x98lose\xe2\x80\x99 the retailer\xe2\x80\x99s Nike order.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 177a.  Even if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will take action against the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s retailers, the covenant here extends protection to Already\xe2\x80\x99s distributors and customers.  And even if Nike were engaging in harassment or unfair trade practices, Already has not explained how invalidating Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark would do anything to stop it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlready also complains that it can no longer \xe2\x80\x9cjust blithely go about its shoe business as if there were no risk of being sued again.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 14.  As counsel told us at oral argument: \xe2\x80\x9conce bitten, twice shy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  But we have never held that a plaintiff has standing to pursue declaratory relief merely on the basis of being \xe2\x80\x9conce bitten.\xe2\x80\x9d  Quite the opposite.  See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Lyons, \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 95, \n109 (1983)\n (holding there is no justiciable controversy where plaintiff had once been subjected to a chokehold).  Given our conclusion that Nike has met its burden of demonstrating there is no reasonable risk that Already will be sued again, there is no reason for Already to be so shy.  It is the only one of Nike\xe2\x80\x99s competitors with a judicially enforceable covenant protecting it from litigation relating to the Air Force 1 trademark.  Insofar as the injury is a threat of Air Force 1 trademark litigation, Already is Nike\xe2\x80\x99s least injured competitor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlready falls back on a sweeping argument: In the context of registered trademarks, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o covenant, no matter how broad, can eradicate the effects\xe2\x80\x9d of a registered but invalid trademark.  Brief for Petitioner 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  According to Already, allowing Nike to unilaterally moot the case \xe2\x80\x9csubverts\xe2\x80\x9d the important role federal courts play in the administration of federal patent and trademark law.  Id., at 40.  It allows companies like Nike to register and brandish invalid trademarks to intimidate smaller competitors, avoiding judicial review by issuing covenants in the rare case where the little guy fights back.  Already and its amici thus contend that Already, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a company engaged in the business of designing and marketing athletic shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d has standing to challenge Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark.  See id., at 21; see also Brief for Intellectual Property Pro- fessors as Amici Curiae 3 (suggesting that standing extends to all \xe2\x80\x9cparticipants in that field\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Public Patent Foundation as Amici Curiae 12 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he public has standing to challenge the validity of any issued patent or registered trademark in court\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder this approach, Nike need not even have threatened to sue first.  Already, even with no plans to make anything resembling the Air Force 1, could sue to invalidate the trademark simply because Already and Nike both compete in the athletic footwear market.  Taken to its logical conclusion, the theory seems to be that a market participant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a competitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\xe2\x80\x94whether a trademark, the awarding of a contract, a landlord-tenant arrangement, or so on.  We have never accepted such a boundless theory of standing.  The cases Already cites for this remarkable proposition stand for no such thing.  In each of those cases, standing was based on an injury more particularized and more concrete than the mere assertion that something unlawful benefited the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s competitor.

But lowering the gates for one party lowers the gates for all.  As a result, larger companies with more resources will have standing to challenge the intellectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals\xe2\x80\x94not because they are threatened by any particular patent or trademark, but simply because they are competitors in the same market.

As noted, the District Court expressly found \xe2\x80\x9cno indication\xe2\x80\x9d that Already had any such plans, App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a, and Already never challenged this finding.

But the analysis in their opinions addressed the same questions we have addressed today under that standard.  In determining the case was moot, they relied, as we have, on the breadth of the covenant and the absence of any indication that Already would produce an infringing shoe.  The District Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether a covenant not to sue will divest the trial court of jurisdiction depends on what is covered by the covenant.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a (internal quotation marks omitted).  It read the covenant \xe2\x80\x9cbroadly,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 34a, and found \xe2\x80\x9cno indication that any of [Already\xe2\x80\x99s] forthcoming models would extend beyond this broad language,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 31a.  It even concluded that from Already\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, there was \xe2\x80\x9clittle difference\xe2\x80\x9d between invalidating the trademark and the scope of protection al- ready afforded by the covenant.  Id., at 34a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLikewise, the Court of Appeals asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the covenant covers future, as well as past, activity and products,\xe2\x80\x9d and inquired into \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of intention or lack of intention, on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction, to engage in new activity or to develop new potentially infringing products that arguably are not covered by the covenant.\xe2\x80\x9d  663 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 96.  It concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he breadth of the Covenant renders the threat of litigation remote or nonexistent\xe2\x80\x9d because it could not envision a shoe that would be within Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark yet not protected by the covenant, noting that Already \xe2\x80\x9chas not asserted any intention to market any such shoe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 97.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder such circumstances, a remand would serve no purpose.

The burden was not on Already to show that a justiciable controversy remains.  Under the voluntary cessation doctrine, Nike bears the \xe2\x80\x9cformidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\xe2\x80\x9d  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167, \n190 (2000)\n.  In the circumstances here, then, Nike must demonstrate that the covenant not to sue is of sufficient breadth and force that Already can have no reasonable anticipation of a future trademark infringement claim from Nike.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBoth the District Court and the Court of Appeals issued their rulings on the erroneous premise that it was for Already to make the relevant showing.  When a court has imposed the burden to establish a certain proposition on the wrong party, remand from a reviewing court is often appropriate to determine whether the outcome would have been different had the proper rule been applied.  Here, however, the Court concludes the case must be deemed moot in all events, based on the terms and scope of the covenant and on Already\xe2\x80\x99s seeming insistence that no matter how it might be worded, a covenant drawn by the trademark holder cannot moot the case.  Brief for Petitioner 33\xe2\x80\x9334; Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\xe2\x80\x9313.  For reasons the Court states, this goes too far.  Already appears also to dis-claim any need to determine whether there is a real like-lihood it will produce a new product that, first, is not a colorable imitation of its existing product line, and, sec-ond, might be thought to infringe Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis brief, separate concurrence is written to underscore that covenants like the one Nike filed here ought not to be taken as an automatic means for the party who first charged a competitor with trademark infringement suddenly to abandon the suit without incurring the risk of an ensuing adverse adjudication.  Courts should be well aware that charges of trademark infringement can be disruptive to the good business relations between the manufacturer alleged to have been an infringer and its dis-tributors, retailers, and investors.  The mere pendency of litigation can mean that other actors in the marketplace may be reluctant to have future dealings with the alleged infringer.  Nike appears to have been well aware of that dynamic in this case.  In referring to Already it stated at one point: \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ver the past eight months, Nike has cleared out the worst offending infringers.  Now Already remains as one of the last few companies that was identified on that top ten list of infringers.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 114a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAny demonstrated reluctance by investors, distributors, and retailers to maintain good relations with the alleged infringer might, in an appropriate case, be an indication that the market itself anticipates that a new line of products could be outside the covenant not to sue yet still within a zone of alleged infringement.  And, as noted at the outset, it is the trademark holder who has the burden to show that this is not the case.  It is not the burden of the alleged infringer to prove that the covenant not to sue is inadequate to protect its current and future products from a trademark enforcement action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn later cases careful consideration must be given to the consequences of using a covenant not to sue as the basis for a motion to dismiss as moot.  If the holder of an alleged trademark can commence suit against a competitor; in midcourse file a covenant not to sue; and then require the competitor and its business network to engage in costly, satellite proceedings to demonstrate that future production or sales might still be compromised, it would seem that the trademark holder\xe2\x80\x99s burden to show the case is moot may fall well short of being formidable.  The very suit the trademark holder initiated and later seeks to de-clare moot may still cause disruption and costs to the competition.  The formidable burden to show the case is moot ought to require the trademark holder, at the outset, to make a substantial showing that the business of the competitor and its supply network will not be disrupted or weakened by satellite litigation over mootness or by any threat latent in the terms of the covenant itself.  It would be most unfair to allow the party who commences the suit to use its delivery of a covenant not to sue as an op-portunity to force a competitor to expose its future business plans or to otherwise disadvantage the competitor and its business network, all in aid of deeming moot a suit the trademark holder itself chose to initiate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are relatively few cases that have discussed the meaning and effect of covenants not to sue in the context of ongoing litigation.  See, e.g., Revolution Eyewear, Inc. v. Aspex Eyewear, Inc., 556 F.\xc2\xa03d 1294 (CA Fed. 2009); Car-aco Pharmaceutical Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc., 527 F.\xc2\xa03d 1278 (CA Fed. 2008).  Courts should proceed with caution before ruling that they can be used to terminate litigation.  An insistence on the proper allocation of the formidable burden on the party asserting mootness is one way to ensure that covenants are not automatic mechanisms for trademark holders to use courts to intimi- date competitors without, at the same time, assuming the risk that their trademark will be found invalid and unenforceable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile there still may be some doubts that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s showing below would suffice in other circumstances, here Already\xe2\x80\x99s litigation stance does seem to have made further proceedings on the mootness issue unnecessary.  In addition, as the Court notes, in any future trademark proceeding Nike will be bound by the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 broad reading of this particular covenant, thus barring suit against Already for any shoe that is not an exact copy or counterfeit version of the Air Force 1 shoe.
