Argued October 8, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 2, 2003</p>\n<p align="left">After respondent tested positive for cocaine and admitted that his behavior violated petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s workplace conduct rules, he was forced to resign.  More than two years later, he applied to be rehired, stating on his application that petitioner had previously employed him, and attaching letters both from his pastor about his active church participation and from an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor about his regular attendance at meetings and his recovery.  The employee who reviewed and rejected respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application testified that petitioner has a policy against rehiring employees who are terminated for workplace misconduct and that she did not know that respondent was a former drug addict when she rejected his application.  Respondent filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that he had been discriminated against in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter, and respondent filed this ADA action, arguing that petitioner rejected his application because of his record of drug addition and/or because he was regarded as being a drug addict.  In response to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment motion, respondent for the first time argued in the alternative that if petitioner applied a neutral no-rehire policy in his case, it still violated the ADA because of that policy\xe2\x80\x99s disparate impact.  The District Court granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment on the disparate-treatment claim and found that the disparate-impact claim had not been timely pleaded or raised.  The Ninth Circuit agreed as to the disparate-impact claim, but held as to the disparate-treatment claim that, under the burden-shifting approach of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a>, respondent had proffered a prima facie case of discrimination, and petitioner had not met its burden to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action because its no-rehire policy, though lawful on its face, was unlawful as applied to employees who were lawfully forced to resign for illegal drug use but have since been rehabilitated.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit improperly applied a disparate-impact analysis to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment claim.  This Court has consistently distinguished between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact claims.  The former arise when an employer treats some people less favorably than others because of a protected characteristic.  Liability depends on whether the protected trait actually motivated the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action.  The latter involve facially neutral employment practices that fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.  Such practices may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s subjective discrimination.  Both claims are cognizable under the ADA, but courts must be careful to distinguish between the theories.  Here, respondent was limited to the disparate-treatment theory that petitioner refused to rehire him because it regarded him as disabled and/or because of his record of disability.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of its neutral no-rehire policy plainly satisfied its obligation under <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire respondent.  Thus, the only remaining question before the Ninth Circuit was whether there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that petitioner did make its employment decision based on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s status as disabled despite its proffered explanation.  Instead, that court concluded that, as a matter of law, the policy was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason sufficient to defeat a prima facie case of discrimination.  In doing so, the Ninth Circuit improperly focused on factors that pertain only to disparate-impact claims, and thus ignored the fact that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s no-hire policy is a quintessential legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire an employee who was terminated for violating workplace conduct rules.

We are asked to decide in this case whether the ADA confers preferential rehire rights on disabled employees lawfully terminated for violating workplace conduct rules.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s unwritten policy not to rehire employees who left the company for violating personal conduct rules contravenes the ADA, at least as applied to employees who were lawfully forced to resign for illegal drug use but have since been rehabilitated.  Because the Ninth Circuit improperly applied a disparate-impact analysis in a disparate-treatment case in order to reach this holding, we vacate its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We do not, however, reach the question on which we granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/1187/index.html">537 U. S. 1187</a> (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, Joel Hernandez, worked for Hughes Missile Systems for 25 years.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On July 11, 1991, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and behavior at work suggested that he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  Pursuant to company policy, respondent took a drug test, which came back positive for cocaine.  Respondent subsequently admitted that he had been up late drinking beer and using cocaine the night before the test.  Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s behavior violated petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s workplace conduct rules, respondent was forced to resign.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEmployee Separation Summary\xe2\x80\x9d indicated as the reason for separation: \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge for personal conduct (quit in lieu of discharge).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 12a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More than two years later, on January 24, 1994, respondent applied to be rehired by petitioner.  Respondent stated on his application that he had previously been employed by petitioner.  He also attached two reference letters to the application, one from his pastor, stating that respondent was a \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful and active member\xe2\x80\x9d of the church, and the other from an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor, stating that respondent attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly and is in recovery.  <em>Id., </em>at 13a\xe2\x80\x9315a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Joanne Bockmiller, an employee in the company\xe2\x80\x99s Labor Relations Department, reviewed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application.  Bockmiller testified in her deposition that since respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application disclosed his prior employment with the company, she pulled his personnel file and reviewed his employee separation summary.  She then rejected respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application.  Bockmiller insisted that the company had a policy against rehiring employees who were terminated for workplace misconduct.  <em>Id., </em>at 62a.  Thus, when she reviewed the employment separation summary and found that respondent had been discharged for violating workplace conduct rules, she rejected respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application.  She testified, in particular, that she did not know that respondent was a former drug addict when she made the employment decision and did not see anything that would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9crecord of\xe2\x80\x9d addiction.  <em>Id., </em>at 63a\xe2\x80\x9364a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent subsequently filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s charge of discrimination indicated that petitioner did not give him a reason for his nonselection, but that respondent believed he had been discriminated against in violation of the ADA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner responded to the charge by submitting a letter to the EEOC, in which George M. Medina, Sr., Manager of Diversity Development, wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe ADA specifically exempts from protection individuals currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when the covered entity acts on the basis of that use.  Contrary to Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s unfounded allegation, his non-selection for rehire is not based on any legitimate disability.  Rather, Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s application was rejected based on his demonstrated drug use while previously employed and the complete lack of evidence indicating successful drug rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Company maintains it\xe2\x80\x99s <em>[sic]</em> right to deny re-employment to employees terminated for violation of Company rules and regulations\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.Complainant has provided no evidence to alter the Company\xe2\x80\x99s position that Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct while employed by [petitioner] makes him ineligible for rehire.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 19a\xe2\x80\x9320a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This response, together with evidence that the letters submitted with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s employment application may have alerted Bockmiller to the reason for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prior termination, led the EEOC to conclude that petitioner may have \xe2\x80\x9crejected [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] application based on his record of past alcohol and drug use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 94a EEOC Determination Letter, Nov. 20, 1997.  The EEOC thus found that there was \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cause to believe that [respondent] was denied hire to the position of Product Test Specialist because of his disability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 95a.  The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter, and respondent subsequently filed this action alleging a violation of the ADA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent proceeded through discovery on the theory that the company rejected his application because of his record of drug addiction and/or because he was regarded as being a drug addict.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712102(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In response to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment, respondent for the first time argued in the alternative that if the company really did apply a neutral no-rehire policy in his case, petitioner still violated the ADA because such a policy has a disparate impact.  The District Court granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment with respect to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment claim.  However, the District Court refused to consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact claim because respondent had failed to plead or raise the theory in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that respondent had failed timely to raise his disparate-impact claim.  <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Hughes Missile Systems Co.</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa03d 1030, 1037, n.\xc2\xa020 (CA9 2002).  In addressing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment claim, the Court of Appeals proceeded under the familiar burden-shifting approach first adopted by this Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a> (1973).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  First, the Ninth Circuit found that with respect to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case of discrimination, there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether respondent was qualified for the position for which he sought to be rehired, and whether the reason for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to rehire him was his past record of drug addiction.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1034\xe2\x80\x931035.  The Court of Appeals thus held that with respect to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case of discrimination, respondent had proffered sufficient evidence to preclude a grant of summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1035.  Because petitioner does not challenge this aspect of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, we do not address it here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals then moved to the next step of <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, where the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action.  411 U. S., at 802.  Here, petitioner contends that Bockmiller applied the neutral policy against rehiring employees previously terminated for violating workplace conduct rules and that this neutral company policy constituted a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for its decision not to rehire respondent.  The Court of Appeals, although admitting that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s no-rehire rule was lawful on its face, held the policy to be unlawful \xe2\x80\x9cas applied to former drug addicts whose only work-related offense was testing positive because of their addiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1036.  The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application of a neutral no-rehire policy was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for rejecting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cMaintaining a blanket policy against rehire of <em>all </em>former employees who violated company policy not only screens out persons with a record of addiction who have been successfully rehabilitated, but may well result, as [petitioner] contends it did here, in the staff member who makes the employment decision remaining unaware of the \xe2\x80\x9cdisability\xe2\x80\x9d and thus of the fact that she is committing an unlawful act\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Additionally, we hold that a policy that serves to bar the reemployment of a drug addict despite his successful rehabilitation violates the ADA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1036\xe2\x80\x931037.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, while ostensibly evaluating whether petitioner had proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to rehire respondent sufficient to rebut respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie showing of disparate treatment, the Court of Appeals held that a neutral no-rehire policy could never suffice in a case where the employee was terminated for illegal drug use, because such a policy has a disparate impact on recovering drug addicts.  In so holding, the Court of Appeals erred by conflating the analytical framework for disparate-impact and disparate-treatment claims.  Had the Court of Appeals correctly applied the disparate-treatment framework, it would have been obliged to conclude that a neutral no-rehire policy is, by definition, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason under the ADA.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And thus the only remaining question would be whether respondent could produce sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s stated reason for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s rejection was in fact pretext.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 804.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has consistently recognized a distinction between claims of discrimination based on disparate treatment and claims of discrimination based on disparate impact.  The Court has said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[d]isparate treatment\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 is the most easily understood type of discrimination.  The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or [other protected characteristic].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/index.html">431 U.

By contrast, disparate-impact claims \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Teamsters</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 335\xe2\x80\x93336, n.\xc2\xa015.  Under a disparate-impact theory of discrimination, \xe2\x80\x9ca facially neutral employment practice may be deemed [illegally discriminatory] without evidence of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a \xe2\x80\x98disparate-treatment\xe2\x80\x99 case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html">490 U.

Because \xe2\x80\x9cthe factual issues, and therefore the character of the evidence presented, differ when the plaintiff claims that a facially neutral employment policy has a discriminatory impact on protected classes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs</em> v. <em>Burdine,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/248/index.html">450 U. S. 248</a>, 252, n.\xc2\xa05 (1981), courts must be careful to distinguish between these theories.  Here, respondent did not timely pursue a disparate-impact claim.  Rather, the District Court concluded, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case was limited to a disparate-treatment theory, that the company refused to rehire respondent because it regarded respondent as being disabled and/or because of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s record of a disability.  298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1037, n.\xc2\xa020.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of its neutral no-rehire policy plainly satisfied its obligation under <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire respondent.  Thus, the only relevant question before the Court of Appeals, after petitioner presented a neutral explanation for its decision not to rehire respondent, was whether there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that petitioner did make its employment decision based on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s status as disabled despite petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proffered explanation.  Instead, the Court of Appeals concluded that, as a matter of law, a neutral no-rehire policy was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason sufficient to defeat a prima facie case of discrimination.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court of Appeals did not even attempt, in the remainder of its opinion, to treat this claim as one involving only disparate treatment.  Instead, the Court of Appeals observed that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s policy \xe2\x80\x9cscreens out persons with a record of addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d and further noted that the company had not raised a business necessity defense, 298 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 1036\xe2\x80\x931037, and n.\xc2\xa019, factors that pertain to disparate-impact claims but not disparate-treatment claims.

If petitioner did indeed apply a neutral, generally applicable no-rehire policy in rejecting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to rehire respondent can, in no way, be said to have been motivated by respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire respondent because it \xe2\x80\x9cserves to bar the re-employment of a drug addict despite his successful rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  298 F.3d<em>, </em>at 1036\xe2\x80\x931037.  We hold that such an analysis is inapplicable to a disparate-treatment claim.  Once respondent had made a prima facie showing of discrimination, the next question for the Court of Appeals was whether petitioner offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions so as to demonstrate that its actions were not motivated by respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disability.

Under <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.  The burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action.  411 U. S., at 802.  If the employer meets this burden, the presumption of intentional discrimination disappears, but the plaintiff can still prove disparate treatment by, for instance, offering evidence demonstrating that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is pretextual.  See <em>Reeves</em> v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/133/index.html">530 U. S. 133</a>, 143 (2000).  The Courts of Appeals have consistently utilized this burden-shifting approach when reviewing motions for summary judgment in disparate-treatment cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Pugh </em>v.<em> Attica</em>, 259 F.\xc2\xa03d 619, 626 (CA7 2001) (applying burden-shifting approach to an ADA disparate-treatment claim).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals noted that \xe2\x80\x9cit is possible that a drug <em>user</em> may not be \xe2\x80\x98disabled\xe2\x80\x99 under the ADA if his drug use does not rise to the level of an addiction which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1033\xe2\x80\x931034, n.\xc2\xa09.  The parties do not dispute that respondent was \xe2\x80\x9cdisabled\xe2\x80\x9d at the time he quit in lieu of discharge and thus a record of the disability exists.  We therefore need not decide in this case whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s employment record constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9crecord of addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d which triggers the protections of the ADA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties are also not disputing in this Court whether respondent was qualified for the position for which he applied.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This would not, of course, resolve the dispute over whether petitioner did in fact apply such a policy in this case.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals expressed some confusion on this point, as the court first held that respondent \xe2\x80\x9craise[d] a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was denied re-employment because of his past record of drug addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1034, but then later stated that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno question that [petitioner] applied this [no-rehire] policy in rejecting [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1036, n.\xc2\xa017.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals characterized respondent\xe2\x80\x99s workplace misconduct as merely \xe2\x80\x9ctesting positive because of [his] addiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1036.  To the extent that the court suggested that, because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s workplace misconduct is related to his disability, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to rehire respondent on account of that workplace misconduct violated the ADA, we point out that we have rejected a similar argument in the context of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.  See <em>Hazen Paper</em> <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Biggins, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html"></a><a href="/us/507/604/index.html">507 U. S. 604</a>, 611 (1993).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, despite the fact that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination laws are undoubtedly aimed at \xe2\x80\x9cthe problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the Court of Appeals held that the unfortunate result of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application of its neutral policy was that Bockmiller may have made the employment decision in this case \xe2\x80\x9cremaining unaware of [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] \xe2\x80\x98disability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1036.  The Court of Appeals did not explain, however, how it could be said that Bockmiller was motivated to reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application because of his disability if Bockmiller was entirely unaware that such a disability existed.  If Bockmiller were truly unaware that such a disability existed, it would be impossible for her hiring decision to have been based, even in part, on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disability.  And, if no part of the hiring decision turned on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s status as disabled, he cannot, ipso facto, have been subject to disparate treatment.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
