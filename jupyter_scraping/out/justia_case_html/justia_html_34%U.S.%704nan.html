"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 34 U. S. 709</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STORY, after stating the facts of the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The points principally relied on at the argument are, in the first place, that the party is not liable to be arrested to answer the indictment after having given a recognizance of bail, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 34 U. S. 710</a></p><p> although the recognizance has been forfeited and the party has not appeared and answered and been tried on the indictment; in the next place, that the discharge upon the habeas corpus before Mr. Chief Justice Cranch is a bar to any subsequent arrest.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that neither of these grounds can, in point of law, be maintained.  A recognizance of bail, in a criminal case, is taken to secure the due attendance of the party accused to answer the indictment and to submit to a trial and the judgment of the court thereon.  It is not designed as a satisfaction for the offense when it is forfeited and paid, but as a means of compelling the party to submit to the trial and punishment which the law ordains for his offense.  And <em>a fortiori</em> it cannot be deemed to apply to a case like the present of a penitentiary offense, for that would be to suppose that the law allowed the party to purge away the offense and the corporeal punishment by a pecuniary compensation.  There is nothing, in our opinion, in the Maryland statute of 1780, ch. 10, to charge this construction of the law.</p>\n<p>The other ground is also unmaintainable.  A discharge of a party under a writ of habeas corpus from the process under which he is imprisoned discharges him from any further confinement under the process, but not under any other process which may be issued against him under the same indictment.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are of opinion that the party is rightfully in custody under the bench warrant of the circuit court, and therefore that the petition for the writ of habeas corpus ought to be</p>\n<p><em>Denied.</em></p>\n<p>The rule, therefore, to show cause is discharged, and the motion for the habeas corpus is overruled.</p>\n<p>* When the petition in this case was presented to the Court, a habeas corpus was asked to be issued and it was proposed to argue the question of the right of the petitioner to his discharge on the return of the habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL said:</p>\n<p>"As the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is appellate, it must first be shown that the Court has the power in this case to award a habeas corpus."</p>\n<p>"A rule was granted to show cause why a habeas corpus should not be issued."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
