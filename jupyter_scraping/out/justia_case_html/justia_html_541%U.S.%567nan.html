After the jury returned a verdict for Atlas, but before entry of judgment, petitioner moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the parties were not diverse at the time the complaint was filed.  In granting the motion, the Magistrate Judge found that, as a partnership, Atlas was a Mexican citizen because two of its partners, also respondents, were Mexican citizens at the time of filing; and that the requisite diversity was absent because petitioner was also a Mexican citizen.  On appeal, Atlas urged the Fifth Circuit to disregard the diversity failure at the time of filing because the Mexican partners had left Atlas before the trial began and, thus, diversity existed thereafter.  Relying on <em>Caterpillar Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/61/index.html">519 U. S. 61</a>, the Fifth Circuit held that the conclusiveness of citizenship at the time of filing is subject to an exception where, as here, the jurisdictional error was not identified until after the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict and the postfiling change in the partnership cured the jurisdictional defect before it was identified.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A party\xe2\x80\x99s postfiling change in citizenship cannot cure a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction that existed at the time of filing in a diversity action.  This Court has long adhered to the rule that subject-matter jurisdiction in diversity cases depends on the state of facts that existed at the time of filing.  <em>Caterpillar</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court \xe2\x80\xa6 considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming,\xe2\x80\x9d 519 U. S., at 75, did not augur a new approach to deciding whether a jurisdictional defect has been cured.  The jurisdictional defect <em>Caterpillar</em> addressed had been cured by the dismissal of the party that had destroyed diversity, a curing method that had long been an exception to the time-of-filing rule.  This Court has never approved a deviation from the longstanding rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here there is <em>no</em> change of party, a jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Conolly</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> 2 Pet. 556, 565 (emphasis added).  Dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is the only option available here.  Allowing a citizenship change in the partnership to cure the jurisdictional defect existing at the time of filing would contravene the <em>Conolly </em>principle.<em> </em>Apart from breaking with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding precedent, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cfinality, efficiency, and judicial economy\xe2\x80\x9d can justify suspension of the time-of-filing rule would create an exception of indeterminate scope that is bound to produce costly collateral litigation.

See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Atlas Global Group, L.\xc2\xa0P., is a limited partnership created under Texas law.  In November 1997, Atlas filed a state-law suit against petitioner Grupo Dataflux, a Mexican corporation, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The complaint contained claims for breach of contract and <em>in quantum meruit</em>, seeking over $1.3 million in damages.  It alleged that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal jurisdiction is proper based upon diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(a), as this suit is between a Texas citizen [Atlas] and a citizen or subject of Mexico [Grupo Dataflux].\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. 19a (Complaint \xc2\xa73).  Pretrial motions and discovery consumed almost three years.  In October 2000, the parties consented to a jury trial presided over by a Magistrate Judge.  On October 27, after a 6-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Atlas awarding $750,000 in damages.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 18, before entry of the judgment, Dataflux filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the parties were not diverse at the time the complaint was filed.  See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1), (h)(3).  The Magistrate Judge granted the motion.  The dismissal was based upon the accepted rule that, as a partnership, Atlas is a citizen of each state or foreign country of which any of its partners is a citizen.  See <em>Carden</em> v. <em>Arkoma Associates</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/185/index.html">494 U. S. 185</a>, 192\xe2\x80\x93195 (1990).  Because Atlas had two partners who were Mexican citizens at the time of filing, the partnership was a Mexican citizen.  (It was also a citizen of Delaware and Texas based on the citizenship of its other partners.)  And because the defendant, Dataflux, was a Mexican corporation, aliens were on both sides of the case, and the requisite diversity was therefore absent.  See <em>Mossman</em> v. <em>Higginson,</em> 4 Dall. 12, 14 (1800).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Atlas did not dispute the finding of no diversity at the time of filing.  It urged the Court of Appeals to disregard this failure and reverse dismissal because the Mexican partners had left the partnership in a transaction consummated the month before trial began.  Atlas argued that, since diversity existed when the jury rendered its verdict, dismissal was inappropriate.  The Fifth Circuit agreed.  312 F.\xc2\xa03d 168, 174 (2002).  It acknowledged the general rule that, for purposes of determining the existence of diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of the parties is to be determined with reference to the facts as they existed at the time of filing.  <em>Id.</em>, at 170.  However, relying on our decision in <em>Caterpillar Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/61/index.html"></a><a href="/us/519/61/index.html">519 U. S. 61</a> (1996), it held that the conclusiveness of citizenship at the time of filing was subject to exception when the following conditions are satisfied:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) [A]n action is filed or removed when constitutional and/or statutory jurisdictional requirements are not met, (2) neither the parties nor the judge raise the error until after a jury verdict has been rendered, or a dispositive ruling has been made by the court, and (3) before the verdict is rendered, or ruling is issued, the jurisdictional defect is cured.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 174.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe opinion strictly limited the exception as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIf at any point prior to the verdict or ruling, the issue is raised, the court must apply the general rule and dismiss regardless of subsequent changes in citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jurisdictional error in the present case not having been identified until after the jury returned its verdict; and the postfiling change in the composition of the partnership having (in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view) cured the jurisdictional defect; the Court reversed and remanded with instructions to the District Court to enter judgment in favor of Atlas.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari.  540 U. S. ___ (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It has long been the case that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mollan</em> v. <em>Torrance</em>, 9 Wheat. 537, 539 (1824).  This time-of-filing rule is hornbook law (quite literally[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]) taught to first-year law students in any basic course on federal civil procedure.  It measures all challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction premised upon diversity of citizenship against the state of facts that existed at the time of filing\xe2\x80\x94whether the challenge be brought shortly after filing, after the trial, or even for the first time on appeal.  (Challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can of course be raised at any time prior to final judgment.  See <em>Capron</em> v. <em>Van Noorden,</em> 2 Cranch 126 (1804).)</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have adhered to the time-of-filing rule regardless of the costs it imposes.  For example, in <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Watt,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/138/694/index.html">138 U. S. 694</a> (1891), two executors of an estate, claiming to be New York citizens, had brought a diversity-based suit in federal court against defendants alleged to be Florida citizens.  When it later developed that two of the defendants were New York citizens, the plaintiffs sought to save jurisdiction by revoking the letters testamentary for one executor and alleging that the remaining executor was in fact a British citizen.  The Court rejected this attempted postfiling salvage operation, because at the time of filing the executors included a New Yorker.  <em>Id.</em>, at 708.  It dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction, even though the case had been filed about 5<font super="1">1/<font super="-1">2 years earlier, the trial court had entered a decree ordering land to be sold 4 years earlier, the sale had been made, exceptions had been filed and overruled, and the case had come to the Court on appeal from the order confirming the land sale.  <em>Id.</em>, at 698.  Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Fuller adhered to the principle set forth in <em>Conolly</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> 2 Pet. 556, 565 (1829), that \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[J]urisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9ccould no more be given \xe2\x80\xa6 by the amendment than if a citizen of Florida had sued another in that court and subsequently sought to give it jurisdiction by removing from the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  138 U. S.em&gt;., at 708.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is uncontested that application of the time-of-filing rule to this case would require dismissal, but Atlas contends that this Court \xe2\x80\x9cshould accept the very limited exception created by the Fifth Circuit to the time-of-filing principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 2.  The Fifth Circuit and Atlas rely on our statement in <em>Caterpillar, supra,</em> at 75, that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court \xe2\x80\xa6 considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming.\xe2\x80\x9d  This statement unquestionably provided the <em>ratio decidendi</em> in <em>Caterpillar</em>, but it did not augur a new approach to deciding whether a jurisdictional defect has been cured.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Caterpillar</em> broke no new ground, because the jurisdictional defect it addressed had been cured by the dismissal of the party that had destroyed diversity.  That method of curing a jurisdictional defect had long been an exception to the time-of-filing rule.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he question always is, or should be, when objection is taken to the jurisdiction of the court by reason of the citizenship of some of the parties, whether \xe2\x80\xa6 they are indispensable parties, for if their interests are severable and a decree without prejudice to their rights may be made, the jurisdiction of the court should be retained and the suit dismissed as to them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Horn</em> v. <em>Lockhart,</em> 17 Wall. 570, 579 (1873).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]arties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\xe2\x80\x9d  By now, \xe2\x80\x9cit is well settled that Rule 21 invests district courts with authority to allow a dispensable nondiverse party to be dropped at any time, even after judgment has been rendered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newman-Green, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alfonzo-Larrain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/826/index.html">490 U. S. 826</a>, 832 (1989).  Indeed, the Court held in <em>Newman-Green</em> that courts of appeals also have the authority to cure a jurisdictional defect by dismissing a dispensable nondiverse party.  <em>Id.</em>, at 837.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Caterpillar</em> involved an unremarkable application of this established exception.  Complete diversity had been lacking at the time of removal to federal court, because one of the plaintiffs shared Kentucky citizenship with one of the defendants.  Almost three years after the District Court denied a motion to remand, but before trial, the diversity-destroying defendant settled out of the case and was dismissed.  The case proceeded to a 6-day jury trial, resulting in judgment for the defendant, Caterpillar, against Lewis.  This Court unanimously held that the lack of complete diversity at the time of removal did not require dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sum of <em>Caterpillar</em>\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional analysis was an approving acknowledgment of Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s admission that there was \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete diversity, and therefore federal subject-matter jurisdiction, at the time of trial and judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 U. S., at 73.  The failure to explain <em>why</em> this solved the problem was not an oversight, because there was nothing novel to explain.  The postsettlement dismissal of the diversity-destroying defendant cured the jurisdictional defect just as the dismissal of the diversity-destroying party had done in <em>Newman-Green</em>.  In both cases, the less-than-complete diversity which had subsisted throughout the action had been converted to complete diversity between the remaining parties to the final judgment.  See also <em>Horn</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 579.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While recognizing that <em>Caterpillar</em> is \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically\xe2\x80\x9d distinguishable because the defect was cured by the dismissal of a diversity-destroying party, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthis factor was not at the heart of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 172\xe2\x80\x93173.  The crux of the analysis, according to the Fifth Circuit, was <em>Caterpillar</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court \xe2\x80\xa6 considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 U. S., at 75.  This was indeed the crux of analysis in <em>Caterpillar</em>, but analysis of a different issue.  It related not to cure of the <em>jurisdictional</em> defect, but to cure of a <em>statutory</em> defect, namely failure to comply with the requirement of the removal statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441(a), that there be complete diversity at the time of removal.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The argument to which the statement was directed took as its <em>starting point </em>that subject-matter jurisdiction had been satisfied: \xe2\x80\x9cultimate satisfaction of the subject-matter jurisdiction requirement ought not swallow up antecedent <em>statutory</em> violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 U. S., at 74 (emphasis added).  The resulting holding of <em>Caterpillar</em>, therefore, is only that a statutory defect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCaterpillar\xe2\x80\x99s failure to meet the \xc2\xa71441(a) requirement that the case be fit for federal adjudication at the time the removal petition is filed\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 73\xe2\x80\x94did not require dismissal once there was no longer any jurisdictional defect.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To our knowledge, the Court has never approved a deviation from the rule articulated by Chief Justice Marshall in 1829 that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here there is <em>no</em> change of party, a jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Conolly</em>, 2 Pet., at 556 (emphasis added).  Unless the Court is to manufacture a brand-new exception to the time-of-filing rule, dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is the only option available in this case.  The purported cure arose not from a change in the parties to the action, but from a change in the citizenship of a continuing party.  Withdrawal of the Mexican partners from Atlas did not change the fact that Atlas, the single artificial entity created under Texas law, remained a party to the action.  True, the composition of the partnership, and consequently its citizenship, changed.  But allowing a citizenship change to cure the jurisdictional defect that existed at the time of filing would contravene the principle articulated by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Conolly</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We decline to do today what the Court has refused to do for the past 175 years.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from breaking with our longstanding precedent, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cfinality, efficiency, and judicial economy\xe2\x80\x9d can justify suspension of the time-of-filing rule would create an exception of indeterminate scope.  The Court of Appeals sought to cabin the exception with the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f at any point prior to the verdict or ruling, the [absence of diversity at the time of filing] is raised, the court must apply the general rule and dismiss regardless of subsequent changes in citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 174.  This limitation is unsound in principle and certain to be ignored in practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is unsound in principle because there is no basis in reason or logic to dismiss preverdict if in fact the change in citizenship has eliminated the jurisdictional defect.  Either the court has jurisdiction at the time the defect is identified (because the parties are diverse at that time) or it does not (because the postfiling citizenship change is irrelevant).  If the former, then dismissal is inappropriate; if the latter, then retention of jurisdiction postverdict is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only two escapes from this dilemma come to mind, neither of which is satisfactory.  First, one might say that it is not <em>any</em> change in party citizenship that cures the jurisdictional defect, but only a change that remains unnoticed until the end of trial.  That is not so much a logical explanation as a restatement of the illogic that produces the dilemma.  There is no conceivable reason why the jurisdictional deficiency which continues despite the citizenship change should suddenly disappear upon the rendering of a verdict.  Second, one might say that there never was a cure, but that the party who failed to object before the end of trial forfeited his objection.  This is logical enough, but comes up against the established principle, reaffirmed earlier this Term, that \xe2\x80\x9ca court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties\xe2\x80\x99 litigation conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, 540 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 11).  \xe2\x80\x9cA litigant generally may raise a court\xe2\x80\x99s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action, even initially at the highest appellate instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Because the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s attempted limitation upon its new exception makes a casualty either of logic or of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence, there is no principled way to defend it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And principled or not, the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s artificial limitation is sure to be discarded in practice.  Only 8% of diversity cases concluded in 2003 actually went to trial, and the median time from filing to trial disposition was nearly two years.  See Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Statistics on Diversity Filings and Terminations in District Courts for Calendar Year 2003 (on file with the Clerk of Court).  In such a litigation environment, an approach to jurisdiction that focuses on efficiency and judicial economy cannot possibly be held to the line drawn by the Court of Appeals.  As Judge Garza observed in his dissent:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no difference in efficiency terms between the jury verdict and, for example, the moment at which the jury retires.  Nor, for that matter, is there a large difference between the verdict and mid-way through the trial. \xe2\x80\xa6 Indeed, in complicated cases requiring a great deal of discovery, the parties and the court often expend tremendous resources long before the case goes to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 177.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissenting opinion rests on two principal propositions: (1) the jurisdictional defect in this case was cured by a change in the composition of the partnership; and (2) refusing to recognize an exception to the time-of-filing rule in this case wastes judicial resources, while creating an exception does not.  We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the dissent, our opinion does not turn on whether the jurisdictional defect here contained at least \xe2\x80\x9cminimal diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Regardless of how one characterizes the acknowledged jurisdictional defect, it was never cured.  The only two ways in which one could conclude that it had been cured would be either (1) to acknowledge that a party\xe2\x80\x99s postfiling change of citizenship <em>can</em> cure a time-of-filing jurisdictional defect, or (2) to treat a change in the composition of a partnership like a change in the parties to the action.  The Court has never, to our knowledge, done the former; and not even the dissent suggests that it ought to do so in this case.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The dissent diverges from our analysis by adopting the latter approach, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthis case seems \xe2\x80\xa6 indistinguishable from one in which there is a change in the parties to the action.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Post</em>, at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This equation of a dropped partner with a dropped party is flatly inconsistent with <em>Carden</em>.  The dissent in <em>Carden</em> sought to apply a \xe2\x80\x9creal party to the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d approach to determine which partners counted for purposes of jurisdictional analysis.  The <em>Carden</em> majority rejected that approach, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question presented today is not which of various parties before the Court should be considered for purposes of determining whether there is complete diversity of citizenship . . . .  There are <em>not</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 multiple respondents before the Court, but only <em>one:</em> the artificial entity called Arkoma Associates, a limited partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 188, n.\xc2\xa01.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent counters that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile a partnership may be characterized as a single artificial entity, a district court determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists looks to the citizenship of the several persons composing [the entity].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa08 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  It is true that the court \xe2\x80\x9clooks to\xe2\x80\x9d the citizenship of the several persons composing the entity, but it does so for the purpose of determining the citizenship of the entity that is a party, not to determine which citizens who compose the entity are to be treated as parties.  See <em>Carden</em>, 494 U. S., at 188, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hat we must decide is the . . . question of how the citizenship of that single artificial entity is to be determined\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 195 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e reject the contention that to determine, for diversity purposes, the citizenship of an artificial entity, the court may consult the citizenship of less than all of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s members\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was from the beginning of this action a single plaintiff (Atlas), which, under <em>Carden</em>, was not diverse from the sole defendant (Dataflux).  Thus, this case fails to present \xe2\x80\x9ctwo adverse parties [who] are not co-citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Tashire,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/523/index.html"></a><a href="/us/386/523/index.html">386 U. S. 523</a>, 531 (1967).  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, then, this is not a case like <em>Caterpillar</em> or <em>Newman-Green</em> in which \xe2\x80\x9cparty line-up changes . . . simply trimmed the litigation down to an ever present core that met the statutory requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 10.  Rather, this is a case in which a single party changed its citizenship by changing its internal composition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The incompatibility with prior law of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to treat a change in partners like a change in parties is revealed by a curious anomaly: It would produce a case unlike every other case in which dropping a party has cured a jurisdictional defect, in that no judicial action (such as granting a motion to dismiss) was necessary to get the jurisdictional spoilers out of the case.  Indeed, judicial action to that end was not even <em>possible: </em>The court could hardly have \xe2\x80\x9cdismissed\xe2\x80\x9d the partners from the partnership to save jurisdiction.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now turn from consideration of the conceptual difficulties with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s disposition to consideration of its practical consequences.  The time-of-filing rule is what it is precisely because the facts determining jurisdiction are subject to change, and because constant litigation in response to that change would be wasteful.  The dissent would have it that the time-of-filing rule applies to establish that a court has jurisdiction (and to protect that jurisdiction from later destruction), but does <em>not </em>apply to establish that a court lacks jurisdiction (and to prevent post-filing changes that perfect jurisdiction).  <em>Post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But whether destruction or perfection of jurisdiction is at issue, the policy goal of minimizing litigation over jurisdiction is thwarted whenever a new exception to the time-of-filing rule is announced, arousing hopes of further new exceptions in the future.  Cf. <em>Dretke</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, 541 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at\xc2\xa08) (recognizing that the creation of exceptions to judge-made procedural rules will enmesh the federal courts in litigation testing the boundaries of each new exception).  That litigation-fostering effect would be particularly strong for a new exception derived from such an expandable concept as the \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency\xe2\x80\x9d rationale relied upon by the dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent argues that it is essential to uphold jurisdiction in this and similar cases because dismissal followed by refiling condemns the parties to \xe2\x80\x9can almost certain replay of the case, with, in all likelihood, the same ultimate outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 14.  But if the parties expect \xe2\x80\x9cthe same ultimate outcome,\xe2\x80\x9d they will not waste time and resources slogging through a new trial.  They will settle, with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s prior verdict supplying a range for the award.  Indeed, settlement instead of retrial will probably occur even if the parties do <em>not</em> expect the same ultimate outcome.  When the stakes remain the same and the players have been shown each other\xe2\x80\x99s cards, they will not likely play the hand all the way through just for the sake of the game.  And finally, even if the parties run the case through complete \xe2\x80\x9crelitigation in the very same District Court in which it was first filed in 1997,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 18, the \xe2\x80\x9cwaste\xe2\x80\x9d will not be great.  Having been through three years of discovery and pretrial motions in the current case, the parties would most likely proceed promptly to trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looked at in its overall effect, and not merely in its application to the sunk costs of the present case, it is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule that is wasteful.  Absent uncertainty about jurisdiction (which the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to change settled law would preserve for the future), the obvious course, for a litigant whose suit was dismissed as Atlas\xe2\x80\x99s was, would have been immediately to file a new action.  That is in fact what Atlas did, though it later dismissed the new case without prejudice.  Had that second suit been pursued instead of this one, there is little doubt that the dispute would have been resolved on the merits by now.  Putting aside the time that has passed between the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision and today, there were two years of wasted time between dismissal of the action and the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reversal of that dismissal\xe2\x80\x94time that the parties could have spent litigating the merits (or engaging in serious settlement talks) instead of litigating jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Atlas and Dataflux have thus far litigated this case for more than 6<font super="1">1/<font super="-1">2 years, including 3<font super="1">1/<font super="-1">2 years over a conceded jurisdictional defect.  Compared with the <em>one month</em> it took the Magistrate Judge to apply the time-of-filing rule and <em>Carden</em> when the jurisdictional problem was brought\nto her attention, this waste counsels strongly against\nany course that would impair the certainty of our jurisdictional rules and thereby encourage similar jurisdictional litigation.</font></font></font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decline to endorse a new exception to a time-of-filing rule that has a pedigree of almost two centuries.

It is possible, though far from clear, that one can have opposing parties in a two-party case who are cocitizens, and yet have minimal Article III jurisdiction because of the multiple citizenship of one of the parties.

We do not understand the inquiry into minimal diversity to proceed by hypothetically rewriting, to whatever the Constitution might allow that would support Article III jurisdiction in the particular case, all laws bearing upon the diversity question.  Whether the Constitution requires it or not, <em>Carden</em> <em>is</em> the subconstitutional rule by which we determine the citizenship of a partnership\xe2\x80\x94and in this case it leads to the conclusion that there were <em>no</em> opposing parties who were not cocitizens.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent appears to leave open the possibility that this line could be crossed in a future case, contrasting <em>Caterpillar Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/61/index.html"></a><a href="/us/519/61/index.html">519 U.

In <em>Caterpillar</em>, plaintiff Lewis, a Kentucky citizen, filed a civil action in state court against two corporate defendants\xe2\x80\x94Caterpillar Inc., a citizen of both Delaware and Illinois, and Whayne Supply Company, a Kentucky citizen.  519 U. S., at 64\xe2\x80\x9365.  Several months later, Liberty Mutual, a Massachusetts corporation, intervened as a plaintiff, asserting claims against both defendants.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65.  After Lewis settled with Whayne Supply, Caterpillar filed a notice of removal.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Lewis moved to remand the case to the state court on the ground that Liberty Mutual had not settled its claim against Whayne Supply, and that Whayne Supply\xe2\x80\x99s continuing presence as a defendant in the lawsuit defeated complete diversity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65\xe2\x80\x9366.  The District Court denied Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 motion to remand.  <em>Id.</em>, at 66.  Liberty Mutual and Whayne Supply subsequently settled, and the District Court dismissed Whayne Supply from the suit.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case proceeded to a jury trial, which yielded a verdict and corresponding judgment for Caterpillar.  <em>Id.</em>, at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Lewis prevailed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 67.  Observing that, at the time of removal, diversity was incomplete, the appellate court accepted Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 argument that dismissal of the case for want of subject-matter jurisdiction was obligatory.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In turn, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] district court\xe2\x80\x99s error in failing to remand a case improperly removed,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court held unanimously, \xe2\x80\x9cis not fatal to the ensuing adjudication if federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the time judgment is entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 64.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Newman-Green</em> concerned a state-law action filed in Federal District Court by an Illinois corporation against a Venezuelan corporation, four Venezuelan citizens, and a United States citizen domiciled in Venezuela.  490 U. S., at 828.  After the District Court granted partial summary judgment for the defendants, the plaintiff appealed.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>SU. S.onte</em>, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit inquired into the basis for federal jurisdiction over the case, and concluded that the presence of the Venezuela-domiciled United States citizen spoiled complete diversity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 828\xe2\x80\x93829.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  To cure the defect, the three-judge panel granted the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s motion to drop the nondiverse party, citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21.  <em>Newman-Green</em>, 490 U. S., at 829.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  But the full Circuit Court, empaneled en banc, concluded that an appellate court lacks such authority.  <em>Id.</em>, at 830\xe2\x80\x93831.  This Court reversed that determination.  Federal appellate courts, the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cposses[s] the authority to grant motions to dismiss dispensable nondiverse parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 836.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em>, minimal diversity within Article III\xe2\x80\x99s compass existed in this case from the start.  See U. S. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases \xe2\x80\xa6 between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.,</em> 386 U. S., at 531 (\xe2\x80\x9cArticle III poses no obstacle to the legislative extension of federal jurisdiction, founded on diversity, so long as any two adverse parties are not co-citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The jurisdictional flaw\xe2\x80\x94in <em>Caterpillar</em>, <em>Newman-Green</em>, and this case\xe2\x80\x94was the absence of complete diversity, required by the governing statute, \xc2\xa71332(a), when the action commenced, a flaw eliminated at a later stage of the proceedings.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (describing <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em> as cases in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe less-than-complete diversity which had subsisted throughout the action had been converted to complete diversity between the remaining parties to the final judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears clarification why this case, in common with <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em>, met the constitutional requirement of minimal diversity at the onset of the litigation.  True, Atlas\xe2\x80\x99 case involves a partnership, while the diversity spoiler in <em>Caterpillar</em> was a corporation and in <em>Newman-Green</em>, an individual.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  In <em>Carden</em> v. <em>Arkoma Associates</em>, this Court held that, in determining a partnership\xe2\x80\x99s qualification to sue or be sued under \xc2\xa71332, the citizenship of each partner, whether general or limited, must be attributed to the partnership.  See 494 U. S., at 195\xe2\x80\x93196.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, however, the Court did not suggest in <em>Carden</em> that minimal diversity, which is adequate for Article III purposes, would be absent when some, but not all, partners composing the \xe2\x80\x9csingle artificial entity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 188, n.\xc2\xa01, share the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship.  To the contrary, the Court emphasized in <em>Carden </em>that Congress could, \xe2\x80\x9cby legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d determine which of the \xe2\x80\x9cwide assortment of artificial entities possessing different powers and characteristics \xe2\x80\xa6 is entitled to be considered a \xe2\x80\x98citizen\xe2\x80\x99 for diversity purposes, and which of their members\xe2\x80\x99 citizenship is to be consulted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 197.  Congress would be disarmed from making such determinations\xe2\x80\x94for example, from legislating that only the citizenship of general partners counts for \xc2\xa71332 purposes\xe2\x80\x94if Article III itself commanded that each partner\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship, limited and general partner\xe2\x80\x99s alike, inescapably adheres to the partnership entity.  See <em>ibid.;</em> cf. <em>Steelworkers</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0H. Bouligny, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/index.html">382 U. S. 145</a>, 153 (1965) (assimilating unincorporated labor unions to the status of corporations for diversity purposes, instead of counting each member\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship, is a matter \xe2\x80\x9csuited to the legislative and not the judicial branch\xe2\x80\x9d).  Just as Article III did not dictate the <em>Carden</em> decision, so the question here is plainly subconstitutional in character.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Dataflux maintains, and the Court agrees, see <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, that this case is not properly bracketed with <em>Caterpillar</em>, where the subtraction of a party yielded complete diversity; instead, according to Dataflux, this case should be aligned with those in which an individual plaintiff initially shared citizenship with a defendant, and then, post-commencement of the litigation, moved to another State.  See Brief for Petitioner 12\xe2\x80\x9314, and n.\xc2\xa09, 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  In my view, this case ranks with <em>Caterpillar</em> and is not equivalent to the case of a plaintiff who moves to another State to create diversity not even minimally present when the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It has long been clear that \xe2\x80\x9cif a citizen sue[d] a citizen of the same state, he [could not] give jurisdiction by removing himself, and becoming a citizen of a different state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Conolly</em>, 2 Pet., at 565.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  When that sole plaintiff files suit in federal court, there is no semblance of Article III diversity; his move to another State manufactures diversity of citizenship that did not exist even minimally at the outset.  <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em>, by contrast, involved parties who were minimally, but not completely, diverse at the time federal-court proceedings began.  <em>Caterpillar</em>, 519 U. S., at 64\xe2\x80\x9365; <em>Newman-Green</em>, 490 U. S., at 828; <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  The post-commencement party line-up changes in <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em> simply trimmed the litigation down to an ever present core that met the statutory requirement.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same holds true for Atlas.  No partner moved.  Instead, those that spoiled statutory diversity dropped out of the case as did the nondiverse parties in <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  In essence, then, this case seems to me indistinguishable from one in which there is \xe2\x80\x9ca change in the parties to the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  As the Court correctly states, the crux of our disagreement lies in whether to \xe2\x80\x9ctreat a change in the composition of a partnership like a change in the parties to the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In common with Dataflux, the Court draws no distinction between an individual plaintiff who changes her citizenship and an enterprise composed of diverse persons, like Atlas, from which one or more original members exit.  See <em>ante,</em> at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe purported cure [in this case] arose not from a change in the parties to the action, but from a change in the citizenship of a continuing party.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Resisting that far-from-inevitable alignment, I would bracket the multimember enterprise with partially changed membership together with multiparty litigation from which some of the originally joined parties drop.  I would do so on the ground that in procedural rulings generally, even on questions of a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority in particular, salvage operations are ordinarily preferable to the wrecking ball.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Dataflux sees <em>Caterpillar</em> as a ruling limited to removal cases, and <em>Newman-Green</em> as limited to court-ordered dismissals of nondiverse parties.  See 312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 173\xe2\x80\x93174; Brief for Petitioner 23, 26\xe2\x80\x9327; Reply Brief for Petitioner 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  True, the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention may be attracted to the jurisdictional question by a motion to remand a removed case or a motion to drop a party.  But, as the Fifth Circuit observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle of these cases is [not] limited to only the exact same procedural scenarios.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 173.  It would be odd, indeed, to hold, as Dataflux\xe2\x80\x99s argument suggests, that jurisdictional flaws fatal to original jurisdiction are nonetheless tolerable when removal jurisdiction is exercised.  Removal jurisdiction, after all, is totally dependent on satisfaction of the requirements for original jurisdiction.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cany civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to [a] district court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  The \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations of finality, efficiency, and economy\xe2\x80\x9d central to the <em>Caterpillar</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of a failure to satisfy \xe2\x80\x9cthe [complete diversity] requirement of the removal statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441(a),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted), have equal force in appraising the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>statutory</em> defect\xe2\x80\x9d here, <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis in original), <em>i.e.</em>, Atlas\xe2\x80\x99 failure initially to satisfy the complete-diversity requirement of \xc2\xa71332(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, by whatever route a case arrives in federal court, it is the obligation of both district court and counsel to be alert to jurisdictional requirements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bender</em> v. <em>Williamsport Area School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/index.html">475 U. S. 534</a>, 541 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cevery federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Maurer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/237/index.html">293 U.

But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 13 (time-of-filing rule should be rigidly applied when \xe2\x80\x9cno judicial action \xe2\x80\xa6 was necessary to get the jurisdictional spoilers out of the case\xe2\x80\x9d).  That obligation is equally applicable to cases initially filed in federal court and cases removed from state court to federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the Fifth Circuit correctly comprehended the essential teaching of <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green:</em> The generally applicable time-of-filing rule is displaced when (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional requiremen[t] [is] not met, (2) neither the parties nor the judge raise the error until after a jury verdict has been rendered, or a dispositive ruling [typically, a grant of summary judgment] has been made by the court, and (3) before the verdict is rendered, or [the dispositive] ruling is issued, the jurisdictional defect is cured.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 174.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations of finality, efficiency, and economy\xe2\x80\x9d the Court found \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em> have undiluted application here.  <em>Caterpillar</em>, 519 U.

In <em>Newman-Green</em>, this Court observed that rigid insistence on the time-of-filing rule, rather than allowing elimination of the jurisdictional defect by dropping a dispensable party, would mean an almost certain replay of the case, with, in all likelihood, the same ultimate outcome.  490 U. S., at 837.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Similarly here, given the October 2000 jury verdict of $750,000 and the unquestioned current existence of complete diversity, Atlas can be expected \xe2\x80\x9csimply [to] refile in the District Court\xe2\x80\x9d and rerun the proceedings.  See <em>ibid.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</em>  No legislative prescription, nothing other than this Court\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to cut loose a court-made rule from common sense, accounts for waste of this large order.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court hypothesizes that Atlas and Dataflux will now settle to avoid fresh litigation costs.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s forecast, however, ignores the procedural history of this case.  Knowing full well the first jury verdict, the parties on two occasions missed clear opportunities to settle: after the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal and after the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reversal.  Instead, the parties \xe2\x80\x9cwaste[d] time and resources,\xe2\x80\x9d including 3<font super="1">1/<font super="-1">2 years on a jurisdictional question.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Even with the jurisdictional question resolved in its favor, Dataflux would now weigh against settlement the possibility that a new panel of jurors, and tactical knowledge gleaned from the first trial, could yield a different outcome the second time around.  Atlas, too, might decline to settle: It prevailed once in a jury trial, and committed 6<font super="1">1/<font super="-1">2 years to litigation, see <em>ante</em>, at 16, a cost that is rational to ignore, but, in practice, hard to sideline.  In short, settlement, which depends on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 shared estimate of likely litigation outcomes, is hardly guaranteed.</font></font></font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In two respects, there is stronger cause for departure from the time-of-filing rule in Atlas\xe2\x80\x99 case than there was in <em>Caterpillar</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (discussing <em>Caterpillar</em>).  First, the <em>Caterpillar</em> plaintiff, judgment loser in the federal trial court, had timely but fruitlessly objected to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s improper removal.  519 U. S., at 74.  The plaintiff in <em>Caterpillar</em>, this Court acknowledged, had done \xe2\x80\x9call that was required to preserve his objection to removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Though mindful of the \xe2\x80\x9cantecedent statutory violatio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d the Court declined to disturb the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s final judgment on the merits.  <em>Id.</em>, at 74\xe2\x80\x9375.  The defendant in this case, Dataflux, in seeking to erase the trial and verdict here, resembles the plaintiff in <em>Caterpillar</em>, except that Dataflux raised its subject-matter jurisdiction objection only <em>after</em> the parties had become completely diverse.  Cf. 312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 170.  It is one thing to preserve jurisdictional objections so long as the jurisdictional flaw persists, see <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 11); <em>Capron</em> v. <em>Van Noorden,</em> 2 Cranch 126 (1804)), quite another to tolerate such an objection after the initial flaw has disappeared from the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court sustains these outcomes: The <em>Caterpillar</em> plaintiff, whose prompt resistance to removal would generally have garnered a remand to the state forum plaintiff had originally selected, is nevertheless bound to an adverse federal-court judgment; the defendant, Dataflux here, after incorrectly conceding federal subject-matter jurisdiction in its answer, see App. 35a, and leaving the record uncorrected until the jury favored the plaintiff, is allowed to return to square one, unburdened by the adverse judgment.  There is no little irony in that juxtaposition, all the more so given the absence of any charge of manipulation in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor would affirmance of the Fifth Circuit judgment entail a significant risk of manipulation in other cases.  Rarely, if ever, will a plaintiff bring suit in federal district court, invoking diversity jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71332(a), with the knowledge that complete diversity does not exist, but in the hope of a post-filing jurisdiction-perfecting event.  Such a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s anticipation is likely to be thwarted by the court\xe2\x80\x99s or the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s swift detection of the jurisdictional impediment.  Furthermore, a plaintiff who ignores threshold jurisdictional requirements risks sanctions and \xe2\x80\x9cthe displeasure of a district court whose authority has been improperly invoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Caterpillar</em>, 519 U. S., at 77\xe2\x80\x9378.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s fears about the \xe2\x80\x9clitigation-fostering effect\xe2\x80\x9d of exceptions to the time-of-filing rule, <em>ante</em>, at 14, thus appear more imaginary than real.  No wave of new jurisdictional litigation is likely, as the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 experience after <em>Caterpillar</em> and <em>Newman-Green</em> shows.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Also distinguishing the two cases, in <em>Caterpillar</em>, the removing defendant \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied with only a day to spare the statutory requirement that a diversity-based removal take place within one year of a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x99s commencement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 65 (citing 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71446(b)).  Had that defendant remained in state court pending the settlement that left only completely diverse parties in the litigation, the one-year limitation on removal would have barred the way to federal court.  Nothing in the record or briefing here, however, suggests that Atlas filed precipitously in federal court in the hope of outpacing a fast-running limitations period; on the contrary, Atlas\xe2\x80\x99 complaint rested on events that occurred only ten months prior to the commencement of the action, see App. 18a, 22a\xe2\x80\x9323a, and therefore fell comfortably within any applicable time bar.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  This case thus presents no risk that refusal to treat an initial jurisdictional flaw as determinative will <em>de facto </em>extend a limitations period.  Cf. 13B Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73608, p.\xc2\xa0459.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment effectively returns this case for relitigation in the very same District Court in which it was first filed in 1997.  Having lost once, Dataflux now gets an unmerited second chance, never mind \xe2\x80\x9cjust how much time will be lost along the way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newman-Green</em>, 490 U.

Nothing is gained by burdening our district courts with the task of replaying diversity actions of this kind once they have been fully and fairly tried.  Neither the Constitution nor federal statute demands a time-of-filing rule as rigid as the one the Court today installs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court invokes \xe2\x80\x9c175 years\xe2\x80\x9d of precedent, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, endorsing a time-of-filing rule that, generally, is altogether sound.  On that point, the Court is united.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  For the class of cases over which we divide\xe2\x80\x94cases involving a post-filing change in the composition of a multimember association such as a partnership\xe2\x80\x94\nthe Court presents no authority impelling the waste today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment approves.  Even if precedent could provide a basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, rules fashioned by this Court for \xe2\x80\x9cthe just, speedy, and inexpensive determination [of cases],\xe2\x80\x9d Fed.

Brief for Petitioner 3; App. 98a.  At least arguably, the general partner Bahia Management, like the two limited partners of Mexican citizenship, initially spoiled diversity.  Although the Court has never ruled on the issue, Courts of Appeals have held the citizenship of each member of an LLC counts for diversity purposes.

Declining to apply the time-of-filing rule only in those cases, the Court suggests, can be justified only on the theory that \xe2\x80\x9cthe party who failed to object before the end of trial [or dispositive court ruling] forfeited his objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U.

The time-of-filing rule, however, is a court-created rule, see <em>supra</em>, at 2; it is therefore incumbent on the Court to define the contours of that rule\xe2\x80\x99s application.  The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision rested not on a forfeiture theory; rather, the decision accurately reflected the judicial economy underpinnings of the time-of-filing rule.  True, as the Court observes, judicial economy concerns might be pressing even when a case is not fully adjudicated through trial or summary pretrial disposition.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.
