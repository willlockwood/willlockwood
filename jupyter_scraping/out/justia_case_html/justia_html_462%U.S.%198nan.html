The issue before us is whether \xc2\xa7 542(a) of that Code authorized the Bankruptcy Court to subject the IRS to a turnover order with respect to the seized property.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent Whiting Pools, Inc., a corporation, sells, installs, and services swimming pools and related equipment and supplies.  As of January, 1981,  Whiting owed approximately $92,000 in Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes and federal taxes withheld from its employees, but had failed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 462 U. S. 200</a></p><p> to respond to assessments and demands for payment by the IRS.  As a consequence, a tax lien in that amount attached to all of Whiting\'s property. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>On January 14, 1981, the Service seized Whiting\'s tangible personal property -- equipment, vehicles, inventory, and office supplies -- pursuant to the levy and distraint provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  According to uncontroverted findings, the estimated liquidation value of the property seized was, at most, $35,000, but its estimated going-concern value in Whiting\'s hands was $162,876.  The very next day, January 15, Whiting filed a petition for reorganization, under the Bankruptcy Code\'s Chapter 11, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed., Supp. V), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of New York.  Whiting was continued as debtor-in-possession. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States, intending to proceed with a tax sale of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 462 U. S. 201</a></p><p> the property, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] moved in the Bankruptcy Court for a declaration that the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, \xc2\xa7 362(a), is inapplicable to the IRS or, in the alternative, for relief from the stay.  Whiting counterclaimed for an order requiring the Service to turn the seized property over to the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \xc2\xa7 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Whiting intended to use the property in its reorganized business.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Bankruptcy Court determined that the IRS was bound by the automatic stay provision.  <em>In re Whiting Pools, Inc.,</em> 10 B.R. 755 (1981).  Because it found that the seized property was essential to Whiting\'s reorganization effort, it refused to lift the stay.  Acting under \xc2\xa7 543(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] rather than under \xc2\xa7 542(a), the court directed the IRS to turn the property over to Whiting on the condition that Whiting provide the Service with specified protection for its interests.  10 B.R. at 760-761. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="202">Page 462 U. S. 202</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The United States District Court reversed, holding that a turnover order against the Service was not authorized by either \xc2\xa7 542(a) or \xc2\xa7 543(b)(1).  15 B.R. 270 (1981).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in turn, reversed the District Court.  674 F.2d 144 (1982).  It held that a turnover order could issue against the Service under \xc2\xa7 542(a), and it remanded the case for reconsideration of the adequacy of the Bankruptcy Court\'s protection conditions.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its ruling was contrary to that reached by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Cross Electric Co. v. United States,</em> 664 F.2d 1218 (1981), and noted confusion on the issue among bankruptcy and district courts.  674 F.2d at 145, and n. 1.  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict in an important area of the law under the new Bankruptcy Code.  459 U.S. 1033 (1982).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>By virtue of its tax lien, the Service holds a secured interest in Whiting\'s property.  We first examine whether \xc2\xa7 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code generally authorizes the turnover of a debtor\'s property seized by a secured creditor prior to the commencement of reorganization proceedings.  Section 542(a) requires an entity in possession of "property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease under section 363" to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 462 U. S. 203</a></p><p> deliver that property to the trustee.  Subsections (b) and (c) off \xc2\xa7 363 authorize the trustee to use, sell, or lease any "property of the estate," subject to certain conditions for the protection of creditors with an interest in the property.  Section 541(a)(1) defines the "estate" as</p>\n<p>"comprised of all the following property, wherever located:  . . . all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case."</p>\n<p>Although these statutes could be read to limit the estate to those "interests of the debtor in property" at the time of the filing of the petition, we view them as a definition of what is included in the estate, rather than as a limitation.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In proceedings under the reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, a troubled enterprise may be restructured to enable it to operate successfully in the future.  Until the business can be reorganized pursuant to a plan under 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1121-1129 (1976 ed., Supp. V), the trustee or debtor-in-possession is authorized to manage the property of the estate and to continue the operation of the business.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 1108.  By permitting reorganization, Congress anticipated that the business would continue to provide jobs, to satisfy creditors\' claims, and to produce a return for its owners.  H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 220 (1977).  Congress presumed that the assets of the debtor would be more valuable if used in a rehabilitated business than if "sold for scrap."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The reorganization effort would have small chance of success, however, if property essential to running the business were excluded from the estate.  <em>See</em> 6 J. Moore &amp; L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy \xef\xbf\xbd 3.05, p. 431 (14th ed. 1978).  Thus, to facilitate the rehabilitation of the debtor\'s business, all the debtor\'s property must be included in the reorganization estate.</p>\n<p>This authorization extends even to property of the estate in which a creditor has a secured interest.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 363(b) and (c); <em>see</em> H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 182 (1977).  Although Congress might have safeguarded the interests of secured creditors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 462 U. S. 204</a></p><p> outright by excluding from the estate any property subject to a secured interest, it chose instead to include such property in the estate and to provide secured creditors with "adequate protection" for their interests. \xc2\xa7 363(e), quoted in  <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra.</em>  At the secured creditor\'s insistence, the bankruptcy court must place such limits or conditions on the trustee\'s power to sell, use, or lease property as are necessary to protect the creditor.  The creditor with a secured interest in property included in the estate must look to this provision for protection, rather than to the nonbankruptcy remedy of possession.</p>\n<p>Both the congressional goal of encouraging reorganizations and Congress\' choice of methods to protect secured creditors suggest that Congress intended a broad range of property to be included in the estate.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The statutory language reflects this view of the scope of the estate.  As noted above, \xc2\xa7 541(a)(1) provides that the</p>\n<p>"estate is comprised of all the following property, wherever located:  . . . all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case."</p>\n<p>11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 541(a)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. V). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The House and Senate Reports </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 462 U. S. 205</a></p><p> on the Bankruptcy Code indicate that \xc2\xa7 541(a)(1)\'s scope is broad. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Most important, in the context of this case, \xc2\xa7 541(a)(1) is intended to include in the estate any property made available to the estate by other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 367 (1977).  Several of these provisions bring into the estate property in which the debtor did not have a possessory interest at the time the bankruptcy proceedings commenced. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 542(a) is such a provision.  It requires an entity (other than a custodian) holding any property of the debtor that the trustee can use under \xc2\xa7 363 to turn that property over to the trustee. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Given the broad scope of the reorganization </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 462 U. S. 206</a></p><p> estate, property of the debtor repossessed by a secured creditor falls within this rule, and therefore may be drawn into the estate.  While there are explicit limitations on the reach of \xc2\xa7 542(a), [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] none requires that the debtor hold a possessory interest in the property at the commencement of the reorganization proceedings. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>As does all bankruptcy law, \xc2\xa7 542(a) modifies the procedural rights available to creditors to protect and satisfy their liens. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/311/273/case.html">Wright v. Union Central Life Ins.

In effect, \xc2\xa7 542(a) grants to the estate a possessory interest in certain property of the debtor that was not held by the debtor at the commencement of reorganization proceedings. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The Bankruptcy Code provides secured creditors various rights, including the right to adequate protection, and these rights replace the protection afforded by possession.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>This interpretation of \xc2\xa7 542(a) is supported by the section\'s legislative history.  Although the legislative Reports are silent on the precise issue before us, the House and Senate hearings from which \xc2\xa7 542(a) emerged provide guidance.  Several witnesses at those hearings noted, without contradiction, the need for a provision authorizing the turnover of property of the debtor in the possession of secured creditors. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Section 542(a) first appeared in the proposed legislation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 462 U. S. 208</a></p><p> shortly after these hearings.  <em>See</em> H.R. 6, \xc2\xa7 542(a), 95th Cong., 1st Sess., introduced January 4, 1977.  <em>See generally</em> Klee, Legislative History of the New Bankruptcy Code, 54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 275, 279-281 (1980).  The section remained unchanged through subsequent versions of the legislation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this interpretation of \xc2\xa7 542 in the reorganization context is consistent with judicial precedent predating the Bankruptcy Code.  Under Chapter X, the reorganization chapter of the Bankruptcy Act of 1878, as amended, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101-276, 52 Stat. 883 (formerly codified as 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 501-676), the bankruptcy court could order the turnover of collateral in the hands of a secured creditor.  <em>Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Kaplan,</em> 185 F.2d 791, 796 (CA1 1950); <em>see In re Third Ave. Transit Corp.,</em> 198 F.2d 703, 706 (CA2 1952); 6A J. Moore &amp; L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy \xef\xbf\xbd 14.03, pp. 741-742 (14th ed.1977); Murphy, Use of Collateral in Business Rehabilitations:  A Suggested Redrafting of Section 7-203 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, 63 Calif.L.Rev. 1483, 1492-1495 (1975).  Nothing in the legislative history evinces a congressional intent to depart from that practice.  Any other interpretation of \xc2\xa7 542(a) would deprive the bankruptcy estate of the assets and property essential to its rehabilitation effort, and thereby would frustrate the congressional purpose behind the reorganization provisions. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 462 U. S. 209</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We conclude that the reorganization estate includes property of the debtor that has been seized by a creditor prior to the filing of a petition for reorganization.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We see no reason why a different result should obtain when the IRS is the creditor.  The Service is bound by \xc2\xa7 542(a) to the same extent as any other secured creditor.  The Bankruptcy Code expressly states that the term "entity," used in \xc2\xa7 542(a), includes a governmental unit.  \xc2\xa7 101 (14).  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  Moreover, Congress carefully considered the effect of the new Bankruptcy Code on tax collection, <em>see generally</em> S.Rep. No. 95-1106 (1978) (Report of Senate Finance Committee), and decided to provide protection to tax collectors, such as the IRS, through grants of enhanced priorities for unsecured tax claims, \xc2\xa7 507 (a)(6), and by the nondischarge of tax liabilities, \xc2\xa7 523(a)(1).  S.Rep. No. 95-989, pp. 14-15 (1978).  Tax collectors also enjoy the generally applicable right under \xc2\xa7 363(e) to adequate protection for property subject to their liens.  Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended a special exception for the tax collector in the form of an exclusion from the estate of property seized to satisfy a tax lien.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Of course, if a tax levy or seizure transfers to the IRS ownership of the property seized, \xc2\xa7 542(a) may not apply.  The enforcement provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6321-6326 (1976 ed. and Supp. V), do grant to the Service powers to enforce its tax liens that are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 462 U. S. 210</a></p><p> greater than those possessed by private secured creditors under state law.  <em>See United States v.

First, the new Bankruptcy Code abolished the distinction between summary and plenary jurisdiction, thus expanding the jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts beyond the possession limitation.  H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, pp. 48-49 (1977); <em>see Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html">458 U.

Moreover, <em>Phelps</em> was a liquidation situation, and is inapplicable to reorganization proceedings such as we consider here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>One of the procedural rights the law of secured transactions grants a secured creditor to enforce its lien is the right to take possession of the secured property upon the debtor\'s default.  Uniform Commercial Code \xc2\xa7 9-503, 3A U.L.A. 211 (1981).  A creditor\'s possessory interest resulting from the exercise of this right is subject to certain restrictions on the creditor\'s use of the property.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 9-504, 3A U.L.A. at 256-257.  Here, we address the abrogation of the Service\'s possessory interest obtained pursuant to its tax lien, a secured interest.  We do not decide whether any property of the debtor in which a third party holds a possessory interest independent of a creditor\'s remedies is subject to turnover under \xc2\xa7 542(a).  For example, if property is pledged to the secured creditor so that the creditor has possession prior to any default, \xc2\xa7 542(a) may not require turnover.  <em>See</em> 4 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy \xef\xbf\xbd 541.08[9], p. 541-53 (15th ed.1982).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, if this were not the effect, \xc2\xa7 542(a) would be largely superfluous in light of \xc2\xa7 541(a)(1).  Interests in the seized property that could have been exercised by the debtor -- in this case, the rights to notice and the surplus from a tax sale, <em>see</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra</em> -- are already part of the estate by virtue of \xc2\xa7 541(a)(1).  No coercive power is needed for this inclusion.  The fact that \xc2\xa7 542(a) grants the trustee greater rights than those held by the debtor prior to the filing of the petition is consistent with other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that address the scope of the estate.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7 544 (trustee has rights of lien creditor); \xc2\xa7 545 (trustee has power to avoid statutory liens); \xc2\xa7 549 (trustee has power to avoid certain postpetition transactions).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Hearings on H.R. 31 and H.R. 32 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., 439 (1975-1976) (statement of Patrick A.

In general, we find Judge Friendly\'s careful analysis of this history for the Court of Appeals, 674 F.2d 144, 152-156 (1982), to be unassailable.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 542(a) also governs turnovers in liquidation and individual adjustment of debt proceedings under Chapters 7 and 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 701-766, 1301-1330 (1976 ed., Supp. V).  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 103(a).  Our analysis in this case depends in part on the reorganization context in which the turnover order is sought.  We express no view on the issue whether \xc2\xa7 542(a) has the same broad effect in liquidation or adjustment of debt proceedings.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>It could be argued that dictum in <em>Phelps v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/330/case.html">421 U. S. 330</a></span> (1975), suggests the contrary.  In that case, the IRS had levied on a fund held by an assignee of the debtor for the benefit of the debtor\'s creditors.  In a liquidation proceeding under the old Bankruptcy Act, the trustee sought an order directing the assignee to turn the funds over to the estate.  The Court determined that the levy transferred constructive possession of the fund to the Service, thus ousting the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/330/case.html#335">421 U. S. 335</a></span>-336.  In rebutting the trustee\'s argument that actual possession by the IRS was necessary to avoid jurisdiction, the Court stated:  "The levy . . . gave the United States full legal right to the $38,000 levied upon as against the claim of the petitioner receiver."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/330/case.html#337">421 U. S. 337</a></span>.  This sentence, however, is merely a restatement of the proposition that the levy gave the Service a sufficient possessory interest to avoid the bankruptcy court\'s summary jurisdiction.  The proposition is now irrelevant because of the expanded jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Code.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F13" name="T13">n</a> 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Phelps</em> made a similar statement in discussing the trustee\'s claim that \xc2\xa7 70a(8) of the old Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 110(a)(8) (trustee is vested "with the title of the bankrupt as of the date of the filing of the petition . . . to . . . property held by an assignee for the benefit of creditors"), continued constructive possession of the property in the estate, notwithstanding the prepetition levy.  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/330/case.html#337">421 U. S. 337</a></span>, n. 8.  The Court rejected this claim.  It first cited the trustee\'s concession that the debtor had surrendered title upon conveying the property to the assignee, <em>ibid.,</em> and held that, because the debtor did not hold title to the property as of the date of filing, the property was not covered by \xc2\xa7 70a(8).  The Court went on, however, to state that "the pre-bankruptcy levy displaced any title of [the debtor] and \xc2\xa7 70a(8) is therefore inapplicable."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because the initial conveyance of the property to the assignee was said to have extinguished the debtor\'s claim, this latter statement perhaps was unnecessary to our decision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6335(a) ("As soon as practicable after seizure of property, notice in writing shall be given by the Secretary to the owner of the property"), and \xc2\xa7 6335(b) ("The Secretary shall as soon as practicable after the seizure of the property give notice to the owner").</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
