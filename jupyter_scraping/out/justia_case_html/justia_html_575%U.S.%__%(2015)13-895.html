The Court\xe2\x80\x99s district-specific language makes sense in light of the personal nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim, see <i>Bush</i> v. <i>Vera</i>,  517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 952 ; <i>Shaw I, supra, </i>at 648.

But a showing that race-based criteria did not significantly affect the drawing of <i>some</i> Alabama districts would have done little to defeat a claim that race-based criteria predominantly affected the drawing of <i>other </i>Alabama districts.  Thus, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient, and the District Court must on remand consider racial gerrymandering with respect to the individual districts challenged by appellants.

The record indicates that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidence and arguments embody the claim that individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered, and those are the districts that the District Court must reconsider.  Although plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines, neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that the legislature racially gerrymandered the State \xe2\x80\x9cas\xe2\x80\x9d an undifferentiated \xe2\x80\x9cwhole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p> <p style="p-SYLCT-F">                      2.\xc2\xa0The District Court also erred in deciding, <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte,</i> that the Conference lacked standing.  It believed that the \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d did \xe2\x80\x9cnot clearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the [Conference] reside.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s post-trial brief and the testimony of a Conference representative support an inference that the organization has members in all of the majority-minority districts, which is sufficient to meet the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s burden of establishing standing.  At the very least, the Conference reasonably believed that, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for more detailed information, it need not provide additional information such as a specific membership list.  While the District Court had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, in these circumstances elementary principles of procedural fairness required the District Court, rather than acting <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i>, to give the Conference an opportunity to provide evidence of member residence.  On remand, the District Court should permit the Conference to file its membership list and the State to respond, as appropriate.

It reached its conclusion in part because it placed in the balance, among other nonracial factors, legislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal population.  An equal population goal, however, is not one of the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d factors to be weighed against the use of race to determine whether race \xe2\x80\x9cpredominates,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 916.  Rather, it is part of the redistricting background, taken as a given, when determining whether race, or other factors, predominate in a legislator\xe2\x80\x99s determination as to <i>how</i> equal population objectives will be met.  Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the law, its \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d conclusions, including those concerning the four districts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well have been different.  For example, there is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26.

The history of \xc2\xa75 further supports this view, as Congress adopted the language in \xc2\xa75 to reject this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,  539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461 , and to accept the views of Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s dissent\xe2\x80\x94that, in a \xc2\xa75 retrogression case, courts should ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice, and that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all significant circumstances, <i>id.,</i> at 493, 498, 505, 509.  Here, both the District Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression.

A court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29.  Here, however, the District Court and the legislature both asked the wrong question with respect to narrow tailoring.  They asked how to maintain the present minority percentages in majority-minority districts, instead of asking the extent to which they must preserve existing minority percentages in order to maintain the minority\xe2\x80\x99s present ability to elect the candidate of its choice.  Because asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer, the Court cannot accept the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.

The appeals focus upon the appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims that new district boundaries create \xe2\x80\x9cracial gerrymanders\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Protection Clause.

We find that the District Court applied incorrect legal standards in evaluating the claims.  We consequently vacate its decision and remand the cases for further proceedings.</p><p>I</p><p>                    The Alabama Constitution requires the legislature to reapportion its State House and Senate electoral districts following each decennial census.  Ala. Const., Art. IX, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7199\xe2\x80\x93200.  In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State\xe2\x80\x99s 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts.  2012 Ala. Acts no. 602 (House plan); <i>id.,</i> at no. 603 (Senate plan) (Acts).  In doing so, Alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectives, such as compactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbents.  But it placed yet greater importance on achieving two other goals.  See Alabama Legislature Reapportionment Committee Guidelines in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 30\xe2\x80\x934, pp. 3\xe2\x80\x935 (Committee Guidelines).</p><p>                    First, it sought to minimize the extent to which a district might deviate from the theoretical ideal of precisely equal population.  In particular, it set as a goal creating a set of districts in which no district would deviate from the theoretical, precisely equal ideal by more than 1%\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>a more rigorous deviation standard than our precedents have found necessary under the Constitution.  See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Thomson</i>,462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 835,842 (1983) (5% deviation from ideal generally permissible).  No one here doubts the desirability of a State\xe2\x80\x99s efforts generally to come close to a one-person, one-vote ideal.</p><p>                    Second, it sought to ensure compliance with federal law, and, in particular, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.79Stat.439, as amended,52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710301 <i>et seq</i>.  At the time of the redistricting Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under that Act.  Accordingly \xc2\xa75 of the Act required Alabama to demonstrate that an electoral change, such as redistricting, would not bring about retrogression in  respect to racial minorities\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cability .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710304(b).  Specifically, Alabama believed that, to avoid retrogression under \xc2\xa75, it was required to maintain roughly the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority districts.  See Appendix B, <i>infra</i>.</p><p>                    Compliance with these two goals posed particular difficulties with respect to many of the State\xe2\x80\x99s 35 majority-minority districts (8 in the Senate, 27 in the House).  That is because many of these districts were (compared with the average district) underpopulated.  In order for Senate District 26, for example, to meet the State\xe2\x80\x99s no-more-than-1% population-deviation objective, the State would have to add about 16,000 individuals to the district.  And, prior to redistricting, 72.75% of District 26\xe2\x80\x99s population was black.  Accordingly, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s plan added 15,785 new individ-uals, and only 36 of those newly added individuals were white.</p><p>                    This suit, as it appears before us, focuses in large part upon Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to achieve these two goals.  The Caucus and the Conference basically claim that the State, in adding so many new minority voters to majority-minority districts (and to others), went too far.  They allege the State created a constitutionally forbidden \xe2\x80\x9cracial gerrymander\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a gerrymander that (<i>e.g.</i>, when the State adds more minority voters than needed for a minor-ity group to elect a candidate of its choice) might, among other things, harm the very minority voters that Acts such as the Voting Rights Act sought to help.</p><p>                    After a bench trial, the Federal District Court held in favor of the State, <i>i.e.</i>, against the Caucus and the Conference, with respect to their racial gerrymandering claims as well as with respect to several other legal claims that the Caucus and the Conference had made.  With respect to racial gerrymandering, the District Court recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when (1) race is the \xe2\x80\x9cdominant and controlling\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant\xe2\x80\x9d consideration in deciding \xe2\x80\x9cto place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900,913,916 (1995), and (2)<i> </i>the use of race is not \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shaw II</i>, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 902; see also <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630,649 (1993) (<i>Shaw I\xc2\xa0</i>) (Constitution forbids \xe2\x80\x9cseparat[ion of\xc2\xa0] voters into different districts on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x9d when the separation \xe2\x80\x9clacks sufficient justification\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Bush</i> v. <i>Vera</i>,517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 952\xe2\x80\x93959, 976 (1996) (principal opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (same).  But, after trial the District Court held (2 to 1) that the Caucus and the Conference had failed to prove their racial gerrymandering claims.  The Caucus along with the Conference (and several other plaintiffs) appealed.  We noted probable jurisdiction with respect to the racial gerrymandering claims.  572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).</p><p>                    We shall focus upon four critical District Court determinations underlying its ultimate \xe2\x80\x9cno violation\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion.  They concern:</p><p><i>The Geographical Nature of the Racial Gerrymandering Claims</i>.  The District Court characterized the appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims as falling into two categories.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, both appellants had argued \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Acts <i>as a whole</i> constitute racial gerrymanders,\xe2\x80\x9d 989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1227, 1287 (MD Ala. 2013) (emphasis added), and one of the appellants (the Conference) had also argued that the State had racially gerrymandered four specific electoral districts, Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26, <i>id</i>., at 1288.</p><p><i>Standing.  </i>The District Court held that the Caucus had standing to argue its racial gerrymandering claim with respect to the State \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Conference lacked standing to make any of its racial gerrymandering claims\xe2\x80\x94the claim requiring consideration of the State \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d and the claims requiring consideration of four individual Senate districts.<i>  Id</i>., at 1292.</p><p><i>Racial Predominance.  </i>The District Court held that, in any event, the appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims must fail because race \xe2\x80\x9cwas not the predominant motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d either (a) \xe2\x80\x9cfor the Acts as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d or (b) with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cSenate Districts 7, 11, 22, or 26.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 1293.</p><p><i>Narrow Tailoring/Compelling State Interest.  </i>The District Court also held that, even were it wrong about standing and predominance, the appellants\xe2\x80\x99 racial gerrymandering claims must fail.  That is because any predominant use of race in the drawing of electoral boundaries was \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to serve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling state interest,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 1306\xe2\x80\x931307, namely the interest in avoiding retrogression with respect to racial minorities\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cability to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa710304(b).</p><p>                    In our view, each of these determinations reflects an error about relevant law.  And each error likely affected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions\xe2\x80\x94to the point where we must vacate the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the cases to allow appellants to reargue their racial gerrymandering claims.  In light of our opinion, all parties remain free to introduce such further evidence as the District Court shall reasonably find appropriate.</p><p>II</p><p>                    We begin by considering the geographical nature of the racial gerrymandering claims.  The District Court repeatedly referred to the racial gerrymandering claims as claims that race improperly motivated the drawing of boundary lines of the State <i>considered as a whole</i>.<i> </i>See, <i>e.g.</i>, 989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1293 (\xe2\x80\x9cRace was not the predominant motivating factor for the Acts as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1287 (construing plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge as arguing that the \xe2\x80\x9cActs as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1292 (describing the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge as a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim of racial gerrymandering to the Acts as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (noting four exceptions).</p><p>                    A racial gerrymandering claim, however, applies to the boundaries of individual districts.  It applies district-by-district.  It does not apply to a State considered as an undifferentiated \xe2\x80\x9cwhole.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have consistently described a claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or more <i>specific electoral</i> <i>districts</i>.<i> </i>See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Shaw I</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 649 (violation consists of \xe2\x80\x9cseparat[ing] voters <i>into different districts</i> on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <i>Vera</i>, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 965 (principal opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Courts] must scrutinize<i> each challenged district</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  We have described the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary burden similarly.  See <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 916 (plaintiff must show that \xe2\x80\x9crace was the predominant factor motivating the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without<i> a particular district</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p><p><i> </i>Our district-specific language makes sense in light of the nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim.  Those harms are personal.  They include being \xe2\x80\x9cpersonally .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. subjected to [a] racial classification,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Vera</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 957 (principal opinion), as well as being represented by a legislator who believes his \xe2\x80\x9cprimary obligation is to represent only the members\xe2\x80\x9d of a particular racial group,  <i>Shaw I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 648.<i> </i>They directly threaten a voter who lives in the<i> district</i> attacked.  But they do not so keenly threaten a voter who lives elsewhere in the State.  Indeed, the latter voter normally lacks standing to pursue a racial gerrymandering claim.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hays</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737\xe2\x80\x93745 (1995).</p><p>                    Voters, of course, can present statewide <i>evidence </i>in order to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular district.  See <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 916.  And voters might make the claim that <i>every </i>individual district in a State suffers from racial gerrymandering.  But this latter claim is not the claim that the District Court, when using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d considered here.  Rather, the concept as used here suggests the existence of a legal unicorn, an animal that exists only in the legal imagination.</p><p>                    This is not a technical, linguistic point.  Nor does it criticize what might seem, in effect, a slip of the pen.  Rather, here the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s terminology mattered.  That is because the District Court found that racial criteria had not<i> </i>predominated in the drawing of some<i> </i>Alabama districts.  And it found that fact (the fact that race did not predominate in the drawing of some, or many districts) sufficient to defeat what it saw as the basic claim before it, namely a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to the State <i>as an undifferentiated whole</i>.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, 989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1294 (rejecting plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge because \xe2\x80\x9c[the legislature] followed no bright-line rule\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to every majority-minority district); <i>id</i>., at 1298\xe2\x80\x931299, 1301 (citing examples of majority-minority districts in which black population percentages were reduced and examples of majority-white districts in which precincts were split).</p><p>                    A showing that race-based criteria did not significantly affect the drawing of <i>some</i> Alabama districts, however, would have done little to defeat a claim that race-based criteria predominantly affected the drawing of <i>other </i>Alabama districts, such as Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s majority-minority districts primarily at issue here.  See <i>id</i>., at 1329 (Thompson, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he drafters[\xe2\x80\x99] fail[ure] to achieve their sought-after percentage in one district does not detract one iota from the fact that they did achieve it in another\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient.  And we must remand for consideration of racial gerrymandering with respect to the individual districts subject to the appellants\xe2\x80\x99 racial gerrymandering challenges.</p><p>                    The State and principal dissent argue that (but for four specifically mentioned districts) there were in effect no such districts.  The Caucus and the Conference, the State and principal dissent say, did not seek a district-by-district analysis.  And, the State and principal dissent conclude that the Caucus and the Conference have consequently waived the right to any further consideration.  Brief for Appellees 14, 31; <i>post,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion ofScalia, J.).</p><p>                    We do not agree.  We concede that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion suggests that it was the Caucus and the Conference that led the Court to consider racial gerrymandering of the State \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1287.  At least the District Court interpreted their filings to allege only that kind of claim.  <i>Ibid</i>.  But our review of the record indicates that the plaintiffs did not claim only that the legislature had racially gerrymandered the State \xe2\x80\x9cas\xe2\x80\x9d an undifferentiated \xe2\x80\x9cwhole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, their evidence and their arguments embody the claim that individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered.  And those are the districts that we believe the District Court must reconsider.</p><p>                    There are 35 majority-minority districts, 27 in the House and 8 in the Senate.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion itself refers to evidence that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting committee, in order to satisfy what it believed the Voting Rights Act required, deliberately chose additional black voters to move into underpopulated majority-minority districts, <i>i.e., </i>a specific set of individual districts.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, 989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1274 (referring to Senator Dial\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that the Committee \xe2\x80\x9ccould have used,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not use, \xe2\x80\x9cwhite population within Jefferson County to repopulate the majority-black districts\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cdoing so would have resulted in the retrogression of the majority-black districts and potentially created a problem for [Justice Department] preclearance\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1276 (stating that Representative Jim McClendon, also committee cochair, \xe2\x80\x9ctestified consistently with Senator Dial\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1277 (noting that the committee\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Randolph Hinaman, testified that \xe2\x80\x9che needed to add population\xe2\x80\x9d to majority-black districts \xe2\x80\x9cwithout significantly lowering the percentage of the population in each district that was majority-black\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    The Caucus and the Conference presented much evidence at trial to show that that the legislature had deliberately moved black voters into these majority-minority districts\xe2\x80\x94again, a specific set of districts\xe2\x80\x94in order to prevent the percentage of minority voters in each district from declining.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>Committee Guidelines 3\xe2\x80\x935; 1 Tr. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, 36\xe2\x80\x9337, 55, 63, 67\xe2\x80\x9368, 77, 81, 96, 115, 124, 136, 138 (testimony of Senator Dial); Deposition of Gerald Dial in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691 (May 21, 2013), Doc. 123\xe2\x80\x935, pp. 17, 39\xe2\x80\x9341, 62, 100 (Dial Deposition); 3 Tr. 222 (testimony of Representative McClendon); <i>id</i>., at 118\xe2\x80\x93119, 145\xe2\x80\x93146, 164, 182\xe2\x80\x93183, 186\xe2\x80\x93187 (testimony of Hinaman); Deposition of Randolph Hinaman in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691 (June 25, 2013), Doc. 134\xe2\x80\x934, pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 101 (Hinaman Deposition).</p><p>                    In their post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the plaintiffs stated that the evidence showed a racial gerrymander with respect to the majority of the majority-minority districts; they referred to the specific splitting of precinct and county lines in the drawing of many majority-minority districts; and they pointed to much district-specific evidence.  <i>E.g.</i>,<i> </i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Notice of Filing Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 194, pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 13\xe2\x80\x9314, 30\xe2\x80\x9335, 40 (Caucus Post-Trial Brief); Newton Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Notice of Filing Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 195, pp. 33\xe2\x80\x9335, 56\xe2\x80\x9361, 64\xe2\x80\x9367, 69\xe2\x80\x9374, 82\xe2\x80\x9385, 108, 121\xe2\x80\x93122 (Conference Post-Trial Brief); see also Appendix A, <i>infra</i> (organizing these citations by district).</p><p>                    We recognize that the plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines.  See generally<i> </i>Caucus Post-Trial Brief 1, 3\xe2\x80\x937, 48\xe2\x80\x9350; Conference Post-Trial Brief 2, 44\xe2\x80\x9345, 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  And they also sought to prove that the use of race to draw the boundaries of the majority-minority districts affected the boundaries of other districts as well.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>1 Tr. 36\xe2\x80\x9337, 48, 55, 70\xe2\x80\x9371, 93, 111, 124 (testimony of Dial); 3 Tr. 142, 162 (testimony of Hinaman); see generally Caucus Post-Trial Brief 8\xe2\x80\x9316.  Such evidence is perfectly relevant.  We have said that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden in a racial gerrymandering case is \xe2\x80\x9cto show, either through circumstantial evidence of a district\xe2\x80\x99s shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 916. Cf. <i>Easley</i> v. <i>Cromartie</i>,532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234,258 (2001) (explaining the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden in cases, unlike these, in which the State argues that politics, not race, was its predominant motive).  That Alabama expressly adopted and applied a policy of prioritizing mechanical racial targets above all other districting criteria (save one-person, one-vote) provides evidence that race motivated the drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the State.  And neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that the legislature racially gerrymandered the State \xe2\x80\x9cas\xe2\x80\x9d an undifferentiated \xe2\x80\x9cwhole.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>                    We, like the principal dissent, recognize that the plaintiffs could have presented their district-specific claims more clearly, <i>post,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x938, 10\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Scalia, J.), but the dissent properly concedes that its objection would weaken had the Conference \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped such a claim in the course of discovery and trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 6.  And that is just what happened.</p><p>                    In the past few pages and in Appendix A, we set forth the many record references that establish this fact.  The Caucus helps to explain the complaint omissions when it tells us that the plaintiffs unearthed the factual basis for their racial gerrymandering claims when they deposed the committee\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting expert.  See Brief for Appellants in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93895, pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The State neither disputes this procedural history nor objects that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 pleadings failed to conform with the proof.  Indeed, throughout, the plaintiffs litigated these claims not as if they were wholly separate entities but as if they were a team.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Caucus Post-Trial Brief 1 (\xe2\x80\x9c[We] support the additional claims made by the [Conference] plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d); but cf. <i>post</i>, at 3\xe2\x80\x9312 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (treating separately Conference claims from Caucus claims).<b> </b>Thus we, like the dissenting judge below (who also lived with these cases through trial), conclude that the record as a whole shows that the plaintiffs brought, and their argument rested significantly upon, district-specific claims.  See 989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1313 (Thompson, J., dissenting) (construing plaintiffs as also challenging \xe2\x80\x9ceach majority-Black House and Senate District\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    The principal dissent adds that the Conference waived its district-specific claims on appeal.  Cf. <i>post,</i> at 8.  But that is not so.  When asked specifically about its position at oral argument, the Conference stated that it was relying on statewide evidence to prove its district-specific challenges.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Its counsel said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe exact same policy was applied in every black-majority district,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 15, and \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y statewide, we simply mean a common policy applied to every district in the State,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 16.  We accept the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s clarification, which is consistent with how it presented these claims below.</p><p>                    We consequently conclude that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of racial gerrymandering of the State \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole\xe2\x80\x9d was legally erroneous.  We find that the appellants did not waive their right to consideration of their claims as applied to particular districts.  Accordingly, we remand the cases.  See <i>Pullman-Standard</i> v. <i>Swint</i>,456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 273,291 (1982) (remand is required when the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to make a finding because of an erroneous view of the law\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Rapanos</i> v. <i>United States</i>,547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 715,757 (2006) (same).</p><p>III</p><p>                    We next consider the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding with respect to standing.  The District Court, <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i>, held that the Conference lacked standing\xe2\x80\x94either to bring racial gerrymandering claims with respect to the four individual districts that the court specifically considered (<i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26) or to bring a racial gerrymandering claim with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cState as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1292.</p><p>                    The District Court recognized that ordinarily</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c[a]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members <i>when its members would have standing to sue in their own right</i>, the interests at stake are germane to the organization\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires individuals members\xe2\x80\x99 participation in the lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 1291 (quoting <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</i>,528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167,181 (2000); emphasis added).</p><p>It also recognized that a \xe2\x80\x9cmember\xe2\x80\x9d of an association \xe2\x80\x9cwould have standing to sue\xe2\x80\x9d in his or her \xe2\x80\x9cown right\xe2\x80\x9d when that member \xe2\x80\x9cresides in the district that he alleges was the product of a racial gerrymander.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1291 (citing <i>Hays</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 744\xe2\x80\x93745).  But, the District Court nonetheless denied standing because it believed that the \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d did \xe2\x80\x9cnot clearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the [Conference] reside,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Conference had \xe2\x80\x9cnot proved that it has members who have standing to pursue any district-specific claims of racial gerrymandering.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1292.</p><p>                    The District Court conceded that Dr. Joe Reed, a representative of the Conference, testified that the Conference \xe2\x80\x9chas members in almost every county in Alabama.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  But, the District Court went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe counties in Alabama are split into many districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cConference offered no testimony or evidence that it has members in all of the districts in Alabama or in any of the [four] specific districts that it challenged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p><p>                    The record, however, lacks adequate support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Dr. Reed\xe2\x80\x99s testimony supports, and nothing in that record undermines, the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s own statement, in its post-trial brief, that it is a \xe2\x80\x9cstatewide political caucus founded in 1960.\xe2\x80\x9d  Conference Post-Trial Brief 3.  It has the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cendors[ing] candidates for political office who will be responsible to the needs of the blacks and other minorities and poor people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  These two statements (the second of which the principal dissent ignores), taken together with Dr. Reed\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, support an inference that the organization has members in all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s majority-minority districts, other things being equal, which is sufficient to meet the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s burden of establishing standing.  That is to say, it seems highly likely that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatewide\xe2\x80\x9d organization with members in \xe2\x80\x9calmost every county,\xe2\x80\x9d the purpose of which is to help \xe2\x80\x9cblacks and other minorities and poor people,\xe2\x80\x9d will have members in each majority-minority district.  But cf<i>. post, </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x935 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p><p>                    At the very least, the common sense inference is strong enough to lead the Conference reasonably to believe that, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for more detailed information, it need not provide additional information such as a specific membership list.  We have found nothing in the record, nor has the State referred us to anything in the record, that suggests the contrary.  Cf. App. 204\xe2\x80\x93205, 208 (State arguing lack of standing, not because of inadequate member residency but because an association \xe2\x80\x9clives\xe2\x80\x9d nowhere and that the Conference should join individual members).  The most the State argued was that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]one of the <i>individual</i> [p]laintiffs [who brought the case with the Conference] claims to live in\xe2\x80\x9d Senate District 11, <i>id.</i>, at 205 (emphasis added), but the Conference would likely not have understood that argument as a request that <i>it</i> provide a membership list.  In fact, the Conference might have understood the argument as an indication that the State did <i>not </i>contest its membership in every district.</p><p>                    To be sure, the District Court had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, even in the absence of a state challenge.  See <i>post,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But, in these circumstances, elementary principles of procedural fairness required that the District Court, rather than acting <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i>, give the Conference an oppor-tunity to provide evidence of member residence.  Cf. <i>Warth</i> v. <i>Seldin</i>,422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490\xe2\x80\x93502 (1975) (explaining that a court may \xe2\x80\x9callow or [r]equire\xe2\x80\x9d a plaintiff to supplement the record to show standing and that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f, <i>after this opportu-nity</i>, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s standing does not adequately appear from all materials of record, the complaint must be dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Moreover, we have no reason to believe that the Conference would have been unable to provide a list of members, at least with respect to the majority-minority districts, had it been asked.  It has filed just such a list in this Court.  See Affidavit of Joe L. Reed Pursuant to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 32.3 (Lodging of Conference affidavit listing members residing in each majority-minority district in the State); see also<i> Parents Involved in Community Schools</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i>,551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 701,718 (2007) (accepting a lodged affidavit in similar circumstances).  Thus, the District Court on remand should reconsider the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s standing by permitting the Conference to file its list of members and permitting the State to respond, as appropriate.</p><p>IV</p><p>                    The District Court held in the alternative that the claims of racial gerrymandering must fail because \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ace was not the predominant motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d in the creation of any of the challenged districts.  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1293.  In our view, however, the District Court did not properly calculate \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance.\xe2\x80\x9d  In particular, it judged race to lack \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d in part because it placed in the balance, among other nonracial factors, legislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal population.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> id</i>., at 1305 (the \xe2\x80\x9cneed to bring the neighboring districts into compliance with the requirement of one person, one vote <i>served as the primary motivating factor</i> for the changes to [Senate] District 22\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <i>id</i>., at 1297 (the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional requirement of one person, one vote trumped every other districting principle\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1296 (the \xe2\x80\x9crecord establishes that the drafters of the new districts, above all, had to correct [for] severe malapportionment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1306 (the \xe2\x80\x9cinclusion of additional precincts [in Senate District 26] is a reasonable response to the underpopulation of the District\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    In our view, however, an equal population goal is not one factor among others to be weighed against the use of race to determine whether race \xe2\x80\x9cpredominates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it is part of the redistricting background, taken as a given, when determining whether race, or other factors, predominate in a legislator\xe2\x80\x99s determination as to <i>how </i>equal population objectives will be met.</p><p>                    To understand this conclusion, recall what \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d is about: A plaintiff pursuing a racial gerrymandering claim must show that \xe2\x80\x9crace was the predominant factor motivating the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 916.  To do so, the \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff must prove that the legislature subordinated <i>traditional race-neutral districting principles</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to racial considerations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (emphasis added).</p><p>                    Now consider the nature of those offsetting \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional race-neutral districting principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have listed several, including \xe2\x80\x9ccompactness, contiguity, respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid</i>.,<i> </i>incumbency protection, and political affiliation,  <i>Vera</i>, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 964, 968 (principal opinion).</p><p>                    But we have not listed equal population objectives.  And there is a reason for that omission.                      The reason that equal population objectives do not appear on this list of \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d criteria is that equal population objectives play a different role in a State\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting process.  That role is not a minor one.  Indeed, in light of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s demands, that role may often prove \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense of that word.  But, as the United States points out, \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of a racial gerrymandering claim is special.  It is not about whether a legislature believes that the need for equal population takes ultimate priority.  Rather, it is, as we said, whether the legislature \xe2\x80\x9cplaced\xe2\x80\x9d race \xe2\x80\x9cabove traditional districting considerations in determining <i>which </i>persons were placed <i>in appropriately apportioned districts</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19 (some emphasis added).  In other words, if the legislature must place 1,000 or so additional voters in a particular district in order to achieve an equal population goal, the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d question concerns <i>which </i>voters the legislature decides to choose, and specifically whether the legislature predominately uses race as opposed to other, \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d factors when doing so.</p><p>                    Consequently, we agree with the United States that the requirement that districts have approximately equal populations is a background rule against which redistricting takes place.  <i>Id</i>., at 12.  It is not a factor to be treated like other nonracial factors when a court determines whether race predominated over other, \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d factors in the drawing of district boundaries.</p><p>                    Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the law, its \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d conclusions, including those concerning the four districts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well have been different.  For example, once the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cequal population\xe2\x80\x9d objectives are put to the side\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, seen as a background principle\xe2\x80\x94then there is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26, the one district that the parties have discussed here in depth.</p><p>                    The legislators in charge of creating the redistricting plan believed, and told their technical adviser, that a primary redistricting goal was to maintain existing racial percentages in each majority-minority district, insofar as feasible.  See <i>supra</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (compiling extensive record testimony in support of this point).  There is considerable evidence that this goal had a direct and significant impact on the drawing of at least some of District 26\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.  See 3 Tr. 175\xe2\x80\x93180 (testimony of Hinaman); Appendix C, <i>infra</i> (change of district\xe2\x80\x99s shape from rectangular to irregular).  Of the 15,785 individuals that the new redistricting laws added to the population of District 26, just 36 were white\xe2\x80\x94a remarkable feat given the local demographics.  See, <i>e.g., </i>2 Tr. 127\xe2\x80\x93128 (testimony of Senator Quinton Ross); 3 Tr. 179 (testimony of Hinaman).  Transgressing their own redistricting guidelines, Committee Guidelines 3\xe2\x80\x934, the drafters split seven precincts between the majority-black District 26 and the majority-white District 25,with the population in those precincts clearly divided on racial lines.  See Exh. V in Support of Newton Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Opposition to Summary Judgment in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 140\xe2\x80\x931, pp. 91\xe2\x80\x9395.  And the District Court conceded that race \xe2\x80\x9cwas a factor in the drawing of District 26,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the legislature \xe2\x80\x9cpreserved\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe percentage of the population that was black.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1306.</p><p>                    We recognize that the District Court also found, with respect to District 26, that \xe2\x80\x9cpreservi[ng] the core of the existing [d]istrict,\xe2\x80\x9d following \xe2\x80\x9ccounty lines,\xe2\x80\x9d and following \xe2\x80\x9chighway lines\xe2\x80\x9d played an important boundary-drawing role.  <i>Ibid</i>.  But the first of these (core preservation) is not directly relevant to the origin of the <i>new </i>district inhabitants; the second (county lines) seems of marginal importance since virtually all Senate District 26 boundaries departed from county lines; and the third (highways) was not mentioned in the legislative redistricting guidelines.  Cf. Committee Guidelines 3\xe2\x80\x935.</p><p>                    All this is to say that, with respect to District 26 and likely others as well, had the District Court treated equal population goals as background factors, it might have concluded that race was the predominant boundary-drawing consideration.  Thus, on remand, the District Court should reconsider its \xe2\x80\x9cno predominance\xe2\x80\x9d conclusions with respect to Senate District 26 and others to which our analysis is applicable.</p><p>                    Finally, we note that our discussion in this section is limited to correcting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s misapplication of the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d test for strict scrutiny discussed in <i>Miller</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 916.  It does not express a view on the question of whether the intentional use of race in redistricting, even in the absence of proof that traditional districting principles were subordinated to race, triggers strict scrutiny.  See <i>Vera</i>, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 996 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p><p>V</p><p>                    The District Court, in a yet further alternative holding, found that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if the [State] subordinated traditional districting principles to racial considerations,\xe2\x80\x9d the racial gerrymandering claims failed because, in any event, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Districts would satisfy strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1306.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the \xe2\x80\x9cActs are narrowly tailored to comply with Section 5\xe2\x80\x9d of the Voting Rights Act.  <i>Id</i>., at 1311. That provision \xe2\x80\x9crequired the Legislature to maintain, where feasible, the existing number of majority-black districts and <i>not substantially reduce the relative percentages of black voters in those districts</i>.<i>\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid</i>. (emphasis added).  And, insofar as the State\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting embodied racial considerations, it did so in order to meet this \xc2\xa75 requirement.</p><p>                    In our view, however, this alternative holding rests upon a misperception of the law.  Section 5, which covered particular States and certain other jurisdictions, does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage.  It requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minority\xe2\x80\x99s ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.  That is precisely what the language of the statute says.  It prohibits a covered jurisdiction from adopting any change that \xe2\x80\x9chas the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of [the minority group] to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710304(b); see also \xc2\xa710304(d) (the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of subsection (b) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    That is also just what Department of Justice Guidelines say.  The Guidelines state specifically that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance determinations are not based</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9con any predetermined or fixed demographic percentages.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  Rather, in the Department\xe2\x80\x99s view, this determination requires a functional analysis of the electoral behavior within the particular jurisdiction or election district.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [C]ensus data alone may not provide sufficient indicia of electoral behavior to make the requisite determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Guidance Concerning Redistricting Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7471 (2011).</p><p>Consistent with this view, the United States tells us that \xe2\x80\x9cSection 5\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9crequir[e] the State to maintain the same percentage of black voters in each of the majority-black districts as had existed in the prior districting plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 22.  Rather, it \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits only those diminutions of a minority group\xe2\x80\x99s proportionate strength that strip the group within a district of its existing ability to elect its candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  We agree.  Section 5 does not require maintaining the same population percentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan.  Rather, \xc2\xa75 is satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.</p><p>                    The history of \xc2\xa75 further supports this view.  In adopting the statutory language to which we referred above, Congress rejected this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461,480 (2003) (holding that it is not nec-essarily retrogressive for a State to replace safe majority-minority districts with crossover or influence districts), and it adopted the views of the dissent.  H. R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93478, pp. 68\xe2\x80\x9369, and n. 183 (2006).  While the thrust of Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s dissent was that, in a \xc2\xa75 retrogression case, courts should ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice\xe2\x80\x94language that Congress adopted in revising \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x94his dissent also made clear that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all significant circumstances.  <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 493, 498, 505, 509.  And while the revised language of \xc2\xa75 may raise some interpretive questions\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>its application to coalition, crossover, and influence districts\xe2\x80\x94it is clear that Congress did not mandate that a 1% reduction in a 70% black population district would be necessarily retrogressive.  See Persily, The Promises and Pitfalls of the New Voting Rights Act, 117 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 174, 218 (2007).  Indeed, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s mechanical interpretation of \xc2\xa75 can raise serious constitutional concerns.  See <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 926.</p><p>                    The record makes clear that both the District Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression.  See Appendix B, <i>infra</i>.  And the difference between that view and the more purpose-oriented view reflected in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language can matter.  Imagine a majority-minority district with a 70% black population.  Assume also that voting in that district, like that in the State itself, is racially polarized.  And assume that the district has long elected to office black voters\xe2\x80\x99 preferred candidate.  Other things being equal, it would seem highly unlikely that a redistricting plan that, while increasing the numerical size of the district, reduced the percentage of the black population from, say, 70% to 65% would have a significant impact on the black voters\xe2\x80\x99 ability to elect their preferred candidate.  And, for that reason, it would be difficult to explain just why a plan that uses racial criteria predominately to maintain the black population at 70% is \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling state interest,\xe2\x80\x9d namely the interest in preventing \xc2\xa75 retrogression.  The cir-cumstances of this hypothetical example, we add, areclose to those characterizing Senate District 26, as set forth in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and throughout the record.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>1 Tr. 131\xe2\x80\x93132 (testimony of Dial); 3 Tr. 180 (testimony of Hinaman).</p><p>                     In saying this, we do not insist that a legislature guess precisely what percentage reduction a court or the Justice Department might eventually find to be retrogressive. The law cannot insist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine <i>precisely</i> what percent minority population \xc2\xa75 demands.  The standards of \xc2\xa75 are complex; they often require evaluation of controverted claims about voting behavior; the evidence may be unclear; and, with respect to any particular district, judges may disagree about the proper outcome.  The law cannot lay  a trap for an unwary legislature, condemning its redistricting plan as either (1) unconstitutional racial gerrymandering should the legislature place a few too many minority voters in a district or (2) retrogressive under \xc2\xa75 should the legislature place a few too few.  See <i>Vera</i>, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 977 (principal opinion).  Thus, we agree with the United States that a court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29 (citing <i>Ricci</i> v. <i>DeStefano</i>,557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557,585 (2009)).  This standard, as the United States points out, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not demand that a State\xe2\x80\x99s actions actually be necessary to achieve a compelling state interest in order to be constitutionally valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29.  And legislators \xe2\x80\x9cmay have a strong basis in evidence to use racial classifications in order to comply with a statute when they have <i>good reasons </i>to believe such use is required, even if a court does not find that the actions were necessary for statutory compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (emphasis added).</p><p>                    Here the District Court enunciated a narrow tailoring standard close to the one we have just mentioned.  It said that a plan is \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored . . . when the race-based action taken was <i>reasonably necessary</i>\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve a compelling interest.  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1307 (emphasis added).  And it held that preventing retrogression is a compel-ling interest.  <i>Id</i>., at 1306\xe2\x80\x931307.  While we do not here decide whether, given <i>Shelby County</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), continued compliance with \xc2\xa75 remains a compelling interest, we conclude that the District Court and the legislature asked the wrong question with respect to narrow tailoring.  They asked: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we maintain present minority percentages in majority-minority districts?\xe2\x80\x9d  But given \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s language, its purpose, the Justice Department Guidelines, and the relevant precedent, they should have asked: \xe2\x80\x9cTo what extent must we preserve existing minority percentages in order to maintain the minority\xe2\x80\x99s present ability to elect the candidate of its choice?\xe2\x80\x9d  Asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer.  Hence, we cannot accept the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest/narrow tailoring\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is vacated.  We note that appellants have also raised additional questions in their jurisdictional statements, relating to their one-person, one-vote claims (Caucus) and vote dilution claims (Conference), which were also rejected by the District Court.

These cases were consolidated before a three-judge District Court.  Even after a full trial, the District Court lamented that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he filings and arguments made by the plaintiffs on these claims were mystifying at best.\xe2\x80\x9d  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1227, 1287 (MD Ala. 2013).  Nevertheless, the District Court understood both groups of plaintiffs to argue, as relevant here, only that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1287.

It then found for Alabama on the merits.</p><p>                    The Court rightly concludes that our racial gerrymandering jurisprudence does not allow for statewide claims.  <i>Ante</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9312.  However, rather than holding appellants to the misguided legal theory they presented to the District Court, it allows them to take a mulligan, remanding the case with orders that the District Court consider whether some (all?) of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s 35 majority-minority districts result from impermissible racial gerrymandering.  In doing this, the Court disregards the detailed findings and thoroughly reasoned conclusions of the District Court\xe2\x80\x94in particular its determination, reached after watching the development of the case from complaint to trial, that no appellant proved (or even pleaded) district-specific claims with respect to the majority-minority districts.  Worse still, the Court ignores the Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s express waiver of these claims before this Court.  It does this on the basis of a few stray comments, cherry-picked from district-court filings that are more Rorschach brief than Brandeis brief, in which the vague outline of what could be district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims begins to take shape only with the careful, post-hoc nudging of appellate counsel.</p><p>                    Racial gerrymandering strikes at the heart of our democratic process, undermining the electorate\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in its government as representative of a cohesive body politic in which all citizens are equal before the law.  It is therefore understandable, if not excusable, that the Court balks at denying merits review simply because appellants pursued a flawed litigation strategy.  But allowing appellants a second bite at the apple invites lower courts similarly to depart from the premise that ours is an adversarial system whenever they deem the stakes sufficiently high.  Because I do not believe that Article III empowers this Court to act as standby counsel for sympathetic litigants, I dissent.</p><p>I.  The Alabama Democratic Conference</p><p>                    The District Court concluded that the Democratic Conference lacked standing to bring district-specific claims.  It did so on the basis of the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present any evidence that it had members who voted in the challenged districts, and because the individual Conference plaintiffs did not claim to vote in them.  989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1292.</p><p><i> </i>A voter has standing to bring a racial-gerrymandering claim only if he votes in a gerrymandered district, or if specific evidence demonstrates that he has suffered the special harms that attend racial gerrymandering.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hays</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737\xe2\x80\x93745 (1995).  However, the Democratic Conference only claimed to have \xe2\x80\x9cchapters and members in <i>almost</i> all counties in the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  Newton Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 195\xe2\x80\x931, pp. 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Democratic Conference Post-Trial Brief) (emphasis added).  Yet the Court concludes that this fact, combined with the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s self-description as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98statewide political caucus\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that endorses candidates for political office, \xe2\x80\x9csupports an inference that the organization has members in all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s majority-minority districts, other things being equal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.  The Court provides no support for this theory of jurisdiction by illogical inference, perhaps because this Court has rejected other attempts to peddle more-likely-than-not standing.  See <i>Summers</i> v. <i>Earth Island Institute,</i>555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 488,497 (2009) (rejecting a test for organizational standing that asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, accepting [an] organization\xe2\x80\x99s self-description of the activities of its members, there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    The inference to be drawn from the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s statements cuts in precisely the opposite direction.  What is at issue here is not just counties but voting districts within counties.  If the Conference has members in <i>almost</i> every county, then there must be counties in which it does not have members; and we have no basis for concluding (or inferring) that those counties do not contain all of the majority-minority voting districts.  Morever, even in those counties in which the Conference does have members, we have no basis for concluding (or inferring) that those members vote in majority-minority districts.  The Conference had plenty of opportunities, including at trial, to demonstrate that this was the case, and failed to do so.  This failure lies with the Democratic Conference, and the consequences should be borne by it, not by the people of Alabama, who must now shoulder the expense of further litigation and the uncertainty that attends a resuscitated constitutional challenge to their legislative districts.</p><p>                    Incredibly, the Court thinks that \xe2\x80\x9celementary principles of procedural fairness\xe2\x80\x9d <i>require</i> giving the Democratic Conference the opportunity to prove on appeal what it neglected to prove at trial.  <i>Ante, </i>at 14.  It observes that the Conference had no reason to believe it should provide such information because \xe2\x80\x9cthe State did <i>not</i> contest its membership in every district,\xe2\x80\x9d and the opinion cites an affidavit lodged <i>with this Court</i> providing a list of the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s members in each majority-minority district in Alabama.  <i>Ibid</i>.  I cannot imagine why the absence of a state challenge would matter.  Whether or not there was such a challenge, it was the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility, as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d to establish standing.  See <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>,504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555,561 (1992).  That responsibility was enforceable, challenge or no, by the court: \xe2\x80\x9cThe federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction, and standing \xe2\x80\x98is perhaps the most important of [the jurisdictional] doctrines.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>FW/PBS, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dallas</i>,493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 215\xe2\x80\x93231 (1990) (citations omitted).  And because standing is not a \xe2\x80\x9cmere pleading requiremen[t] but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, <i>i.e., </i>with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra</i>, at 561<i>.</i></p><p>                    The Court points to <i>Parents Involved in Community Schools</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i>,551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 701,718 (2007), as support for its decision to sandbag Alabama with the Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-time (indeed, out-of-court) lodging in this Court.  The circumstances in that case, however, are far afield.  The organization of parents in that case had established organizational standing in the lower court by showing that it had members with children who would be subject to the school district\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintegration tiebreaker,\xe2\x80\x9d which was applied at ninth grade.  Brief for Respondents, O. T. 2006, No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, p.\xc2\xa016.  By the time the case reached this Court, however, the youngest of these children had entered high school, and so would no longer be subject to the challenged policy.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Accordingly, we accepted a lodging that provided names of additional, younger children in order to show that the organization had not <i>lost</i> standing as a result of the long delay that often accompanies federal litigation.  Here, by contrast, the Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s lodging in the Supreme Court is its first attempt to show that it has members in the majority-minority districts.  This is too little, too late.</p><p>                    But that is just the start.  Even if the Democratic Conference <i>had standing to</i> <i>bring</i> district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims, there remains the question whether it <i>did</i> bring them.  Its complaint alleged three counts: (1) Violation of \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act, (2) Racial gerrymandering in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and (3) \xc2\xa71983 violations of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Complaint in No. 2:12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x931081, Doc. 1, pp. 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The racial gerrymandering count alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cAlabama Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 were drawn for the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportunity of minority voters to participate effectively in the political process,\xe2\x80\x9d and that this \xe2\x80\x9cracial gerrymandering by Alabama Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 violates the rights of Plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 17.  It made no reference to specific districts that were racially gerrymandered; indeed, the only particular jurisdictions mentioned <i>anywhere</i> in the complaint were Senate District 11, Senate District 22, Madison County Senate Districts, House District 73, and Jefferson and Montgomery County House Districts.  None of the Senate Districts is majority-minority.  Nor is House District 73.  Jefferson County does, admittedly, contain 8 of the 27 majority-minority House Districts in Alabama, and Montgomery County contains another 4, making a total of 12.  But they also contain 14 majority-white House Districts between them.  In light of this, it is difficult to understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that appellants\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cevidence and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. arguments embody the claim that individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.</p><p>                    That observation would, of course, make sense if the Democratic Conference had developed such a claim in the course of discovery and trial.  But in its post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Conference hewed to its original charge of statewide racial gerrymandering\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, it did so as much as it reasonably could without actually proposing that the Court find <i>any</i> racial gerrymandering, statewide or otherwise.  Instead, the Conference chose only to pursue claims that Alabama violated \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act under two theories.  See Democratic Conference Post-Trial Brief 91\xe2\x80\x93103 (alleging a violation of the results prong of Voting Rights Act \xc2\xa72) and 103\xe2\x80\x93124 (alleging a violation of the purpose prong of Voting Rights Act \xc2\xa72).</p><p>                    To be sure, the Conference employed language and presented factual claims at various points in its 126-page post-trial brief that are evocative of a claim of racial gerrymandering.  But in clinging to these stray comments to support its conclusion that the Conference made district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims, <i>ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, the Court ignores the context in which these comments appear\xe2\x80\x94the context of a clear Voting Rights Act \xc2\xa72 claim.  Voting Rights Act claims and racial-gerrymandering claims share some of the same elements.  See <i>League of United Latin American Citizens</i> v. <i>Perry,</i>548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399,514 (2006) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Thus, allegations made in the course of arguing a \xc2\xa72 claim will often be indistinguishable from allegations that would be made in support of a racial-gerrymandering claim.  The appearance of such allegations in one of the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s briefs might support reversal if this case came to us on appeal from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of a motion to dismiss.  See<i> Johnson</i> v. <i>City of Shelby</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 1) (noting that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \xe2\x80\x9cdo not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim as-serted\xe2\x80\x9d).  But here the District Court held a full trial be-fore concluding that the Conference failed to make or prove any district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims with respect to the majority-minority districts.  In this posture, and on this record, I cannot agree with the Court that the Conference\xe2\x80\x99s district-specific evidence, clearly made in the course of arguing a \xc2\xa72 theory, should be read to give rise to district-specific claims of racial gerrymandering with respect to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s majority-minority districts.</p><p>                    The Court attempts to shift responsibility for the Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s ill-fated statewide theory from the Conference to the District Court, implying that it was the \xe2\x80\x9clegally erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d analysis of the District Court, <i>ante,</i> at 12, rather than the arguments made by the Conference, that conjured this \xe2\x80\x9clegal unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 7, so that the Conference did not forfeit the claims that the Court now attributes to it, <i>ante,</i> at 12.  I suspect this will come as a great surprise to the Conference.  Whatever may have been presented to the District Court, the Conference un-equivocally stated in its opening brief:  \xe2\x80\x9cAppellants challenge Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s race-based statewide redistricting policy, <i>not</i> the design of any one particular election district.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellants in No. 13\xe2\x80\x931138, p. 2 (emphasis added).  It drove the point home in its reply brief: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f theCourt were to apply a predominant-motive and narrow-tailoring analysis, that analysis should be applied to the state\xe2\x80\x99s <i>policy</i>, not to the design of each particular district one-by-one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief in No. 11\xe2\x80\x931138, p.\xc2\xa07.  How could anything be clearer?  As the Court observes, the Conference attempted to walk back this unqualified description of its case at oral argument.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Its assertion that what it <i>really</i> meant to challenge was the policy as applied to every district (<i>not </i>every majority-minority district, mind you) is not \xe2\x80\x9cclarification,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 12, but an entirely new argument\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the same argument it expressly disclaimed in its briefing.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Republic of Argentina</i> v. <i>NML Capital, Ltd.</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (2014) (slip op., at 5, n.\xc2\xa02); we certainly should not do so when the issue is first presented at oral argument.</p><p>II.  The Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</p><p>                    The Court does not bother to disentangle the independent claims brought by the Black Caucus from those of the Democratic Conference, but it strongly implies that both parties asserted racial-gerrymandering claims with respect to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s 35 majority-minority districts.  As we have described, the Democratic Conference brought no such claims; and the Black Caucus\xe2\x80\x99s filings provide even weaker support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.</p><p>                    The Black Caucus complaint contained three counts: (1) Violation of One Person, One Vote, see <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims</i>,377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533 (1964); (2) Dilution and Isolation of Black Voting Strength in violation of \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act; and (3) Partisan Gerrymandering.  Complaint in No. 2:12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 1, pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9322.  The failure to raise <i>any</i> racial-gerrymandering claim was not a mere oversight or the consequence of inartful pleading.  Indeed, in its amended complaint the Black Caucus specifically cited this Court\xe2\x80\x99s leading racial-gerrymandering case for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional or neutral districting principles may not be subordinated in a dominant fashion by <i>either racial or partisan interests</i> absent a compelling state interest for doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amended Complaint in No. 2:12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 60, p.\xc2\xa023 (citing <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630,642 (1993); emphasis added).  This quote appears in the first paragraph under the \xe2\x80\x9cPartisan Gerrymandering\xe2\x80\x9d heading, and claims of subordination to <i>racial</i> interests are notably absent from the Black Caucus complaint.</p><p>                    Racial gerrymandering was not completely ignored, however.  In a brief introductory paragraph to the amended complaint, before addressing jurisdiction and venue, the Black Caucus alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cActs 2012-602 and 2012-603 are racial gerrymanders that unnecessarily minimize population deviations and violate the whole-county provisions of the Alabama Constitution with both the purpose and effect of minimizing black voting strength and isolating from influence in the Alabama Legislature legislators chosen by African Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amended Complaint, at 3.  This was the first and last mention of racial gerrymandering, and like the Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, it focused exclusively on the districting maps as a whole rather than individual districts.  Moreover, even this allegation appears primarily concerned with the use of racially motivated districting as a means of violating one person, one vote (by splitting counties), and \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act (by minimizing and isolating black voters and legislators).</p><p>                    To the extent the Black Caucus cited particular districts in the body of its complaint, it did so only with respect to its enumerated one-person, one-vote, Voting Rights Act, and partisan-gerrymandering counts.  See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (alleging that the \xe2\x80\x9cdeviation restriction and disregard of the \xe2\x80\x98whole county\xe2\x80\x99 requirements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. facilitated the Republican majority\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to gerrymander the district boundaries in Acts 2012\xe2\x80\x93602 and 2012\xe2\x80\x93603 for partisan purposes.  By packing the majority-black House and Senate districts, the plans remove reliable Democratic voters from adjacent majority-white districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>, at 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe partisan purpose of [one] gerrymander was to remove predominately black Madison County precincts to SD 1, avoiding a potential crossover district\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (asserting that \xe2\x80\x9csplitting Jefferson County among 11 House and Senate districts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cincreasing the size of its local legislative delegation and the number of other counties whose residents elect members\xe2\x80\x9d of the delegation \xe2\x80\x9cdilut[es] the votes of Jefferson County residents\xe2\x80\x9d by diminishing their ability to control county-level legislation in the state legislature).  And even these claims were made with a statewide scope in mind.  <i>Id.</i>, at 55 (\xe2\x80\x9cViewed in their entirety, the plans in Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 have the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportunities for black and white voters who support the Democratic Party to elect candidates of their choice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    Here again, discovery and trial failed to produce any clear claims with respect to the majority-minority districts.  In a curious inversion of the Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s practice of pleading racial gerrymandering and then effectively abandoning the claims, the Black Caucus, which failed to plead racial gerrymandering, did clearly advance the theory after the trial.  See Alabama Legislative Black Caucus Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 2:12\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93691, Doc. 194, pp. 48\xe2\x80\x9351 (Black Caucus Post-Trial Brief).  The Black Caucus asserted racial-gerrymandering claims in its post-trial brief, but they all had a clear statewide scope.  It charged that Alabama \xe2\x80\x9cstarted their line drawing with the majority-black districts\xe2\x80\x9d so as to maximize the size of their black majorities, which \xe2\x80\x9cimpacted the drawing of majority-white districts in nearly every part of the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 48\xe2\x80\x9349.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]ace was the predominant factor in drafting both plans,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 49, which \xe2\x80\x9cdrove nearly every districting decision,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdilut[ing] the influence of black voters in the majority-white districts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 50.</p><p>                    The Black Caucus did present district-specific evidence in the course of developing its other legal theories.  Al-though this included evidence that Alabama manipulated the racial composition of certain majority-minority districts, it also included evidence that Alabama manipulated racial distributions with respect to the districting maps as a whole, <i>id.,</i> at 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cMaintaining the same high black percentages had a predominant impact on the entire plan\xe2\x80\x9d), and with respect to majority-white districts, <i>id.,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (\xe2\x80\x9cAsked why [majority-white] SD 11 was drawn in a semi-donut-shape that splits St. Clair, Talladega, and Shelby Counties, Sen. Dial blamed that also on the need to preserve the black majorities in Jefferson County Senate districts\xe2\x80\x9d), and 43\xe2\x80\x9344 (\xe2\x80\x9cSen. Irons\xe2\x80\x99 quick, \xe2\x80\x98primative\xe2\x80\x99 [<i>sic</i>] analysis of the new [majority-white] SD 1 convinced her that it was designed to \xe2\x80\x98shed\xe2\x80\x99 the minority population of Sen.

The Black Caucus was attacking the legislative districts from every angle.  Nothing gives rise to an inference that it ever homed in on majority-minority districts\xe2\x80\x94or, for that matter, any particular set of districts.  Indeed, the fair reading of the Black Caucus\xe2\x80\x99s filings is that it was presenting illustrative evidence in particular districts\xe2\x80\x94majority-minority, minority-influence, and majority-white\xe2\x80\x94in an effort to make out a claim of statewide racial gerrymandering.  The fact that the Court now concludes that this is not a valid legal theory does not justify its repackaging the claims for a second round of litigation.</p><p>III.  Conclusion</p><p>                    Frankly, I do not know what to make of appellants\xe2\x80\x99 arguments.  They are pleaded with such opacity that, squinting hard enough, one can find them to contain just about anything.  This, the Court believes, justifies demanding that the District Court go back and squint harder, so that it may divine some new means of construingthe filings.  This disposition is based, it seems, on the implicit premise that plaintiffs only plead legally correct theories.  That is a silly premise.  We should not reward the practice of litigation by obfuscation, especially when we are dealing with a well-established legal claim that numerous plaintiffs have successfully brought in the past.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Amended Complaint and Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction in <i>Cromartie</i> v. <i>Hunt</i>, No. 4:96\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93104 (EDNC), Doc. 21, p.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the March 1997 redistricting plan, the Twelfth District and First District have boundaries which were drawn pursuant to a predominantly racial motivation,\xe2\x80\x9d which were \xe2\x80\x9cthe fruit of [earlier] racially gerrymandered plans\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even the complaint in <i>Shaw</i>, which established a cause of action for racial gerrymandering, displayed greater lucidity than appellants\xe2\x80\x99, alleging that defendants \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[ed] two amorphous districts which embody a scheme for segregation of voters by race in order to meet a racial quota\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctotally unrelated to considerations of compactness, contiguous, and geographic or jurisdictional communities of interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint and Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction and for Temporary Restraining Order in <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Barr</i>, No. 5:92\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93202 (EDNC), Doc. 1, pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p><p>                    The Court seems to acknowledge that appellants never focused their racial-gerrymandering claims on Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s majority-minority districts.  While remanding to consider whether the majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered, it admits that plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cbasically claim that the State, in adding so many new minority voters to majority-minority districts (<i>and to others</i>), went too far.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 3 (emphasis added).  It further concedes that appellants \xe2\x80\x9crelied heavily upon statewide evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and that they \xe2\x80\x9calso sought to prove that the use of race to draw the boundaries of the majority-minority districts affected the boundaries of other districts as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.</p><p>                    The only reason I see for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s selection of the majority-minority districts as the relevant set of districts for the District Court to consider on remand is that this was the set chosen by appellants after losing on the claim they actually presented in the District Court.  By playing along with appellants\xe2\x80\x99 choose-your-own-adventure style of litigation, willingly turning back the page every time a strategic decision leads to a dead-end, the Court discourages careful litigation and punishes defendants who are denied both notice and repose.

These consolidated cases are yet another installment in the \xe2\x80\x9cdisastrous misadventure\xe2\x80\x9d of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s voting rights jurisprudence.  <i>Id., </i>at 893.  We have somehow arrived at a place where the parties agree that Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts should be fine-tuned to achieve some \xe2\x80\x9coptimal\xe2\x80\x9d result with respect to black voting power; the only dis-agreement is about what <i>percentage</i> of blacks should be placed in those optimized districts.

I write only to point out that, as this case painfully illustrates, our jurisprudence in this area continues to be infected with error.</p><p>I</p><p>                    The Alabama Legislature faced a difficult situation in its 2010 redistricting efforts.  It began with racially segregated district maps that were inherited from previous decades.  The maps produced by the 2001 redistricting contained 27 majority-black House districts and 8 majority-black Senate districts\xe2\x80\x94both at the time they weredrawn, App. to Juris. Statement 47\xe2\x80\x9348, and at the time of the 2010 Census,  App. 103\xe2\x80\x93108.   Many of these majority-black districts were over 70% black when they were drawn in 2001, and even more were over 60% black.  App. to Juris. Statement 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  Even after the 2010 Census, the population remained above 60% black in the majority of districts.  App. 103\xe2\x80\x93108.</p><p>                    Under the 2006 amendments to \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Alabama was also under a federal command to avoid drawing new districts that would \xe2\x80\x9chave the effect of diminishing the ability\xe2\x80\x9d of black voters \xe2\x80\x9cto elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710304(b).  To comply with \xc2\xa75, the legislature adopted a policy of maintaining the same percentage of black voters within each of those districts as existed in the 2001 plans.  See <i>ante,</i> at 16.  This, the districting committee thought, would preserve the ability of black voters to elect the same number of preferred candidates.  App. to Juris. Statement 174\xe2\x80\x93175.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) apparently agreed.  Acting under its authority to administer \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, the DOJ precleared Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s plans.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  <i>Id.,</i>at 9.</p><p>                    Appellants\xe2\x80\x94including the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and the Alabama Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x94saw matters differently.  They sued Alabama, and on appeal they argue that the State\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting plans are racially gerrymandered because many districts are highly packed with black voters.  According to appellants, black voters would have more voting power if they were spread over more districts rather than concentrated in the same number of districts as in previous decades.  The DOJ has entered the fray in support of appellants, arguing that the State\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting maps fail strict scrutiny because the State focused too heavily on a single racial characteristic\xe2\x80\x94the number of black voters in majority-minority districts\xe2\x80\x94which potentially resulted in impermissible packing of black voters.</p><p>                    Like the DOJ, today\xe2\x80\x99s majority sides with appellants, faulting Alabama for choosing the wrong percentage of blacks in the State\xe2\x80\x99s majority-black districts, or at least for arriving at that percentage using the wrong reasoning.  In doing so, the Court\xe2\x80\x94along with appellants and the DOJ\xe2\x80\x94exacerbates a problem many years in the making.  It seems fitting, then, to trace that history here.  The practice of creating highly packed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94majority-minority districts is the product of our erroneous jurisprudence, which created a system that forces States to segregate voters into districts based on the color of their skin.  Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s current legislative districts have their genesis in the \xe2\x80\x9cmax-black\xe2\x80\x9d policy that the DOJ itself applied to \xc2\xa75 throughout the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s and early 2000\xe2\x80\x99s.  The 2006 amendments to \xc2\xa75 then effectively locked in place Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s max-black districts that were established during the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s and 2000\xe2\x80\x99s.  These three problems\xe2\x80\x94a jurisprudence requiring segregated districts, the distortion created by the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s max-black policy, and the ossifying effects of the 2006 amendments\xe2\x80\x94are the primary culprits in this case, not Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting policy. Nor does this Court have clean hands.</p><p>II</p><p>                    This Court created the current system of race-based redistricting by adopting expansive readings of \xc2\xa72 and \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act.  Both \xc2\xa72 and \xc2\xa75 prohibit States from implementing voting laws that \xe2\x80\x9cden[y] or abridg[e] the right to vote on account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710304(a), 10301(a).  But both provisions extend to only certain types of voting laws: any \xe2\x80\x9cvoting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  As I have previously explained, the terms \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98standard, practice, or procedure\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. refer only to practices that affect minor-ity citizens\xe2\x80\x99 access to the ballot,\xe2\x80\x9d such as literacy tests.  <i>Holder</i>, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 914 (opinion concurring in judgment).  They do not apply to \xe2\x80\x9c[d]istricting systems and electoral mechanisms that may affect the \xe2\x80\x98weight\xe2\x80\x99 given to a ballot duly cast and counted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Yet this Court has adopted far-reaching interpretations of both provisions, holding that they encompass legislative redistricting and other actions that might \xe2\x80\x9cdilute\xe2\x80\x9d the strength of minority votes.  See generally <i>Thornburg</i> v. <i>Gingles</i>,478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30 (1986) (\xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9cvote dilution\xe2\x80\x9d challenge to legislative districting plan); see also <i>Allen</i> v. <i>State Bd. of Elections</i>,393 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544\xe2\x80\x93587 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p><p>                    The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72 and \xc2\xa75 have resulted in challenge after challenge to the drawing of voting districts.  See, <i>e.g., Bartlett</i> v. <i>Strickland</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2009); <i>League of United Latin American Citizens</i> v. <i>Perry</i>,548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399 (2006); <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461 (2003); <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Bossier Parish School Bd.</i>,528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320 (2000) (<i>Bossier II\xc2\xa0</i>); <i>Hunt</i> v. <i>Cromartie</i>,526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 541 (1999); <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Bossier Parish School Bd.</i>,520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471 (1997) (<i>Bossier I\xc2\xa0</i>); <i>Bush</i> v. <i>Vera</i>,517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 952 (1996); <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Hunt</i>,517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 899 (1996) (<i>Shaw II\xc2\xa0</i>); <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900 (1995); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hays</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737 (1995); <i>Holder</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>De Grandy</i>,512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 997 (1994); <i>Growe</i> v. <i>Emison</i>,507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25 (1993); <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630 (1993) (<i>Shaw I\xc2\xa0</i>); <i>Voinovich</i> v. <i>Quilter</i>,507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146 (1993).</p><p>                    The consequences have been as predictable and as they are unfortunate.  In pursuing \xe2\x80\x9cundiluted\xe2\x80\x9d or maximized minority voting power, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have devised a remedial mechanism that encourages federal courts to segregate voters into racially designated districts to ensure minority electoral success.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Holder</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 892 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Section 5, the provision at issue here, has been applied to require States that redistrict to maintain the number of pre-existing majority-minority districts, in which minority voters make up a large enough portion of the population to be able to elect their candidate of choice.  See, <i>e.g., Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 923\xe2\x80\x93927 (rejecting the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s policy of requiring States to increase the number of majority-black districts because maintaining the same number of majority-black districts would not violate \xc2\xa75).</p><p>                    In order to maintain these \xe2\x80\x9cracially \xe2\x80\x98safe burroughs,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d States or courts must perpetually \xe2\x80\x9cdivid[e] the country into electoral districts along racial lines\xe2\x80\x94an enterprise of segregating the races into political homelands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Holder</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 905 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).

And, as predicted, the States\xe2\x80\x99 compliance efforts have \xe2\x80\x9cembroil[ed] the courts in a lengthy process of attempting to undo, or at least to minimize, the damage wrought by the system we created.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 905<i>.  </i>It is this fateful system that has produced these cases.</p><p>III</p><p>A</p><p>                    In tandem with our flawed jurisprudence, the DOJ has played a significant role in creating Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s current redistricting problem.  It did so by enforcing \xc2\xa75 in a manner that required States, including Alabama, to create supermajority-black voting districts or face denial ofpre-clearance.</p><p>                    The details of this so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmax-black\xe2\x80\x9d policy were highlighted in federal court during Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s 1991 congressional redistricting.  See <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>Miller</i>, 864 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1354, 1360\xe2\x80\x931361 (SD Ga. 1994).  On behalf of the Black Caucus of the Georgia General Assembly, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) submitted a redistricting proposal to the Georgia Legislature that became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cmax-black plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1360.  The ACLU\xe2\x80\x99s map created two new \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d districts and \xe2\x80\x9cfurther maximized black voting strength by pushing the percentage of black voters within its majority-black districts as high as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1361 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>                    The DOJ denied several of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s proposals on the ground that they did not include enough majority-black districts.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1366.  The plan it finally approved was substantially similar to the ACLU\xe2\x80\x99s max-black proposal, <i>id.,</i> at 1364\xe2\x80\x931366, creating three majority-black districts, with total black populations of 56.63%, 62.27%, and 64.07%, <i>id.,</i> at 1366, and n. 12.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p><i> </i>Georgia was not the only State subject to the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s maximization policy.  North Carolina, for example, submitted a congressional redistricting plan after the 1990 Census, but the DOJ rejected it because it did not create a new majority-minority district, and thus \xe2\x80\x9cappear[ed] to minimize minority voting strength.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shaw </i>v. <i>Barr</i>, 808 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 461, 463\xe2\x80\x93464 (EDNC 1992) (quoting Letter from John R. Dunne, Assistant Attorney General of N.\xc2\xa0C., Civil Rights Div., to Tiare B. Smiley, Special Deputy Attorney General of N.\xc2\xa0C. 4 (Dec. 18, 1991)).  The DOJ likewise pressured Louisiana to create a new majority-black district when the State sought approval of its congressional redistricting plan following the 1990 Census.  See <i>Hays </i>v. <i>Louisiana</i>, 839 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1188, 1190 (WD La. 1993), va-cated on other grounds by <i>Louisiana </i>v. <i>Hays</i>,512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1230 (1994).</p><p>                    Although we eventually rejected the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s max-black policy, see <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 924\xe2\x80\x93927, much damage to the States\xe2\x80\x99 congressional and legislative district maps had already been done.  In those States that had enacted districting plans in accordance with the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s max-black policy, the prohibition on retrogression under \xc2\xa75 meant that the legislatures were effectively required to maintain those max-black plans during any subsequent redistricting.  That is what happened in Alabama.</p><p>B</p><p>                    Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 redistricting plans were modeled after max-black-inspired plans that the State put in place in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s under the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s max-black policy.  See generally <i>Kelley </i>v. <i>Bennett</i>, 96 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1301 (MD Ala. 2000), vacated on other grounds by <i>Sinkfield</i> v. <i>Kelley</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 28 (2000) (<i>per curiam</i>).</p><p>                    Following the 1990 Census, the Alabama Legislature began redrawing its state legislative districts.  After several proposals failed in the legislature, a group of plaintiffs sued, and the State entered into a consent decree agreeing to use the \xe2\x80\x9cReed-Buskey\xe2\x80\x9d plan.  96 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1309.  The primary designer of this plan was Dr. Joe Reed, the current chairman of appellant Alabama Democratic Conference.  According to Dr. Reed, the previous plan from the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s was not \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d because it did not achieve the number of \xe2\x80\x9cblack-preferred\xe2\x80\x9d representatives that was proportionate to the percentage of blacks in the population.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1310.  And because of the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s max-black policy, \xe2\x80\x9cit was widely assumed that a state could (and, according to DOJ, had to) draw district lines with the primary intent of maximizing election of black officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1310, n.\xc2\xa014.  \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Reed thus set out to maximize the number of black representatives and senators elected to the legislature by maximizing the number of black-majority districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1310<i>.  </i>Illustrating this strategy, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s letter to the DOJ seeking preclearance of the Reed-Buskey plan \xe2\x80\x9cemphasize[d] the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate creation of enough majority-black districts to assure nearly proportional representation in the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, n.\xc2\xa014 and boasted that the plan had created four new majority-black districts and two additional majority-black Senate districts.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    Dr. Reed populated these districts with a percentage of black residents that achieved an optimal middle ground\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9chappy medium\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94between too many and too few.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1311.  Twenty-three of the twenty-seven majority-black House districts were between 60% and 70% black under Reed\xe2\x80\x99s plan, <i>id.,</i> at 1311, and Senate District 26\xe2\x80\x94one of the districts at issue today\xe2\x80\x94was pushed from 65% to 70% black.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1315.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  A District Court struck down several districts created in the Reed-Buskey plan as unconstitutionally based on race.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1324.  This Court reversed, however, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not live in the gerrymandered districts.  <i>Sinkfield</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.</p><p>                    The Reed-Buskey plan thus went into effect and provided the template for the State\xe2\x80\x99s next redistricting efforts in 2001.  See <i>Montiel </i>v. <i>Davis</i>, 215 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1279, 1282 (SD Ala. 2002).  The 2001 maps maintained the same number of majority-black districts as the Reed-Buskey plan had created: 27 House districts and 8 Senate districts.  <i>Ibid</i>.  And \xe2\x80\x9cto maintain the same relative percentages of black voters in those districts,\xe2\x80\x9d the legislature \xe2\x80\x9credrew the districts by shifting more black voters into the majority-black districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Juris. Statement 4.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s letters requesting preclearance of the 2001 plans boasted that the maps maintained the same number of majority-black districts and the same (or higher) percentages of black voters within those districts, other than \xe2\x80\x9cslight reductions\xe2\x80\x9d that were \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to satisfy other legitimate, nondiscriminatory redistricting considerations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from William H.

In other words, the State could not retrogress from the previous plan if it wished to comply with \xc2\xa75.</p><p>IV</p><p>                    Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s quandary as it attempted to redraw its legislative districts after 2010 was exacerbated by the 2006 amendments to \xc2\xa75.  Those amendments created an inflexible definition of \xe2\x80\x9cretrogression\xe2\x80\x9d that Alabama understandably took as requiring it to maintain the same percentages of minority voters in majority-minority districts.  The amendments thus provide the last piece of the puzzle that explains why the State sought to maintain the same percentages of blacks in each majority-black district.</p><p>                    Congress passed the 2006 amendments in response to our attempt to define \xe2\x80\x9cretrogression\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461.  Prior to that decision, practically any reapportionment change could \xe2\x80\x9cbe deemed \xe2\x80\x98retrogressive\xe2\x80\x99 under our vote dilution jurisprudence by a court inclined to find it so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bossier I</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 490\xe2\x80\x93491 (Thomas, J., concurring).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] court could strike down <i>any</i> reapportionment plan, either because it did not include enough majority-minority districts or because it did (and thereby diluted the minority vote in the remaining districts).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 491<i>.  </i>Our \xc2\xa75 jurisprudence thus \xe2\x80\x9cinevitably force[d] the courts to make political judgments regarding which type of apportionment best serves supposed minority interests\xe2\x80\x94judgments courts are ill equipped to make.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 492<i>.</i></p><p>                    We tried to pull the courts and the DOJ away from making these sorts of judgments in <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>Ashcroft</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Insofar as \xc2\xa75 applies to the drawing of voting districts, we held that a District Court had wrongly re-jected Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s reapportionment plan, and we adopted a retrogression standard that gave States flexibility in determining the percentage of black voters in each district.  <i>Id.,</i> at 479\xe2\x80\x93481.  As we explained, \xe2\x80\x9ca State may choose to create a certain number of \xe2\x80\x98safe\xe2\x80\x99 districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 480.  Alternatively, \xe2\x80\x9ca State may choose to create a greater number of districts in which it is likely\xe2\x80\x94although perhaps not quite as likely as under the benchmark plan\xe2\x80\x94that minority voters will be able to elect candidates of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  We noted that \xe2\x80\x9cspreading out minority voters over a greater number of districts creates more districts in which minority voters may have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice,\xe2\x80\x9d even if success is not guaranteed, and even if it diminished the chance of electing a representative in some districts.  <i>Id.,</i> at 481.  Thus, States would be permitted to make judgments about how best to prevent retrogression in a minority group\xe2\x80\x99s voting power, including assessing the range of appropriate minority population percentages within each district.  <i>Id.,</i> at 480\xe2\x80\x93481.</p><p>                    In response, Congress amended \xc2\xa75 and effectively overruled <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>Ashcroft</i>.  See120Stat.577.  The 2006 amendments added subsection (b), which provides:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cAny voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or color  .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. this section.\xe2\x80\x9d52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710304(b).  See \xc2\xa75,120Stat.577.</p><p>Thus, any change that has the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cdiminishing the ability\xe2\x80\x9d of a minority group to \xe2\x80\x9celect their preferred candidate of choice\xe2\x80\x9d is retrogressive.</p><p>                    Some were rightly worried that the 2006 amendments would impose too much inflexibility on the States as they sought to comply with \xc2\xa75.  Richard Pildes, who argued on behalf of the Alabama Democratic Conference in these cases, testified in congressional hearings on the 2006 amendments.  He explained that <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>Ashcroft</i> \xe2\x80\x9crecognizes room .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for some modest flexibility in Section 5,\xe2\x80\x9d and warned that if \xe2\x80\x9cCongress overturns <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>Ashcroft</i>, it will make even this limited amount of flexibility illegal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearing on the Continuing Need for Section 5 Pre-Clearance before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Congress, 2d Sess., pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (2006).  Pildes also observed that the proposed standard of \xe2\x80\x9cno \xe2\x80\x98diminished ability to elect\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has a rigidity and a mechanical quality that can lock into place minority districts in the south at populations that do not serve minority voters\xe2\x80\x99 interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 12.  Although this testimony saysnothing about how \xc2\xa75 ought to be interpreted, it tells us that the Alabama Democratic Conference\xe2\x80\x99s own attorney believes that the State was subject to a \xe2\x80\x9crigi[d]\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x9cmechanical\xe2\x80\x9d standard in determining the number ofblack voters that must be maintained in a majority-black district.</p><p>V</p><p>                    All of this history explains Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances when it attempted to redistrict after the 2010 Census.  The legislature began with the max-black district maps that it inherited from the days of Reed-Buskey.  Using these inherited maps, combined with population data from the 2010 Census, many of the State\xe2\x80\x99s majority-black House and Senate districts were between 60% and 70% black, and some were over 70%.  App. to Juris. Statement 103\xe2\x80\x93108.  And the State was prohibited from drawing new districts that would \xe2\x80\x9chave the effect of diminishing the ability\xe2\x80\x9d of blacks \xe2\x80\x9cto elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa710304(b).  The legislature thus adopted a policy of maintaining the same number of majority-black districts and roughly the same percentage of blacks within each of those districts.  See <i>ante,</i> at 16.</p><p>                    The majority faults the State for taking this approach.  I do not pretend that Alabama is blameless when it comes to its sordid history of racial politics.  But, today the State is not the one that is culpable.  Its redistricting effort was indeed tainted, but it was tainted by our voting rights jurisprudence and the uses to which the Voting Rights Act has been put.  Long ago, the DOJ and special-interest groups like the ACLU hijacked the Act, and they have been using it ever since to achieve their vision of maximized black electoral strength, often at the expense of the voters they purport to help.  States covered by \xc2\xa75 have been whipsawed, first required to create \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d majority-black districts, then told not to \xe2\x80\x9cdiminis[h]\xe2\x80\x9d the ability to elect, and now told they have been too rigid in preventing any \xe2\x80\x9cdiminishing\xe2\x80\x9d of the ability to elect.  <i>Ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.</p><p>                    Worse, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s solution to the appellants\xe2\x80\x99 gerrymandering claims requires States to analyze race even <i>more</i> exhaustively, not less, by accounting for black voter registration and turnout statistics.  <i>Ante,</i> at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s command to analyze black voting patterns en route to adopting the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d racial quota does nothing to ease the conflict between our color-blind Constitution and the \xe2\x80\x9cconsciously segregated districting system\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has required in the name of equality. <i> Holder</i>, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 907.
