That statute, by its terms, does not become effective until the 1976 elections, and intervening special elections to fill vacancies, if any, will be held in the districts involved as constituted on January 1, 1975.  Rather than render an unnecessary judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="936">Page 422 U. S. 936</a></p><p> on the validity of the constitutional views expressed by the District Court in this case, which we do not undertake to do at this time, we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case to that court for reconsideration in light of the recent Texas reapportionment legislation and for dismissal if the case is or becomes moot.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLA took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
