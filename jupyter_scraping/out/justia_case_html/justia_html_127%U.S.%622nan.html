Both parties appealed from the final decree.  The case is stated in the opinion.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The bill in this case was filed on the 25th of October, 1883, by Edward A. Rollins, of Philadelphia, against Zenas C. Robbins, of the City of Washington, to recover $122,000, with interest, and, on the failure of Robbins to pay the same, to have certain property in Washington, of which Rollins claims to be mortgagee in possession, sold to satisfy said claim.  Rollins, the complainant, claims title to the matter in suit, by purchase in November, 1880, from one Keyser, the receiver of the German-American Bank, and said bank derived title from the German-American Savings Bank of Washington by purchase in October, 1877, and the latter acquired their principal interest in the matter from John Hitz, William F. Mattingly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 127 U. S. 623</a></p><p> and Charles E. Prentiss by deeds dated in May and June, 1875 -- the said Hitz, Mattingly, and Prentiss having procured the said interest for the said savings bank in the manner hereafter mentioned.  The transactions out of which the controversy took its rise were as follows:</p>\n<p>In 1873, the defendant Zenas C. Robbins was in possession of the property known as the "federal Building," situated on the southeast corner of Seventh Street and F Street Northwest in the City of Washington, immediately opposite the Post Office Department building, being 100 feet on Seventh Street, and 129 feet 3 1/2 inches on F Street.  Part of this property, namely, the 100 feet front on Seventh Street, and 40 feet deep on F Street, he owned in fee simple:  the rest of it, 89 feet 3 1/2 inches on F Street, and 100 feet deep, lying immediately in rear of the first part, he held by leases, with contracts giving him the privilege of purchasing the fee at any time during the continuance of the leases.  This leasehold portion was divided into four lots fronting on F Street, and each running back from F Street 100 feet in depth, and he had a separate lease and contract for privilege of purchase on each, the rent of each being $60 per month, amounting to $2,880 per annum for all four lots, and the purchase prices at which he had the privilege of purchasing the lots, were, respectively, $8,000, $12,000, $12,000, and $10,000, the whole amounting to $42,000.  The lot owned by Robbins in fee, fronting on Seventh and F Streets, was encumbered by two mortgages, or deeds of trust in the nature of mortgages, one for $10,000, held by one Daniel Low, and the other for $25,000, held by the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of New Jersey.  There was also a judgment lien of $10,500 on the leasehold property.</p>\n<p>In or about August, 1873, the Board of Public Works of the City of Washington cut down the grade of the streets around Mr. Robbins\' corner several feet, and rendered the buildings on his property somewhat insecure.  The Board, pretending that they were in danger of falling, in October, 1873, ordered them to be taken down, and Robbins remonstrated, and some arrangement was made for strengthening them.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="624">Page 127 U. S. 624</a></p><p> Robbins claimed damages against the city for the injury done to his property, and an award of $4,098 was afterwards made and paid to the bank after it came into possession of the property as hereafter mentioned.</p>\n<p>On the 10th of September, 1873, Hitz, the president of the German-American Savings Bank and in its interest, made a contract with Robbins to purchase the whole property, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<p>"WASHINGTON, D.C. September 10, 1873"</p>\n<p>"<em>Agreement between Zenas C. Robbins and John Hitz," </em></p>\n<p>"<em>both of the City of Washington, D.C." </em></p>\n<p>"The said Robbins does hereby agree to sell unto the said Hitz, his heirs or assigns, the real estate at the northwest corner of square numbered four hundred and fifty-six (456), in the City of Washington, D.C., for the sum of one hundred and seventy thousand dollars, said property fronting one hundred (100) feet on 7th Street, and one hundred and twenty-nine (129) feet four and one-half (4 1/2) inches, more or less, on F Street.  Forty (40) feet on F Street at the corner of 7th Street, by one hundred (100) feet, more or less, in depth, is owned by said Robbins in fee.  Twenty (20) feet on F Street, by one hundred (100) feet in depth, more or less, is a leasehold, with privilege of purchase, for $10,000.00.  Twenty-three (23) feet on F Street by one hundred (100) feet in depth, more or less, is a leasehold, with like privilege, for $8,000.00.  Twenty three (23) feet on F Street, by like depth, is leasehold, with like privilege, for $12,000.00.  Twenty-three (23) feet four and one-half (4 1/2) inches on F Street, by like depth, is leasehold, with like privilege, for $12,000.00.  Said sale is to date as October 1, 1873."</p>\n<p>"All taxes upon said property are to be paid by said Robbins, including the taxes for the year ending June 30, 1873, and all rents up to October 1, 1873, are to be received by him, provided none of said rents are payable in advance.  All rents due on said leasehold property up to said October 1st, and all interest on encumbrances, are to be paid by said Robbins. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="625">Page 127 U.

C. ROBBINS [Seal]"</p>\n<p>"JOHN HITZ     [Seal]"</p>\n<p>Robbins, in his testimony, says that immediately after signing this contract, he went to Virginia to visit some friends, and did not return until the 1st of November, 1873.  He says that he then found the bank in possession of all the property, and proceeds as follows:</p>\n<p>"A few days after my return from Virginia, Mr. Hitz came to me and made me this proposition:  he said that if I preferred to change the sale into a lease of the property, perhaps we could make a new negotiation, and he made this proposition:  that he and his associates, Mr. Mattingly and Mr. Prentiss, would take the property on a ten years\' lease; would pay the purchase money under the four leases; would pay the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="626">Page 127 U. S. 626</a></p><p> encumbrances of record, amounting to $35,000; would pay me $600 a month during the term of the lease; pay all the taxes that might be assessed on the fee simple property and leasehold estates, and would relieve me of all care and responsibility, expense, and charges of every name, nature, and description relating to the fee simple and the leasehold estates during the whole term of the lease, provided I would embody in the lease the privilege of the purchase of my fee simple property by the lessees for the sum of $93,000 at any time during the term of the lease.  Another provision of the contract was he gave me the option of a conveyance of the four leasehold estates by paying the several amounts of purchase money named in the leases, with eight percent interest from the date of payment."</p>\n<p>Thereupon the first agreement was abandoned and the following agreement and lease, upon which the present rights and obligations of the parties  depend, was entered into.  We set it out at large because it is the foundation of the whole controversy in the present suit, and almost every part of it is important in settling the rights of the litigants:</p>\n<p>"This indenture, made this 25th day of October, A.D. 1873, by and between Zenas C.

S. 631</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If we analyze this document, we find that, like the first agreement, it treats of the entire property, freehold as well as leasehold, and instead of providing for an absolute sale, transfers the leases of the leasehold, with privilege of purchase, and leases the fee simple part, with like privilege of purchase, the consideration, as before, being the same amount, $170,000 -- namely $93,000 for the lot held by Robbins in fee simple, $35,000 to be paid to clear off the mortgages, and $42,000 to be paid to the owners of the four leasehold lots.</p>\n<p>Looking at the agreement in parts, we find:</p>\n<p>1st.  Robbins, for and in consideration of the rents, covenants, and agreements to be paid and performed by the parties of the second part, assigns to them the leases of the four leasehold lots, with all the rights and privileges conferred thereby, and leases to them the lot held by him in fee simple for the term of ten years at a rent of $600 per month.</p>\n<p>2d.  The parties of the second part, on their side, covenant and agree to pay the said monthly rent above stipulated, and the encumbrances of record against the said property, or any portion thereof, specifying the two deeds of trust for $10,000 and $25,000, and further agree that they will exercise the several privileges of purchasing in fee simple the leasehold lots, by paying the several amounts provided in the leases -- namely [amounting in the aggregate to $42,000], and further to pay all taxes and assessments to be levied on the property or any portion thereof.</p>\n<p>Suppose the paper had ended here, could there have been a doubt that the payments to be made by the parties of the second part -- namely the reserved rent, the $35,000 for clearing off the mortgages, and the $42,000 for buying in the fee (for themselves) of the leasehold property -- constituted the consideration of the lease and assignment made to them by Robbins in the first clause?  The parties evidently regarded the privilege of purchasing the four leased lots on F Street for $42,000 as a valuable one.  It does not seem at all improbable that Robbins should demand, and that the parties of the second part should be willing to give, $35,000 (the amount of his mortgages) for this privilege.  This would make the four </p><p><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 127 U. S. 632</a></p><p> lots cost them $77,000.  If Robbins\' 4,000 square feet on Seventh Street were worth $93,000, it is not unreasonable to suppose the 8,900 square feet fronting on F Street, and lying in the rear of the other, and almost necessary to it, should be worth $77,000.  The remaining parts of the agreement are not in conflict with the construction suggested.  In the next place,</p>\n<p>3d.  Robbins gives to the parties of the second part the privilege of purchasing his fee simple lot at any time during the ten-years lease for the sum of $93,000.</p>\n<p>4th.  The agreement then provides that Robbins shall pay all interest, rents, taxes, and assessments up to the 1st of November, 1873, and it was further agreed that if the second party should have to pay any sums of money which Robbins, under the agreement, ought to pay, they should be a lien on the property.</p>\n<p>5th.  It was provided that if any of the buildings should fall in repairing, etc., the second party should be released from the contract, and refunded the amounts paid by them.</p>\n<p>6th.  It was agreed that if the second party should not exercise their option of buying Robbins\' fee simple property, he should, for one year after the expiration of the ten-years term, have the privilege of buying them out by refunding all payments they might have made.</p>\n<p>Now none of these provisional exigencies took place.  The parties of the second part did not exercise their option of buying Robbins\' fee simple property, nor did he exercise his option of buying them out, and the buildings never fell.  In all other respects, both parties performed their respective parts of the agreement.  Robbins paid all interest, taxes, rents, etc., up to November 1, 1873, and paid off the $10,500 judgment lien on the leasehold property, and the parties of the second part and their successors in interest, the German-American Savings Bank and the German-American National Bank, paid the rent of $600 per month, paid off the two mortgages or deeds of trust, amounting together to $35,000, and all interest thereon, paid the rents of the leasehold lots, and bought in the fee simple thereof from the owners at the stipulated amount of $42,000.  So that at the close of the transaction, the parties </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 127 U. S. 633</a></p><p> stood as follows:  Robbins owned his old fee simple lot on the corner of Seventh and F Streets and the complainant, who purchased the interest of the other parties, owned the four lots on F Street.</p>\n<p>This is the whole case, and we can hardly entertain a doubt respecting the rights of the parties.  We think that the court below was in error in sustaining and allowing against Robbins the complainant\'s claim for the payment of the two mortgages or deeds of trust and subrogating him to the rights of the mortgagees, Low and the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company.  The deed of subrogation from the latter company to the German-American Savings Bank was entirely wrong and unauthorized, and should be vacated and declared void.  Had a cross-bill been filed for that purpose, it should have been so decreed.  Remedy can be had by an original bill.</p>\n<p>The contract contains no stipulation whatever that the parties of the second part were, in any event, to have a return of the $35,000 paid in lifting the two mortgages, except in the event of Robbins\' availing himself of his option to have a conveyance of the whole property -- an event which never took place.  We cannot interpolate such a stipulation.  It is not implied by anything that appears on the face of the contract, nor does anything in the surrounding circumstances authorize or require a construction of the contract that would import such a stipulation into it.  The first agreement made with Hitz seems to us to have an entirely opposite effect.</p>\n<p>On all the other points raised in the case, we think that the views of the court below were correct.</p>\n<p><em>The decision is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint, with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
