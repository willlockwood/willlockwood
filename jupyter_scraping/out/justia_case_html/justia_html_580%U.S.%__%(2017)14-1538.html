One of the kit\xe2\x80\x99s five components, an enzyme known as the <i>Taq </i>polymerase, was manufactured by Life Technologies in the United States and then shipped to the United Kingdom, where the four other components were made, for combination there.  When Life Technologies began selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use, Promega sued, claiming that patent infringement liability was triggered under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) of the Patent Act, which prohibits the supply from the United States of \xe2\x80\x9call or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention\xe2\x80\x9d for combination abroad.  The jury returned a verdict for Promega, but the District Court granted Life Technologies\xe2\x80\x99 motion for judgment as a matter of law, holding that \xc2\xa7271(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9call or a substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d did not encompass the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention.  The Federal Circuit reversed.  It determined that a single important component could constitute a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of the components of an invention under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) and found the <i>Taq</i> polymerase to be such a component.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention for manufacture abroad does not give rise to \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) liability.

Although the Patent Act itself does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d and the term\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning may refer either to qualitative importance or to quantitatively large size, the statutory context points to a quantitative meaning.  Neighboring words \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d convey a quantitative meaning, and nothing in the neighboring text points to a qualitative interpretation.  More-over, a qualitative reading would render the modifying phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof the components\xe2\x80\x9d unnecessary the first time it is used in \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).

And Promega\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to adopt an analytical framework that accounts for both the components\xe2\x80\x99 quantitative and qualitative aspects is likely to complicate rather than aid the factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s review.

This conclusion is reinforced by \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and structure.  Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to the plural \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents,\xe2\x80\x9d indicating that multiple components make up the substantial portion.  Reading \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) to cover any single component would also leave little room for \xc2\xa7271(f)(2), which refers to \xe2\x80\x9cany component,\xe2\x80\x9d and would undermine \xc2\xa7271(f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s express reference to a single component \xe2\x80\x9cespecially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  The better reading allows the two provisions to work in tandem and gives each provision its unique application.

Consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent, a supplier may be liable under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) for supplying from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of the invention or under \xc2\xa7271(f)(2) for supplying a single component if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity.  But, as here, when a product is made abroad and all components but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad, the activity is outside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.

We hold that a single component does not constitute a substantial portion of the components that can give rise to liability under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).

Reissue Patent No. RE 37,984, claims a toolkit for genetic testing.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The kit is used to take small samples of genetic material\xe2\x80\x94in the form of nucleotide sequences that make up the molecule deoxyribonu-cleic acid (commonly referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cDNA\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94and then synthesize multiple copies of a particular nucleotide sequence.  This process of copying, known as amplification, generates DNA profiles that can be used by law enforcement agencies for forensic identification and by clinical and research institutions around the world.  For purposes of this litigation, the parties agree that the kit covered by the Tautz patent contains five components: (1) a mixture of primers that mark the part of the DNA strand to be copied; (2) nucleotides for forming replicated strands of DNA; (3) an enzyme known as <i>Taq</i> polymerase; (4) a buffer solution for the amplification; and (5) control DNA.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent Promega Corporation was the exclusive licensee of the Tautz patent.  Petitioner Life Technologies Corporation manufactured genetic testing kits.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  During the timeframe relevant here, Promega sublicensed the Tautz patent to Life Technologies for the manufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement fields worldwide.  Life Technologies manufactured all but one component of the kits in the United Kingdom.  It manufactured that component\xe2\x80\x94the <i>Taq</i> polymerase\xe2\x80\x94in the United States.  Life Technologies shipped the <i>Taq</i> polymerase to its United Kingdom facility, where it was combined with the other four components of the kit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four years into the agreement, Promega sued Life Technologies on the grounds that Life Technologies had infringed the patent by selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use to clinical and research markets.  As relevant here, Promega alleged that Life Technologies\xe2\x80\x99 supply of the <i>Taq</i> polymerase from the United States to its United Kingdom manufacturing facilities triggered liability under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">At trial, the parties disputed the scope of \xc2\xa7271(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against supplying all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention from the United States for combination abroad.

Life Technologies and the United States argue that the text of \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) establishes a quantitative threshold, and that the threshold must be greater than one.  Promega defends the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute, arguing that a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of the components includes a single component if that component is sufficiently important to the invention.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We look first to the text of the statute.  <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Cloer</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6).  The Patent Act itself does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d and so we turn to its ordinary meaning.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Here we find little help.  All agree the term is ambiguous and, taken in isolation, might refer to an important portion or to a large portion.  Brief for Petitioners 16; Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12.  \xe2\x80\x9cSubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d as it is commonly understood, may refer either to qualitative importance or to quantitatively large size.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2280 (defs. 1c, 2c) (1981) (Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third) (\xe2\x80\x9cimportant, essential,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable in amount, value, or worth\xe2\x80\x9d); 17 Oxford English Dictionary<i> </i>67 (defs. 5a, 9) (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, constitutes, or involves an essential part, point, or feature; essential, material,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cOf ample or considerable amount, quantity, or dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The context in which \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d appears in the statute, however, points to a quantitative meaning here.  Its neighboring terms are the first clue.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> United States</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 285,\n294 (2008)\n.  Both \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d convey a quantitative meaning.  \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x9d means the entire quantity, without reference to relative importance.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third 54 (defs. 1a, 2a, 3) (\xe2\x80\x9cthat is the whole amount or quantity of,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cevery member or individual component of,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole number or sum of\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 OED 324 (def. 2) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe entire number of; the individual components of, without exception\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cPortion\xe2\x80\x9d likewise refers to some quantity less than all.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third 1768 (defs. 1, 3a) (\xe2\x80\x9can individual\xe2\x80\x99s part or share of something,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca part of a whole\xe2\x80\x9d); 12 OED 154, 155 (def. 1a, 5a) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe part (of anything) allotted or belonging to one person,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cA part of any whole\xe2\x80\x9d).  Conversely, there is nothing in the neighboring text to ground a qualitative interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d is modified by \xe2\x80\x9cof the components of a patented invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the supply of all or a substantial portion \xe2\x80\x9cof the components\xe2\x80\x9d of a patented invention that triggers liability for infringement.  But if \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d has a qualitative meaning, then the more natural way to write the opening clause of the provision would be to not reference \xe2\x80\x9cthe components\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  Instead, the opening clause of \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) could have triggered liability for the supply of \xe2\x80\x9call or a substantial portion of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a patented invention, where [its] components are uncombined in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  A qualitative reading would render the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof the components\xe2\x80\x9d unnecessary the first time it is used in \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).  Whenever possible, however, we should favor an interpretation that gives meaning to each statutory provision.  See <i>Hibbs</i> v. <i>Winn</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 88,\n101 (2004)\n.  Only the quantitative approach does so here.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of \xc2\xa7271(f)(1), is most reasonably read to connote a quantitative measure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Promega argues that a quantitative approach is too narrow, and invites the Court to instead adopt a \xe2\x80\x9ccase-specific approach\xe2\x80\x9d that would require a factfinder to decipher whether the components at issue are a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d under <i>either</i> a qualitative or quantitative test.  Brief for Respondent 17, 42.  We decline to do so.  Having determined the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous, our task is to resolve that ambiguity, not to compound it by tasking juries across the Nation with interpreting the meaning of the statute on an ad\xc2\xa0hoc basis.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Co.</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 337\n\xe2\x80\x93346 (1997).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a more general matter, moreover, we cannot accept Promega\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the Court adopt a different analytical framework entirely\xe2\x80\x94one that accounts for both the quantitative <i>and</i> qualitative aspects of the components.  Promega reads \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) to mean that the answer to whether a given portion of the components is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d depends not only on the number of components involved but also on their qualitative importance to the invention overall.  At first blush, there is some appeal to the idea that, in close cases, a subjective analysis of the qualitative importance of a component may help determine whether it is a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of the components of a patent.  But, for the reasons discussed above, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure provides little support for a qualitative interpretation of the term.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor would considering the qualitative importance of a component necessarily help resolve close cases.  To the contrary, it might just as easily complicate the factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s review.  Surely a great many components of an invention (if not every component) are important.  Few inventions, including the one at issue here, would function at all without any one of their components.  Indeed, Promega has not identified any component covered by the Tautz patent that would not satisfy Promega\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimportance\xe2\x80\x9d litmus test.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  How are courts\xe2\x80\x94or, for that matter, market participants attempting to avoid liability\xe2\x80\x94to determine the relative importance of the components of an invention?  Neither Promega nor the Federal Circuit offers an easy way to make this decision.  Accordingly, we conclude that a quantitative interpretation hews most closely to the text of the statute and provides an administrable construction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having determined that the term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a quantitative measurement, we must next decide whether, as a matter of law, a single component can ever constitute a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d so as to trigger liability under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).  The answer is no.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As before, we begin with the text of the statute.  Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d in the plural.  The section is targeted toward the supply of all or a substantial portion \xe2\x80\x9cof the <i>components</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9csuch <i>components</i>\xe2\x80\x9d are uncombined, in a manner that actively induces the combination of \xe2\x80\x9csuch <i>components</i>\xe2\x80\x9d outside the United States.  Text specifying a substantial portion of \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents,\xe2\x80\x9d plural, indicates that multiple components constitute the substantial portion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The structure of \xc2\xa7271(f) reinforces this reading.  Section 271(f)(2), which is \xc2\xa7271(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s companion provision, reads as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of theUnited States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reading \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) to refer to more than one component allows the two provisions to work in tandem.  Whereas \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) refers to \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents,\xe2\x80\x9d plural, \xc2\xa7271(f)(2) refers to \xe2\x80\x9cany component,\xe2\x80\x9d singular.  And, whereas \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) speaks to whether the components supplied by a party constitute a substantial portion of the components,\xc2\xa7271(f)(2) speaks to whether a party has supplied \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d noncommodity component \xe2\x80\x9cespecially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not disagree with the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s observation that the two provisions concern different scenarios.  See 773 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1354.  As this Court has previously observed, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7271(f)(1) and 271(f)(2) \xe2\x80\x9cdiffer, among other things, on the quantity of components that must be \xe2\x80\x98supplie[d] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the United States\xe2\x80\x99 for liability to attach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Microsoft Corp.</i> v. <i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437,\n454, n.\n16 (2007)\n.  But we do not draw the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion from these different but related provisions.  Reading \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) to cover <i>any</i> single component would not only leave little room for \xc2\xa7271(f)(2), but would also undermine \xc2\xa7271(f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s express reference to a single component \xe2\x80\x9cespecially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Our conclusion that \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) prohibits the supply of components, plural, gives each subsection its unique application.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Cloer</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op.,at 6).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Taken alone, \xc2\xa7271(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d might plausibly be read to encompass \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d in the singular.  See\n\n1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 (instructing that \xe2\x80\x9cwords importing the plural include the singular,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunless the context indicates otherwise\xe2\x80\x9d).  But \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and structure leave us to conclude that when Congress said \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents,\xe2\x80\x9d plural, it meant plural, and when it said \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent,\xe2\x80\x9d singular, it meant singular.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not today define how close to \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d of the components \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d must be.  We hold only that one component does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9call or a substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of a multicomponent invention under \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).  This is all that is required to resolve the question presented.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The history of \xc2\xa7271(f) bolsters our conclusion.  The Court has previously observed that Congress enacted \xc2\xa7271(f) in response to our decision in <i>Deepsouth Packing Co.</i> v. <i>Laitram Corp.</i>,\n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518 (1972)\n.  See <i>Microsoft Corp.</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444.  In <i>Deepsouth</i>, the Court determined that, under patent law as it existed at the time, it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot an infringement to make or use a patented product outside of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  406 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 527.  The new \xc2\xa7271(f) \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[ed] the definition of infringement to include supplying from the United States a patented invention\xe2\x80\x99s components,\xe2\x80\x9d as outlined in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2).  <i>Microsoft</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444\xe2\x80\x93445.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The effect of this provision was to fill a gap in the enforceability of patent rights by reaching components that are manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas and that were beyond the reach of the statute in its prior formulation.  Our ruling today comports with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  A supplier may be liable under\xc2\xa7271(f)(1) for supplying from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components (plural) of the invention, even when those components are combined abroad.  The same is true even for a single component under \xc2\xa7271(f)(2) if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity.  We are persuaded, however, that when as in this case a product is made abroad and all components but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad, this activity is outside the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We hold that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d in\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) has a quantitative, not a qualitative, meaning.  We hold further that \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) does not cover the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Tautz patent expired in 2015.
