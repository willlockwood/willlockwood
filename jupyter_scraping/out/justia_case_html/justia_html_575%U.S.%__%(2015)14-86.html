The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit on Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, <i>inter alia,</i> prohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant because of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice when the practice could be accommodated without undue hardship.  The EEOC prevailed in the District Court, but the Tenth Circuit reversed, awarding Abercrombie summary judgment on the ground that failure-to-accommodate liability attaches only when the applicant provides the employer with actual knowledge of his need for an accommodation.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0To prevail in a disparate-treatment claim, an applicant need show only that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s decision, not that the employer had knowledge of his need.  Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment provision requires Elauf to show that Abercrombie (1) \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to hire\xe2\x80\x9d her (2) \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d (3) \xe2\x80\x9c[her] religion\xe2\x80\x9d (including a religious practice).\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).

Thus, rather than imposing a knowledge standard, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) prohibits certain <i>motives</i>, regardless of the state of the actor\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge: An employer may not make an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions.  Title VII contains no knowledge requirement.  Furthermore, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of religion clearly indicates that failure-to-accommodate challenges can be brought as disparate-treatment claims.  And Title VII gives favored treatment to religious practices, rather than demanding that religious practices be treated no worse than other practices.

Respondent Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., operates several lines of clothing stores, each with its own \xe2\x80\x9cstyle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consistent with the image Abercrombie seeks to project for each store, the company imposes a Look Policy that governs its employees\xe2\x80\x99 dress.  The Look Policy prohibits \xe2\x80\x9ccaps\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a term the Policy does not define\xe2\x80\x94as too informal for Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s desired image.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Samantha Elauf is a practicing Muslim who, consistent with her understanding of her religion\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, wears a headscarf.  She applied for a position in an Abercrombie store, and was interviewed by Heather Cooke, the store\xe2\x80\x99s assistant manager.  Using Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary system for evaluating applicants, Cooke gave Elauf a rating that qualified her to be hired; Cooke was concerned, however, that Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s headscarf would conflict with the store\xe2\x80\x99s Look Policy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cooke sought the store manager\xe2\x80\x99s guidance to clarify whether the headscarf was a forbidden \xe2\x80\x9ccap.\xe2\x80\x9d  When this yielded no answer, Cooke turned to Randall Johnson, the district manager.  Cooke informed Johnson that she believed Elauf wore her headscarf because of her faith.  Johnson told Cooke that Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s headscarf would violate the Look Policy, as would all other headwear, religious or otherwise, and directed Cooke not to hire Elauf.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The EEOC sued Abercrombie on Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, claiming that its refusal to hire Elauf violated Title VII.  The District Court granted the EEOC summary judgment on the issue of liability, 798 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1272 (ND Okla. 2011), held a trial on damages, and awarded $20,000.  The Tenth Circuit reversed and awarded Abercrombie summary judgment.  731 F.\xc2\xa03d 1106 (2013).   It concluded that ordinarily an employer cannot be liable under Title VII for failing to accommodate a religious practice until the applicant (or employee) provides the employer with actual knowledge of his need for an accommodation.  <i>Id., </i>at 1131.

It is unlawful for an employer:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin"></p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race,color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These two proscriptions, often referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate treatment\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d) provision and the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d provision, are the only causes of action under Title VII.  The word \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e] all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9creligious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e(\xc2\xa0j).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument is that an applicant cannot show disparate treatment without first showing that an employer has \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s need for an accommodation.  We disagree.  Instead, an applicant need only show that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s decision.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The disparate-treatment provision forbids employers to:  (1) \xe2\x80\x9cfail . . . to hire\xe2\x80\x9d an applicant (2) \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d (3) \xe2\x80\x9csuch individual\xe2\x80\x99s . . . religion\xe2\x80\x9d (which includes his religious practice).  Here, of course, Abercrombie (1) failed to hire Elauf.  The parties concede that (if Elauf sincerely believes that her religion so requires) Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s wearing of a headscarf is (3) a \xe2\x80\x9creligious practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  All that remains is whether she was not hired (2) \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d her religious practice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The term \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d appears frequently in antidiscrimination laws.  It typically imports, at a minimum, the traditional standard of but-for causation. <i>University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center </i>v<i>. Nassar</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).  Title VII relaxes this standard, however, to prohibit even making a protected characteristic a \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d in an employment decision.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) links the forbidden consideration to each of the verbs preceding it; an individual\xe2\x80\x99s actual religious practice may not be a motivating factor in failing to hire, in refusing to hire, and so on.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is significant that \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) does not impose a knowledge requirement.  As Abercrombie acknowledges, some antidiscrimination statutes do.  For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines discrimination to include an employer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make \xe2\x80\x9creason-able accommodations to the <i>known </i>physical or mental limitations\xe2\x80\x9d of an applicant.  \xc2\xa712112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  Title VII contains no such limitation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, the intentional discrimination provision prohibits certain <i>motives</i>, regardless of the state of the actor\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.  Motive and knowledge are separate concepts.  An employer who has actual knowledge of the need for an accommodation does not violate Title VII by refusing to hire an applicant if avoiding that accommodation is not his <i>motive</i>.  Conversely, an employer who acts with the motive of avoiding accommodation may violate Title VII even if he has no more than an unsubstantiated suspicion that accommodation would be needed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the rule for disparate-treatment claims based on a failure to accommodate a religious practice is straightforward: An employer may not make an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions.  For example, suppose that an employer thinks (though he does not know for certain) that a job applicant may be an orthodox Jew who will observe the Sabbath, and thus be unable to work on Saturdays.  If the applicant actually requires an accommodation of that religious practice, and the employer\xe2\x80\x99s desire to avoid the prospective accommodation is a motivating factor in his decision, the employer violates Title VII.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Abercrombie urges this Court to adopt the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule \xe2\x80\x9callocat[ing] the burden of raising a religious conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 46.  This would require the employer to have actual knowledge of a conflict between an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice and a work rule.  The problem with this approach is the one that inheres in most incorrect interpretations of statutes: It asks us to add words to the law to produce what is thought to be a desirable result.  That is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s province.  We construe Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s silence as exactly that: silence.  Its disparate-treatment provision prohibits actions taken with the <i>motive </i>of avoiding the need for accommodating a religious practice.  A request for accommodation, or the employer\xe2\x80\x99s certainty that the practice exists, may make it easier to infer motive, but is not a necessary condition of liability.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Abercrombie argues in the alternative that a claim based on a failure to accommodate an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice must be raised as a disparate-impact claim, not a disparate-treatment claim.  We think not.  That might have been true if Congress had limited the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII to religious <i>belief</i>\xe2\x80\x94so that discriminating against a particular religious <i>practice</i> would not be disparate treatment though it might have disparate impact.  In fact, however, Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9creligion,\xe2\x80\x9d for Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, as \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[ing] all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(j).  Thus, religious practice is one of the protected characteristics that cannot be accorded disparate treatment and must be accommodated.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the statute limit disparate-treatment claims to only those employer policies that treat religious practices less favorably than similar secular practices.  Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a neutral policy cannot constitute \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d may make sense in other contexts.  But Title VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices\xe2\x80\x94that they be treated no worse than other practices.  Rather, it gives them favored treatment, affirmatively obligating employers not \xe2\x80\x9cto fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual . . . because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creligious observance and practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear policy as an ordinary matter.  But when an applicant requires an accommodation as an \xe2\x80\x9caspec[t] of religious . . . practice,\xe2\x80\x9d it is no response that the sub-sequent \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ure] . . . to hire\xe2\x80\x9d was due to an otherwise-neutral policy.  Title VII requires otherwise-neutralpolicies to give way to the need for an accommodation. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Tenth Circuit misinterpreted Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s requirements in granting summary judgment.

Another provision states that the term \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cincludes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s or prospective employee\xe2\x80\x99s religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e(\xc2\xa0j).  When these two provisions are put together, the following rule (expressed in somewhat simplified terms) results: An employer may not take an adverse employment action against an applicant or employee because of any aspect of that individual\xe2\x80\x99s religious observance or practice unless the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate that observance or practice without undue hardship.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, Samantha Elauf, a practicing Muslim, wore a headscarf for a religious reason when she was interviewed for a job in a store operated by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.  She was rejected because her scarf violated Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s dress code for employees.  There is sufficient evidence in the summary judgment record to support a finding that Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmakers knew that Elauf was a Muslim and that she wore the headscarf for a religious reason.  But she was never asked why she wore the headscarf and did not volunteer that information.  Nor was she told that she would be prohibited from wearing the headscarf on the job.  The Tenth Circuit held that Abercrombie was entitled to summary judgment because, except perhaps in unusual circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]pplicants or employees must initially inform employers of their religious practices that conflict with a work requirement and their need for a reasonable accommodation for them.\xe2\x80\x9d  731 F.\xc2\xa03d 1106, 1142 (2013) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The relevant provisions of Title VII, however, do not impose the notice requirement that formed the basis for the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  While I interpret those provisions to require proof that Abercrombie knew that Elauf wore the headscarf for a religious reason, the evidence of  Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge is sufficient to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The opinion of the Court states that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) does not impose a knowledge requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 4, but then reserves decision on the question whether it is a condition of liability that the employer know or suspect that the practice he refuses to accommodate is a religious practice, <i>ante</i>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03, but in my view, the answer to this question, which may arise on remand,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]2 is obvious. I would hold that an employer cannot be held liable for taking an adverse action because of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice unless the employer knows that the employee engages in the practice for a religious reason.  If \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) really \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not impose a knowledge requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante </i>at 4, it would be irrelevant in this case whether Abercrombie had any inkling that Elauf is a Muslim or that she wore the headscarf for a religious reason.  That would be very strange.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The scarves that Elauf wore were not articles of clothing that were designed or marketed specifically for Muslim women.  Instead, she generally purchased her scarves at ordinary clothing stores.  In this case, the Abercrombie employee who interviewed Elauf had seen her wearing scarves on other occasions, and for reasons that the record does not make clear, came to the (correct) conclusion that she is a Muslim.  But suppose that the interviewer in this case had never seen Elauf before.  Suppose that the interviewer thought Elauf was wearing the scarf for a secular reason.  Suppose that nothing else about Elauf made the interviewer even suspect that she was a Muslim or that she was wearing the scarf for a religious reason.  If \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) does not impose a knowledge requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d Abercrombie would still be liable.  The EEOC, which sued on Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, does not adopt that interpretation, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioner 19, and it is surely wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory text does not compel such a strange result.  It is entirely reasonable to understand the prohibition against an employer\xe2\x80\x99s taking an adverse action because of a religious practice to mean that an employer may not take an adverse action because of a practice that the employer knows to be religious.  Consider the following sentences.  The parole board granted the prisoner parole because of an <i>exemplary</i> record in prison.  The court sanctioned the attorney because of a <i>flagrant</i> violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  No one is likely to understand these sentences to mean that the parole board granted parole because of a record that, unbeknownst to the board, happened to be exemplary or that the court sanctioned the attorney because of a violation that, unbeknownst to the court, happened to be flagrant.  Similarly, it is entirely reasonable to understand this statement\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe employer rejected the applicant because of a <i>religious </i>practice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to mean that the employer rejected the applicant because of a practice that the employer knew to be religious.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This interpretation makes sense of the statutory provisions.  Those provisions prohibit intentional discrimination, which is blameworthy conduct, but if there is no knowledge requirement, an employer could be held liable without fault.  The prohibition of discrimination because of religious practices is meant to force employers to consider whether those practices can be accommodated without undue hardship.  See \xc2\xa72000e(\xc2\xa0j).  But the \xe2\x80\x9cno-knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation would deprive employers of that opportunity.  For these reasons, an employer cannot be liable for taking adverse action because of a religious practice if the employer does not know that the practice is religious.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A plaintiff need not show, however, that the employer took the adverse action because of the religious nature of the practice.  Cf. <i>post</i>, at 4 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Suppose, for example, that an employer rejected all applicants who refuse to work on Saturday, whether for religious or nonreligious reasons.  Applicants whose refusal to work on Saturday was known by the employer to be based on religion will have been rejected because of a religious practice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This conclusion follows from the reasonable accommodation requirement imposed by \xc2\xa72000e(\xc2\xa0j).  If neutral work rules (<i>e.g.</i>, every employee must work on Saturday, no employee may wear any head covering) precluded liability, there would be no need to provide that defense, which allows an employer to escape liability for refusing to make an exception to a neutral work rule if doing so would impose an undue hardship.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This brings me to a final point.  Under the relevant statutory provisions, an employer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make a reasonable accommodation is not an element that the plaintiff must prove.  I am therefore concerned about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that it \xe2\x80\x9c<i>is</i> the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden [to prove failure to accommodate].\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ante, </i>at 3 n.\xc2\xa02.  This blatantly contradicts the language of the statutes.  As I noted at the beginning, when \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) and \xc2\xa72000e(\xc2\xa0j) are combined, this is the result:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to fail or refuse to hire .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any individual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of [any aspect of] such individual\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. religious .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. practice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to [the] employee\xe2\x80\x99s or prospective employee\xe2\x80\x99s religious</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>practice</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s business.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The clause that begins with the term \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d unmistakably sets out an employer defense.  If an employer chooses to assert that defense, it bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.  A plaintiff, on the other hand, must prove the elements set out prior to the \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d clause, but that portion of the rule makes no mention of accommodation.  Thus, a plaintiff need not plead or prove that the employer wished to avoid making an accommodation or could have done so without undue hardship.  If a plaintiff shows that the employer took an adverse employment action because of a religious observance or practice, it is then up to the employer to plead and prove the defense.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement subverts the statutory text, and in close cases, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reallocation of the burden of persuasion may be decisive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, the EEOC was required in this case to prove that Abercrombie rejected Elauf because of a practice that Abercrombie knew was religious.  It is undisputed that Abercrombie rejected Elauf because she wore a headscarf, and there is ample evidence in the summary judgment record to prove that Abercrombie knew that Elauf is a Muslim and that she wore the scarf for a religious reason.  The Tenth Circuit therefore erred in ordering the entry of summary judgment for Abercrombie.  On remand, the Tenth Circuit can consider whether there is sufficient evidence to support summary judgment in favor of the EEOC on the question of Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.  The Tenth Circuit will also be required to address Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it could not have accommodated Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s wearing the headscarf on the job without undue hardship.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), an employer takes an action \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d religion if religion is a \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d in the decision.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t2\xc2\xa0Cooke testified that she told Johnson that she believed Elauf wore a head scarf for a religious reason, App. 87, but Johnson testified that Cooke did not share this belief with him, <i>id.,</i> at 146.

Our agreement ends there.  Unlike the majority, I adhere to what I had thought before today was an undisputed proposition: Mere application of a neutral policy cannot constitute \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) can prevail here only if Abercrombie engaged in intentional discrimination, and because Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s application of its neutral Look Policy does not meet that description, I would affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This case turns on whether Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s conduct constituted \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981a(a)(1).

In doing so, it did not treat religious practices less favorably than similar secular practices, but instead remained neutral with regard to religious practices.  To be sure, the <i>effects</i> of Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s neutral Look Policy, absent an accommodation, fall more harshly on those who wear headscarves as an aspect of their faith.  But that is a classic case of an alleged disparate impact.  It is not what we have previously understood to be a case of disparate treatment because Elauf received the <i>same</i> treatment from Abercrombie as any other applicant who appeared unable to comply with the company\xe2\x80\x99s Look Policy.  See <i>ibid.</i>; App. 134, 144.  Because I cannot classify Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s conduct as \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d I would affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Resisting this straightforward application of \xc2\xa71981a, the majority expands the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d to include a refusal to give a religious applicant \xe2\x80\x9cfavored treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assumption, this novel theory of discrimination is not commanded by the relevant statutory text.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Title VII makes it illegal for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto fail or refuse to hire .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any individual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  And as used in Title VII, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98religion\xe2\x80\x99 includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s or prospective employee\xe2\x80\x99s religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e(\xc2\xa0j).  With this gloss on the definition of \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1), the majority concludes that an employer may violate Title VII if he \xe2\x80\x9crefuse[s] to hire .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any individual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. religious .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. practice\xe2\x80\x9d (unless he has an \xe2\x80\x9cundue hardship\xe2\x80\x9d defense).  See <i>ante,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But inserting the statutory definition of religion into \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) does not answer the question whether Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to hire Elauf was \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of her religious practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  At first glance, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice\xe2\x80\x9d could mean one of two things.  Under one reading, it could prohibit taking an action because of the religious nature of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s particular practice.  Under the alternative reading, it could prohibit taking an action because of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s practice that <i>happens</i> to be religious.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The distinction is perhaps best understood by example.  Suppose an employer with a neutral grooming policy forbidding facial hair refuses to hire a Muslim who wears a beard for religious reasons.  Assuming the employer applied the neutral grooming policy to all applicants, the motivation behind the refusal to hire the Muslim applicant would not be the religious nature of his beard, but its existence.  Under the first reading, then, the Muslim applicant would lack an intentional-discrimination claim, as he was not refused employment \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d the religious nature of his practice.  But under the second reading, he would have such a claim, as he was refused employment \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d a practice that happens to be religious in nature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One problem with the second, more expansive reading is that it would punish employers who have no discrimina-tory motive.  If the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice\xe2\x80\x9d sweeps in any case in which an employer takes an adverse action because of a practice that hap-pens to be religious in nature, an employer who had no idea that a particular practice was religious would be penalized.  That strict-liability view is plainly at odds with the concept of intentional discrimination.  Cf. <i>Raytheon</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 54, n.\xc2\xa07 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf [the employer] were truly unaware that such a disability existed, it would be impossible for her hiring decision to have been based, even in part, on [the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s] disability.  And, if no part of the hiring decision turned on [the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s] status as disabled, he cannot, <i>ipso facto</i>, have been subject to disparate treatment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Surprisingly, the majority leaves the door open to this strict-liability theory, reserving the question whether an employer who does not even \xe2\x80\x9csuspec[t] that the practice in question is a religious practice\xe2\x80\x9d can nonetheless be punished for <i>intentional</i> discrimination.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6, n. 3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For purposes of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, the majority opts for a compromise, albeit one that lacks a foothold in the text and fares no better under our precedents.  The majority construes \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) to punish employers who refuse to accommodate applicants under neutral policies when they act \xe2\x80\x9cwith the motive of avoiding accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 5.  But an employer who is aware that strictly applying a neutral policy will have an adverse effect on a religious group, and applies the policy anyway, is not engaged in intentional discrimination, at least as that term has traditionally been understood.  As the Court explained many decades ago, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Discriminatory purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> the purpose necessary for a claim of intentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x94demands \xe2\x80\x9cmore than .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. awareness of consequences.  It implies that the decisionmaker .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part \xe2\x80\x98because of,\xe2\x80\x99 not merely \xe2\x80\x98in spite of,\xe2\x80\x99 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Personnel Administrator of Mass. </i>v. <i>Feeney</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 256,\n279 (1979)\n (internal citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I do not dispute that a refusal to accommodate can, in some circumstances, constitute intentional discrimination.  If an employer declines to accommodate a particular religious practice, yet accommodates a similar secular (or other denominational) practice, then that may be proof that he has \xe2\x80\x9ctreated a particular person less favorably than others because of [a religious practice].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ricci</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 577 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); see also, <i>e.g., Dixon </i>v. <i>Hallmark Cos.</i>, 627 F.\xc2\xa03d 849, 853 (CA11 2010) (addressing a policy forbidding display of \xe2\x80\x9creligious items\xe2\x80\x9d in management offices).  But merely refusing to create an exception to a neutral policy for a religious practice cannot be described as treating a particular applicant \xe2\x80\x9cless favorably than others.\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority itself appears to recognize that its construction requires something more than equal treatment.  See <i>ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9cgives them favored treatment\xe2\x80\x9d).  But equal treatment is not disparate treatment, and that basic principle should have disposed of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s novel theory of intentional discrimination is also inconsistent with the history of this area of employment discrimination law.  As that history shows, cases arising out of the application of a neutral policy absent religious accommodations have traditionally been understood to involve only disparate-impact liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When Title VII was enacted in 1964, it prohibited discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. religion\xe2\x80\x9d and did not include the current definition of \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d encompassing \xe2\x80\x9creligious observance and practice\xe2\x80\x9d that was added to the statute in 1972.

But if the major-ity\xe2\x80\x99s view were correct\xe2\x80\x94if a mere refusal to accommodate a religious practice under a neutral policy could constitute intentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x94then the Court in <i>Hardison</i> should never have engaged in such reasoning.  After all, the employer in <i>Hardison </i>knew of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice and refused to make an exception to its neutral seniority system, just as Abercrombie arguably knew of Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice and refused to make an exception to its neutral Look Policy.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lower courts following <i>Hardison </i>likewise did not equate a failure to accommodate with intentional discrimination.  To the contrary, many lower courts, including the Tenth Circuit below, wrongly assumed that Title VII creates a freestanding failure-to-accommodate claim distinct from either disparate treatment or disparate impact.  See, <i>e.g., </i>731 F.\xc2\xa03d 1106, 1120 (2013) (\xe2\x80\x9cA claim for religious discrimination under Title VII can be asserted under several different theories, including disparate treatment and failure to accommodate\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Protos </i>v. <i>Volkswagen of Am., Inc.</i>, 797 F.\xc2\xa02d 129, 134, n.\xc2\xa02 (CA3 1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to her religious accommodation argument, [the plaintiff] maintains that she prevailed in the district court on a disparate treatment claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  That assumption appears to have grown out of statements in our cases suggesting that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definitional provision concerning religion created an independent duty.  See, <i>e.g., Ansonia Bd. of Ed. </i>v. <i>Philbrook</i>,\n\n479 U.\xc2\xa0S. 60\n, n.\xc2\xa01 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe reasonable accommodation duty was incorporated into the statute, somewhat awkwardly, in the definition of religion\xe2\x80\x9d).  But in doing so, the lower courts correctly recognized that a failure-to-accommodate claim based on the application of a neutral policy is not a disparate-treatment claim.  See, <i>e.g., Reed </i>v. <i>International Union, United Auto, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of Am.</i>, 569 F.\xc2\xa03d 576, 579\xe2\x80\x93580 (CA6 2009);<i> Chalmers </i>v. <i>Tulon Co. of Richmond</i>, 101 F. 3d 1012, 1018 (CA4 1996).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At least before we granted a writ of certiorari in this case, the EEOC too understood that merely applying a neutral policy did not automatically constitute intentional discrimination giving rise to a disparate-treatment claim.  For example, the Commission explained in a recent compliance manual, \xe2\x80\x9cA religious accommodation claim is distinct from a disparate treatment claim, in which the question is whether employees are treated equally.\xe2\x80\x9d  EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x93IV, p. 46 (2008).  Indeed, in asking us to take this case, the EEOC dismissed one of Abercrombie\xe2\x80\x99s supporting authorities as \xe2\x80\x9ca case addressing intentional discrimination, not religious accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply to Brief in Opposition 7, n.  Once we granted certiorari in this case, however, the EEOC altered course and advanced the intentional-discrimination theory now adopted by the majority.  The Court should have rejected this eleventh-hour request to expand our understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d to include merely applying a religion-neutral policy.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court today rightly puts to rest the notion that Title VII creates a freestanding religious-accommodation claim, <i>ante,</i> at 3, but creates in its stead an entirely new form of liability: the disparate-treatment-based-on-equal-treatment claim.  Because I do not think that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1972 redefinition of \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d also redefined \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d I would affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.  I respectfully dissent from the portions of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision that take the contrary view.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Contrary to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </i>v.<i> Hardison</i>,\n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 63 (1977)\n,<i> </i>did not establish that a refusal to accommodate a religious practice automatically constitutes intentional discrimination.  To be sure, <i>Hardison </i>remarked that the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the 1972 amendment expanding the definition of religion \xe2\x80\x9cwas to make it an unlawful employment practice under [\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)] for an employer not to make reasonable accommodations, short of undue hardship, for the religious practices of his employees and prospective employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 74.  But that statement should not be understood as a holding that such conduct automatically gives rise to a disparate-treatment claim.  Although this Court has more recently described \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) as originally creating only disparate-treatment liability, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Ricci</i> v. <i>DeStefano</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557,\n577 (2009)\n, it was an open question at the time <i>Hardison </i>was decided whether \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) also created disparate-impact liability, see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Nashville Gas Co. </i>v. <i>Satty</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136,\n144 (1977)\n; <i>General Elec. Co.</i> v. <i>Gilbert</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125\n\xe2\x80\x93155 (1976) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  In fact, both the employee and the EEOC in <i>Hardison </i>argued before this Court that the employer had violated \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) under a disparate-impact theory.  See Brief for Respondent 15, 25\xe2\x80\x9326, and Brief for United States et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 33\xe2\x80\x9336, 50, in<i> Trans World Airlines, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hardison</i>, O. T. 1976, No. 75\xe2\x80\x931126 etc.  In any event, the relevant language in <i>Hardison</i> is dictum.  Because the employee\xe2\x80\x99s termination had occurred before the 1972 amendment to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of religion, <i>Hardison</i> applied the then-existing EEOC guideline\xe2\x80\x94which also contained an \xe2\x80\x9cundue hardship\xe2\x80\x9d defense\xe2\x80\x94not the amended statutory definition.  432 U.\xc2\xa0S.,at 76, and n.\xc2\xa011.  <i>Hardison</i>\xe2\x80\x99s comment about the effect of the 1972 amendment was thus entirely beside the point.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
