In contrast, the Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits have concluded that the " prosecutorial overreaching" referred to in Dinitz is not limited to specific attempts to provoke a mistrial, but may also encompass other forms of serious Government misconduct intended in a more generalized way to prejudice the defendant. United States v. Weaver, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/565/129/">565 F.2d 129</a>, 133 ( CA8 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1074 ( 1978); United States v.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] The Double Jeopardy Clause protects a criminal defendant\'s interest in a single fair adjudication of his guilt or innocence. United States v. Jenkins, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/358/case.html#370">420 U.S. 358, 370</a>, 1013 (1975); United States v. Wilson, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/332/case.html#343">420 U.S. 332, 343</a>, 1021-1022, 43 L. Ed.2d 232 (1975); Downum v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/734/case.html#736">372 U.S. 734, 736</a>, 1034 (1963). This constitutional interest is implicated whenever intentional governmental misconduct results in a mistrial. Regardless of whether the Government\'s misbehavior was designed specifically to provoke a mistrial or was simply intended to reduce the chances of an acquittal, the net effect on the defendant is the same: he is faced with the burdens and risks of a second trial solely because the Government has deliberately undermined the integrity of the first proceeding. Indeed, in United States v. Jorn, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/470/case.html">400 U.S. 470</a> (1971), the central decision relied on in Dinitz, this Court concluded that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="932">Page 451 U.S. 929 , 932</a></p><p> "where a defendant\'s mistrial motion is necessitated by . . . prosecutorial impropriety designed to avoid an acquittal, reprosecution might well be barred." 400 U.S., at 485, n. 12, n. 12 ( emphasis added). This language strongly suggests that a general governmental intent to affect the trial in a manner that objectively might be viewed as risking a mistrial, rather than a specific, subjective intent on the part of the prosecution to achieve that precise result, is sufficient to invoke the double jeopardy concerns discussed in Dinitz. In any event, because the Courts of Appeals are divided on this important issue, I believe that this Court is obliged to resolve the conflict. </p><p> The second ground for the decision of the court below-that Dinitz does not apply to government witnesses-is equally suspect. Dinitz referred to " \'prosecutorial . . . overreaching,\' " 424 U.S., at 607, 96 S. Ct., at 1079, but nothing in that decision suggests that its holding was limited solely to misconduct by the prosecutor. To be sure, the prosecutor cannot be held responsible for the misconduct of every Government witness. However, in this case, Agent Dixon\'s role in the prosecution of petitioner was far more extensive than that of an ordinary Government witness. As Judge Winter observed in dissent: </p><ul>"Agent Dixon was a four-year veteran of the Drug Enforcement Administration. . . . Since joining DEA he had made over 150 arrests and participated in approximately 35 cases. Manifestly he was the agent in charge of the instant case; he sat at counsel table throughout the entire trial. Significantly, the government had been advised that defendant would not testify because of his record. Undoubtedly, as the agent in charge, Dixon had that knowledge." 636 F.2d, at 930.</ul> <p> Given Dixon\'s extensive involvement in the prosecution of the Government\'s case against petitioner, I question whether the court below correctly found Dinitz to be inapplicable. In any event, the question is sufficiently important to warrant this Court\'s review. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="933">Page 451 U.S. 929 , 933</a></p><p> Accordingly, I dissent from the denial of certiorari and would instead grant the petition and set the case for argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Under the Government\'s theory of the case, petitioner was a distributor for a heroin dealer. Agent Dixon testified that dealers did not distribute heroin through heroin users. The defense then produced evidence that petitioner was receiving large amounts of heroin for his personal use at the relevant time, and that the arrest report on petitioner noted that he was a "heroin user." The defense then asked Dixon if he was the agent who had arrested petitioner. Agent Dixon stated that he was not. The defense, however, again discredited Dixon by proving that he was indeed the arresting officer. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> As an initial matter, I question the validity of the lower court\'s assumption that the Government in such cases tailors its misconduct to achieve one improper result as opposed to another. It is far more likely that in cases such as this, where the prosecution is concerned that the trial may result in an acquittal, that the Government engages in misconduct with the general purpose of prejudicing the defendant. In this case, for example, the Government stood to benefit from Dixon\'s misconduct, regardless of whether it resulted in a guilty verdict or a mistrial. Moreover, even if such subtle differences in motivation do exist, I suspect that a defendant seeking to prevent a retrial will seldom be able to prove the Government\'s actual motivation. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
