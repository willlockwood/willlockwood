CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to decide whether a minimum fee schedule for lawyers published by the Fairfax County Bar Association and enforced by the Virginia State Bar violates \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1.  The Court of Appeals held that, although the fee schedule and enforcement mechanism substantially restrained competition among lawyers, publication of the schedule by the County Bar was outside the scope of the Act because the practice of law is not "trade or commerce," and enforcement of the schedule by the State Bar was exempt from the Sherman Act as state action as defined in <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1971 petitioners, husband and wife, contracted to buy a home in Fairfax County, Va.  The financing agency required them to secure title insurance; this required a title examination, and only a member of the Virginia State Bar could legally perform that service. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="776">Page 421 U. S. 776</a></p><p> Petitioners therefore contacted a lawyer who quoted them the precise fee suggested in a minimum fee schedule published by respondent Fairfax County Bar Association; the lawyer told them that it was his policy to keep his charges in line with the minimum fee schedule, which provided for a fee of 1% of the value of the property involved.  Petitioners then tried to find a lawyer who would examine the title for less than the fee fixed by the schedule.  They sent letters to 36 other Fairfax County lawyers requesting their fees.  Nineteen replied, and none indicated that he would charge less than the rate fixed by the schedule; several stated that they knew of no attorney who would do so.</p>\n<p>The fee schedule the lawyers referred to is a list of recommended minimum prices for common legal services.  Respondent Fairfax County Bar Association published the fee schedule although, as a purely voluntary association of attorneys, the County Bar has no formal power to enforce it.  Enforcement has been provided by respondent Virginia State Bar, which is the administrative agency [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] through which the Virginia Supreme Court regulates the practice of law in that State; membership in the State Bar is required in order to practice in Virginia. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Although the State Bar has never taken formal disciplinary action to compel adherence to any fee schedule, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="777">Page 421 U. S. 777</a></p><p> it has published reports [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] condoning fee schedules, and has issued two ethical opinions [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] indicating that fee schedules cannot be ignored.  The most recent opinion states that</p>\n<p>"evidence that an attorney <em>habitually</em> charges </p><p><a class="page-number" name="778">Page 421 U. S. 778</a></p><p> less than the suggested minimum fee schedule adopted by his local bar Association, raises a presumption that such lawyer is guilty of misconduct. . . . [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]"</p>\n<p>Because petitioners could not find a lawyer willing to charge a fee lower than the schedule dictated, they had their title examined by the lawyer they had first contacted.  They then brought this class action against the State Bar and the County Bar [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] alleging that the operation of the minimum fee schedule, as applied to fees for legal services relating to residential real estate transactions, constitutes price-fixing in violation of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act.  Petitioners sought both injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n<p>After a trial solely on the issue of liability, the District Court held that the minimum fee schedule violated the Sherman Act. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  355 F.Supp. 491 (ED Va.1973).  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 421 U. S. 779</a></p><p> court viewed the fee-schedule system as a significant reason for petitioners\' failure to obtain legal services for less than the minimum fee, and it rejected the County Bar\'s contention that, as a "learned profession," the practice of law is exempt from the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>Both respondents argued that their actions were also exempt from the Sherman Act as state action.  <em>Parker v. Brown, supra.</em>  The District Court agreed that the Virginia State Bar was exempt under that doctrine because it is an administrative agency of the Virginia Supreme Court, and, more important, because its</p>\n<p>"minor role in this matter . . . derived from the judicial and \'legislative command of the State and was not intended to operate or become effective without that command.\'"</p>\n<p>The County Bar, on the other hand, is a private organization, and was under no compulsion to adopt the fee schedule recommended by the State Bar.  Since the County Bar chose its own course of conduct, the District Court held that the antitrust laws "remain in full force and effect as to it."  The court enjoined the fee schedule, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 26, and set the case down for trial to ascertain damages.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed as to liability.  497 F.2d 1 (CA4 1974).  Despite its conclusion that it</p>\n<p>"is abundantly clear from the record before us that the fee schedule and the enforcement mechanism supporting it act as a substantial restraint upon competition among attorneys practicing in Fairfax County,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 13, the Court of Appeals held the State Bar immune under <em>Parker v. Brown, supra,</em> and held the County Bar immune because the practice of law is not "trade or commerce" under the Sherman Act.  There has long been judicial recognition of a limited exclusion of "learned professions" from the scope of the antitrust laws, the court said; that exclusion is based upon the special form </p><p><a class="page-number" name="780">Page 421 U. S. 780</a></p><p> of regulation imposed upon the professions by the States, and the incompatibility of certain competitive practices with such professional regulation.  It concluded that the promulgation of a minimum fee schedule is one of</p>\n<p>"those matters with respect to which an accord must be reached between the necessities of professional regulation and the dictates of the antitrust laws."</p>\n<p>The accord reached by that court was to hold the practice of law exempt from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the Court of Appeals held that respondents\' activities did not have sufficient effect on interstate commerce to support Sherman Act jurisdiction.  Petitioners had argued that the fee schedule restrained the business of financing and insuring home mortgages by inflating a component part of the total cost of housing, but the court concluded that a title examination is generally a local service, and, even where it is part of a transaction which crosses state lines, its effect on commerce is only "incidental," and does not justify federal regulation.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 419 U.S. 963 (1974), and are thus confronted for the first time with the question of whether the Sherman Act applies to services performed by attorneys in examining titles in connection with financing the purchase of real estate.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our inquiry can be divided into four steps:  did respondents engage in price-fixing?  If so, are their activities in interstate commerce or do they affect interstate commerce?  If so, are the activities exempt from the Sherman Act because they involve a "learned profession?"  If not, are the activities "state action" within the meaning of <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943), and therefore exempt from the Sherman Act? </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 421 U. S. 781</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The County Bar argues that, because the fee schedule is merely advisory, the schedule and its enforcement mechanism do not constitute price-fixing.  Its purpose, the argument continues, is only to provide legitimate information to aid member lawyers in complying with Virginia professional regulations.  Moreover, the County Bar contends that, in practice, the schedule has not had the effect of producing fixed fees.  The facts found by the trier belie these contentions, and nothing in the record suggests these findings lack support.</p>\n<p>A purely advisory fee schedule issued to provide guidelines, or an exchange of price information without a showing of an actual restraint on trade, would present us with a different question, <em>e.g., American Column Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/377/case.html">257 U. S. 377</a></span> (1921); <em>Maple Flooring Assn. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/563/case.html">268 U.

National Assn. of Real Estate Boards,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/485/case.html">339 U. S. 485</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/485/case.html#488">339 U.

The record here, however, reveals a situation quite different from what would occur under a purely advisory fee schedule.  Here, a fixed, rigid price floor arose from respondents\' activities:  every lawyer who responded to petitioners\' inquiries adhered to the fee schedule, and no lawyer asked for additional information in order to set an individualized fee.  The price information disseminated did not concern past standards, <em>cf. Cement Mfrs. Protective Assn. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/588/case.html">268 U. S. 588</a></span> (1925), but rather minimum fees to be charged in future transactions, and those minimum rates were increased over time.  The fee schedule was enforced through the prospect of professional discipline from the State Bar, and the desire of attorneys to comply with announced professional norms, <em>see generally American Column Co., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/377/case.html#411">257 U. S. 411</a></span>; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 421 U. S. 782</a></p><p> the motivation to conform was reinforced by the assurance that other lawyers would not compete by underbidding.  This is not merely a case of an agreement that may be inferred from an exchange of price information, <em>United States v. Container Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/333/case.html">393 U. S. 333</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/333/case.html#337">393 U. S. 337</a></span> (1969), for here a naked agreement was clearly shown, and the effect on prices is plain. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/333/case.html#339">393 U. S. 339</a></span> (Fortas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Moreover, in terms of restraining competition and harming consumers like petitioners, the price-fixing activities found here are unusually damaging.  A title examination is indispensable in the process of financing a real estate purchase, and since only an attorney licensed to practice in Virginia may legally examine a title, <em>see</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra,</em> consumers could not turn to alternative sources for the necessary service.  All attorneys, of course, were practicing under the constraint of the fee schedule.  <em>See generally United States v. Container Corp., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/333/case.html#337">393 U. S. 337</a></span>.  The County Bar makes much of the fact that it is a voluntary organization; however, the ethical opinions issued by the State Bar provide that any lawyer, whether or not a member of his county bar association, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 421 U. S. 783</a></p><p> may be disciplined for "<em>habitually</em> charg[ing] less than the suggested minimum fee schedule adopted by his local bar Association. . . ."  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#777">421 U. S. 777</a></span>-778, and n. 4.  These factors coalesced to create a pricing system that consumers could not realistically escape.  On this record, respondents\' activities constitute a classic illustration of price-fixing.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The County Bar argues, as the Court of Appeals held, that any effect on interstate commerce caused by the fee schedule\'s restraint on legal services was incidental and remote.  In its view, the legal services, which are performed wholly intrastate, are essentially local in nature, and therefore a restraint with respect to them can never substantially affect interstate commerce.  Further, the County Bar maintains, there was no showing here that the fee schedule and its enforcement mechanism increased fees, and that, even if they did, there was no showing that such an increase deterred any prospective homeowner from buying in Fairfax County.</p>\n<p>These arguments misconceive the nature of the transactions at issue and the place legal services play in those transactions.  As the District Court found, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] "a significant portion of funds furnished for the purchasing of homes in Fairfax County comes from without the State of Virginia," and "significant amounts of loans on Fairfax County real estate are guaranteed by the United States Veterans Administration and Department of Housing and Urban Development, both headquartered in the District of Columbia."  Thus, in this class action, the transactions which create the need for the particular legal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 421 U. S. 784</a></p><p> services in question frequently are interstate transactions.  The necessary connection between the interstate transactions and the restraint of trade provided by the minimum fee schedule is present because, in a practical sense, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] title examinations are necessary in real estate transactions to assure a lien on a valid title of the borrower.  In financing realty purchases, lenders require, "as a condition of making the loan, that the title to the property involved be examined. . . ." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Thus, a title examination is an integral part of an interstate transaction, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and this Court has long held that</p>\n<p>"there is an obvious distinction to be drawn between a course of conduct wholly within a state and conduct which is an inseparable element of a larger program dependent for its success upon activity which affects commerce between the states. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 421 U. S. 785</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>United States v. Frankfort Distilleries,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/293/case.html">324 U. S. 293</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/293/case.html#297">324 U. S. 297</a></span> (1945).  <em>See United States v.

Given the substantial volume of commerce involved, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and the inseparability of this particular legal service from the interstate aspects of real estate transactions, we conclude that interstate commerce has been sufficiently affected.  <em>See Montague &amp; Co. v. Lowry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/193/38/case.html">193 U. S. 38</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/193/38/case.html#45">193 U.

S. 464</a></span>-465 (1949).</p>\n<p>The fact that there was no showing that home buyers were discouraged by the challenged activities does not mean that interstate commerce was not affected.  Otherwise, the magnitude of the effect would control, and our cases have shown that, once an effect is shown, no specific magnitude need be proved.  <em>E.g., United States v.

Of course, there may be legal services that involve interstate commerce in other fashions, just as there may be legal services that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 421 U. S. 786</a></p><p> have no nexus with interstate commerce, and thus are beyond the reach of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The County Bar argues that Congress never intended to include the learned professions within the terms "trade or commerce" in \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and therefore the sale of professional services is exempt from the Act.  No explicit exemption or legislative history is provided to support this contention; rather, the existence of state regulation seems to be its primary basis.  Also, the County Bar maintains that competition is inconsistent with the practice of a profession because enhancing profit is not the goal of professional activities; the goal is to provide services necessary to the community. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  That, indeed, is the classic basis traditionally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 421 U.

Whether state regulation is active or dormant, real or theoretical, lawyers would be able to adopt anticompetitive practices with impunity.  We cannot find support for the proposition that Congress intended any such sweeping exclusion.

Congress intended to strike as broadly as it could in \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, and to read into it so wide an exemption as that urged on us would be at odds with that purpose.</p>\n<p>The language of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, of course, contains no exception.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  That court has adopted ethical codes which deal in part with fees, and, far from exercising state power to authorize binding price-fixing, explicitly directed lawyers not "to be controlled" by fee schedules. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The State Bar, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 421 U.

The County Bar, although it is a voluntary association and not a state agency, claims that the ethical codes and the activities of the State Bar "prompted" it to issue fee schedules, and thus its actions too, are state action for Sherman Act purposes.</p>\n<p>The threshold inquiry in determining if an anticompetitive activity is state action of the type the Sherman Act was not meant to proscribe is whether the activity is required by the State acting as sovereign.  <em>Parker v.

Here, we need not inquire further into the state action question, because it cannot fairly be said that the State of Virginia, through its Supreme Court Rules, required the anticompetitive activities of either respondent.  Respondents have pointed to no Virginia statute requiring their activities; state law simply does not refer to fees, leaving regulation of the profession to the Virginia Supreme Court; although the Supreme Court\'s ethical codes mention advisory fee schedules, they do not direct either respondent to supply them, or require the type of price floor which arose from respondents\' activities.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="791">Page 421 U. S. 791</a></p><p> Although the State Bar apparently has been granted the power to issue ethical opinions, there is no indication in this record that the Virginia Supreme Court approves the opinions.  Respondents\' arguments, at most, constitute the contention that their activities complemented the objective of the ethical codes.  In our view, that is not state action for Sherman Act purposes.  It is not enough that, as the County Bar puts it, anticompetitive conduct is "prompted" by state action; rather, anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign.</p>\n<p>The fact that the State Bar is a state agency for some limited purposes does not create an antitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive practices for the benefit of its members.

The State Bar, by providing that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="792">Page 421 U.

The report stated, however, that the fees were not mandatory, and it recommended only that the State Bar <em>consider</em> adopting such a schedule.  Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the County Bar adopted its own minimum fee schedule that purported to be "a conscientious effort to show lawyers in their true perspective of dignity, training and integrity."  The suggested fees for title examination were virtually identical to those in the State Bar report.  In accord with Opinion 98 of the State Bar Committee on Legal Ethics, the schedule stated that, although there is an ethical duty to charge a lower fee in a deserving case, if a lawyer</p>\n<p>"purely for his own advancement, intentionally and regularly bills less than the customary charges of the bar for similar services . . .

The report again stated that no local bar association was bound by its recommendations; however, respondent County Bar again quickly moved to publish an updated minimum fee schedule, and generally to raise fees.  The new schedule stated that the fees were not mandatory, but tempered that by referring again to Opinion 98.  This time, the schedule also stated that lawyers should feel free to charge <em>more</em> than the recommended fees; and to avoid condemnation of higher fees charged by some lawyers, it cautioned County Bar members that "to . . . publicly criticize lawyers who charge more than the suggested fees herein might in itself be evidence of solicitation. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Virginia State Bar Committee on Legal Ethics, Opinion No. 98, June 1, 1960; Virginia State Bar Committee on Legal Ethics, Opinion No. 170, May 28, 1971.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The parties stipulated that these opinions are a substantial influencing factor in lawyers\' adherence to the fee schedules.

We intimate no view on any other situation than the one with which we are confronted today.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Virginia Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 54-48 (1972) provides:</p>\n<p>"Rules and regulations defining practice of law and prescribing codes of ethics and disciplinary procedure. -- The Supreme Court of Appeals may, from time to time, prescribe, adopt, promulgate and amend rules and regulations:"</p>\n<p>"(a) Defining the practice of law."</p>\n<p>"(b) Prescribing a code of ethics governing the professional conduct of attorneys at law and a code of judicial ethics."</p>\n<p>"(c) Prescribing procedure for disciplining, suspending, and disbarring attorneys at law."</p>\n<p>In addition, the Supreme Court of Virginia, has inherent power to regulate the practice of law in that State.  <em>Button v. Day,</em> 204 Va. 547, 132 S.E.2d 292 (1963).  <em>See Lathrop v. Donohue,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/820/case.html">367 U. S. 820</a></span> (1961).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1938, the Supreme Court of Virginia adopted Rules for the Integration of the Virginia State Bar, and Rule II, \xc2\xa7 12, dealt with the procedure for setting fees.  Among six factors that court directed to be considered in setting a fee were "the customary charges of the Bar for similar services."  The court also directed that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n determining the customary charges of the Bar for similar services, it is proper for a lawyer to consider a schedule of minimum fees adopted by a Bar Association, but <em>no lawyer should permit himself to be controlled</em> thereby or to follow it as his sole guide in determining the amount of his fee."</p>\n<p>Rules for Integration of the Virginia State Bar, 171 Va. xvii, xxiii. (Emphasis supplied.)  In 1970, the Virginia Supreme Court amended the 1938 rules in part, and adopted the Code of Professional Responsibility, effective January 1, 1971.  211 Va. 295 (1970).  Certain of its provisions also dealt with the fee-setting procedure.  In EC 2-18, lawyers were told again that fees vary according to many factors, but that "[s]uggested fee schedules and economic reports of state and local bar associations provide some guidance on the subject of reasonable fees."  211 Va. at 302.  In DR 2-106(b), which detailed eight factors that should be considered in avoiding an excessive fee, one of the factors was "[t]he fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services."  DR 2-106(b)(3).  211 Va. at 313.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#776">421 U. S. 776</a></span> n. 2.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court stated that the State Bar acted in only a "minor role" as far as the price-fixing was concerned, 355 F.Supp. at 496, and one member of the Court of Appeals panel was prepared to exonerate the State Bar because its participation was so minimal as to be insufficient to impose Sherman Act liability.  497 F.2d at 21 (Craven, J., concurring and dissenting).  Of course, an alleged participant in a restraint of trade may have so insubstantial a connection with the restraint that liability under the Sherman Act would not be found, <em>see United States v. National Assn. of Real Estate Boards,</em> 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/485/case.html#495">339 U. S. 495</a></span>; however, that is not the case here.  The State Bar\'s fee schedule reports provided the impetus for the County Bar, on two occasions, to adopt minimum fee schedules.  More important, the State Bar\'s ethical opinions provided substantial reason for lawyers to comply with the minimum fee schedules.  Those opinions threatened professional discipline for habitual disregard of fee schedules, and thus attorneys knew their livelihood was in jeopardy if they did so.  Even without that threat, the opinions would have constituted substantial reason to adhere to the schedules because attorneys could be expected to comply in order to assure that they did not discredit themselves by departing from professional norms, and perhaps betraying their professional oaths.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The State Bar also contends that it is protected by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Edelman v. Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/case.html">415 U. S. 651</a></span> (1974).  Petitioners dispute this contention, and the District Court had no occasion to reach it in view of its holding.  Given the record before us, we intimate no view on the issue, leaving it for the District Court on remand.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
