The District Court also rejected the State\'s argument that both federal2 and state3 \'equal pay\' laws required Homemakers to equalize wages by paying premium overtime wages to male employees, not by forbidding payment of such wages to female employees.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment that 1350.5(a) conflicted with Title VII and was unenforceable, expressly approving the District Court\'s refusal to follow Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., supra. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/509/22/">509 F.2d 22</a>-23. </p><p> The statute at issue in Hays, Ark.Stat.Ann. 81-601 (1960), is essentially indistinguishable from 1350.5(a) and was upheld in district court against the claim that it had been superseded by Title VII and should be declared unenforceable. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Arkansas statute was not inconsistent with Title VII because it "does not say that women must be paid more than men; it simply says that they must be paid daily overtime without making a similar requirement as to men," <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/465/1082/">465 F.2d 1082</a>, quoting 318 F.Supp., at 1375, and that \'any discrimination against men resulting from the Arkansas statute is to be cured by extending the benefits of that statute to male employees rather than holding it invalid.\' 465 F.2d, at 1083.4 </p><p> I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and set the case for oral argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Cal.Labor Code 1350.5(a) (West 1971):</p><ul>\'Employers of employees covered under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act may employ females up to 10 hours during any one day of 24 hours or up to 58 hours in one week, provided that they are compensated at the rate of 1 1/2 times the regular rate of pay for time worked for one employer in excess of eight hours in any one day or 40 hours in any one week.\'</ul> <p> Only the overtime premium requirement is at issue in this case.
