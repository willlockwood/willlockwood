S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, and replaced those claims with the State\xe2\x80\x99s preferred alternative.  Thereunder, a prisoner will have his claim against a correction officer dismissed for want of jurisdiction and will be left to pursue a damages claim against the State in the Court of Claims, a court of limited jurisdiction in which the prisoner will not be entitled to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, punitive damages, or injunctive relief.  Petitioner filed two \xc2\xa71983 damages actions against correction employees in state court.  Finding that it lacked jurisdiction under Correction Law \xc2\xa724, the trial court dismissed the actions.  Affirming, the State Court of Appeals rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the state statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional limitation violated the Supremacy Clause.  It reasoned that because that law treats state and federal damages actions against correction officers equally\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e., </em>neither can be brought in New York courts\xe2\x80\x94it was a neutral rule of judicial administration and thus a valid excuse for the State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to entertain the federal cause of action.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Correction Law \xc2\xa724, as applied to \xc2\xa71983 claims, violates the Supremacy Clause.

S. 130</a>, 136\xe2\x80\x93137.  Both state and federal courts have jurisdiction over \xc2\xa71983 suits.  So strong is the presumption of concurrency that it is defeated only when Congress expressly ousts state courts of jurisdiction, see<em> e.g., id., </em>at 136; or \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a state court refuses jurisdiction because of a neutral state rule regarding the administration of the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Howlett</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/356/index.html">496 U. S. 356</a>, 372.  As to whether a state law qualifies as such a neutral rule, States retain substantial leeway to establish the contours of their judicial systems, but lack authority to nullify a federal right or cause of action they believe is inconsistent with their local policies.  Whatever its merits, New York\xe2\x80\x99s policy of shielding correction officers from liability when sued for damages arising out of conduct performed in the scope of their employment is contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that <em>all</em> persons who violate federal rights while acting under color of state law shall be held liable for damages.  \xe2\x80\x9cA State may not \xe2\x80\xa6 relieve congestion in its courts by declaring a whole category of federal claims to be frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 380.

Although the absence of discrimination is essential to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding a state law neutral, nondiscrimination alone is not sufficient to guarantee that a state law will be deemed neutral.  In addition to this misplaced reliance on equality, respondents mistakenly treat this case as implicating the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat latitude [States enjoy] to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howlett</em>, 496 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, the statute that creates a remedy for violations of federal rights committed by persons acting under color of state law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  While that rule is generally applicable to New York\xe2\x80\x99s supreme courts\xe2\x80\x94the State\xe2\x80\x99s trial courts of general jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94New York\xe2\x80\x99s Correction Law \xc2\xa724 divests those courts of jurisdiction over \xc2\xa71983 suits that seek money damages from correction officers.  New York thus prohibits the trial courts that generally exercise jurisdiction over \xc2\xa71983 suits brought against other state officials from hearing virtually all such suits brought against state correction officers.  The question presented is whether that exceptional treatment of a limited category of \xc2\xa71983 claims is consistent with the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, an inmate in New York\xe2\x80\x99s Attica Correctional Facility, commenced two \xc2\xa71983 actions against several correction employees alleging that they violated his civil rights in connection with three prisoner disciplinary proceedings and an altercation.  Proceeding <em>pro se</em>, petitioner filed his claims in State Supreme Court and sought punitive damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  The trial court dismissed the actions on the ground that, under N.\xc2\xa0Y. Correct. Law Ann. \xc2\xa724 (West 1987) (hereinafter Correction Law \xc2\xa724), it lacked jurisdiction to entertain any suit arising under state or federal law seeking money damages from correction officers for actions taken in the scope of their employment.  The intermediate appellate court summarily affirmed the trial court.  35 App. Div. 3d 1290, 826 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 2d 542 (2006).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The New York Court of Appeals, by a 4-to-3 vote, also affirmed the dismissal of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s damages action.  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Correction Law \xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional limitation interfered with \xc2\xa71983 and therefore ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.  The majority reasoned that, because Correction Law \xc2\xa724 treats state and federal damages actions against correction officers equally (that is, neither can be brought in New York courts), the statute should be properly characterized as a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral state rule regarding the administration of the courts\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid excuse\xe2\x80\x9d for the State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to entertain the federal cause of action.  9 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 481, 487, 881 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 180, 183, 184 (2007) (quoting <em>Howlett</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/496/356/index.html">496 U. S. 356</a>, 369, 372 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The majority understood our Supremacy Clause precedents to set forth the general rule that so long as a State does not refuse to hear a federal claim for the \xe2\x80\x9csole reason that the cause of action arises under federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d its withdrawal of jurisdiction will be deemed constitutional.\n9 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d, at 488, 881 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 184.  So read, discrimination <em>vel non</em> is the focal point of Supremacy Clause analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In dissent, Judge Jones argued that Correction Law \xc2\xa724 is not a neutral rule of judicial administration.  Noting that the State\xe2\x80\x99s trial courts handle all other \xc2\xa71983 damages actions, he concluded that the State had created courts of competent jurisdiction to entertain \xc2\xa71983 suits.  In his view, \xe2\x80\x9conce a state opens its courts to hear section 1983 actions, it may not selectively exclude section 1983 actions by denominating state policies as jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 497, 881 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 191.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing the importance of the question decided by the New York Court of Appeals, we granted certiorari.  554 U. S. ___ (2008).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Motivated by the belief that damages suits filed by prisoners against state correction officers were by and large frivolous and vexatious, New York passed Correction Law \xc2\xa724.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The statute employs a two-step process to strip its courts of jurisdiction over such damages claims and to replace those claims with the State\xe2\x80\x99s preferred alternative.  The provision states in full:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c1.\xc2\xa0No civil action shall be brought in any court of the state, except by the attorney general on behalf of the state, against any officer or employee of the department, in his personal capacity, for damages arising out of any act done or the failure to perform any act within the scope of employment and in the discharge of the duties by such officer or employee.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c2.\xc2\xa0Any claim for damages arising out of any act done or the failure to perform any act within the scope of employment and in the discharge of the duties of any officer or employee of the department shall be brought and maintained in the court of claims as a claim against the state.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, under this scheme, a prisoner seeking damages from a correction officer will have his claim dismissed for want of jurisdiction and will be left, instead, to pursue a claim for damages against an entirely different party (the State) in the Court of Claims\xe2\x80\x94a court of limited jurisdiction.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See N.\xc2\xa0Y.

In addition to facing a different defendant, plaintiffs in that Court are not provided with the same relief, or the same procedural protections, made available in \xc2\xa71983 actions brought in state courts of general jurisdiction.  Specifically, under New York law, plaintiffs in the Court of Claims must comply with a 90-day notice requirement, Court of Claims Act \xc2\xa79; are not entitled to a jury trial, \xc2\xa712; have no right to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, \xc2\xa727; and may not seek punitive damages or injunctive relief, <em>Sharapata </em>v. <em>Town of Islip</em>, 56 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d 332, 334, 437 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1104, 1105 (1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must decide whether Correction Law \xc2\xa724, as applied to \xc2\xa71983 claims, violates the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has long made clear that federal law is as much the law of the several States as are the laws passed by their legislatures.  Federal and state law \xe2\x80\x9ctogether form one system of jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State; and the courts of the two jurisdictions are not foreign to each other, nor to be treated by each other as such, but as courts of the same country, having jurisdiction partly different and partly concurrent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Claflin</em> v. <em>Houseman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/index.html">93 U.

Although \xc2\xa71983, a Reconstruction-era statute, was passed \xe2\x80\x9cto interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people\xe2\x80\x99s federal rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mitchum </em>v. <em>Foster</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/index.html">407 U. S. 225</a>, 242 (1972), state courts as well as federal courts are entrusted with providing a forum for the vindication of federal rights violated by state or local officials acting under color of state law.  See <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of Fla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/index.html">457 U. S. 496</a>, 506\xe2\x80\x93507 (1982) (canvassing the legislative debates of the 1871 Congress and noting that \xe2\x80\x9cmany legislators interpreted [\xc2\xa71983] to provide dual or concurrent forums in the state and federal system, enabling the plaintiff to choose the forum in which to seek relief\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/index.html">448 U. S. 1</a>, 3, n.\xc2\xa01 (1980).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So strong is the presumption of concurrency that it is defeated only in two narrowly defined circumstances: first, when Congress expressly ousts state courts of jurisdiction, see <em>Bombolis</em>, 241 U. S., at 221;<em> Claflin</em>, 93 U. S., at 136; and second, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a state court refuses jurisdiction because of a neutral state rule regarding the administration of the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Howlett</em>, 496 U. S., at 372.  Focusing on the latter circumstance, we have emphasized that only a neutral jurisdictional rule will be deemed a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid excuse\xe2\x80\x9d for departing from the default assumption that \xe2\x80\x9cstate courts have inherent authority, and are thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tafflin</em> v. <em>Levitt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/455/index.html">493 U. S. 455</a>, 458 (1990).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether a state law qualifies as a neutral rule of judicial administration, our cases have established that a State cannot employ a jurisdictional rule \xe2\x80\x9cto dissociate [itself] from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howlett</em>, 496 U. S., at 371.  In other words, although States retain substantial leeway to establish the contours of their judicial systems, they lack authority to nullify a federal right or cause of action they believe is inconsistent with their local policies.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe suggestion that [an] act of Congress is not in harmony with the policy of the State, and therefore that the courts of the State are free to decline jurisdiction, is quite inadmissible, because it presupposes what in legal contemplation does not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/223/1/index.html">223 U. S. 1</a>, 57 (1912).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is principally on this basis that Correction Law \xc2\xa724 violates the Supremacy Clause.  In passing Correction Law \xc2\xa724, New York made the judgment that correction officers should not be burdened with suits for damages arising out of conduct performed in the scope of their employment.  Because it regards these suits as too numerous or too frivolous (or both), the State\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding policy has been to shield this narrow class of defendants from liability when sued for damages.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The State\xe2\x80\x99s policy, whatever its merits, is contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that <em>all</em> persons who violate federal rights while acting under color of state law shall be held liable for damages.  As we have unanimously recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] State may not \xe2\x80\xa6 relieve congestion in its courts by declaring a whole category of federal claims to be frivolous.  Until it has been proved that the claim has no merit, that judgment is not up to the States to make.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howlett</em>, 496 U. S., at 380; <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Grattan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/42/index.html">468 U. S. 42</a>, 55 (1984) (rejecting as \xe2\x80\x9cmanifestly inconsistent with the central objective of the Reconstruction\xe2\x80\x93Era civil rights statutes\xe2\x80\x9d the judgment \xe2\x80\x9cthat factors such as minimizing the diversion of state officials\xe2\x80\x99 attention from their duties outweigh the interest in providing employees ready access to a forum to resolve valid claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  That New York strongly favors a rule shielding correction officers from personal damages liability and substituting the State as the party responsible for compensating individual victims is irrelevant.  The State cannot condition its enforcement of federal law on the demand that those individuals whose conduct federal law seeks to regulate must nevertheless escape liability.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While our cases have uniformly applied the principle that a State cannot simply refuse to entertain a federal claim based on a policy disagreement, we have yet to confront a statute like New York\xe2\x80\x99s that registers its dissent by divesting its courts of jurisdiction over a disfavored federal claim in addition to an identical state claim.  The New York Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding was based on the misunderstanding that this equal treatment of federal and state claims rendered Correction Law \xc2\xa724 constitutional.  9 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d, at 489, 881 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 185 (\xe2\x80\x9cPut simply, because Correction Law \xc2\xa724 does not treat section 1983 claims differently than it treats related state law causes of action, the Supremacy Clause is not offended\xe2\x80\x9d).  To the extent our cases have created this misperception, we now make clear that equality of treatment does not ensure that a state law will be deemed a neutral rule of judicial administration and therefore a valid excuse for refusing to entertain a federal cause of action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents correctly observe that, in the handful of cases in which this Court has found a valid excuse, the state rule at issue treated state and federal claims equally.  In <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <em>N.\xc2\xa0H. &amp; H.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/279/377/index.html">279 U. S. 377</a> (1929), we upheld a state law that granted state courts discretion to decline jurisdiction over state and federal claims alike when neither party was a resident of the State.  Later, in <em>Herb </em>v. <em>Pitcairn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/117/index.html">324 U. S. 117</a> (1945), a city court dismissed an action brought under the Federal Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751 <em>et seq.</em>, for want of jurisdiction because the cause of action arose outside the court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction.  We upheld the dismissal on the ground that the State\xe2\x80\x99s venue laws were not being applied in a way that discriminated against the federal claim.  324 U. S., at 123.  In a third case, <em>Missouri ex rel. Southern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Mayfield</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/1/index.html">340 U. S. 1</a> (1950), we held that a State\xe2\x80\x99s application of the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine to bar adjudication of a FELA case brought by nonresidents was constitutionally sound as long as the policy was enforced impartially.  <em>Id.</em>, at 4.  And our most recent decision finding a valid excuse, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fankell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/911/index.html">520 U. S. 911</a> (1997), rested largely on the fact that Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s rule limiting interlocutory jurisdiction did not discriminate against \xc2\xa71983 actions.  See <em>id.</em>, at 918.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the absence of discrimination is necessary to our finding a state law neutral, it is not sufficient.  A jurisdictional rule cannot be used as a device to undermine federal law, no matter how evenhanded it may appear.<font b="1">  As we made clear in <em>Howlett</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that a rule is denominated jurisdictional does not provide a court an excuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the rule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person and competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect.\xe2\x80\x9d  496 U. S., at 381.  Ensuring equality of treatment is thus the beginning, not the end, of the Supremacy Clause analysis.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to giving too much weight to equality of treatment, respondents mistakenly treat this case as implicating the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat latitude [States enjoy] to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 372.  Although Correction Law \xc2\xa724 denies state courts authority to entertain damages actions against correction officers, this case does not require us to decide whether Congress may compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise unavailable under state law, to hear suits brought pursuant to \xc2\xa71983.  The State of New York has made this inquiry unnecessary by creating courts of general jurisdiction that routinely sit to hear analogous \xc2\xa71983 actions.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s constitution vests the state supreme courts with general original jurisdiction, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Const., Art. VI, \xc2\xa77(a), and the \xe2\x80\x9cinviolate authority to hear and resolve all causes in law and equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pollicina </em>v. <em>Misericordia Hospital Medical Center</em>, 82 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d 332, 339, 624 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 974, 977 (1993). <em> </em>For instance, if petitioner had attempted to sue a police officer for damages under \xc2\xa71983, the suit would be properly adjudicated by a state supreme court.  Similarly, if petitioner had sought declaratory or injunctive relief against a correction officer, that suit would be heard in a state supreme court.  It is only a particular species of suits\xe2\x80\x94those seeking damages relief against correction officers\xe2\x80\x94that the State deems inappropriate for its trial courts.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore hold that, having made the decision to create courts of general jurisdiction that regularly sit to entertain analogous suits, New York is not at liberty to shut the courthouse door to federal claims that it considers at odds with its local policy.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  A State\xe2\x80\x99s authority to organize its courts, while considerable, remains subject to the strictures of the Constitution.

Because New York\xe2\x80\x99s supreme courts generally have personal jurisdiction over the parties in \xc2\xa71983 suits brought by prisoners against correction officers and because they hear the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of all other \xc2\xa71983 actions, we find little concerning \xe2\x80\x9cpower over the person and competence over the subject matter\xe2\x80\x9d in Correction Law \xc2\xa724. <em>Id</em>., at 381; see <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 378 (conducting a similar analysis and concluding that the Florida courts of general jurisdiction were \xe2\x80\x9cfully competent to provide the remedies [\xc2\xa71983] requires\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s fear that \xe2\x80\x9cno state jurisdictional rule will be upheld as constitutional\xe2\x80\x9d is entirely unfounded.  <em>Post</em>, at 29, n. 10.<em> </em>Our holding addresses only the unique scheme adopted by the State of New York\xe2\x80\x94a law designed to shield a particular class of defendants (correction officers) from a particular type of liability (damages) brought by a particular class of plaintiffs (prisoners).

Thus, in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s conception of the Supremacy Clause, a State could express its disagreement with (and even open hostility to) a federal cause of action, declare a desire to thwart its enforcement, and achieve that goal by removing the disfavored category of claims from its courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.

Article III, \xc2\xa71, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\xe2\x80\x9d  The history of the drafting and ratification of this Article establishes that it leaves untouched the States\xe2\x80\x99 plenary authority to decide whether their local courts will have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal causes of action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of Article III reflects the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 agreement that the National Government needed a Supreme Court.  There was sharp disagreement at the Philadelphia Convention, however, over the need for lower federal courts.  Several of the Framers, most notably James Madison, favored a strong central government that included lower federal tribunals.  Under the Virginia Plan, the Constitution would have established a \xe2\x80\x9cNational Judiciary \xe2\x80\xa6 to consist of one or more supreme tribunals, and of inferior tribunals to be chosen by the National Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 21 (M.

A revised version of the proposal, which stated that the National Judiciary would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consist of One supreme tribunal, and of one or more inferior tribunals,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was approved on June 4, 1787.  <em>Id.</em>, at 95.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following day, however, John Rutledge raised an objection to \xe2\x80\x9cestablishing any national tribunal except a single supreme one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 119.  He proposed striking the language providing for the creation of lower federal courts because state courts were \xe2\x80\x9cmost proper\xe2\x80\x9d for deciding \xe2\x80\x9call cases in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  According to Rutledge, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of appeal to the supreme national tribunal [was] sufficient to secure the national rights [and] uniformity of Judgm[en]ts,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lower federal courts were thus an \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary encroachment\xe2\x80\x9d on the sovereign prerogative of the States to adjudicate federal claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 124.  Madison nonetheless defended the Virginia Plan.  He countered that \xe2\x80\x9cinferior [federal] tribunals \xe2\x80\xa6 dispersed throughout the Republic\xe2\x80\x9d were necessary to meet the needs of the newly formed government: \xe2\x80\x9cAn effective Judiciary establishment commensurate to the legislative authority [is] essential.  A Government without a proper Executive [and] Judiciary would be the mere trunk of a body without arms or legs to act or move.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But despite Madison\xe2\x80\x99s objections, Rutledge\xe2\x80\x99s motion prevailed. See <em>id.</em>, at 125.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Madison and James Wilson soon thereafter proposed alternative language that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98empowered [Congress] to institute inferior tribunals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  This version moderated the original Virginia Plan because of the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinction between establishing such tribunals absolutely, and giving a discretion to the Legislature to establish or not establish [inferior federal courts].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Over continued objections that such courts were an unnecessary expense and an affront to the States, the scaled-back version of the Virginia Plan passed.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On June 15, 1787, however, the New Jersey Plan was introduced.  Although it did not directly challenge the decision to permit Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cinstitute\xe2\x80\x9d inferior federal courts, the plan, among other things, required state courts to adjudicate federal claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 125, 243.  In particular, the plan provided that, except for cases of impeachment (over which the Supreme Court would have original jurisdiction), \xe2\x80\x9call punishments, fines, forfeitures [and] penalties \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be adjudged by the Common law Judiciar[ies] of the State in which any offence contrary to the true intent [and] meaning of [federal law] shall have been committed or perpetrated, with liberty of commencing in the first instance all suits [and] prosecutions for that purpose in the superior Common law Judiciary in such State, subject nevertheless, for the correction of all errors, both in law [and] fact in rendering judgment, to an appeal to the Judiciary of the U[nited] States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 243, 244.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The introduction of the New Jersey Plan reignited the debate over the need for lower federal courts.  In light of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s provision for mandatory state-court jurisdiction over federal claims, Pierce Butler \xe2\x80\x9ccould see no necessity for such tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 <em>id.,</em> at 45.

But Nathaniel Ghorum responded that inferior federal tribunals were \xe2\x80\x9cessential to render the authority of the Nat[ional] Legislature effectual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 46.  Edmund Randolph bluntly argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Courts of the States can not be trusted with the administration of the National laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  George Mason suggested that, at the very least, \xe2\x80\x9cmany circumstances might arise not now to be foreseen, which might render such a power absolutely necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Roger Sherman also \xe2\x80\x9cwas willing to give the power to the Legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d even though he \xe2\x80\x9cwished them to make use of the State Tribunals whenever it could be done \xe2\x80\xa6 with safety to the general interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the conclusion of this debate, the New Jersey Plan, including its component requiring state-court consideration of federal claims, was defeated and the Madison-Wilson proposal was delivered to the Committee of Detail, see <em>id.</em>, at 133. The Committee amended the proposal\xe2\x80\x99s language to its current form in Article III, which gives Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9cordain and establish\xe2\x80\x9d inferior federal courts.  See <em>id.</em>, at 168.  The delegates to the Constitutional Convention unanimously adopted this revised version, see <em>id.</em>, at 315, and it was ultimately ratified by the States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This so-called Madisonian Compromise bridged the divide \xe2\x80\x9cbetween those who thought that the establishment of lower federal courts should be constitutionally mandatory and those who thought there should be no federal courts at all except for a Supreme Court with, <em>inter alia</em>, appellate jurisdiction to review state court judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\xe2\x80\x99s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 348 (4th ed. 1996).  In so doing, the compromise left to the wisdom of Congress the creation of lower federal courts: \xe2\x80\x9cSo far as the inferior Federal Courts were concerned, it was entirely discretionary with Congress to what extent it would vest Federal judicial power in them.  It could grant to them as much or as little as it chose of those classes of jurisdiction, enumerated in Article III as belonging to the judicial power of the United States.  It could, if it chose, leave to the State Courts all or any of these classes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warren, Federal Criminal Laws and the State Courts, 38 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 545, 547 (1925) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The assumption that state courts would continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims was essential to this compromise.

As discussed above, there was at least one proposal to expressly require state courts to take original jurisdiction over federal claims (subject to appeal in federal court) that was introduced in an attempt to forestall the creation of lower federal courts.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  But in light of the failure of this proposal\xe2\x80\x94which was offered before the adoption of the Madisonian Compromise\xe2\x80\x94the assertions by its supporters that state courts would ordinarily entertain federal causes of action cannot reasonably be viewed as an assurance that the States would never alter the subject-matter jurisdiction of their courts.  The Framers\xe2\x80\x99 decision to empower Congress to create federal courts that could either supplement or displace state-court review of federal claims, as well as the exclusion of any affirmative command requiring the States to consider federal claims in the text of Article III, confirm this understanding.

In short, there was \xe2\x80\x9ca very clear intimation given by the judges of the Supreme Court, that the state courts were not bound in consequence of any act of congress, to assume and exercise jurisdiction in such cases.  It was merely permitted to them to do so as far, as was compatible with their state obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kent 375; see also <em>id.</em>, at 377<em> </em>(explaining that the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cpermits state courts which are competent for the purpose, and have an inherent jurisdiction adequate to the case, to entertain suits in the given cases\xe2\x80\x9d). \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under our federal system, therefore, the States have unfettered authority to determine whether their local courts may entertain a federal cause of action.

New York Correction Law Annotated \xc2\xa724, \xc2\xb61 (West 1987) (NYCLA) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o civil action shall be brought in any court of the state, except by the attorney general on behalf of the state, against any officer or employee of the department, in his personal capacity, for damages arising out of any act done or the failure to perform any act within the scope of the employment and in the discharge of the duties by such officer or employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority and petitioner agree that this statute erects a jurisdictional bar that prevents the state courts from entertaining petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim for damages under \xc2\xa71983.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4 (agreeing that \xe2\x80\x9ca prisoner seeking damages from a correction officer will have his claim dismissed for want of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Petitioner 21 (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery New York court must immediately dismiss such suits for lack of jurisdiction, regardless of merit\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because New York\xe2\x80\x99s decision to withdraw jurisdiction over \xc2\xa71983 damages actions\xe2\x80\x94or indeed, over any claims\xe2\x80\x94does not offend the Constitution, the judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has evaded Article III\xe2\x80\x99s limitations by finding that the Supremacy Clause constrains the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to define the subject-matter jurisdiction of their own courts.

S. 111</a>, 120 (1965).  As a textual matter, however, the Supremacy Clause does not address whether a state court must entertain a federal cause of action; it provides only a rule of decision that the state court must follow if it adjudicates the claim.  See R. Berger, Congress v. The Supreme Court 245 (1969) (The Supremacy Clause only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98enacts what the law shall be\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

Its precursor was introduced as part of the New Jersey Plan.  See 1 Farrand 245 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll Acts of \xe2\x80\xa6 Cong[ress] made by virtue [and] in pursuance of the powers hereby \xe2\x80\xa6 vested in them \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be the supreme law of the respective States so far forth as those Acts \xe2\x80\xa6 shall relate to the said States or their Citizens\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Judiciary of the several States shall be bound thereby in their decisions, any thing in the respective laws of the Individual States \xe2\x80\xa6 notwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d).  But, as explained above, see <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, the New Jersey Plan also included an entirely separate provision that addressed state-court jurisdiction, which would have required all federal questions to \xe2\x80\x9cb[e] determined in the first instance in the courts of the respective states.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Farrand 287.  These two provisions of the New Jersey Plan worked in tandem to require state courts to entertain federal claims and to decide the substantive dispute in favor of federal law if a conflict between the two arose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the adoption of the Madisonian Compromise and the defeat of the New Jersey Plan, the Framers returned to the question of federal supremacy.  A proposal was introduced granting Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98negative all laws passed by the several States (contravening in the opinion of [Congress] the articles of Union, or any treaties subsisting under the authority of [Congress]).\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  2 <em>id.,</em> at 27.  James Madison believed the proposal \xe2\x80\x9cessential to the efficacy [and] security of the [federal] Gov[ernmen]t.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But others at the Convention, including Roger Sherman, \xe2\x80\x9cthought it unnecessary, as the Courts of the States would not consider as valid any law contravening the Authority of the Union, and which the legislature would wish to be negatived.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In the end, Madison\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was defeated.  <em>Id</em>., at 28.  But as a substitute for that rejected proposal, Luther Martin resurrected the Supremacy Clause provision from the New Jersey Plan and it was unanimously approved.  See <em>id.,</em> at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This historical record makes clear that the Supremacy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive function is to disable state laws that are substantively inconsistent with federal law\xe2\x80\x94not to require state courts to hear federal claims over which the courts lack jurisdiction.  This was necessarily the case when the clause was first introduced as part of the New Jersey Plan, as it included a separate provision to confront the jurisdictional question.  Had that plan prevailed and been ratified by the States, construing the Supremacy Clause to address state-court jurisdiction would have rendered the separate jurisdictional component of the New Jersey Plan mere surplusage.  See <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Kelo</em> v. <em>New London</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/469/index.html">545 U. S. 469</a>, 507 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supremacy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive focus on substantive state law is also evident from the context in which it was revived.  First, the Clause was not adopted until after the New Jersey Plan\xe2\x80\x99s rejection, as part of the entirely separate debate over Madison\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to grant Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d the laws of the States.  By then, the Framers had already adopted Article III, thereby ending the fight over state-court jurisdiction.  The question before the Convention thus was not which courts (state or federal) were best suited to adjudicate federal claims, but which branch of government (Congress or the courts) would be most effective in vindicating the substantive superiority of federal law.  The Supremacy Clause was directly responsive to that question.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the timing of the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s adoption suggests that the Framers viewed it as achieving the same end as Madison\xe2\x80\x99s congressional \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d proposal.  Although Madison believed that Congress could most effectively countermand inconsistent state laws,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the Framers decided that the Judiciary could adequately perform that function.  There is no evidence that the Framers envisioned the Supremacy Clause as having a substantively broader sweep than the proposal it replaced.  And, there can be no question that Madison\xe2\x80\x99s congressional \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d proposal was entirely unconcerned with the dispute over whether state courts should be required to exercise jurisdiction over federal claims.  Indeed, Madison\xe2\x80\x99s proposal did not require the States to become enmeshed in any federal business at all; it merely provided that state laws could be directly nullified if Congress found them to be inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States.  The role of the Supremacy Clause is no different.  It does not require state courts to entertain federal causes of action.  Rather, it only requires that in reaching the merits of such claims, state courts must decide the legal question in favor of the \xe2\x80\x9claw of the Land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For this reason, Representative Fisher Ames explained during the debate over the First Judiciary Act that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he law of the United States is a rule to [state-court judges], but no authority for them.  It controlled their decisions, but could not enlarge their powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Congress 808 (1789) (reprint 2003).  And because the Constitution requires from state judges only an oath of \xe2\x80\x9cAllegiance and not an Oath of Office,\xe2\x80\x9d the federal government \xe2\x80\x9c[c]annot compel them to act\xe2\x80\x94or to become our Officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Notes of William Patterson from Speech on Judiciary Act (June 23, 1789), in 9 Documentary History of the First Federal Congress 1789\xe2\x80\x931791, p. 477 (K. Bowling &amp; H. Veit eds. 1988); 1 Annals of Congress 805 (remarks of Rep. Sedgwick, Debate of Aug. 29, 1789) (arguing that inferior federal courts should be established because state courts \xe2\x80\x9cmight refuse or neglect to attend to the national business\xe2\x80\x9d); 10 <em>id.,</em> at 892 (remarks of Rep. Harper) (explaining that Congress \xe2\x80\x9ccannot enforce on the State courts, as a matter of duty, a performance of the acts we confide to them\xe2\x80\x9d but arguing that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno cause to complain\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuntil they refuse to exercise\xe2\x80\x9d the jurisdiction granted over federal claims).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The supremacy of federal law, therefore, is not impugned by a State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to strip its local courts of subject-matter jurisdiction to hear certain federal claims.  Subject-matter jurisdiction determines only whether a court has the power to entertain a particular claim\xe2\x80\x94a condition precedent to reaching the merits of a legal dispute.  See <em>Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/index.html">523 U. S. 83</a>, 94 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cWithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Although the line between subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim and the merits of that claim can at times prove difficult to draw, see <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 513\xe2\x80\x93515 (2006), see<em> </em>also <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/index.html">327 U. S. 678</a>, 682 (1946), the distinction is crucial in the Supremacy Clause context.  If the state court does not reach the merits of the dispute for lack of statutory or constitutional jurisdiction, the preeminence of federal law remains undiminished.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the superiority of federal law as a substantive matter does not trigger an obligation on States to keep their courts jurisdictionally neutral with respect to federal and state-law claims.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe federal law in any field within which Congress is empowered to legislate is the supreme law of the land in the sense that it may supplant state legislation in that field, but not in the sense that it may supplant the existing rules of litigation in state courts.  Congress has full power to provide its own courts for litigating federal rights.  The state courts belong to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Gerdes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/178/index.html">321 U.

In <em>Claflin</em>, the Court concluded that because the federal statute under consideration did not deprive the state court of jurisdiction, the state court was competent to resolve the claim.  See 93 U. S., at 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ights, whether legal or equitable, acquired under the laws of the United States, may be prosecuted in the United States courts, or in the State courts, competent to decide rights of the like character and class; subject, however, to this qualification, that where a right arises under a law of the United States, Congress may, if it see[s] fit, give to the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Court was careful to also explain that the Constitution did not impose an obligation on the States to accept jurisdiction over such claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 137 (explaining that there \xe2\x80\x9cis no reason why the State courts should not be open for the prosecution of rights growing out of the laws of the United States, to which their jurisdiction is competent, and not denied\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Constitution instead left the States with the choice\xe2\x80\x94but not the obligation\xe2\x80\x94to entertain federal actions.  See <em>id.</em>, at 139 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here no direction is given [from Congress] on the subject, it was assumed, in our early judicial history, that the State courts retained their usual jurisdiction concurrently with the Federal Courts invested with jurisdiction in like cases\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then in <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Cases,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/223/1/index.html">223 U. S. 1</a> (1912), the Court applied the rule set forth in <em>Claflin </em>and correctly rejected a Connecticut court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to enforce the 1908 Federal Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751 <em>et seq.  </em>FELA neither provided for exclusive federal jurisdiction nor attempted to require state courts to entertain claims brought under it.  See 223 U. S., at 54\xe2\x80\x9355.  Therefore, the statute was enforceable \xe2\x80\x9cas of right, in the courts of the States <em>when their jurisdiction, as prescribed by local laws, is adequate to the occasion</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 55 (emphasis added).  Connecticut had not deprived its courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over FELA claims; thus, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to hear the claim was \xe2\x80\x9cnot because the ordinary jurisdiction of the Superior Courts, as defined by the constitution and laws of the State, was deemed inadequate or not adapted to the adjudication of such a case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Rather, the state court took the position that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be inconvenient and confusing for the same court, in dealing with cases of the same general class, to apply in some the standards of right established by the congressional act and in others the different standards recognized by the laws of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 55\xe2\x80\x9356.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reversal of such a decision is compatible with the original understanding of Article III and the Supremacy Clause.  Because there was no question that the state court had subject-matter jurisdiction under state law to adjudicate the federal claim, <em>id.</em>, at 57, the Court correctly observed that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to decide the case amounted to a policy dispute with federal law: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress, in the exertion of the power confided to it by the Constitution, adopted that [federal] act, it spoke for all the people and all the States, and thereby established a policy for all.  That policy is as much the policy of Connecticut as if the act had emanated from its own legislature, and should be respected accordingly in the courts of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It was for this specific reason, then, that the Court rejected Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to adjudicate the federal claim.  As the Court correctly noted, the \xe2\x80\x9cexistence of the jurisdiction creates an implication of duty to exercise it, and that its exercise may be onerous does not militate against that implication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But nothing in <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99 </em>suggested that the Supremacy Clause could pre-empt a state law that deprived the local court of subject-matter jurisdiction over the federal claim.  Instead, the <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99 </em>Court took exactly the opposite position on this question: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e deem it well to observe that there is not here involved any attempt by Congress to enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction of state courts \xe2\x80\xa6 but only a question of the duty of such a court, when its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate to the occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court again confronted this issue in <em>Douglas</em> v. <em>New York, N.\xc2\xa0H. &amp; H. R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/279/377/index.html">279 U. S. 377</a> (1929).  There, the Court considered whether a New York court was required to hear a claim brought under FELA.  Unlike the Connecticut court in <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99</em>, however, the New York court did not have jurisdiction under state law to entertain the federal cause of action.  279 U. S., at 386\xe2\x80\x93387.  As a result, this Court upheld the state-court ruling that dismissed the claim.  The Court explained that FELA did \xe2\x80\x9cnot purport to require State Courts to entertain suits arising under it, but only to empower them to do so, so far as the authority of the United States is concerned.  It may very well be that if the Supreme Court of New York [was] given no discretion, being otherwise competent, it would be subject to a duty.  But there is nothing in the Act of Congress that purports to force a duty upon such Courts as against an otherwise valid excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 387\xe2\x80\x93388.  In other words, because the New York court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under state law, it was not \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise competent\xe2\x80\x9d to adjudicate the federal claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, <em>Claflin</em>, <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99</em>, and <em>Douglas</em> together establish that<em> </em>a state court\xe2\x80\x99s inability to entertain a federal claim because of a lack of state-law jurisdiction is an \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise valid excuse\xe2\x80\x9d that in no way denies the superiority of federal substantive law.  It simply disables the state court from adjudicating a claim brought under that federal law.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was not until five years after <em>Douglas</em> that the Court used the Supremacy Clause to strike down a state jurisdictional statute for its failure to permit state-court adjudication of federal claims.  See <em>McKnett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/230/index.html"></a><a href="/us/292/230/index.html">292 U. S. 230</a>.  The Court started by correctly noting that it \xe2\x80\x9cwas settled\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthat a state court whose ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate to the occasion, may not refuse to entertain suits under [FELA].\xe2\x80\x9d  292 U. S., at 233.  Yet, even though the Alabama court <em>lacked</em> such jurisdiction over the relevant federal claim pursuant to a state statute, the <em>McKnett </em>Court held that the state court had improperly dismissed the federal claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 231\xe2\x80\x93234.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile Congress has not attempted to compel states to provide courts for the enforcement of [FELA], the Federal Constitution prohibits state courts of general jurisdiction from refusing to do so solely because the suit is brought under a federal law.  The denial of jurisdiction by the Alabama court is based solely upon the source of law sought to be enforced.  The plaintiff is cast out because he is suing to enforce a federal act.  A state may not discriminate against rights arising under federal laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 233\xe2\x80\x93234.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all the reasons identified above, <em>McKnett</em> cannot be reconciled with the decisions of this Court that preceded it.  Unlike the Connecticut court in <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99</em>,<em> </em>the Alabama Supreme Court did not indulge its own bias against adjudication of federal claims in state court by refusing to hear a federal claim over which it had subject-matter jurisdiction.  Rather, like the New York court decision affirmed in <em>Douglas</em>,<em> </em>the Alabama court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal merely respected a jurisdictional barrier to adjudication of the federal claim imposed by state law.  The fact that Alabama courts were competent to hear similar state-law claims should have been immaterial.  Alabama had exercised its sovereign right to establish the subject-matter jurisdiction of its courts.  Under <em>Claflin </em>and its progeny, that legislative judgment should have been upheld.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Despite <em>McKnett</em>\xe2\x80\x99s infidelity to the Constitution and more than a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s later decisions have repeated <em>McKnett</em>\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that state jurisdictional statutes must be policed for antifederal discrimination.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Testa</em> v. <em>Katt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/index.html">330 U.

The outcome in these cases, however, can be reconciled with first principles notwithstanding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s stated reliance on <em>McKnett</em>\xe2\x80\x99s flawed interpretation of the Supremacy Clause.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Testa</em>, the Court struck down the Rhode Island Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to entertain a claim under the federal Emergency Price Control Act.

See 496 U. S., at 361, 375\xe2\x80\x93381.  The Florida court had interpreted the State\xe2\x80\x99s statutory \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver of sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d not to extend to federal claims brought in state court.  <em>Id.</em>, at 361 (citing Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7768.28 (1989)).  According to the state court, absent a statutory waiver, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing common-law sovereign immunity rule provided a \xe2\x80\x9cblanket immunity on [state] governmental entities from federal civil rights actions under \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x9d brought in Florida courts.  496 U. S., at 364.  Based on this rule, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of the \xc2\xa71983 suit against the state officials.  See <em>id.</em>, at 359; see also <em>Howlett </em>v. <em>Rose</em>, 537 So.\xc2\xa02d 706, 708 (Fla. App. 1989) (concluding that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommon law immunity\xe2\x80\x9d rule barred \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of its courts for suits against the state in those state courts\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No antidiscrimination rule was required to strike down the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Even though several Florida courts had concluded that the defense of sovereign immunity was jurisdictional, see 496 U. S., at 361, n.\xc2\xa05, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he force of the Supremacy Clause is not so weak that it can be evaded by mere mention of the word \xe2\x80\x98jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 382\xe2\x80\x93383.  That is, state courts cannot evade their obligation to enforce federal law by simply characterizing a statute or common-law rule as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d; the state law must in fact operate in a jurisdictional manner.  No matter where the line between subject-matter jurisdiction and the merits is drawn, see <em>supra</em>, at 14, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommon law immunity\xe2\x80\x9d rule crossed it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, because the Florida Supreme Court had dismissed the \xc2\xa71983 lawsuit with prejudice, its decision was on the merits.  Cf.<em> Semtek Int\xe2\x80\x99l Inc.</em> v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/497/index.html">531 U. S. 497</a>, 505 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98With prejudice\xe2\x80\x99 is an acceptable form of shorthand for \xe2\x80\x98an adjudication upon the merits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 9 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure  \xc2\xa72373, p. 396, n.\xc2\xa04 (1981))).  Second, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity rule violated the Supremacy Clause by operating as a state-law defense to a federal law.  See <em>Martinez</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/277/index.html">444 U. S. 277</a>, 284, n.\xc2\xa08 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[P]ermitt[ing] a state immunity defense to have controlling effect\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d over a federal claim violates the Supremacy Clause).  Resolving a federal claim with preclusive effect based on a state-law defense is far different from simply closing the door of the state courthouse to that federal claim.  The first changes federal law by denying relief on the merits; the second merely dictates the forum in which the federal claim will be heard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have said about it.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Graves</em> v. <em>New York ex rel. O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/306/466/index.html">306 U. S. 466</a>, 491\xe2\x80\x93492 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  And contrary to <em>McKnett</em>, the Constitution does not require state courts to give equal billing to state and federal claims.  To read the Supremacy Clause to include an anti-discrimination principle undermines the compromise that shaped Article III and contradicts the original understanding of Constitution.  There is no justification for preserving such a principle.  But even if the Court chooses to adhere to the antidiscrimination rule as part of the Supremacy Clause inquiry, the rule\xe2\x80\x99s infidelity to the text, structure, and history of the Constitution counsels against extending the principle any further than our precedent requires.  Cf.<em> United States</em> v. <em>Lopez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html">514 U. S. 549</a>, 584\xe2\x80\x93585 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring); see <em>infra</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Supremacy Clause does not, on its own force, pre-empt state jurisdictional statutes of any kind, it may still pre-empt state law once Congress has acted.  Federal law must prevail when Congress validly enacts a statute that expressly supersedes state law, see <em>Sprietsma</em> v. <em>Mercury Marine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/51/index.html">537 U.

Under \xc2\xa71983, any state official who denies \xe2\x80\x9cany citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof \xe2\x80\xa6 any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute addresses who may sue and be sued for violations of federal law.  But it includes no substantive command requiring New York to provide a state judicial forum to a \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff.  See <em>Felder</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/131/index.html"></a><a href="/us/487/131/index.html">487 U.

S. ___, ___ (2009)  (slip op., at 9) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that the Court has alternatively described the standard for conflict pre-emption as \xe2\x80\x9cphysical impossibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdirect conflict\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).  As explained above, Congress did not grant \xc2\xa71983 plaintiffs a \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to bring their claims in state court or \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee\xe2\x80\x9d that the state forum would remain open to their suits.  See <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 12).<em> </em>Moreover, Congress has created inferior federal courts that have the power to adjudicate all \xc2\xa71983 actions.  And this Court has expressly determined that \xc2\xa71983 plaintiffs do not have to exhaust state-court remedies before proceeding in federal court.  See <em>Patsy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 516.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Therefore, even if every state court closed its doors to \xc2\xa71983 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs could proceed with their claims in the federal forum.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Felder</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 160 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery plaintiff has the option of proceeding in federal court, and the Wisconsin statute has not the slightest effect on that right\xe2\x80\x9d).  And because the dismissal of \xc2\xa71983 claims from state court pursuant to NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, see <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939,<em> </em>it has no preclusive effect on claims refiled in federal court, see <em>Allen</em> v. <em>McCurry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/index.html">449 U.

Any contention\nthat NYCLA \xc2\xa724 conflicts with \xc2\xa71983 therefore would be misplaced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nevertheless has relied on an expansive brand of \xe2\x80\x9cconflict\xe2\x80\x9d pre-emption to strike down state-court procedural rules that are perceived to \xe2\x80\x9cburde[n] the exercise of the federal right\xe2\x80\x9d in state court.  <em>Felder</em>, 487 U.

In such cases, the Court has asked if the state-law rule, when applied \xe2\x80\x9cto \xc2\xa71983 actions brought in state courts [is] consistent with the goals of the federal civil rights laws, or does the enforcement of such a requirement instead \xe2\x80\x98stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 138 (quoting <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U.

There has been no suggestion in this case, however, that NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is a procedural rule that must be satisfied in order to bring the \xc2\xa71983 action in state court.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939;<em> infra</em>, at 27; see also <em>ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa09.

The majority concedes not only that NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is jurisdictional, but that the statute is neutral with respect to federal and state claims.

See <em>id.</em>, at 189 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe only limitation upon the freedom of a State to define the jurisdiction of its own courts is that \xe2\x80\xa6 [it] must treat litigants under the Federal act as other litigants are treated\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Herb</em> v. <em>Pitcairn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/117/index.html"></a><a href="/us/324/117/index.html">324 U.

A jurisdictional statute simply deprives the relevant court of the power to decide the case altogether.  See 10A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa72713, p. 239 (3d ed. 1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the court has no jurisdiction, it has no power to enter a judgment on the merits and must dismiss the action\xe2\x80\x9d); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa711, p. 108 (1980) (defining subject-matter jurisdiction as a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such a statute necessarily operates without prejudice to the adjudication of the matter in a competent forum.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Jurisdictional statutes therefore by definition are incapable of undermining federal law.  NYCLA \xc2\xa724 no more undermines \xc2\xa71983 than the amount-in-controversy requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction undermines state law.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332.  The relevant law (state or federal) remains fully operative in both circumstances.  The sole consequence of the jurisdictional barrier is that the law cannot be enforced in one particular judicial forum.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on New York\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for enacting this jurisdictional statute is entirely misplaced.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.

But Congress has not enforced that judgment by statutorily requiring the States to open their courts to <em>all </em>\xc2\xa71983 claims.

Because NYCLA \xc2\xa724 does not violate this command, any policy-driven reasons for depriving jurisdiction over a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal claim in addition to an identical state claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, are irrelevant for purposes of the Supremacy Clause.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Howlett</em> is not to the contrary.  Despite the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, <em>Howlett </em>does not stand for the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat a State cannot employ a jurisdictional rule \xe2\x80\x98to dissociate itself from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>Howlett</em>, 496 U. S., at 371).  As an initial matter, the majority lifts the above quotation\xe2\x80\x94which was merely part of a passage explaining that a \xe2\x80\x9cState may not discriminate against federal causes of action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 372\xe2\x80\x94entirely out of context.  <em>Howlett</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reiteration of <em>McKnett\xe2\x80\x99</em>s neutrality command, which is all the selected quotation reflects, see 496 U. S., at 372\xe2\x80\x93373, offers no refuge to the majority in light of its concession that NYCLA \xc2\xa724 affords \xe2\x80\x9cequal treatment\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cfederal and state claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Howlett </em>instead stands for the unremarkable proposition that States may not add immunity defenses to \xc2\xa71983.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa05 (explaining that <em>Howlett </em>held that \xe2\x80\x9ca Florida school board could [not] assert a state-law immunity defense in a \xc2\xa71983 action brought in state court\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98elements of, and the defenses to, a federal cause of action are defined by federal law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 496 U. S., at 375)).<em> </em>A state law is not jurisdictional just because the legislature has \xe2\x80\x9cdenominated\xe2\x80\x9d it as such.  <em>Id., </em>at 381.  As the majority observes, the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinvocation of \xe2\x80\x98jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d cannot \xe2\x80\x9ctrump\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cSupremacy Clause inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The majority, therefore, is correct that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cto nullify a federal right or cause of action [that it] believe[s] is inconsistent with [its] local policies\xe2\x80\x9d cannot evade the Supremacy Clause by hiding behind a jurisdictional label, <em>ante</em>, at 6, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe Supremacy Clause cannot be evaded by formalism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Rather, a state statute must in fact <em>operate</em> jurisdictionally: It must deprive the court of the power to hear the claim and it must not preclude relitigation of the action in a proper forum.  See <em>supra</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  <em>Howlett </em>proved the point by striking down a state-law immunity rule that bore the jurisdictional label but operated as a defense on the merits and provided for the dismissal of the state court action with prejudice.  See 496 U. S., at 359; <em>supra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s axiomatic refrain about jurisdictional labels is entirely unresponsive to the issue before the Court\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>whether NYCLA \xc2\xa724 operates jurisdictionally.  Unlike the Florida immunity rule in <em>Howlett</em>, NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is not a defense to a federal claim and the dismissal it authorizes is without prejudice.  See 9 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 481, 490, 881 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 180, 186 (2007) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature did nothing more than exercise its prerogative to establish the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9clitigants like plaintiff can use the federal courts to pursue section 1983 claims\xe2\x80\x9d against correction officers).  For this reason, NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is not merely \xe2\x80\x9cdenominated\xe2\x80\x9d as jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x94it actually is jurisdictional.  The New York courts, therefore, have not declared a \xe2\x80\x9ccategory\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71983 claims to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98frivolous\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or to have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no merit\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in order to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relieve congestion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the state-court system.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (quoting <em>Howlett, supra</em>, at 380).  These courts have simply recognized that they lack the power to adjudicate this category of claims regardless of their merit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s failure to grapple with the clear differences between the immunity rule at issue in <em>Howlett </em>and NYCLA \xc2\xa724 proves that its decision is untethered from precedent.  And more broadly, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s failure to account for the important role of claim preclusion in evaluating whether a statute is jurisdictional undermines the important line drawn by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions between subject-matter jurisdiction and the merits.  See <em>Marrese</em> v. <em>American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/373/index.html">470 U. S. 373</a>, 382 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to matters that were not decided in the state proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 claim preclusion generally does not apply where \xe2\x80\x98the plaintiff was unable to \xe2\x80\xa6 seek a remedy because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa726(1)(c)(1982))); see also <em>Arbaugh</em>, 546 U.

S., at<em> </em>94.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s principal response is that NYCLA \xc2\xa724 \xe2\x80\x9cis effectively an immunity statute cloaked in jurisdictional garb.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But this curious rejoinder resurrects an argument that the majority abandons earlier in its own opinion.  See <em>ante,</em> at 7, n.\xc2\xa05.  The majority needs to choose.  Either it should definitively commit to making the impossible case that a statute denying state courts the power to entertain a claim without prejudice to its reassertion in federal court is an immunity defense in disguise, or it should clearly explain why some other aspect of <em>Howlett </em>controls the outcome of this case.  This Court has required Congress to speak clearly when it intends to \xe2\x80\x9cupset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gregory,</em> 501 U. S., at 460.  It should require no less of itself.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At bottom, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s warning that upholding New York\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9cwould permit a State to withhold a forum for the adjudication of any federal cause of action with which it disagreed as long as the policy took the form of a jurisdictional rule\xe2\x80\x9d is without any basis in fact.  <em>Ante, </em>at 13, n.\xc2\xa09. This Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional neutrality command already guards against antifederal discrimination.  A decision upholding NYCLA \xc2\xa724, which fully adheres to that rule, would not \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvent our prior decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It simply would adhere to them.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also incorrectly concludes that NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is not a neutral jurisdictional statute because it applies to a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow class of defendants,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, and because New York courts \xe2\x80\x9chear the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of all other \xc2\xa71983 actions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.  A statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional status does not turn on its narrowness or on its breadth.  See <em>Arbaugh, supra</em>, at 515, n.\xc2\xa011.  Rather, as explained above, a statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional status turns on the grounds on which the state-law dismissal rests and the consequences that follow from such rulings.  No matter how narrow the majority perceives NYCLA \xc2\xa724 to be, it easily qualifies as jurisdictional under this established standard.  Accordingly, it is immaterial that New York has chosen to allow its courts of general jurisdiction to entertain \xc2\xa71983 actions against certain categories of defendants but not others (such as correction officers), or to entertain \xc2\xa71983 actions against particular defendants for only certain types of relief.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Building on its assumption that a statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional status turns on its scope, the majority further holds that \xe2\x80\x9chaving made the decision to create courts of general jurisdiction that regularly sit to entertain analogous suits, New York is not at liberty to shut the courthouse door to federal claims that it considers at odds with its local policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But whether two claims are \xe2\x80\x9canalogous\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant only for purposes of determining whether a state jurisdictional statute discriminates against federal law.  This inquiry necessarily requires an evaluation of the similarities between <em>federal</em> and <em>state</em> law claims to assess whether state-court jurisdiction is being denied to a federal claim simply because of its federal character.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, the majority limits its analysis to state-law claims, finding discrimination based solely on the fact that state law provides jurisdiction in state court for claims against state officials who serve in \xe2\x80\x9canalogous\xe2\x80\x9d roles to the correction officers.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry is not probative of antifederal discrimination, which is the concern that first led this Court in <em>McKnett </em>to find a Supremacy Clause limitation on state-court jurisdictional autonomy.  Consequently, there is no support for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that New York\xe2\x80\x99s decision to treat police officers differently from correction officers for purposes of civil litigation somehow violates the Constitution.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Worse still, the majority concludes that \xc2\xa71983 claims for damages against \xe2\x80\x9cother state officials\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently analogous to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71983 claims\xe2\x80\x9d to trigger a Supremacy Clause violation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa06.<em> </em>Under this reasoning, if a State grants its trial courts jurisdiction to hear \xc2\xa71983 claims for damages against <em>any </em>state official, the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny those courts the power to entertain some narrower species of \xc2\xa71983 claims\xe2\x80\x94even on jurisdictionally neutral terms\xe2\x80\x94<em>a fortiori </em>violates the Supremacy Clause.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that its holding is applicable only to New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunique scheme\xe2\x80\x9d thus rings hollow.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The majority is forcing States into an all-or-nothing choice that neither the Constitution nor this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions require.  See <em>FERC</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/index.html">456 U. S. 742</a>, 774, n.\xc2\xa04 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be open to us to insist on adjudication in a state court of a federal claim arising beyond the jurisdiction of the local court\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s novel approach breaks the promise that the States still enjoy \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98great latitude \xe2\x80\xa6 to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Howlett</em>, 496 U. S., at 372).  It cannot be that New York has forsaken the right to withdraw a particular class of claims from its courts\xe2\x80\x99 purview simply because it has created courts of general jurisdiction that would otherwise have the power to hear suits for damages against correction officers.  The Supremacy Clause does not fossilize the jurisdiction of state courts in their original form.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, States remain free to alter the structure of their judicial system even if that means certain federal causes of action will no longer be heard in state court, so long as States do so on nondiscriminatory terms.  See <em>Printz</em>, 521 U. S., at  906, n.\xc2\xa01. (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe States obviously regulate the \xe2\x80\x98ordinary jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 of their courts\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Fankell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/911/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/911/index.html">520 U.

By imposing on state courts a duty to accept subject-matter jurisdiction over federal \xc2\xa71983 actions, the Court has stretched the Supremacy Clause beyond all reasonable bounds and upended a compromise struck by the Framers in Article III of the Constitution.  Furthermore, by declaring unconstitutional even those laws that divest state courts of jurisdiction over federal claims on a non-discriminatory basis, the majority has silently overturned this Court\xe2\x80\x99s unbroken line of decisions upholding state statutes that are materially indistinguishable from the New York law under review.  And it has transformed a single exception to the rule of state judicial autonomy into a virtually ironclad obligation to entertain federal business.

Madison appears to have preferred that the state courts hear as little federal business as possible.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority contends that the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause support its view of the Supremacy Clause because each \xe2\x80\x9ccompel[s] States to open their courts to causes of action over which they would normally lack jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa07 (citing <em>Howlett</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/496/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/496/356/index.html">496 U. S. 356</a>, 381\xe2\x80\x93382 (1990)).  But the majority has it backwards.  The Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause include a textual prohibition on discrimination that the Supremacy Clause lacks.  See Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa71 (\xe2\x80\x9cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State\xe2\x80\x9d); Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa72 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Framers\xe2\x80\x99 decision to address state-to-state discrimination in these two clauses without taking similar steps with respect to federal-state relations governed by the Supremacy Clause aligns with reasons given for abandoning the Articles of Confederation, see The Federalist No. 42, p. 292 (E. Bourne ed. 1947) (J. Madison) (describing the Full Faith and Credit Clause as \xe2\x80\x9can evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the articles of Confederation\xe2\x80\x9d), and the principle of dual sovereignty that the Constitution preserves, see <em>Texas</em> v. <em>White</em>, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869).  Accordingly, contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s supposition, there are in fact strong \xe2\x80\x9creason[s] to treat the Supremacy Clause differently,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa07,<em> </em>from the Full Faith and Credit and Privileges and Immunities Clauses.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Other decisions also have articulated this antidiscrimination principle.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Fankell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/911/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/911/index.html">520 U. S. 911</a> (1997); <em>Missouri ex rel.

The outcomes in these cases nonetheless preserved state-court jurisdictional autonomy. <em> </em>In <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Herb</em>, the Court sustained the state-court dismissals of the federal claims as nondiscriminatory.  See <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 918\xe2\x80\x93920; <em>Herb</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 123.  In <em>Mayfield</em>, the Court never decided whether the state court had jurisdiction over the relevant federal claim; rather, it remanded the case to the Missouri Supreme Court based on the state court\xe2\x80\x99s possibly erroneous interpretation of federal law at issue in that case.  See 340 U. S., at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Finally, in <em>Miles</em>, the Court struck down a Tennessee decision that enjoined a citizen of that State from pursuing a FELA action in Missouri state court \xe2\x80\x9con grounds of inequity.\xe2\x80\x9d  315 U. S., at 702.  The Court correctly held that, so long as jurisdiction existed under Missouri law, the Tennessee court could not rely on its own notions of \xe2\x80\x9cinequity\xe2\x80\x9d to thwart the vindication of a federal right in state court.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Despite suggestions to the contrary, see <em>ante</em>, at 5; <em>Howlett</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/496/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/496/356/index.html">496 U.

As quoted above, the Court (in dicta) accurately summarized the holding of <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99</em>.  See 241 U. S., at 222.

S., at 141, its argument is equally misplaced.  First, the majority concedes that NYCLA \xc2\xa724 is not a state procedural rule.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa08.  Second, applying the reasoning of <em>Felder </em>to a jurisdictional statute like NYCLA \xc2\xa724 would overrule all of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions upholding state laws that decline jurisdiction over federal claims, and would virtually ensure that in future cases, no state jurisdictional rule will be upheld as constitutional.  By simply rendering a federal claim noncognizable in state court, a statute depriving a state court of subject-matter jurisdiction (even under the terms and conditions permitted by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent) will always violate <em>Felder</em>\xe2\x80\x99s command that a state rule must not undermine the \xe2\x80\x9cremedial objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal claim, see 487 U. S., at 138.  The jurisdictional statute also will unavoidably implicate <em>Felder</em>\xe2\x80\x99s concern that a state rule should not inevitably produce a different outcome depending on whether a claim is asserted in state or federal court, see <em>ibid</em>.  A state jurisdictional statute necessarily will result in a different outcome in state court, where it will cause dismissal of the federal claim, than in federal court, where that claim will be heard.  It is for this reason that the Court has been careful to keep its examination of state jurisdictional statutes and state procedural rules in different categories.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority also suggests that allowing jurisdictional neutrality to be the test \xe2\x80\x9cwould create a blind spot in the Supremacy Clause\xe2\x80\x9d because a procedural rule that too heavily burdens a federal cause of action would be struck down as unconstitutional while \xe2\x80\x9ca State could express its disagreement with (and even open hostility to) a federal cause of action, declare a desire to thwart its enforcement, and achieve that goal by removing the disfavored category of claims from its courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa08.<em> </em> This is incorrect for at least two reasons.  First, as explained above, a State may permissibly register its hostility to federal law only by subjecting analogous state-law claims to equally disfavored treatment.  See <em>supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Hostility to federal law is thus irrelevant under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent\xe2\x80\x94the Supremacy Clause is concerned only with whether there is antifederal discrimination.  Second, the majority obscures important differences between procedural rules, like the notice-of-claim rule at issue in <em>Felder</em>, and neutral jurisdictional statutes like NYCLA \xc2\xa724.<em> </em> Unlike a neutral jurisdictional statute, which merely prevents a state court from entertaining a federal claim, failure to comply with a state procedural rule will result in dismissal of a federal claim with prejudice.  See <em>Felder</em>, 487 U. S., at 151 (explaining that the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coutcome-determinative law must give way when a party asserts a federal right in state court\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, therefore, it is not that state courts with \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutionally burdensome procedural rules did not go far enough\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it is instead that they went too far by placing an insurmountable procedural hurdle in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s path that led to a judgment against him on the merits.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa08.  As a result, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of whether a state procedural rule too heavily burdens a federal right does not have any bearing on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s continued adherence to the neutrality principle as the sole determinant in evaluating state-law jurisdictional statutes.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
