Lewis, as counsel for the prisoner, took two exceptions on the trial: 1st. That it was not proved, that the defendant was an inhabitant of Wright\'s Town, as stated in the process of outlawry; for though it appeared that he worked there, he contended that circumstance alone did not establish a residence. 2nd. That the addition is false and defective; for, he is called \'Yeoman,\' which means (contrary to the fact) that he is a free-holder of the value of 40 shillings per annum; and the addition does not extend to the town or hamlet, the name, degree, or mistery, without which the outlawry is void. 1 Bl.
