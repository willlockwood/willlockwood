Wherefore the said Samuel says he is prejudiced, and hath sustained damages to the value of L 1000, &amp;c.\' </p><p> The counsel for the defendants, Lewis, demurred to the declaration, upon this ground, that a tenant by the curtesy cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 2 U.S. 257, 259</a></p><p> maintain the writ of partition; and the demurrer was opposed by Wells. </p><p> For the plaintiff, it was admitted, that partition could only be compelled at common law, between parceners; and that the 31 Hen. 8. c. 1. only gives the writ where the party is seized of the inheritance: But, it was contended, that the 32 Hen. 8 c. 32 was designed to give relief in cases not relievable at common law, nor within the provisions of the preceding statute. Thus, in Hargr. Co. Litt. 175. a. b. it is stated, that tenant by the curtesy, though not named in the 32 Hen. 8. is within its equity; and in 3 Bac. Abr. 211. 16 Vin. Abr 233 it is expressly declared, that tenant by the curtesy shall have a rit of partition on that statute. F. N. B. 336 Unless, indeed, he is allowed the benefit of this writ, he has a clear right, without an adequate remedy; for, although he might bring an ejectment, and put himself in possession with the defendants, he could not divide the estate. </p><p> For the defendants, it was observed, that their single object in the demurrer was to take the opinion of the Court; as a decision, either way, would be satisfactory to them; and they were, indeed, desirous that a partition should be effected, provided it was done in a legal and valid form, so as to bind the minor daughter of the plaintiff, who is entitled to the reversion. But, it was urged, that in all the books of entries ( which had been laboriously searched for the occasion) not one precedent could be found of a writ of partition, issuing at the suit of a tenant by the curtesy. The common law does not give him that remedy; the statute of the 31 Hen. 8. c. 1, gives it only to, and against, joint tenants, or tenants in common, seized of an estate of inheritance; and though the 32 Hen. 8. c. 32 extends the operation of the preceding statute, by giving the writ of partition to joint tenants, and tenants in common, seized of an estate of inheritance against tenants for life, or years, (embracing, by an equitable construction, the case of tenants by the curtesy, as tenants for life) it does not, e converso, give the writ to tenants for life, or years, nor consequently, constructively, to tenants by the curtesy, as tenants for life. It is true, Lord Coke says, that \'the tenant by the curtesy shall have a writ of partition upon the statute of 32 Hen. 8. c. 32.\'; Co. Litt. 175. a. but this general dictum, referring to Bro. lit. \'partition;\', 41. is not supported by the case, which was a writ of partition against, and not for, a tenant by the curtesy; the reason assigned for the dictum by the commentator, \'that a proecipe lieth against tenant by the curtesy,\' is a good reason, why he should be defendant, but not why he should be plaintiff, in partition; and the dictum is refuted by the plain language of the statute itself as well as by the universal silence of every book, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="260">Page 2 U.S. 257, 260</a></p><p> in which, if such a writ could ever have been maintained, precedents would most certainly have been recorded. </p><p> By the Court: Great doubt and difficulty have arisen in this case, from the force of the arguments used by the counsel for the defendants. As, therefore, the object of the plaintiff may be safely and effectually attained by a compromise, in which the defendants declare themselves ready to unite, we wish to avoid an immediate decision of the point of law, that has been agitated.* </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] On this intimation, the parties entered into an amicable partition by deed, which terminated the controversy. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
