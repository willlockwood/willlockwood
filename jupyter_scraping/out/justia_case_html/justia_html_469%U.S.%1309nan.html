The order holds the Administrator in contempt for failing to promulgate certain emission standards for radionuclides as required by an earlier District Court order.  The controversy has reached this point due to a disagreement between the District Court and the agency over the construction of \xc2\xa7 112(b)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act, as added, 84 Stat. 1685, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7412(b)(1)(B), which governs the actions the agency must take with respect to establishing emission standards for hazardous air pollutants.  Essentially, the District Court reads the section to require the EPA either to promulgate emission standards for all sources of the pollutant previously identified by the agency or to make a specific finding that the pollutant "is not a hazardous air pollutant"; the agency believes that, under the section, it may establish standards for some sources but not for others. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1310">Page 469 U.

Capps,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/1312/case.html">449 U. S. 1312</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/1312/case.html#1313">449 U. S. 1313</a></span> (1981) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers).  They have not pointed us to a conflict of authority on the issue decided by the District Court.  Under those circumstances I do not think a stay is in order.  Even if the Court of Appeals were to affirm the District Court, I am by no means certain that four Members of this Court would vote to grant certiorari to review this statutory question.</p>\n<p>The applications for stay are accordingly denied.</p>\n<p>* Together with No. A-40, <em>Idaho Miniing Association v. Sierra Clubm et al.,</em> also on application for stay of the same order.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
