CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the respondent has standing to bring an action as a federal taxpayer [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] alleging that certain provisions concerning public reporting of expenditures under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 208, 50 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 418 U. S. 168</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 403a <em>et seq.,</em> violate Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, of the Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<p>"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."</p>\n<p>Respondent brought this suit in the United States District Court on a complaint in which he recites attempts to obtain from the Government information concerning detailed expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency.  According to the complaint, respondent wrote to the Government Printing Office in 1967 and requested that he be provided with the documents "published by the Government in compliance with Article I, section 9, clause (7) of the United States Constitution."  The Fiscal Service of the Bureau of Accounts of the Department of the Treasury replied, explaining that it published the document known as the Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures, and Balances of the United States Government.  Several copies of the monthly and daily reports of the office were sent with the letter.  Respondent then wrote to the same office and, quoting part of the CIA Act, asked whether this statute did not "cast reflection upon the authenticity of the Treasury\'s Statement."  He also inquired as to how he could receive further information on the expenditures of the CIA.  The Bureau of Accounts replied stating that it had no other available information.</p>\n<p>In another letter, respondent asserted that the CIA Act was repugnant to the Constitution and requested that the Treasury Department seek an opinion of the Attorney General.  The Department answered declining to seek such an opinion, and this suit followed.  Respondent\'s complaint asked the court to</p>\n<p>"issue a permanent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 418 U. S. 169</a></p><p> injunction enjoining the defendants from publishing their \'Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures and Balances of the United States Government\' and representing it as the fulfillment of the mandates of Article I Section 9 Clause 7 until same fully complies with those mandates. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>In essence, the respondent asked the federal court to declare unconstitutional that provision of the Central Intelligence Agency Act which permits the Agency to account for its expenditures "solely on the certificate of the Director. . . ."  50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 403j(b).  The only injury alleged by respondent was that he "cannot obtain a document that sets out the expenditures and receipts" of the CIA, but, on the contrary, was "asked to accept a fraudulent document."  The District Court granted a motion for dismissal on the ground respondent lacked standing under <em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span> (1968), and that the subject matter raised political questions not suited for judicial disposition.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals sitting en banc, with three judges dissenting, reversed, 465 F.2d 844 (CA3 1972), holding that the respondent had standing to bring this action. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The majority relied chiefly on <em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 418 U. S. 170</a></p><p> <em>supra,</em> and its two-tier test that taxpayer standing rests on a showing of (a) a "logical link" between the status a a taxpayer and the challenged legislative enactment, <em>i.e.,</em> an attack on an enactment under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, of the Constitution; and (b) a "nexus" between the plaintiff\'s status and a specific constitutional limitation imposed on the taxing and spending power.  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U. S. 102</a></span>-103.  While noting that the respondent did not directly attack an appropriations act, as did the plaintiff in <em>Flast,</em> the Court of Appeals concluded that the CIA statute challenged by the respondent was "integrally related," 465 F.2d at 853, to his ability to challenge the appropriations, since he could not question an appropriation about which he had no knowledge.  The Court of Appeal seemed to rest its holding on an assumption that this case was a prelude to a later case challenging, on the basis of information obtained in this suit, some particular appropriation for or expenditure of the CIA; respondent stated no such an intention in his complaint.  The dissenters took a different approach urging denial of standing principally because, in their view, respondent alleged no specific injury, but only a general interest common to all members of the public.</p>\n<p>We conclude that respondent lacks standing to maintain a suit for the relief sought, and we reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="171">Page 418 U.

Madison,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), this Court held that judicial power may be exercised only in a case properly before it -- a "case or controversy" not suffering any of the limitations of the political question doctrine, not then moot or calling for an advisory opinion.  In <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U. S. 204</a></span> (1962), this limitation was described in terms that a federal court cannot</p>\n<p>"\'pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.\'  <em>Liverpool Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/113/33/case.html">113 U. S. 33</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/113/33/case.html#39">113 U. S. 39</a></span>."</p>\n<p>Recently, in <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html">397 U. S. 150</a></span> (1970), the Court, while noting that "[g]eneralizations about standing to sue are largely worthless as such," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html#151">397 U. S. 151</a></span>, emphasized that</p>\n<p>"[o]ne generalization is, however, necessary, and that is that the question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered in the framework of Article III, which restricts judicial power to \'cases\' and \'controversies.\' [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>Although the recent holding of the Court in <em>Flast v. Cohen, supra,</em> is a starting point in an examination of respondent\'s claim to prosecute this suit as a taxpayer, that case must be read with reference to its principal predecessor, <em>Frothingham v. Mellon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html">262 U. S. 447</a></span> (1923).  In <em>Frothingham,</em> the injury alleged was that the congressional enactment challenged as unconstitutional would, if implemented, increase the complainants </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 418 U. S. 172</a></p><p> future federal income taxes. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Denying standing, the <em>Frothingham</em> Court rested on the "comparatively minute[,] remote, fluctuating and uncertain," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#487">262 U. S. 487</a></span>, impact on the taxpayer, and the failure to allege the kind of direct injury required for standing.</p>\n<p>"The party who invokes the [judicial] power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained, or is immediately in danger of sustaining, some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#488">262 U. S. 488</a></span>.</p>\n<p>When the Court addressed the question of standing in <em>Flast,</em> Mr. Chief Justice Warren traced what he described as the "confusion" following <em>Frothingham</em> as to whether the Court had announced a constitutional doctrine barring suits by taxpayers challenging federal expenditures as unconstitutional, or simply a policy rule of judicial self-restraint.  In an effort to clarify the confusion and to take into account intervening developments, of which class actions and joinder under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were given as examples, the Court embarked on "a fresh examination of the limitations upon standing to sue in a federal court and the application of those limitations to taxpayer suits."  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#94">392 U. S. 94</a></span>.  That reexamination led, however, to the holding that a "taxpayer will have standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 418 U. S. 173</a></p><p> judicial power when he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of those constitutional provisions <em>which operate to restrict the exercise of the taxing and spending power.</em>"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#105">392 U. S. 105</a></span>-106.  (Emphasis supplied.)  In so holding, the Court emphasized that Art. III requirements are the threshold inquiry:</p>\n<p>"The \'gist of the question of standing\' is whether the party seeking relief has \'alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness . . . upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#99">392 U. S. 99</a></span>, citing <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> 369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U. S. 204</a></span>.  The Court then announced a two-pronged standing test which requires allegations:  (a) challenging an enactment under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, of the Constitution; and (b) claiming that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed on the taxing and spending power.  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U. S. 102</a></span>-103.  While the "impenetrable barrier to suits against Acts of Congress brought by individuals who can assert only the interest of federal taxpayers," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#85">392 U. S. 85</a></span>, had been slightly lowered, the Court made clear it was reaffirming the principle of <em>Frothingham</em> precluding a taxpayer\'s use of</p>\n<p>"a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#106">392 U. S. 106</a></span>.  The narrowness of that holding is emphasized by the concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in <em>Flast:</em></p>\n<p>"In concluding that the appellants therefore have standing to sue, we do not undermine the salutary principle, established by <em>Frothingham</em> and reaffirmed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 418 U. S. 174</a></p><p> today, that a taxpayer may not \'employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#114">392 U. S. 114</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although the Court made it very explicit in <em>Flast</em> that a "fundamental aspect of standing" is that it focuses primarily on the party seeking to get his complaint before the federal court, rather than "on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#99">392 U. S. 99</a></span>, it made equally clear that,</p>\n<p>"in ruling on [taxpayer] standing, it is both appropriate and necessary to look to the substantive issues for another purpose, namely, to determine whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted an the claim sought to be adjudicated."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U. S. 102</a></span>. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We therefore turn to an examination of the issues sought to be raised by respondent\'s complaint to determine whether he is "a proper and appropriate party to invoke federal judicial power," <em>ibid.,</em> with respect to those issues.</p>\n<p>We need not and do not reach the merits of the constitutional attack on the statute; our inquiry into the "substantive issues" is for the limited purpose indicated above.  The mere recital of the respondent\'s claims and an examination of the statute under attack demonstrate how far he falls short of the standing criteria of <em>Flast</em> and how neatly he falls within the <em>Frothingham</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 418 U. S. 175</a></p><p> holding left undisturbed.  Although the status he rests on is that he is a taxpayer, his challenge is not addressed to the taxing or spending power, but to the statutes regulating the CIA, specifically 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 403j(b).  That section provides different accounting and reporting requirements and procedures for the CIA, as is also done with respect to other governmental agencies dealing in confidential areas. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent makes no claim that appropriated funds are being spent in violation of a "specific constitutional limitation upon the . . . taxing and spending power. . . ."  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#104">392 U. S. 104</a></span>.  Rather, he asks the courts to compel the Government to give him information on precisely how the CIA spends its funds.  Thus, there is no "logical nexus" between the asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of the Congress to require the Executive to supply a more detailed report of the expenditures of that agency. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The question presented thus is simply and narrowly whether these claims meet the standards for taxpayer standing set forth in <em>Flast;</em> we hold they do not.  Respondent is seeking "to employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government."  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#106">392 U.

S. 176</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that the basis of taxpayer standing</p>\n<p>"need not always be the appropriation and the spending of [taxpayer\'s] money for an invalid purpose.

There Levitt sought to challenge the validity of the commission of a Supreme Court Justice who had been nominated and confirmed as such while he was a member of the Senate.  Levitt alleged that the appointee had voted for an increase in the emoluments provided by Congress for Justices of the Supreme Court during the term for which he was last elected to the United States Senate.  The claim was that the appointment violated the explicit prohibition of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 2, of the Constitution. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The Court disposed of Levitt\'s claim, stating:</p>\n<p>"It is an established principle that to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has <em>sustained or is immediately</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 418 U.

In a very real sense, the absence of any particular individual or class to litigate these claims gives support to the argument that the subject matter is committed to the surveillance of Congress, and ultimately to the political process.  Any other conclusion would mean that the Founding Fathers intended to set up something in the nature of an Athenian democracy or a New England town meeting to oversee the conduct of the National Government by means of lawsuits in federal courts.  The Constitution created a <em>representative</em> Government, with the representatives directly responsible to their constituents at stated periods of two, four, and six years; that the Constitution does not afford a judicial remedy does not, of course, completely disable the citizen who is not satisfied with the "ground rules" established by the Congress for reporting expenditures of the Executive Branch.  Lack of standing within the narrow confines of Art. III jurisdiction does not impair the right to assert his views in the political forum or at the polls.

Abstracting some general language of that opinion from the setting and controlling facts of that case, the Court of Appeals overlooked the crucial factor that standing in that case arose under a specific statute, Bank Service Corporation Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 1132, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1861.  The petitioners in <em>Data Processing</em> alleged competitive economic injury to private business enterprise due to a ruling by the Comptroller of the Currency permitting national banks to sell their data processing services to other banks and to bank customers whose patronage the data processing companies sought.  We recognized standing for those private business proprietors who were engaged in selling the same kind of services the Comptroller allowed banks to sell; we held only that the claims of impermissible competition were "arguably . . . within the zone of interests protected" by \xc2\xa7 4 of the Bank Service Corporation Act. 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html#156">397 U.

While the available evidence is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively conclusive, historical analysis of the genesis of cl. 7 suggests that it was intended to permit some degree of secrecy of governmental operations.  The ultimate weapon of enforcement available to the Congress would, of course, be the "power of the purse."

Miller, Secret Statutes of the United States 10 (1918).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court because I am in accord with most of its analysis, particularly insofar as it relies on traditional barriers against federal taxpayer or citizen standing.  And I agree that <em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span> (1968), which set the boundaries for the arguments of the parties before us, is the most directly relevant precedent and quite correctly absorbs a major portion of the Court\'s attention.  I write solely to indicate that I would go further than the Court, and would lay to rest the approach undertaken in <em>Flast.</em>  I would not overrule <em>Flast</em> on its facts, because it is now settled that federal taxpayer standing exists in Establishment Clause cases.  I would not, however, perpetuate the doctrinal confusion inherent in the <em>Flast</em> two-part "nexus" test.  That test is not a reliable indicator of when a federal taxpayer has standing, and it has no sound relationship to the question whether such a plaintiff, with no other interest at stake, should be allowed to bring suit against one of the branches of the Federal Government.  In my opinion, it should be abandoned.</p>\n<p>My difficulties with <em>Flast</em> are several.  The opinion purports to separate the question of standing from the merits, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#99">392 U. S. 99</a></span>-101, yet it abruptly returns to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 418 U. S. 181</a></p><p> the substantive issues raised by a plaintiff for the purpose of determining "whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought o be adjudicated."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U. S. 102</a></span>.  Similarly, the opinion distinguishes between constitutional and prudential limits on standing.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#92">392 U. S. 92</a></span>-94,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#97">392 U. S. 97</a></span>.  I find it impossible, however, to determine whether the two-part "nexus" test created in <em>Flast</em> amounts to a constitutional or a prudential limitation, because it has no meaningful connection with the Court\'s statement of the bare-minimum constitutional requirements for standing.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U. S. 204</a></span> (1962), the Court in <em>Flast</em> stated the "<em>gist of the question of standing\'" as\n</em></p>\n<p>"whether the party seeking relief has \'alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\'"</p>\n<p>392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#99">392 U.

S. 173</a></span>, this is now the controlling definition of the irreducible Art. III case or controversy requirements for standing. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  But, as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 418 U.

S. 116</a></span> <em>et seq.,</em> it is impossible to see how an inquiry about the existence of "concrete adverseness" is furthered by an application of the <em>Flast</em> test.</p>\n<p><em>Flast</em> announced the following two-part "nexus" test:</p>\n<p>"The nexus demanded of federal taxpayers has two aspects to it.  First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.  Thus, a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, of the Constitution.  It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. . . .  Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.  Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power, and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.

On the other hand, the Tenth Amendment, and apparently the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, were determined not to be such "specific" limitations.  The bases for these determinations are not wholly clear, but it appears that the Court found the Tenth Amendment addressed to the interests of the States, rather than of taxpayers, and the Due process Clause no protection against increases in tax liability.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#105">392 U. S. 105</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Mr. Justice Harlan\'s critique of the <em>Flast</em> "nexus" test is unanswerable.  As he pointed out,</p>\n<p>"the Court\'s standard for the determination of standing [<em>i.e.,</em> sufficiently concrete adverseness] and its criteria for the satisfaction of that standard are entirely unrelated."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#122">392 U.

Assuming that the relevant constitutional inquiry is the intensity of the plaintiff\'s concern, as the Court initially posited, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#99">392 U.

There can be little doubt about respondent\'s fervor in pursuing his case, both within administrative channels and at every level of the federal courts.  The intensity of his interest appears to bear no relationship to the fact that, literally speaking, he is not challenging directly a congressional exercise of the taxing and spending power.  On the other hand, if the involvement of the taxing and spending power has some relevance, it requires no great leap in reasoning to conclude that the Statement and Account Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, on which respondent relies, is inextricably linked to that power.  And that Clause might well be seen as a "specific" limitation on congressional spending.  Indeed, it could be viewed as the most democratic of limitations.  Thus, although the Court\'s application of <em>Flast</em> to the instant case is probably literally correct, adherence to the <em>Flast</em> test in this instance suggests, as does <em>Flast</em> itself, that the test is not a sound or logical limitation on standing.</p>\n<p>The lack of real meaning and of principled content in the <em>Flast</em> "nexus" test renders it likely that it will in time collapse of its own weight, as MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS predicted in his concurring opinion in that case.  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#107">392 U. S. 107</a></span>.  This will present several options for the Court.  It may either reaffirm pre-<em>Flast</em> prudential limitations on federal and citizen taxpayer standing; attempt new doctrinal departures in this area, as would MR. JUSTICE STEWART, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/case.html#203">418 U.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  I believe the first option to be the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 418 U.

Carr</em> statement of the constitutional indicia of standing, I further believe that constitutional limitations are not the only pertinent considerations.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, would grant citizen or taxpayer standing under those clauses of the Constitution that impose on the Federal Government "an affirmative duty" to do something on behalf of its citizens and taxpayers.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/case.html#203">418 U.

JUSTICE STEWART would deny federal taxpayer standing in all cases involving a constitutional prohibition, as his concurring opinion in <em>Flast</em> makes clear. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Rather, he would find federal taxpayer standing, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 418 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  In either instance, the relevant inquiry is the same -- may a plaintiff, relying on nothing other than citizen or taxpayer status, bring suit to adjudicate whether an entity of the Federal Government is carrying out its responsibilities in conformance with the requirements of the Constitution?  A taxpayer\'s or citizen\'s interest in and willingness to pursue with vigor such a suit would not turn on whether the constitutional clause at issue imposed a duty on the Government to do something for him or prohibited the Government from doing something to him.  Prohibitions and duties in this context are opposite ides of the same coin.  Thus, I do not believe that the inquiry whether federal courts should entertain public actions is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 418 U.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, in my opinion, my Brother STEWART\'s view fails to provide a meaningful stopping point between an all-or-nothing position with regard to federal taxpayer or citizen standing.  In this respect, it shares certain of the deficiencies of <em>Flast.</em>  I suspect that this may also be true of any intermediate position in this area.  MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS correctly discerns, I think, that the alternatives here as a matter of doctrine are essentially bipolar.  His preference is clear:</p>\n<p>"I would be as liberal in allowing taxpayers standing to object to. . . violations of the First Amendment as I would in granting standing to people to complain of any invasion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 418 U. S. 188</a></p><p> of their rights under the Fourth Amendment or the Fourteenth or under any other guarantee in the Constitution itself or in the Bill of Rights."</p>\n<p><em>Flast v.

My view is to the contrary.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Relaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial power. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  It seems to me inescapable that allowing unrestricted taxpayer or citizen standing would significantly alter the allocation of power at the national level, with a shift away from a democratic form of government.  I also believe that repeated and essentially head-on confrontations between the life-tenured branch and the representative branches of government will not, in the long run, be beneficial to either.  The public confidence essential to the former and the vitality critical to the latter may well erode if we do not exercise self-restraint in the utilization of our power to negative the actions of the other branches.  We should be ever mindful of the contradictions that would arise if a democracy were to permit general oversight of the elected branches of government by a nonrepresentative, and in large measure insulated, judicial branch. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Moreover, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 418 U. S. 189</a></p><p> argument that the Court should allow unrestricted taxpayer or citizen standing underestimates the ability of the representative branches of the Federal Government to respond to the citizen pressure that has been responsible in large measure for the current drift toward expanded standing.  Indeed, taxpayer or citizen advocacy, given its potentially broad base, is precisely the type of leverage that, in a democracy, ought to be employed against the branches that were intended to be responsive to public attitudes about the appropriate operation of government.</p>\n<p>"We must, as judges, recall that, as Mr. Justice Holmes wisely observed, the other branches of the Government \'are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\'  <em>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas R.

Randolph\'s proposed Council of Revision, which was repeatedly rejected by the Framers, at least had the virtue of being systematic; every law passed by the legislature automatically would have been previewed by the Judiciary before the law could take effect. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  On the other hand, since the Judiciary cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="191">Page 418 U.

Were we to utilize this power as indiscriminately as is now being urged, we may witness efforts by the representative branches drastically to curb its use.  Due to what many have regarded as the unresponsiveness of the Federal Government to recognized needs or serious inequities in our society, recourse to the federal courts has attained an unprecedented popularity in recent decades.  Those courts have often acted as a major instrument of social reform.  But this has not always been the case, as experiences under the New Deal illustrate.  The public reaction to the substantive due process holdings of the federal courts during that period requires no elaboration, and it is not unusual for history to repeat itself. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 418 U.

The irreplaceable value of the power articulated by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall lies in the protection it has afforded the constitutional rights and liberties of individual citizens and minority groups against oppressive or discriminatory government action.  It is this role, not some amorphous general supervision of the operations of government, that has maintained public esteem for the federal courts and has permitted the peaceful coexistence of the counter-majoritarian implications of judicial review and the democratic principles upon which our Federal Government, in the final analysis, rests.</p>\n<p>The considerations outlined above underlie, I believe, the traditional hostility of the Court to federal taxpayer or citizen standing where the plaintiff has nothing at stake other than his interest as a taxpayer or citizen.  It merits noting how often and how unequivocally the Court has expressed its antipathy to efforts to convert the Judiciary into an open forum for the resolution of political or ideological disputes about the performance of government.  <em>See, e.g., Ex parte Levitt,</em> 302 U.S. 633, 634 (1937); [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] <em>Frothingham v.

The Court has confirmed the power of Congress to open the federal courts to representatives of the public interest through specific statutory grants of standing.  <em>E.g., FCC v. Sanders Bros.

A stringently limited exception for federal taxpayer standing has been created.  <em>Flast v.

As the Court noted in <em>Sierra Club,</em></p>\n<p>"broadening the categories of injury that may be alleged in support of standing is a different matter from abandoning the requirement that the party seeking review must himself have suffered an injury."</p>\n<p>405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/case.html#738">405 U.

[<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Indeed, despite the diminution of standing requirements in the last decade, the Court has not broken with the traditional requirement that, in the absence of a specific statutory grant of the right of review, a plaintiff must allege some particularized injury that sets him apart from the man on the street.

In recognition of those considerations, we should refuse to go the last mile toward abolition of standing requirements that is implicit in broadening the "precarious opening" for federal taxpayers created by <em>Flast, see</em> 392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#116">392 U.

And, if distinctions between constitutional prohibitions and duties are to make a difference, there are certain to be some incongruous rules as to when such a public action may be brought.  This is apparent when one attempts to categorize the provisions of the Constitution primarily addressed at limiting the powers of the National Government -- Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, and the Bill of Rights.  All of the clauses of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, except the seventh, which is at issue here, are stated as prohibitions.  In fact, the seventh clause is in part a prohibition against expenditures of public money in the absence of appropriations, and in part an affirmative duty to publish periodically an account of such expenditures.  The rationale for according special treatment solely to one-half of Art,. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, and not to the other, and not to the remaining clauses of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, is not immediately apparent.</p>\n<p>The same observation may be made of the Bill of Rights.  The First Amendment through the Fifth, the Eighth, and possibly the Tenth, are stated in terms of prohibitions.  The Sixth Amendment and portions of the Seventh can be classified as duties.  The Ninth defies classification.  Rational rules for standing in public actions are, it seems to me, unlikely to emerge from an effort to make the format of a particular Amendment determinative.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>One commentator predicted this phenomenon and its possible implications at the outset of the past decade of dramatic changes in standing doctrine:</p>\n<p>"[J]udicial power expands as the requirements of standing are relaxed. . . .

Madison ably supported the proposal, but it was defeated</p>\n<p>The analogy between the proposed Council of Revision and unrestricted taxpayer or citizen standing is not complete.  For example, Randolph proposed to link the Judiciary directly to the Executive, in large measure to enhance the Executive and to protect it from legislative encroachments.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 1 Farrand 108, 138; 2 Farrand 74, 79.  Thus, reliance on the Framers\' rejection of the Council must be approached with caution.  Nevertheless, the arguments advanced at the Convention in support of and in opposition to the Council provide an interesting parallel to present contentions regarding unrestrained public actions.  For example, Madison spoke of the "good" that would "proceed from the perspicuity, the conciseness, and the systematic character wch. the Code of laws wd. receive from the Judiciary talents."  1 Farrand 139.  He declared that the proposal would be useful</p>\n<p>"to restrain the Legislature from encroaching on the other coordinate Departments, or on the right of the people at large; or from passing laws unwise in their principle or incorrect in their form. . . ,"</p>\n<p><em>ibid.,</em> and that such a system would be "useful to the Community at large as an additional check" against unwise legislative measures.  2 Farrand 74.  Those opposed to the proposal, including Gerry, Martin, and Rutledge, preferred to rely "on the Representatives of the people as the guardians of their Rights &amp; interests."  <em>Id.</em> at 75.  Judges were not presumed "to possess any peculiar knowledge of the mere policy of public measures . . , " <em>id.</em> at 73, or any "higher . . . degree" of knowledge of making and of "Legislative affairs. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 76.  It was "necessary that the Supreme Judiciary should have the confidence of the people . . ," <em>id.</em> at 76-77, and this would "soon be lost if they are employed in the task of remonstrating agst. popular measures of the Legislature."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 77.  Moreover, the "Judges ought never to give their opinion on a law till it comes before them."  <em>Id.</em> at 80.</p>\n<p>The arguments adduced at the Convention in opposition to the Council of Revision ultimately prevailed.  I believe that analogous arguments should guide us in refusing as a general matter to entertain public actions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Some Western European democracies have experimented with forms of constitutional judicial review in the abstract, <em>see, e.g.,</em> M.

The clear implication is that allowing "any individual citizen with [a] . . . <em>bona fide</em> special interest" to trigger federal court litigation is a result to be avoided.  All standing cases, even the most recent ones, include references to the need for particularized injury or similar language.  None of them as yet has equated the interest of a taxpayer or citizen, suing in that status alone, with the particularized interest that standing doctrine has traditionally demanded.  To take that step, it appears to me, would render the requirement of direct or immediate injury meaningless, and would reduce the Court\'s consistent insistence on such an injury to mere talk.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Baker v.

My views are expressed in my dissent to the <em>Schlesinger</em> case, <em>post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html#229">418 U. S. 229</a></span>, decided this day.  There, a citizen and taxpayer raised a question concerning the Incompatibility Clause of the Constitution which bars a person from "holding any Office under the United States" if he is a Member of Congress, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 2.  That action was designed to bring the Pentagon into line with that constitutional requirement by requiring it to drop "reservists" who were Members of Congress.</p>\n<p>The present action involves Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, of the Constitution which provides:</p>\n<p>"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."</p>\n<p>We held in <em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span>, that a taxpayer had "standing" to challenge the constitutionality of taxes raised to finance the establishment of a religion contrary to the command of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  A taxpayer making such outlays, we held, had sufficient "personal stake" in the controversy, <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U. S. 204</a></span>, to give the case the "concrete adverseness" necessary for the resolution of constitutional issues.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Respondent in the present case claims that he has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 418 U. S. 198</a></p><p> a right to "a regular statement and account" of receipts and expenditures of public moneys for the Central Intelligence Agency.  As the Court of Appeals noted, <em>Flast</em> recognizes "standing" of a taxpayer to challenge appropriations made in the face of a constitutional prohibition, and it logically asks, "how can a taxpayer make that challenge unless he knows how the money is being spent?"  465 F.2d 844, 853.</p>\n<p>History shows that the curse of government is not always venality; secrecy is one of the most tempting coverups to save regimes from criticism.  As the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<p>"The Framers of the Constitution deemed fiscal information essential if the electorate was to exercise any control over its representatives and meet their new responsibilities as citizens of the Republic; and they mandated publication, although stated in general terms, of the Government\'s receipts and expenditures.  Whatever the ultimate scope and extent of that obligation, its elimination generates a sufficient, adverse interest in a taxpayer."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p>Whatever may be the merits of the underlying claim, it seems clear that the taxpayer in the present case is not making a generalized complaint about the operation of Government.  He does not even challenge the constitutionality of the Central Intelligence Agency Act.  He only wants to know the amount of tax money exacted from him that goes into CIA activities.  Secrecy of the Government acquires new sanctity when his claim is denied.  Secrecy has, of course, some constitutional sanction.  Article I, \xc2\xa7 5, cl. 3, provides that</p>\n<p>"Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 418 U. S. 199</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But the difference was great when it came to an accounting of public money.  Secrecy was the evil at which Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, was aimed.  At the Convention, Mason took the initiative in moving for an annual account of public expenditures.  2 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 618 (1911).  Madison suggested it be "from time to time," <em>id.</em> at 618-619, because it was thought that requiring publication at fixed intervals might lead to no publication at all.  Indeed, under the Articles of Confederation, "[a] punctual compliance being often impossible, the practice ha[d] ceased altogether."  <em>Id.</em> at 619.</p>\n<p>During the Maryland debates on the Constitution, McHenry said:  "[T]he People who give their Money ought to know in what manner it is expended," 3 Farrand, <em>supra,</em> at 150.  In the Virginia debates, Mason expressed his belief that, while some matters might require secrecy (<em>e.g.,</em> ongoing diplomatic negotiations and military operations)</p>\n<p>"he did not conceive that the receipts and expenditures of the public money ought ever to be concealed.  The people, he affirmed, had a right to know the expenditures of their money."</p>\n<p>3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 459 (1836).  Lee said that the clause "must be supposed to mean, in the common acceptation of language, short, convenient periods," and that those "who would neglect this provision would disobey the most pointed directions."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Madison added that an accounting from "time to time" insured that the accounts would be "more full and satisfactory to the public, and would be sufficiently frequent."  <em>Id.</em> at 460.  Madison thought "this provision went farther than the constitution of any state in the Union, or perhaps in the world."  <em>Ibid.</em>  In New York, Livingston said:</p>\n<p>"Will not the representatives . . . consider it as essential to their popularity to gratify their constituents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 418 U. S. 200</a></p><p> with full and frequent statements of the public accounts?  There can be no doubt of it."</p>\n<p>2 Elliot, <em>supra</em> at 347. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>From the history of the clause, it is apparent that the Framers inserted it in the Constitution to give the public knowledge of the way public funds are expended.  No one has a greater "personal stake" in policing this protective measure than a taxpayer.  Indeed, if a taxpayer may not raise the question, who may do so?  The Court states that discretion to release information is, in the first instance, "committed to the surveillance of Congress," and that the right of the citizenry to information under Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, cannot be enforced directly, but only through the "[s]low, cumbersome, and unresponsive" electoral process.  One has only to read constitutional history to realize that statement would shock Mason and Madison.  Congress, of course, has discretion; but to say that it has the power to read the clause out of the Constitution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 418 U. S. 201</a></p><p> when it comes to one or two or three agencies is astounding.  That is the bare-bones issue in the present case.  Does Art. I,  9, cl. 7, of the Constitution permit Congress to withhold "a regular Statement and Account" respecting any agency it chooses?  Respecting all federal agencies?  What purpose, what function is the clause to perform under the Court\'s construction?  The electoral process already permits the removal of legislators for any reason.  Allowing their removal at the polls for failure to comply with Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, effectively reduces that clause to a nullity, giving it no purpose at all.</p>\n<p>The sovereign in this Nation is the people, not the bureaucracy.  The statement of accounts of public expenditures goes to the heart of the problem of sovereignty.  If taxpayers may not ask that rudimentary question, their sovereignty becomes an empty symbol and a secret bureaucracy is allowed to run our affairs.</p>\n<p>The resolution of that issue has not been entrusted to one of the other coordinate branches of government -- the test of the "political question" under <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> 369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#217">369 U. S. 217</a></span>.  The question is "political" if there is "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department," <em>ibid.</em>  The mandate runs to the Congress and to the agencies it creates to make "a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money."  The beneficiary -- as is abundantly clear from the constitutional history -- is the public.  The public cannot intelligently know how to exercise the franchise unless it has a basic knowledge concerning at least the generality of the accounts under every head of government.  No greater crisis in confidence can be generated than today\'s decision.  Its consequences are grave because it relegates to secrecy vast operations of government, and keeps the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="202">Page 418 U. S. 202</a></p><p> public from knowing what secret plans concerning this Nation or other nations are afoot.  The fact that the result is serious does not, of course, make the issue "justiciable."  But resolutions of any doubts or ambiguities should be toward protecting an individual\'s stake in the integrity of constitutional guarantees, rather than turning him away without even a chance to be heard.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>* Livingston used the proposed Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, to combat the idea that the new Congress would be corrupt.  He said in part:</p>\n<p>"You will give up to your state legislatures everything dear and valuable; but you will give no power to Congress, because it may be abused; you will give them no revenue, because the public treasures may be squandered.  But do you not see here a capital check?  Congress are to publish, from time to time, an account of their receipts and expenditures.  These may be compared together; and if the former, year after year, exceed the latter, the corruption will be detected, and the people may use the constitutional mode of redress.  The gentleman admits that corruption will not take place immediately:  its operations can only be conducted by a long series and a steady system of measures.  These measures will be easily defeated, even if the people are unapprized of them.  They will be defeated by that continual change of members, which naturally takes place in free governments, arising from the disaffection and inconstancy of the people.  A changeable assembly will be entirely incapable of conducting a system of mischief; they will meet with obstacles and embarrassments on every side."</p>\n<p>2 Elliot, <em>supra</em> at 345-346.</p>\n<p>MR JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decisions in <em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span> (1968), and <em>Frothingham v. Mellon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html">262 U. S. 447</a></span> (1923), throw very little light on the question at issue in this case.  For, unlike the plaintiffs in those cases, Richardson did not bring this action asking a court to invalidate a federal statute on the ground that it was beyond the delegated power of Congress to enact, or that it contravened some constitutional prohibition.  Richardson\'s claim is of an entirely different order.  It is that Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, Cl. 7, of the Constitution, the Statement and Account Clause, gives him a right to receive, and imposes on the Government a corresponding affirmative duty to supply, a periodic report of the receipts and expenditures "of all public Money." [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  In support of his standing to litigate this claim, he has asserted his status both as a taxpayer and as a citizen-voter.  Whether the Statement and Account Clause imposes upon the Government an affirmative duty to supply the information requested, and whether that duty runs to every taxpayer or citizen, are questions that go to the substantive merits of this litigation.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 418 U. S. 203</a></p><p> Those questions are not now before us, but I think that the Court is quite wrong in holding that the respondent was without standing to raise them in the trial court.</p>\n<p>Seeking a determination that the Government owes him a duty to supply the information he has requested, the respondent is in the position of a traditional Hohfeldian plaintiff. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  He contends that the Statement and Account Clause gives him a right to receive the information and burdens the Government with a correlative duty to supply it.  Courts of law exist for the resolution of such right-duty disputes.  When a party is seeking a judicial determination that a defendant owes him an affirmative duty, it seems clear to me that he has standing to litigate the issue of the existence <em>vel non</em> of this duty once he shows that the defendant has declined to honor his claim.  If the duty in question involved the payment of a sum of money, I suppose that all would agree that a plaintiff asserting the duty would have standing to litigate the issue of his entitlement to the money upon a showing that he had not been paid.  I see no reason for a different result when the defendant is a Government official and the asserted duty relates not to the payment of money, but to the disclosure of items of information.</p>\n<p>When the duty relates to a very particularized and explicit performance by the asserted obligor, such as the payment of money or the rendition of specific items of information, there is no necessity to resort to any extended analysis, such as the <em>Flast</em> nexus tests, in order to find standing in the obligee.  Under such circumstances, the duty itself, running as it does from the defendant to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 418 U. S. 204</a></p><p> plaintiff, provides fully adequate assurance that the plaintiff is not seeking to</p>\n<p>"employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System."</p>\n<p><em>Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#106">392 U. S. 106</a></span>.  If such a duty arose in the context of a contract between private parties, no one would suggest that the obligee should be barred from the courts.  It seems to me that, when the asserted duty is, as here, as particularized, palpable, and explicit as those which courts regularly recognize in private contexts, it should make no difference that the obligor is the Government and the duty is embodied in our organic law.  Certainly, after <em>United States v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html">412 U. S. 669</a></span> (1973), it does not matter that those to whom the duty is owed may be many.  "[S]tanding is not to be denied simply because many people suffer the same injury."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html#687">412 U. S. 687</a></span>.</p>\n<p>For example, the Freedom of Information Act creates a private cause of action for the benefit of persons who have requested certain records from a public agency and whose request has been denied.  5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 552(a)(3).  The statute requires nothing more than a request and the denial of that request as a predicate to a suit in the district court.  The provision purports to create a duty in the Government agency involved to make those records covered by the statute available to "any person."  Correspondingly, it confers a right on "any person" to receive those records, subject to published regulations regarding time, place, fees, and procedure.  The analogy, of course, is clear.  If the Court is correct in this case in holding that Richardson lacks standing under Art. III to litigate his claim that the Statement and Account Clause imposes an affirmative duty that runs in his favor, it would follow that a person whose request under 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 552 has been denied would similarly lack standing under Art. III despite </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 418 U. S. 205</a></p><p> the clear intent of Congress to confer a right of action to compel production of the information.</p>\n<p>The issue in <em>Flast</em> and its predecessor, <em>Frothingham, supra,</em> related solely to the standing of a federal taxpayer to challenge allegedly unconstitutional exercises of the taxing and spending power.  The question in those cases was under what circumstances a federal taxpayer whose interest stemmed solely from the taxes he paid to the Treasury</p>\n<p>"[would] be deemed to have the personal stake and interest that impart the necessary concrete adverseness to such litigation so that standing can be conferred on the taxpayer <em>qua</em> taxpayer consistent with the constitutional limitations of Article III."</p>\n<p>392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#101">392 U. S. 101</a></span>.  But the "nexus" criteria developed in <em>Flast</em> were not intended as a litmus test to resolve all conceivable standing questions in the federal courts; they were no more than a response to the problem of taxpayer standing to challenge federal legislation enacted in the exercise of the taxing and spending power of Congress.</p>\n<p>Richardson is not asserting that a taxing and spending program exceeds Congress\' delegated power or violates a constitutional limitation on such power.  Indeed, the constitutional provision that, underlies his claim does not purport to limit the power of the Federal Government in any respect, but, according to Richardson, simply imposes an affirmative duty on the Government with respect to all taxpayers or citizen-voters of the Republic.  Thus, the nexus analysis of <em>Flast</em> is simply not relevant to the standing question raised in this case.</p>\n<p>The Court also seems to say that this case is not justiciable because it involves a political question.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/case.html#179">418 U. S. 179</a></span>.  This is an issue that is not before us.  The "Question Presented" in the Government\'s petition for certiorari was the respondent\'s</p>\n<p>"standing to challenge the provisions of the Central Intelligence Agency </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 418 U. S. 206</a></p><p> Act which provide that appropriations to and expenditures by that Agency shall not be made public, on the ground that such secrecy contravenes Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]"</p>\n<p>The issue of the justiciability of the respondent\'s claim was thus not presented in the petition for certiorari, and it was not argued in the briefs. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  At oral argument, in response to questions about whether the Government was asking this Court to rule on the justiciability of the respondent\'s claim, the following colloquy occurred between the Court and the Solicitor General:</p>\n<p>"MR. BORK:  . . .  I think the Court of Appeals was correct that the political question issue could be resolved much more effectively if we were in the full merits of the case than we can at this stage.  I think standing is all that really can be effectively discussed in the posture of the case now."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Q:  . . .  [I]f we disagree with you on standing, the Government agrees then that the case should go back to the District Court?"</p>\n<p>"MR. BORK:  I think that is correct. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 418 U. S. 207</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Solicitor General\'s answer was clearly right.</p>\n<p>"[W]hen standing is placed in issue in a case, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue, and not whether the issue itself is justiciable."</p>\n<p><em>Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#99">392 U. S. 99</a></span>-100.</p>\n<p>On the merits, I presume that the Government\'s position would be that the Statement and Account Clause of the Constitution does not impose an affirmative duty upon it; that any such duty does not, in any event, run to Richardson; that any such duty is subject to legislative qualifications, one of which is applicable here; and that the question involved is political, and thus not justiciable.  Richardson might ultimately be thrown out of court on any one of these grounds, or some other.  But to say that he might ultimately lose his lawsuit certainly does not mean that he had no standing to bring it.</p>\n<p>For the reasons expressed, I believe that Richardson had standing to bring this action.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Jaffe, The Citizen as Litigant in Public Actions:  The Non-Hohfeldian or Ideological Plaintiff, 116 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1033 (1968).  <em>See</em> Hohfeld, Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 23 Yale L.J. 16 (1913).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has often indicated that, except in the most extraordinary circumstances, it will not consider questions that have not been presented in the petition for certiorari.  <em>E.g., General Talking Pictures Corp. v.

The Court of Appeals reversed the standing holding, but concluded that the justiciability issue was so intertwined with the merits that it should await consideration of the merits by the District Court on remand.  The Government then brought the case here on petition for certiorari.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
