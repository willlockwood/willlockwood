SCHMIDT et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x931186.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 28, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 17, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), is a national banking association with its designated main office in North Carolina and branch offices in many States, including South Carolina.  Plaintiff-respondent Schmidt and other South Carolina citizens sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter.  Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in Federal District Court, seeking to compel arbitration of the dispute.  As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties\xe2\x80\x99 diverse citizenship.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332.  The District Court denied Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s petition on the merits.  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit determined that the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, vacated the judgment, and instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.  The appeals court observed that Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship for diversity purposes is controlled by \xc2\xa71348, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cnational banking associations\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the court read \xc2\xa71348, Wachovia is \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in, and is therefore a \xe2\x80\x9ccitizen\xe2\x80\x9d of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  Thus, Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s South Carolina branch operations rendered it a citizen of that State.  Given the South Carolina citizenship of the opposing parties, the court concluded that the matter could not be adjudicated in federal court.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A national bank, for \xc2\xa71348 purposes, is a citizen of the State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0When Congress first authorized national banks, it allowed them to sue and be sued in federal court in any and all civil proceedings.  State banks, however, could initiate actions in federal court only on the basis of diversity of citizenship or the existence of a federal question.  Congress ended national banks\xe2\x80\x99 automatic qualification for federal jurisdiction in 1882, placing them \xe2\x80\x9con the same footing as the banks of the state where they were located,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Leather Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 Bank</em> v. <em>Cooper,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/120/778/index.html">120 U. S. 778</a>, 780.  In an 1887 enactment, Congress first used the \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d language today contained in \xc2\xa71348.  Like its 1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act \xe2\x80\x9csought to limit \xe2\x80\xa6 the access of national banks to, and their suability in, the federal courts to the same extent [as] non-national banks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dallas</em> v. <em>Langdeau,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/555/index.html">371 U. S. 555</a>, 565\xe2\x80\x93566.  In the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress combined two formerly discrete provisions on proceedings involving national banks, but retained without alteration the \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  Finally, as part of the 1948 Judicial Code revision, Congress enacted \xc2\xa71348 in its current form.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Fourth Circuit advanced three principal reasons for deciding that Wachovia is \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in, and therefore a \xe2\x80\x9ccitizen\xe2\x80\x9d of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  First, consulting dictionaries, the court observed that the term \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cphysical presence in a place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Next, the court noted that \xc2\xa71348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clocated.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court concluded that, to give independent meaning to each word, \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d should be read to refer to the bank\xe2\x80\x99s charter location and \xe2\x80\x9clocated,\xe2\x80\x9d to the place where the bank has a physical presence.  Finally, the court relied on <em>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Bougas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/35/index.html">434 U. S. 35</a>, in which this Court interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa794 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office.  Viewing the jurisdiction and venue statutes as pertaining to the same subject matter, the court concluded that, under the <em>in pari materia</em> canon, the two statutes should be interpreted consistently.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0None of the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rationales persuade this Court to read \xc2\xa71348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity-jurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of each State in which the bank has established branch operations.  First, the term \xe2\x80\x9clocated,\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain meaning.  In some provisions, the word unquestionably refers to the site of the banking association\xe2\x80\x99s designated main office, but in others, \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d apparently refers to or includes branch offices.  Recognizing the controlling significance of context, this Court stated in <em>Bougas: </em>\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no enduring rigidity about the word \xe2\x80\x98located.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U. S., at 44.  Second, Congress may well have comprehended the words \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cestablished,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa71348, as synonymous terms.  When Congress enacted \xc2\xa71348\xe2\x80\x99s statutory predecessors and \xc2\xa71348 itself, a national bank was almost always \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d only in the State in which it was \xe2\x80\x9cestablished,\xe2\x80\x9d under any of the proffered definitions of the two words.  For with rare exceptions a national bank could not operate a branch outside its home State until 1994, when Congress broadly authorized national banks to establish branches across state lines.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the two terms may be best explained as a coincidence of statutory codification.  Deriving from separate provisions enacted in different years, the word \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d appearing in the first paragraph of \xc2\xa71348 and the word \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d appearing in the second paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision.  The codifying Act stated that provisions substantially the same as existing statutes should not be treated as new enactments.  Thus, it is unsurprising that, in 1947, this Court, referring to a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d as alternatives.  See <em>Cope</em> v. <em>Anderson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/461/index.html">331 U. S. 461</a>, 467.  Finally, <em>Bougas</em> does not control \xc2\xa71348\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Although it is true that, under the <em>in pari materia</em> canon, statutes addressing the same subject matter generally should be read \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as if they were one law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Erlenbaugh</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/239/index.html">409 U. S. 239</a>, 243, venue and subject-matter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order.  Venue, largely a matter of litigational convenience, is waived if not timely raised.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a court\xe2\x80\x99s competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases; a matter far weightier than venue, subject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court on its own motion, even if no party raises an objection.  Cognizant that venue \xe2\x80\x9cis primarily a matter of choosing a convenient forum,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Leroy</em> v. <em>Great Western United Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/173/index.html">443 U. S. 173</a>, 180, the Court in <em>Bougas</em> stressed that its \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation of [the former] \xc2\xa794 [would] not inconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it with distant litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d 434 U. S., at 44, n.\xc2\xa010.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, however, does not entail an assessment of convenience.  It poses the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre.  Thus, the considerations that account for the <em>Bougas</em> decision are inapplicable to \xc2\xa71348, a prescription governing subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting \xc2\xa71348 <em>in pari materia</em> with the former \xc2\xa794.  Significantly, <em>Bougas\xe2\x80\x99 </em>reading of former \xc2\xa794 effectively aligned the treatment of national banks for venue purposes with the treatment of state banks and corporations.  By contrast, the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case severely constricts national banks\xe2\x80\x99 access to diversity jurisdiction as compared to the access generally available to corporations, for corporations ordinarily rank as citizens only of States in which they are incorporated or maintain their principal place of business, and are not deemed citizens of every State in which they maintain a business establishment.

S. Treasury.  Congress empowered federal district courts to adjudicate civil actions between \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of different States\xe2\x80\x9d where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.  28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71332(a)(1).  A business organized as a corporation, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated\xe2\x80\x9d and, since 1958, also \xe2\x80\x9cof the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(c)(1).  State banks, usually chartered as corporate bodies by a particular State, ordinarily fit comfortably within this prescription.  Federally chartered national banks do not, for they are not incorporated by \xe2\x80\x9cany State.\xe2\x80\x9d  For diversity jurisdiction purposes, therefore, Congress has discretely provided that national banks \xe2\x80\x9cshall \xe2\x80\xa6 be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71348.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented turns on the meaning, in \xc2\xa71348\xe2\x80\x99s context, of the word \xe2\x80\x9clocated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Does it signal, as the petitioning national bank and the United States, as <em>amicus curiae</em>, urge, that the bank\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship is determined by the place designated in the bank\xe2\x80\x99s articles of association as the location of its main office?  Or does it mean, in addition, as respondents urge and the Court of Appeals held, that a national bank is a citizen of every State in which it maintains a branch?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d is not a word of \xe2\x80\x9cenduring rigidity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Bougas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/35/index.html"></a><a href="/us/434/35/index.html">434 U. S. 35</a>, 44 (1977), but one that gains its precise meaning from context, we hold that a national bank, for \xc2\xa71348 purposes, is a citizen of the State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.  Were we to hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that a national bank is additionally a citizen of every State in which it has established a branch, the access of a federally chartered bank to a federal forum would be drastically curtailed in comparison to the access afforded state banks and other state-incorporated entities.  Congress, we are satisfied, created no such anomaly.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), is a national banking association with its designated main office in Charlotte, North Carolina.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Wachovia operates branch offices in many States, including South Carolina.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The litigation before us commenced when plaintiff-respondent Daniel G. Schmidt III and others, citizens of South Carolina, sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter.  Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking to compel arbitration of the dispute.  As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties\xe2\x80\x99 diverse citizenship.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332.  The District Court denied Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s<font b="1"> petition on the<font b="1"> merits; neither the parties nor the court questioned the existence of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.<font b="1">  On appeal, a divided Fourth Circuit panel determined that the District Court lacked diversity jurisdiction over the action; it therefore vacated the judgment and instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.</font></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 majority observed that Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship for diversity purposes is controlled by \xc2\xa71348, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cnational banking associations\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the panel majority read \xc2\xa71348, Wachovia is \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in, and is therefore a \xe2\x80\x9ccitizen\xe2\x80\x9d of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  Thus Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s branch operations in South Carolina, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, rendered the bank a citizen of South Carolina.  Given the South Carolina citizenship of the opposing parties, the majority concluded that the matter could not be adjudicated in federal court.  388 F.\xc2\xa03d 414, 432 (CA4 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Circuit Judge King dissented.

On his reading, Wachovia is a citizen only of North Carolina, the State in which its main office is located, not of every State in which it maintains a branch office; accordingly, he concluded, Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s petition qualified for federal-court adjudication.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among Courts of Appeals on the meaning of \xc2\xa71348.  545 U.

First, consulting dictionaries, the Court of Appeals observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n ordinary parlance\xe2\x80\x9d the term \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cphysical presence in a place.\xe2\x80\x9d  388 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 416\xe2\x80\x93417 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Banks have a physical presence, the Fourth Circuit stated, wherever they operate branches.  <em>Id.</em>, at 417.  Next, the court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cSection 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: \xe2\x80\x98established\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98located.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 419.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo give independent meaning\xe2\x80\x9d to each word, the court said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is most reasonable to understand the place where a national bank is \xe2\x80\x98established\xe2\x80\x99 to refer to a bank\xe2\x80\x99s charter location, and to understand the place where it is \xe2\x80\x98located\xe2\x80\x99 to refer to the place or places where it has a physical presence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Finally, the Court of Appeals stressed that in <em>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Bougas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/35/index.html"></a><a href="/us/434/35/index.html">434 U. S. 35</a> (1977), this Court interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa794 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office.  388 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 419\xe2\x80\x93420.  Reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction and venue statutes pertain to the same subject matter, namely the amenability of national banking associations to suit in federal court,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel majority concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9cunder the <em>in pari materia </em>canon[,] the two statutes should be interpreted\xe2\x80\x9d consistently.  <em>Id.,</em> at 422.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rationales persuade us to read \xc2\xa71348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of each State in which the bank has established branch operations.  First, the term \xe2\x80\x9clocated,\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain meaning.  In some provisions, the word unquestionably refers to a single place: the site of the banking association\xe2\x80\x99s designated main office.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa752 (national bank\xe2\x80\x99s capital stock certificates must state \xe2\x80\x9cthe name and location of the association\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa755 (requiring notice of sale of capital stock \xe2\x80\x9cin a newspaper of the city or town in which the bank is located\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa775 (bank\xe2\x80\x99s regular annual shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meeting shall be rescheduled when it \xe2\x80\x9cfalls on a legal holiday in the State in which the bank is located\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7182 (requiring publication of a notice of dissolution \xe2\x80\x9cin the city or town in which the association is located\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other provisions, \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d apparently refers to or includes branch offices.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa736(j) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cbranch\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany branch place of business located in any State\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa785 (limiting interest rate charged by national bank to \xe2\x80\x9crate allowed by the laws of the State, Territory, or District where the bank is located\xe2\x80\x9d) (construed in OCC Interpretive Letter No. 822 (Feb. 17, 1998), [1997\xe2\x80\x931998 Transfer Binder] CCH Fed. Banking L.\xc2\xa0Rep. \xc2\xb681\xe2\x80\x93265, pp. 90,256-90,257); \xc2\xa792 (permitting national bank to act as insurance agent in certain circumstances when bank is \xe2\x80\x9clocated and doing business in any place the population of which does not exceed five thousand inhabitants\xe2\x80\x9d) (construed in 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.1001 (2005)).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Recognizing the controlling significance of context, we stated in <em>Bougas</em>, regarding a venue provision for national banks: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no enduring rigidity about the word \xe2\x80\x98located.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U. S., at 44.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Congress may well have comprehended the words \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cestablished,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa71348, not as contrasting, but as synonymous or alternative terms.  When Congress enacted \xc2\xa71348\xe2\x80\x99s statutory predecessors and then \xc2\xa71348 itself, a national bank was almost always \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d only in the State in which it was \xe2\x80\x9cestablished,\xe2\x80\x9d under any of the proffered definitions of the two words, for, with rare exceptions, a national bank could not operate a branch outside its home State.  Not until 1994 did Congress provide broad authorization for national banks to establish branches across state lines.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa02.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the two terms may be best explained as a coincidence of statutory codification.  Deriving from separate provisions enacted in different years, the word \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d appearing in the first paragraph of \xc2\xa71348 and the word \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d appearing in the second paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision of the Judicial Code.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n. 6.  The codifying Act explicitly stated that \xe2\x80\x9cso far as [its provisions were] substantially the same as existing statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d they should \xe2\x80\x9cbe construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \xc2\xa7294, 36 Stat. 1167; see <em>Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Columbia</em> v. <em>Mitchell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/213/index.html">277 U. S. 213</a>, 216 (1928) (1911 Act \xe2\x80\x9cwas in substance a reenactment of the earlier provisions in respect of \xe2\x80\xa6 jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this light, it is unsurprising that, in 1947, this Court, referring to a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d as alternatives.  See <em>Cope</em> v. <em>Anderson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/461/index.html">331 U. S. 461</a>, 467 (1947) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor jurisdictional purposes, a national bank is a \xe2\x80\x98citizen\xe2\x80\x99 of the state in which it is established or located[.]\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, <em>Bougas</em> does not control the meaning of \xc2\xa71348.  In that case, we construed a now-repealed venue provision, which stated that actions against national banking associations could be filed \xe2\x80\x9cin any State, county, or municipal court in the county or city in which said association [was] located.\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U. S., at 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (quoting 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa794 (1976 ed.)).  We held that, for purposes of this provision, a national bank was located, and venue was therefore proper, in any county or city where the bank maintained a branch office.  434 U. S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.<font b="1">  True, under the <em>in pari materia</em> canon of statutory construction, statutes addressing the same subject matter generally should be read \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as if they were one law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Erlenbaugh</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/239/index.html">409 U. S. 239</a>, 243 (1972) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Freeman,</em> 3 How. 556, 564 (1845)).  But venue and subject-matter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order.  Venue is largely a matter of litigational convenience; accordingly, it is waived if not timely raised.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Ringer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/602/index.html">466 U. S. 602</a>, 638, n. 25 (1984); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa012(h)(1).  Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a court\xe2\x80\x99s competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases; a matter far weightier than venue, subject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court on its own motion, even if no party raises an objection.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Swan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/index.html">111 U. S. 379</a>, 382 (1884); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa012(h)(3).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cognizant that venue \xe2\x80\x9cis primarily a matter of choosing a convenient forum,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Leroy</em> v. <em>Great Western United Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/173/index.html">443 U. S. 173</a>, 180 (1979), the Court in <em>Bougas</em> stressed that its \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation of [the former] \xc2\xa794 [would] not inconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it with distant litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d 434 U. S., at 44, n.\xc2\xa010.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, however, does not entail an assessment of convenience.  It poses a \xe2\x80\x9cwhether,\xe2\x80\x9d not a \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x9d question: Has the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre?  See <em>Neirbo Co.</em> v. <em>Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/165/index.html">308 U. S. 165</a>, 168 (1939) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis basic difference between the court\xe2\x80\x99s power and the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s convenience is historic in the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the considerations that account for our decision in <em>Bougas</em> are inapplicable to \xc2\xa71348, a prescription governing subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting \xc2\xa71348 <em>in pari materia</em> with the former \xc2\xa794.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Significantly, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the venue provision in <em>Bougas</em> effectively aligned the treatment of national banks for venue purposes with the treatment of state banks and corporations.  For venue in suits against state banks and other state-created corporations typically lies wherever those entities have business establishments.  See 19 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Corporations \xc2\xa7717(d), p. 374, n. 30 (1990) (under typical state venue statutes, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]enue in action against domestic corporation can be laid in any county where corporation maintains branch office\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision in the instant case severely constricts national banks\xe2\x80\x99 access to diversity jurisdiction as compared to the access available to corporations generally.  For purposes of diversity, a corporation surely is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it maintains a business establishment.  See <em>Pennsylvania R. Co.</em> v. <em>St. Louis, A. &amp; T. H. R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/118/290/index.html">118 U. S. 290</a>, 295\xe2\x80\x93296 (1886).  Rather, under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c)(1), a corporation is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to be a citizen\xe2\x80\x9d only of \xe2\x80\x9cany State by which it has been incorporated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cof the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, while corporations ordinarily rank as citizens of at most 2 States, Wachovia, under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 novel citizenship rule, would be a citizen of 16 States.  See FDIC Institution Directory, available at http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/ main.asp.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>Bougas</em> does not call for this anomalous result.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To summarize, \xe2\x80\x9clocated,\xe2\x80\x9d as its appearances in the banking laws reveal, see <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, is a chameleon word; its meaning depends on the context in and purpose for which it is used.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the context of venue, \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d may refer to multiple places, for a venue prescription, <em>e.g.</em>, the current and former 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa794, presupposes subject-matter jurisdiction and simply delineates <em>where</em> within a given judicial system a case may be maintained.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391(c) (for venue purposes, \xe2\x80\x9ca corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, in \xc2\xa71348, \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d appears in a prescription governing not venue but federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  Concerning access to the federal court system, \xc2\xa71348 deems national banks \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no reason to suppose Congress used those words to effect a radical departure from the norm.  An individual who resides in more than one State is regarded, for purposes of federal subject-matter (diversity) jurisdiction, as a citizen of but one State.  See <em>Newman-Green, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alfonzo-Larrain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/826/index.html">490 U. S. 826</a>, 828 (1989) (an individual is deemed a citizen of the State of her domicil); <em>Williamson</em> v. <em>Osenton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/619/index.html">232 U.

Similarly, a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship derives, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, from its State of incorporation and principal place of business.  \xc2\xa71332(c)(1).  It is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it conducts business or is otherwise amenable to personal jurisdiction.  Reading \xc2\xa71348 in this context, one would sensibly \xe2\x80\x9clocate\xe2\x80\x9d a national bank for the very same purpose, <em>i.e.</em>, qualification for diversity jurisdiction, in the State designated in its articles of association as its main office.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Treating venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <em>in</em> <em>pari materia</em>, 388 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 422\xe2\x80\x93423, the Court of Appeals majority overlooked the discrete offices of those concepts.

The resulting Fourth Circuit decision rendered national banks singularly disfavored corporate bodies with regard to their access to federal courts.

The first sentence of this formulation merged the 1888 caveat with text, including the word \xe2\x80\x9cestablished,\xe2\x80\x9d originally contained in the Act of Dec. 1, 1873, \xc2\xa7629 (Tenth to Eleventh), 18 Stat. 111.  The second sentence, including the word \xe2\x80\x9clocated,\xe2\x80\x9d derives from the 1887 formulation.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals did not overlook these nonuniform uses of the word \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in various provisions of the National Bank Act.  See 388 F.\xc2\xa03d 414, 425 (CA4 2004).  Nevertheless, it declared that, in \xc2\xa71348, \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d unambiguously means \xe2\x80\x9cphysically present.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  The court did not say what facilities other than branch offices, for example, storage sites or even automated teller machines, would suffice to establish a bank\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence.  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (counsel for respondents stated that an ATM, although an arguable question, probably would suffice to locate a bank in a State for \xc2\xa71348 purposes).</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Context also matters in assigning meaning to the word \xe2\x80\x9cestablished.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, S. Treaty Doc. No. 107\xe2\x80\x9319, Art. 5, pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor the purposes of this Convention, the term \xe2\x80\x98permanent establishment\xe2\x80\x99 means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the character of the proceedings covered by the first paragraph of \xc2\xa71348, see <em>supra</em>, at 7, one might read \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d as referring to the bank\xe2\x80\x99s main office as set forth in its articles of association.  Other readings mentioned in Court of Appeals opinions are the bank\xe2\x80\x99s principal place of business and the place listed in the bank\xe2\x80\x99s organization certificate.  See <em>Horton</em> v. <em>Bank One, N. A.</em>, 387 F. 3d 426, 434 (CA5 2004); <em>Firstar Bank, N. A.</em> v. <em>Faul</em>, 253 F. 3d 982, 992 (CA7 2001).  Because this issue is not presented by the parties or necessary to today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, we express no opinion on it.  Cf. <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To achieve complete parity with state banks and other state-incorporated entities, a national banking association would have to be deemed a citizen of both the State of its main office and the State of its principal place of business.  See <em>Horton</em>, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 431, and n.\xc2\xa026; <em>Firstar Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, 253 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 993\xe2\x80\x93994.  Congress has prescribed that a corporation \xe2\x80\x9cshall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated <em>and</em> of the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71332(c)(1) (emphasis added).  The counterpart provision for national banking associations, \xc2\xa71348, however, does not refer to \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d; it simply deems such associations \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\xe2\x80\x9d  The absence of a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d reference in \xc2\xa71348 may be of scant practical significance for, in almost every case, as in this one, the location of a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s main office and of its principal place of business coincide.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
