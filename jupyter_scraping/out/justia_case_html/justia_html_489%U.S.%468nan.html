S. 470</a></p><p></p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Unlike its federal counterpart, the California Arbitration Act, Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1280 <em>et seq.</em> (West 1982), contains a provision allowing a court to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation.  We hold that application of the California statute is not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1 <em>et seq.,</em> in a case where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of California.</p>\n<p>Appellant Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (Volt), and appellee Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford) entered into a construction contract under which Volt was to install a system of electrical conduits on the Stanford campus.  The contract contained an agreement to arbitrate all disputes between the parties "arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The contract also contained a choice-of-law clause providing that "[t]he Contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located."  App. 37.  During the course of the project, a dispute developed regarding compensation for extra work, and Volt made a formal demand for arbitration.  Stanford responded by filing an action against Volt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 489 U. S. 471</a></p><p> in California Superior Court, alleging fraud and breach of contract; in the same action, Stanford also sought indemnity from two other companies involved in the construction project, with whom it did not have arbitration agreements.  Volt petitioned the Superior Court to compel arbitration of the dispute. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Stanford, in turn, moved to stay arbitration pursuant to Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c) (West 1982), which permits a court to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation between a party to the arbitration agreement and third parties not bound by it, where "there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Superior Court denied Volt\'s motion to compel arbitration and stayed the arbitration proceedings pending the outcome of the litigation on the authority of \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c).   App. 59-60.</p>\n<p>The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The court acknowledged that the parties\' contract involved interstate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 489 U. S. 472</a></p><p> commerce, that the FAA governs contracts in interstate commerce, and that the FAA contains no provision permitting a court to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation involving third parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.  App. 64-65.  However, the court held that, by specifying that their contract would be governed by "<em>the law of the place where the project is located,\'" the parties had incorporated the California rules of arbitration, including \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c), into their arbitration agreement.  <em>Id.</em> at 65.  Finally, the court rejected Volt\'s contention that, even if the parties had agreed to arbitrate under the California rules, application of \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c) here was nonetheless preempted by the FAA because the contract involved interstate commerce.  <em>Id.</em> at 68-80.\n</em></p>\n<p>The court reasoned that the purpose of the FAA was</p>\n<p>"\'not [to] mandate the arbitration of all claims, but merely the enforcement . . . of privately negotiated arbitration agreements.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 70 (quoting <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/case.html">470 U. S. 213</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/case.html#219">470 U. S. 219</a></span> (1985)).  While the FAA therefore preempts application of state laws which render arbitration agreements unenforceable,</p>\n<p>"[i]t does not follow, however, that the federal law has preclusive effect in a case where the parties have chosen in their [arbitration] agreement to abide by state rules."</p>\n<p>App. 71.  To the contrary, because "[t]he thrust of the federal law is that arbitration is strictly a matter of contract," <em>ibid.,</em> the parties to an arbitration agreement should be "at liberty to choose the terms under which they will arbitrate."  <em>Id.</em> at 72.  Where, as here, the parties have chosen in their agreement to abide by the state rules of arbitration, application of the FAA to prevent enforcement of those rules would actually be "inimical to the policies underlying state and federal arbitration law," <em>id.</em> at 73, because it would "force the parties to arbitrate in a manner contrary to their agreement."  <em>Id.</em> at 65.  The California Supreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 489 U. S. 473</a></p><p> Court denied Volt\'s petition for discretionary review.  <em>Id.</em> at 87.  We postponed consideration of our jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.  485 U.S. 976 (1988).  We now hold that we have appellate jurisdiction, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and affirm. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 489 U. S. 474</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellant devotes the bulk of its argument to convincing us that the Court of Appeal erred in interpreting the choice-of-law clause to mean that the parties had incorporated the California rules of arbitration into their arbitration agreement.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellant 66-96.  Appellant acknowledges, as it must, that the interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law, which this Court does not sit to review.  <em>See id.</em> at 26, 29.  But appellant nonetheless maintains that we should set aside the Court of Appeal\'s interpretation of this particular contractual provision for two principal reasons.</p>\n<p>Appellant first suggests that the Court of Appeal\'s construction of the choice-of-law clause was, in effect, a finding that appellant had "waived" its "federally guaranteed right to compel arbitration of the parties\' dispute," a waiver whose validity must be judged by reference to federal, rather than state, law.  <em>Id.</em> at 17, 30-36.  This argument fundamentally misconceives the nature of the rights created by the FAA.  The Act was designed "to overrule the judiciary\'s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate," <em>Byrd, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/case.html#219">470 U. S. 219</a></span>-220, and place such agreements "<em>upon the same footing as other contracts,\'" <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/506/case.html">417 U. S. 506</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/506/case.html#511">417 U. S. 511</a></span> (1974) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 2 (1924)).  Section 2 of the Act therefore declares that a written agreement to arbitrate in any contract involving interstate commerce or a maritime transaction "shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract," 9 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2, and \xc2\xa7 4 allows a party to such an arbitration agreement to\n</em></p>\n<p>"petition any United States district court . . . for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement."</p>\n<p>But \xc2\xa7 4 of the FAA does not confer a right to compel arbitration of any dispute at any time; it confers only the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 489 U. S. 475</a></p><p> right to obtain an order directing that "arbitration proceed <em>in the manner provided for in [the parties\'] agreement.</em>"  9 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4 (emphasis added).  Here the Court of Appeal found that, by incorporating the California rules of arbitration into their agreement, the parties had agreed that arbitration would not proceed in situations which fell within the scope of Calif.Code Civ.Proc.Ann. \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c).  This was not a finding that appellant had "waived" an FAA-guaranteed right to compel arbitration of this dispute, but a finding that it had no such right in the first place, because the parties\' agreement did not require arbitration to proceed in this situation.  Accordingly, appellant\'s contention that the contract interpretation issue presented here involves the "waiver" of a federal right is without merit.</p>\n<p>Second, appellant argues that we should set aside the Court of Appeal\'s construction of the choice-of-law clause because it violates the settled federal rule that questions of arbitrability in contracts subject to the FAA must be resolved with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.  Brief for Appellant 49-52; <em>id.</em> at 92-96, citing <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/case.html">460 U.

S. 24</a></span>-25 (1983) (section 2 of the FAA "create[s] a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act," which requires that "questions of arbitrability . . . be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration," and that "any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues . . . be resolved in favor of arbitration"); <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/case.html">473 U. S. 614</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/case.html#626">473 U. S. 626</a></span> (1985) (in construing an arbitration agreement within the coverage of the FAA, "as with any other contract, the parties\' intentions control, but those intentions are generously construed as to issues of arbitrability").  These cases of course establish that, in applying general state law principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the Act, <em>see Perry v. Thomas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/483/case.html">482 U. S. 483</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/483/case.html#493">482 U. S. 493</a></span>, n. 9 (1987), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 489 U. S. 476</a></p><p> due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.</p>\n<p>But we do not think the Court of Appeal offended the <em>Moses H. Cone</em> principle by interpreting the choice-of-law provision to mean that the parties intended the California rules of arbitration, including the \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c) stay provision, to apply to their arbitration agreement.  There is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules; the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of private agreements to arbitrate.  Interpreting a choice-of-law clause to make applicable state rules governing the conduct of arbitration -- rules which are manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process -- simply does not offend the rule of liberal construction set forth in <em>Moses H. Cone,</em> nor does it offend any other policy embodied in the FAA. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The question remains whether, assuming the choice-of-law clause meant what the Court of Appeal found it to mean, application of Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c) is nonetheless preempted by the FAA to the extent it is used to stay arbitration under this contract involving interstate commerce.  It is undisputed that this contract falls within the coverage of the FAA, since it involves interstate commerce, and that the FAA contains no provision authorizing a stay of arbitration in this situation.  Appellees contend, however, that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3 and 4 of the FAA, which are the specific sections </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 489 U. S. 477</a></p><p> claimed to conflict with the California statute at issue here, are not applicable in this state court proceeding, and thus cannot preempt application of the California statute.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellee 43-50.  While the argument is not without some merit, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] we need not resolve it to decide this case, for we conclude that, even if \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3 and 4 of the FAA are fully applicable in state court proceedings, they do not prevent application of Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c) to stay arbitration where, as here, the parties have agreed to arbitrate in accordance with California law.</p>\n<p>The FAA contains no express preemptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.  <em>See Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/198/case.html">350 U. S. 198</a></span> (1956) (upholding application of state arbitration law to arbitration provision in contract not covered by the FAA).  But even when Congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area, state law may nonetheless be preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law -- that is, to the extent that it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."  <em>Hines v.

But it does not follow that the FAA prevents the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the Act itself.  Indeed, such a result would be quite inimical to the FAA\'s primary purpose of ensuring that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.  Arbitration under the Act is a matter of consent, not coercion, and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.

Where, as here, the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration, enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the FAA, even if the result is that arbitration is stayed where the Act would otherwise permit it to go forward.  By permitting the courts to "rigorously enforce" such agreements according to their terms, <em>see Byrd, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/case.html#221">470 U.

In this case, appellant contended before the Court of Appeal that, even if the contract required application of Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c), the California statute, as applied to stay arbitration under this contract in interstate commerce, so conflicted with the FAA that it was invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  The Court of Appeal upheld application of the statute against this challenge, and under <em>Datanke-Walker</em> and its progeny, that was sufficient to bring the case within the terms of \xc2\xa7 1257(2), even though the court\'s decision may have been premised on its interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Unlike the dissent, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/case.html#486">489 U.

As indicated, the FAA itself contains no provision designed to deal with the special practical problems that arise in multiparty contractual disputes when some or all of the contracts at issue include agreements to arbitrate.  California has taken the lead in fashioning a legislative response to this problem, by giving courts authority to consolidate or stay arbitration proceedings in these situations in order to minimize the potential for contradictory judgments.  <em>See</em> Calif.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>While we have held that the FAA\'s "substantive" provisions -- \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 -- are applicable in state as well as federal court, <em>see Southland Corp. v.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  When a dispute arose between the parties, Volt invoked the arbitration clause, while Stanford attempted to avoid it (apparently because the dispute also involved two other contractors with whom Stanford had no arbitration agreements).</p>\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1 <em>et seq.,</em> requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/case.html#474">489 U.

The California courts nonetheless rejected Volt\'s petition to compel arbitration in reliance on a provision of state law that, in the circumstances presented, permitted a court to stay arbitration pending the conclusion of related litigation.  Volt, not surprisingly, suggested that the Supremacy Clause compelled a different result.  The California Court of Appeal found, however, that the parties had agreed that their contract would be governed solely by the law of the State of California, to the exclusion of federal law.

I have no quarrel with the general proposition that the interpretation of contracts is a matter of state law.  By ending its analysis at that level of generality, however, the Court overlooks well-established precedent to the effect that, in order to guard against arbitrary denials of federal claims, a state court\'s construction of a contract in such a way as to preclude enforcement of a federal right is not immune from review in this Court as to its "adequacy."</p>\n<p>Many of our cases that so hold involve, understandably enough, claims under the Contract Clause.

Since the FAA merely requires enforcement of what the parties have agreed to, moreover, they are free if they wish to write an agreement to arbitrate outside the coverage of the FAA.

Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/case.html">473 U.

Keating,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/1/case.html">465 U. S. 1</a></span> (1984).\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court recognizes the relevance of the <em>Moses Cone</em> principle, but finds it unoffended by the Court of Appeal\'s decision, which, the Court suggests, merely determines what set of procedural rules will apply.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/case.html#476">489 U. S. 476</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  I agree fully with the Court that "the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of private agreements to arbitrate," <em>ibid.,</em> but I disagree emphatically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 489 U. S. 487</a></p><p> with its conclusion that that policy is not frustrated here.  Applying the California procedural rule, which stays arbitration while litigation of the same issue goes forward, means simply that the parties\' dispute will be litigated, rather than arbitrated.  Thus, interpreting the parties\' agreement to say that the California procedural rules apply, rather than the FAA, where the parties arguably had no such intent, implicates the <em>Moses H. Cone</em> principle no less than would an interpretation of the parties\' contract that erroneously denied the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>While appearing to recognize that the state court\'s interpretation of the contract does raise a question of federal law, the Court nonetheless refuses to determine whether the state court misconstrued that agreement.  There is no warrant for failing to do so.  The FAA requires that a court determining a question of arbitrability not stop with the application of state law rules for construing the parties\' intentions, but that it also take account of the command of federal law that "those intentions [be] generously construed as to issues of arbitrability."  <em>Mitsubishi Motors, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/case.html#626">473 U. S. 626</a></span>.  Thus, the decision below is based on both state and federal law, which are thoroughly intertwined.  In such circumstances the state court judgment cannot be said to rest on an "adequate and independent state ground," so as to bar review by this Court.  <em>See Enterprise Irrigation Dist. v. Farmers Mutual Canal Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/243/157/case.html">243 U. S. 157</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/243/157/case.html#164">243 U.

S. 488</a></p><p> ground is so interwoven with the other as not to be an independent matter . . . our jurisdiction is plain").  With a proper application of federal law in this case, the state court\'s judgment might have been different, and our review is therefore not barred.  <em>Cf. Ake v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/68/case.html">470 U. S. 68</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/68/case.html#74">470 U.

Cone, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/case.html#24">460 U. S. 24</a></span>, it is clear that the choice-of-law clause cannot bear the interpretation the California court assigned to it.</p>\n<p>Construction of a contractual provision is, of course, a matter of discerning the parties\' intent.  It is important to recall, in the first place, that, in this case, there is no extrinsic evidence of their intent.  We must therefore rely on the contract itself.  But the provision of the contract at issue here was not one that these parties drafted themselves.  Rather, they incorporated portions of a standard form contract commonly used in the construction industry.  That makes it most unlikely that their intent was in any way at variance with the purposes for which choice-of-law clauses are commonly written and the manner in which they are generally interpreted.</p>\n<p>It seems to me beyond dispute that the normal purpose of such choice-of-law clauses is to determine that the law of one State, rather than that of another State, will be applicable; they simply do not speak to any interaction between state and federal law.  A cursory glance at standard conflicts texts confirms this observation:  they contain no reference at all to the relation between federal and state law in their discussions of contractual choice-of-law clauses.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 489 U. S. 489</a></p><p> R. Weintraub, Commentary on the Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7 7.3C (2d ed.1980); E. Scoles &amp; P. Hay, Conflict of Laws 632-652 (1982); R. Leflar, L. McDougal, &amp; R. Felix, American Conflicts Law \xc2\xa7 147 (4th ed.1986).  The same is true of standard codifications.  <em>See</em> Uniform Commercial Code \xc2\xa7 1-105(1) (1978); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7 187 (1971).  Indeed the Restatement of Conflicts notes expressly that it does not deal with</p>\n<p>"the ever-present problem of determining the respective spheres of authority of the law and courts of the nation and of the member States."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 2,  Comment c.  Decisions of this Court fully bear out the impression that choice-of-law clauses do not speak to any state-federal issue.  On at least two occasions, we have been called upon to determine the applicability <em>vel non</em> of the FAA to contracts containing choice-of-law clauses similar to that at issue here.  Despite adverting to the choice-of-law clauses in other contexts in our opinions, we ascribed no significance whatever to them in connection with the applicability of the FAA.  <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/506/case.html">417 U. S. 506</a></span> (1974); <em>Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/198/case.html">350 U. S. 198</a></span> (1956). [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  The great weight of lower court authority similarly rejects the notion that a choice-of-law clause renders the FAA inapplicable. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 489 U. S. 490</a></p><p> Choice-of-law clauses simply have never been used for the purpose of dealing with the relationship between state and federal law.  There is no basis whatever for believing that the parties in this case intended their choice-of-law clause to do so.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the literal language of the contract -- "the law of the place" -- gives no indication of any intention to apply only state law and exclude other law that would normally be applicable to something taking place at that location.  By settled principles of federal supremacy, the law of any place in the United States includes federal law.  <em>See Claffin v. Houseman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html">93 U. S. 130</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html#136">93 U.

App. 82 (opinion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 489 U. S. 491</a></p><p> of Capaccioli, J.).  Thus, "the mere choice of California law is not a selection of California law over federal law. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 84.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that this is what the parties meant by "the law of the place where the Project is located."</p>\n<p>Indeed, this is precisely what we said when we once previously confronted virtually the same question.

Rejecting the contention that the parties thereby had agreed to be bound solely by local law, we held:</p>\n<p>"Paragraph 15 provides that the deed is to be governed by the \'law of the jurisdiction\' in which the property is located; but the \'law of the jurisdiction\' includes federal, as well as state, law."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/141/case.html#157">458 U.

They will usually do so by means of an express choice-of-law clause in their written contract").  Were every state court to construe such clauses as an expression of the parties\' intent to exclude the application of federal law, as has the California Court of Appeal in this case, the result would be to render the Federal Arbitration Act a virtual nullity as to presently existing contracts.  I cannot believe that the parties to contracts intend such consequences to flow from their insertion of a standard choice-of-law clause.  Even less can I agree that we are powerless to review decisions of state courts that effectively nullify a vital piece of federal legislation.

To stay the arbitration proceedings pending litigation of the same issues, as \xc2\xa7 1281.2(c) provides, is not compatible with specific enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate -- which is what the FAA requires here.
