EDWARDS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of indiana</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93208.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 26, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 19, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">After \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indiana charged respondent Edwards with attempted murder and other crimes for a shooting during his attempt to steal a pair of shoes, his mental condition became the subject of three competency proceedings and two self-representation requests, mostly before the same trial judge.  Referring to the lengthy record of psychiatric reports, the trial court noted that Edwards suffered from schizophrenia and concluded that, although it appeared he was competent to stand trial, he was not competent to defend himself at trial.  The court therefore denied Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 self-representation request.  He was represented by appointed counsel at trial and convicted on two counts.  Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, agreeing with Edwards that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to permit him to represent himself deprived him of his constitutional right of self-representation under the Sixth Amendment and <em>Faretta</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/index.html">422 U. S. 806</a>.  Although finding that the record provided substantial support for the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, the Indiana Supreme Court nonetheless affirmed the intermediate appellate court on the ground that <em>Faretta</em> and <em>Godinez</em> v. <em>Moran</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/389/index.html">509 U. S. 389</a>, required the State to allow Edwards to represent himself.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Constitution does not forbid States from insisting upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents frame the question presented, but they do not answer it.  <em>Dusky</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/402/index.html">362 U. S. 402</a>, and <em>Drope</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/162/index.html">420 U. S. 162</a>, 171, set forth the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmental competence\xe2\x80\x9d standard forbidding the trial of an individual lacking a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and sufficient ability to consult with his lawyer<em> </em>with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.  But those cases did not consider the issue presented here, namely, the relation of that \xe2\x80\x9cmental competence\xe2\x80\x9d standard to the self-representation right.  Similarly the Court\xe2\x80\x99s foundational \xe2\x80\x9cself-representation\xe2\x80\x9d case, <em>Faretta</em>, <em>supra</em>\xe2\x80\x94which held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments include a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional right to proceed <em>without</em> counsel when\xe2\x80\x9d a criminal defendant \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily and intelligently elects to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d 422 U. S., at 807\xe2\x80\x94does not answer the question as to the scope of the self-representation right.  Finally, although <em>Godinez, supra,</em> presents a question closer to the one at issue in that it focused upon a borderline-competent defendant who had asked a state trial court to permit him to represent himself and to change his pleas from not guilty to guilty, <em>Godinez</em> provides no answer here because that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct a defense at trial was expressly not at issue in that case, see 509 U. S., at 399\xe2\x80\x93400, and because the case\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding that a State may <em>permit </em>a gray-area defendant to represent himself does not tell a State whether it may <em>deny </em>such a defendant the right to represent himself at his trial.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Several considerations taken together lead the Court to conclude that the Constitution permits a State to limit a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s self-representation right by insisting upon trial counsel when the defendant lacks the mental competency to conduct his trial defense unless represented.  First, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, while not answering the question, points slightly in that direction.  By setting forth a standard that focuses directly upon a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consult with his lawyer,<em> Dusky </em>and <em>Drope</em> assume representation by counsel and emphasize counsel\xe2\x80\x99s importance, thus suggesting (though not holding) that choosing to forgo trial counsel presents a very different set of circumstances than the mental competency determination for a defendant to stand trial.  Also, <em>Faretta</em> rested its self-representation conclusion in part on pre-existing state cases that are consistent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limitation on the self-representation right.  See 422 U. S., at 813, and n.\xc2\xa09.  Second, the nature of mental illness\xe2\x80\x94which is not a unitary concept, but varies in degree, can vary over time, and interferes with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s functioning at different times in different ways\xe2\x80\x94cautions against using a single competency standard to decide both whether a defendant who is represented can proceed to trial and whether a defendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself.  Third, a self-representation right at trial will not \xe2\x80\x9caffirm the dignity\xe2\x80\x9d of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel, see <em>McKaskle</em> v. <em>Wiggins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/168/index.html">465 U. S. 168</a>, 176\xe2\x80\x93177, and may undercut the most basic of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial.  The trial judge\xe2\x80\x94particularly one such as the judge in this case, who presided over one of Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 competency hearings and his two trials\xe2\x80\x94will often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s individualized circumstances.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s proposed standard, which would deny a criminal defendant the right to represent himself at trial if he cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury, is rejected because this Court is uncertain as to how that standard would work in practice.   The Court also declines Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s request to overrule <em>Faretta </em>because today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion may well remedy the unfair trial concerns previously leveled against the case.

We must decide whether in these circumstances the Constitution forbids a State from insisting that the defendant proceed to trial with counsel, the State thereby denying the defendant the right to represent himself.  See U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; <em>Faretta</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/index.html"></a><a href="/us/422/806/index.html">422 U. S. 806</a> (1975).  We conclude that the Constitution does not forbid a State so to insist.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 1999 Ahmad Edwards, the respondent, tried to steal a pair of shoes from an Indiana department store.  After he was discovered, he drew a gun, fired at a store security officer, and wounded a bystander.  He was caught and then charged with attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness, and theft.  His mental condition subsequently became the subject of three competency proceedings and two self-representation requests, mostly before the same trial judge:</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>1.<em>\xe2\x80\x82First Competency Hearing: August 2000</em>.  Five months after Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, his court-appointed counsel asked for a psychiatric evaluation.  After hearing psychiatrist and neuropsychologist witnesses (in February 2000 and again in August 2000), the court found Edwards incompetent to stand trial, App. 365a, and committed him to Logansport State Hospital for evaluation and treatment, see <em>id</em>., at 48a\xe2\x80\x9353a.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>2.<em>\xe2\x80\x82Second Competency Hearing: March 2002. </em> Seven months after his commitment, doctors found that Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 condition had improved to the point where he could stand trial.  <em>Id</em>., at 63a\xe2\x80\x9364a.  Several months later, however, but still before trial, Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 counsel asked for another psychiatric evaluation.  In March 2002, the judge held a competency hearing, considered additional psychiatric evidence, and (in April) found that Edwards, while \xe2\x80\x9csuffer[ing] from mental illness,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9ccompetent to assist his attorneys in his defense and stand trial for the charged crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 114a.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>3.<em>\xe2\x80\x82Third Competency Hearing: April 2003.</em>  Seven months later but still before trial, Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 counsel sought yet another psychiatric evaluation of his client.  And, in April 2003, the court held yet another competency hearing.  Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 counsel presented further psychiatric and neuropsychological evidence showing that Edwards was suffering from serious thinking difficulties and delusions.  A testifying psychiatrist reported that Edwards could understand the charges against him, but he was \xe2\x80\x9cunable to cooperate with his attorney in his defense because of his schizophrenic illness\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[h]is delusions and his marked difficulties in thinking make it impossible for him to cooperate with his attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 164a.  In November 2003, the court concluded that Edwards was not then competent to stand trial and ordered his recommitment to the state hospital.  <em>Id</em>., at 206a\xe2\x80\x93211a.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>4.<em>\xe2\x80\x82First Self-Representation Request and First Trial: June 2005.  </em>About eight months after his commitment, the hospital reported that Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 condition had again improved to the point that he had again become competent to stand trial.  <em>Id</em>., at 228a\xe2\x80\x93236a.  And almost one year after that Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 trial began.  Just before trial, Edwards asked to represent himself.  <em>Id</em>., at 509a, 520a.  He also asked for a continuance, which, he said, he needed in order to proceed <em>pro se</em>.  <em>Id</em>., at 519a\xe2\x80\x93520a.  The court refused the continuance.  <em>Id</em>., at 520a.  Edwards then proceeded to trial represented by counsel.  The jury convicted him of criminal recklessness and theft but failed to reach a verdict on the charges of attempted murder and battery.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>5.<em>\xe2\x80\x82Second Self-Representation Request and Second Trial: December 2005</em>.  The State decided to retry Edwards on the attempted murder and battery charges.  Just before the retrial, Edwards again asked the court to permit him to represent himself.  <em>Id</em>., at 279a\xe2\x80\x93282a.  Referring to the lengthy record of psychiatric reports, the trial court noted that Edwards still suffered from schizophrenia and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith these findings, he\xe2\x80\x99s competent to stand trial but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to find he\xe2\x80\x99s competent to defend himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 527a.  The court denied Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 self-representation request.  Edwards was represented by appointed counsel at his retrial.  The jury convicted Edwards on both of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Edwards subsequently appealed to Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s intermediate appellate court.  He argued that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to permit him to represent himself at his retrial deprived him of his constitutional right of self-representation.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; <em>Faretta</em>, <em>supra</em>.  The court agreed and ordered a new trial.  The matter then went to the Indiana Supreme Court.  That court found that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record in this case presents a substantial basis to agree with the trial court,\xe2\x80\x9d 866 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 252, 260 (2007), but it nonetheless affirmed the intermediate appellate court on the belief that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, namely, <em>Faretta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/index.html"></a><a href="/us/422/806/index.html">422 U. S. 806</a>, and <em>Godinez</em> v. <em>Moran</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/389/index.html">509 U. S. 389</a> (1993), required the State to allow Edwards to represent himself.  At Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s request, we agreed to consider whether the Constitution required the trial court to allow Edwards to represent himself at trial.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our examination of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents convinces us that those precedents frame the question presented, but they do not answer it.  The two cases that set forth the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmental competence\xe2\x80\x9d standard, <em>Dusky</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/402/index.html">362 U. S. 402</a> (1960) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and <em>Drope</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/162/index.html">420 U. S. 162</a> (1975), specify that the Constitution does not permit trial of an individual who lacks \xe2\x80\x9cmental competency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dusky </em>defines the competency standard as including both (1) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant has \xe2\x80\x9ca rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) whether the defendant \xe2\x80\x9chas sufficient present ability <em>to consult with his lawyer </em>with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d  362 U. S., at 402 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  <em>Drope </em>repeats that standard, stating that it \xe2\x80\x9chas long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, <em>to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense</em> may not be subjected to a trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U. S., at 171 (emphasis added).  Neither case considered the mental competency issue presented here, namely, the relation of the mental competence standard to the right of self-representation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s foundational \xe2\x80\x9cself-representation\xe2\x80\x9d case, <em>Faretta</em>, held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments include a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional right to proceed <em>without</em> counsel when\xe2\x80\x9d a criminal defendant \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  422 U. S., at 807 (emphasis in original).  The Court implied that right from: (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cnearly universal conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d made manifest in state law, that \xe2\x80\x9cforcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 817\xe2\x80\x93818; (2) Sixth Amendment language granting rights to the \xe2\x80\x9caccused;\xe2\x80\x9d (3) Sixth Amendment structure indicating that the rights it sets forth, related to the \xe2\x80\x9cfair administration of American justice,\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cpersona[l]\xe2\x80\x9d to the accused, <em>id</em>., at 818\xe2\x80\x93821; (4) the absence of historical examples of <em>forced</em> representation, <em>id</em>., at 821\xe2\x80\x93832; and (5) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98respect for the individual,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 834 (quoting <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/337/index.html">397 U. S. 337</a>, 350\xe2\x80\x93351 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring) (a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel \xe2\x80\x9cmust be honored out of \xe2\x80\x98that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Faretta</em> does not answer the question before us both because it did not consider the problem of mental competency (cf. 422 U. S., at 835 (Faretta was \xe2\x80\x9cliterate, competent, and understanding\xe2\x80\x9d)), and because <em>Faretta </em>itself and later cases have made clear that the right of self-representation is not absolute.  See <em>Martinez</em> v. <em>Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/152/index.html">528 U. S. 152</a>, 163 (2000) (no right of self-representation on direct appeal in a criminal case); <em>McKaskle</em> v. <em>Wiggins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/168/index.html">465 U. S. 168</a>, 178\xe2\x80\x93179 (1984) (appointment of standby counsel over self-represented defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objection is permissible); <em>Faretta</em>, 422 U. S., at 835, n. 46 (no right \xe2\x80\x9cto abuse the dignity of the courtroom\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid</em>. (no right to avoid compliance with \xe2\x80\x9crelevant rules of procedural and substantive law\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at<em> </em>834, n. 46 (no right to \xe2\x80\x9cengag[e] in serious and obstructionist misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <em>supra</em>).  The question here concerns a mental-illness-related limitation on the scope of the self-representation right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole case in which this Court considered mental competence and self-representation together, <em>Godinez, supra,</em> presents a question closer to that at issue here.  The case focused upon a borderline-competent criminal defendant who had asked a state trial court to permit him to represent himself and to change his pleas from not\nguilty to guilty.  The state trial court had found that the defendant met <em>Dusky\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>mental competence standard, that he \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intelligently\xe2\x80\x9d waived his right to assistance of counsel, and that he \xe2\x80\x9cfreely and voluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d chose to plead guilty.  509 U. S., at 393 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the state trial court had consequently granted the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s self-representation and change-of-plea requests.  See <em>id</em>., at 392\xe2\x80\x93393.  A federal appeals court, however, had vacated the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty pleas on the ground that the Constitution required the trial court to ask a further question, namely, whether the defendant was competent to waive his constitutional right to counsel.  See <em>id</em>., at 393\xe2\x80\x93394.  Competence to make that latter decision, the appeals court said, required the defendant to satisfy a higher mental competency standard than the standard set forth in <em>Dusky</em>.  See 509 U. S., at 393\xe2\x80\x93394.  <em>Dusky</em>\xe2\x80\x99s more general standard sought only to determine whether a defendant represented by counsel was competent to stand trial, not whether he was competent to waive his right to counsel.  509 U. S.,<em> </em>at 394\xe2\x80\x93395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, \xe2\x80\x9creject[ed] the notion that competence to plead guilty or to waive the right to counsel must be measured by a standard that is higher than (or even different from) the <em>Dusky</em> standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 398.  The decision to plead guilty, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cis no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a [represented] defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hence \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason to believe that the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciably higher level of mental functioning than the decision to waive other constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 399.  And even assuming that self-representation might pose special trial-related difficulties, \xe2\x80\x9cthe competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to<em> waive the right, </em>not the competence to represent himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis in original).  For this reason, we concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98technical legal knowledge\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98not relevant\xe2\x80\x99 to the determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 400 (quoting <em>Faretta</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 836).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We concede that <em>Godinez </em>bears certain similarities with the present case.  Both involve mental competence and self-representation.  Both involve a defendant who wants to represent himself.  Both involve a mental condition that falls in a gray area between <em>Dusky\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>minimal constitutional requirement that measures a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to stand trial and a somewhat higher standard that measures mental fitness for another legal purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We nonetheless conclude that <em>Godinez </em>does not answer the question before us now.  In part that is because the Court of Appeals higher standard at issue in <em>Godinez</em> differs in a critical way from the higher standard at issue here.  In <em>Godinez, </em>the higher standard sought to measure the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to proceed on his own to enter a guilty plea; here the higher standard seeks to measure the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct trial proceedings.  To put the matter more specifically, the <em>Godinez</em> defendant sought only to change his pleas to guilty, he did not seek to conduct trial proceedings, and his ability to conduct a defense at trial was expressly not at issue.  Thus we emphasized in <em>Godinez </em>that we needed to consider only the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompetence to<em> waive the right</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  509 U. S., at 399 (emphasis in original).  And we further emphasized that we need <em>not</em> consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical legal knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d about how to proceed at trial.  <em>Id</em>., at 400 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We found our holding consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statement in <em>Massey</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/105/index.html">348 U. S. 105</a>, 108 (1954), that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne might not be insane in the sense of being incapable of standing trial and yet lack the capacity to stand trial without benefit of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Godinez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 399\xe2\x80\x93400, n.\xc2\xa010 (quoting <em>Massey</em> and noting that it dealt with \xe2\x80\x9ca question that is quite different from the question presented\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Godinez</em>).  In this case, the very matters that we did not consider in <em>Godinez </em>are directly before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, <em>Godinez </em>involved a State that sought to <em>permit </em>a gray-area defendant to represent himself.  <em>Godinez</em>\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding is that a State may do so.  But that holding simply does not tell a State whether it may <em>deny </em>a gray-area defendant the right to represent himself\xe2\x80\x94the matter at issue here.  One might argue that <em>Godinez</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>grant (to a State) of permission to allow a gray-area defendant self-representation must implicitly include permission to deny self-representation.  Cf. 509 U. S., at 402 (\xe2\x80\x9cStates are free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the <em>Dusky </em>formulation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet one could more forcefully argue that <em>Godinez </em>simply<em> </em>did not consider whether the Constitution <em>requires</em> self-representation by gray-area defendants even in circumstances where the State seeks to disallow it (the question here).  The upshot is that, in our view, the question before us is an open one.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now turn to the question presented.  We assume that a criminal defendant has sufficient mental competence to stand trial (<em>i.e</em>., the defendant meets <em>Dusky\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>standard) and that the defendant insists on representing himself during that trial.  We ask whether the Constitution permits a State to limit that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s self-representation right by insisting upon representation by counsel at trial\xe2\x80\x94on the ground that the defendant lacks the mental capacity to conduct his trial defense unless represented.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several considerations taken together lead us to conclude that the answer to this question is yes.  First, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, while not answering the question, points slightly in the direction of our affirmative answer.  <em>Godinez, </em>as we have just said, simply leaves the question open.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmental competency\xe2\x80\x9d cases set forth a standard that focuses directly upon a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpresent ability to consult with his lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dusky</em>, 362 U. S., at 402 (internal quotation marks omitted); a \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity \xe2\x80\xa6 to consult with counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d and an ability \xe2\x80\x9cto assist [counsel] in preparing his defense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Drope</em>, 420 U. S., at 171.  See <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cIt has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, <em>to consult with counsel,</em> and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  These standards assume representation by counsel and emphasize the importance of counsel.  They thus suggest (though do not hold) that an instance in which a defendant who would choose to forgo counsel at trial presents a very different set of circumstances, which in our view, calls for a different standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time <em>Faretta</em>, the foundational self-representation case, rested its conclusion in part upon pre-existing state law set forth in cases all of which are consistent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limitation on the self-representation right.  See 422 U. S., at 813, and n.\xc2\xa09 (citing 16 state-court decisions and two secondary sources).  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Cappetta</em> v. <em>State</em>, 204 So.\xc2\xa02d 913, 917\xe2\x80\x93918 (Fla. App. 1967), rev\xe2\x80\x99d on other grounds, 216 So.\xc2\xa02d 749 (Fla. 1968), cited in <em>Faretta</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 813, n.\xc2\xa09 (assuring a \xe2\x80\x9cmentally competent\xe2\x80\x9d defendant the right \xe2\x80\x9cto conduct his own defense\xe2\x80\x9d <em>provided that </em>\xe2\x80\x9cno unusual circumstances exist\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>such as, <em>e.g</em>., \xe2\x80\x9cmental derangement\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>that \xe2\x80\x9cwould \xe2\x80\xa6 depriv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cof a fair trial if allowed to conduct his own defense,\xe2\x80\x9d 204 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 917\xe2\x80\x93918); <em>id.</em>, at 918 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cwhether unusual circumstances are evident is a matter resting in the sound discretion granted to the trial judge\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 324 Mass. 558, 562\xe2\x80\x93563, 87 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 192, 195 (1949) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe assignment of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d where there was some \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d such as when the criminal defendant was \xe2\x80\x9cmentally defective\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the nature of the problem before us cautions against the use of a single mental competency standard for deciding both (1) whether a defendant who is represented by counsel can proceed to trial and (2) whether a defendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself.  Mental illness itself is not a unitary concept.  It varies in degree.  It can vary over time.  It interferes with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s functioning at different times in different ways.  The history of this case (set forth in Part I, <em>supra) </em>illustrates the complexity of the problem.  In certain instances an individual may well be able to satisfy <em>Dusky\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>mental competence standard, for he will be able to work with counsel at trial, yet at the same time he may be unable to carry out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense without the help of counsel.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, N. Poythress, R. Bonnie, J. Monahan, R. Otto, &amp; S. Hoge, Adjudicative Competence: The MacArthur Studies 103 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cWithin each domain of adjudicative competence (competence to assist counsel; decisional competence) the data indicate that understanding, reasoning, and appreciation [of the charges against a defendant] are separable and somewhat independent aspects of functional legal ability\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>McKaskle</em>, 465 U. S., at 174 (describing trial tasks as including organization of defense, making motions, arguing points of law, participating in <em>voir dire</em>, questioning witnesses, and addressing the court and jury).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The American Psychiatric Association (APA) tells us (without dispute) in its <em>amicus</em> brief filed in support of neither party that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isorganized thinking, deficits in sustaining attention and concentration, impaired expressive abilities, anxiety, and other common symptoms of severe mental illnesses can impair the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to play the significantly expanded role required for self-representation even if he can play the lesser role of represented defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for APA et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 26.  Motions and other documents that the defendant prepared in this case (one of which we include in the Appendix, <em>infra</em>) suggest to a layperson the common sense of this general conclusion.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, in our view, a right of self-representation at trial will not \xe2\x80\x9caffirm the dignity\xe2\x80\x9d of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel.  <em>McKaskle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (\xe2\x80\x9cDignity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomy\xe2\x80\x9d of individual underlie self-representation right)<em>.</em>  To the contrary, given that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain mental state, the spectacle that could well result from his self-representation at trial is at least as likely to prove humiliating as ennobling.  Moreover, insofar as a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of capacity threatens an improper conviction or sentence, self-representation in that exceptional context undercuts the most basic of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial.  As Justice Brennan put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Constitution would protect none of us if it prevented the courts from acting to preserve the very processes that the Constitution itself prescribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em>, 397 U. S., at 350 (concurring opinion).  See <em>Martinez</em>, 528 U. S., at 162 (\xe2\x80\x9cEven at the trial level \xe2\x80\xa6 the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times outweighs the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interest in acting as his own lawyer\xe2\x80\x9d).

S. 153</a>, 160 (1988).  An <em>amicus</em> brief reports one psychiatrist\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to having observed a patient (a patient who had satisfied <em>Dusky</em>) try to conduct his own defense: \xe2\x80\x9c[H]ow in the world can our legal system allow an insane man to defend himself?\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Ohio et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See <em>Massey</em>, 348 U. S., at 108 (\xe2\x80\x9cNo trial can be fair that leaves the defense to a man who is insane, unaided by counsel, and who by reason of his mental condition stands helpless and alone before the court\xe2\x80\x9d).  The application of <em>Dusky\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>basic mental competence standard can help in part to avoid this result.  But given the different capacities needed to proceed to trial without counsel, there is little reason to believe that <em>Dusky </em>alone is sufficient.  At the same time, the trial judge, particularly one such as the trial judge in this case, who presided over one of Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 competency hearings and his two trials, will often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the individualized circumstances of a particular defendant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consequently conclude that the Constitution permits judges to take realistic account of the particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so.  That is to say, the Constitution permits States to insist upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial under <em>Dusky </em>but who still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indiana has also asked us to adopt, as a measure of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct a trial, a more specific standard that would \xe2\x80\x9cdeny a criminal defendant the right to represent himself at trial where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief  for Petitioner 20 (emphasis deleted).  We are sufficiently uncertain, however, as to how that particular standard would work in practice to refrain from endorsing it as a federal constitutional standard here.  We need not now, and we do not, adopt it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indiana has also asked us to overrule <em>Faretta</em>.  We decline to do so.  We recognize that judges have sometimes expressed concern that <em>Faretta, </em>contrary to its intent,<em> </em>has led to trials that are unfair.  See <em>Martinez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 164 (Breyer, J., concurring) (noting practical concerns of trial judges).  But recent empirical research suggests that such instances are not common.  See, <em>e.g</em>., Hashimoto, Defending the Right of Self-Representation: An Empirical Look at the Pro Se Felony Defendant, 85 N.\xc2\xa0C. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 423, 427, 447, 428 (2007) (noting that of the small number of defendants who chose to proceed <em>pro se</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9croughly 0.3% to 0.5%\xe2\x80\x9d of the total, state felony defendants in particular \xe2\x80\x9cappear to have achieved higher felony acquittal rates than their represented counterparts in that they were less likely to have been convicted of felonies\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the same time, instances in which the trial\xe2\x80\x99s fairness is in doubt may well be concentrated in the 20 percent or so of self-representation cases where the mental competence of the defendant is also at issue.  See <em>id</em>., at 428 (about 20 percent of federal <em>pro se</em> felony defendants ordered to undergo competency evaluations).  If so, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, assuring trial judges the authority to deal appropriately with cases in the latter category, may well alleviate those fair trial concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">So ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Excerpt from respondent\xe2\x80\x99s filing entitled \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Version of the Instant Offense,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which he had attached to his presentence investigation report:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The appointed motion of permissive intervention filed therein the court superior on, 6\xe2\x80\x9326\xe2\x80\x9301 caused a stay of action and apon it\xe2\x80\x99s expiration or thereafter three years the plan to establish a youth program to and for the coordination of aspects of law enforcement to prevent and reduce crime amoung young people in Indiana became a diplomatic act as under the Safe Streets Act of 1967, \xe2\x80\x9cA omnibuc considerate agent: I membered clients within the public and others that at/production of the courts actions showcased causes.

A mentally ill defendant who knowingly and voluntarily elects to proceed <em>pro se </em>instead of through counsel receives a fair trial that comports with the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Godinez </em>v.<em> Moran, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/509/389/index.html"></a><a href="/us/509/389/index.html">509 U.

In the years between 2000 and 2003\xe2\x80\x94years in which Edwards was apparently not treated with the antipsychotic medications and other drugs that are commonly prescribed for his illness\xe2\x80\x94Edwards was repeatedly declared incompetent to stand trial.  Even during this period, however, his mental state seems to have fluctuated.  For instance, one psychiatrist in March 2001 described Edwards in a competency report as \xe2\x80\x9cfree of psychosis, depression, mania, and confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9calert, oriented, [and] appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d apparently \xe2\x80\x9cable to think clearly\xe2\x80\x9d and apparently \xe2\x80\x9cpsychiatrically normal.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 61a. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Edwards seems to have been treated with antipsychotic medication for the first time in 2004.  He was found competent to stand trial the same year.  The psychiatrist making the recommendation described Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 thought processes as \xe2\x80\x9ccoherent\xe2\x80\x9d and wrote that he \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicate[d] very well,\xe2\x80\x9d that his speech was \xe2\x80\x9ceasy to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d that he displayed \xe2\x80\x9cgood communications skills, cooperative attitude, average intelligence, and good cognitive functioning,\xe2\x80\x9d that he could \xe2\x80\x9cappraise the roles of the participants in the courtroom proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had the capacity to challenge prosecution witnesses realistically and to testify relevantly.  <em>Id.</em>, at 232a\xe2\x80\x93235a (report of Dr. Robert Sena).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the course of what became two separate criminal trials, Edwards sought to act as his own lawyer.  He filed a number of incoherent written pleadings with the judge on which the Court places emphasis, but he also filed several intelligible pleadings, such as a motion to dismiss counsel, a motion to dismiss charges under the Indiana speedy trial provision, and a motion seeking a trial transcript.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Edwards made arguments in<em> </em>the courtroom that were more coherent than his written pleadings.  In seeking to represent himself at his first trial, Edwards complained in detail that the attorney representing him had not spent adequate time preparing and was not sharing legal materials for use in his defense.  The trial judge concluded that Edwards had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and proceeded to quiz Edwards about matters of state law.  Edwards correctly answered questions about the meaning of <em>voir dire </em>and how it operated, and described the basic framework for admitting videotape evidence to trial, though he was unable to answer other questions, including questions about the topics covered by state evidentiary rules that the judge identified only by number.  He persisted in his request to represent himself, but the judge denied the request because Edwards acknowledged he would need a continuance.  Represented by counsel, he was convicted of criminal recklessness and theft, but the jury deadlocked on charges of attempted murder and battery. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At his second trial, Edwards again asked the judge to be allowed to proceed <em>pro se</em>.  He explained that he and his attorney disagreed about which defense to present to the attempted murder charge.  Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 counsel favored lack of intent to kill; Edwards, self-defense.  As the defendant put it: \xe2\x80\x9cMy objection is me and my attorney actually had discussed a defense, I think prosecution had mentioned that, and we are in disagreement with it.  He has a defense and I have a defense that I would like to represent or present to the Judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 523a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court again rejected Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 request to proceed <em>pro se</em>, and this time it did not have the justification that Edwards had sought a continuance.  The court did not dispute that Edwards knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, but stated it was \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to carve out a third exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the right of self-representation, and\xe2\x80\x94without explaining precisely what abilities Edwards lacked\xe2\x80\x94stated Edwards was \xe2\x80\x9ccompetent to stand trial but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to find he\xe2\x80\x99s competent to defend himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 527a.  Edwards sought\xe2\x80\x94by a request through counsel and by raising an objection in open court\xe2\x80\x94to address the judge on the matter, but the judge refused, stating that the issue had already been decided.  Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 court-appointed attorney pursued the defense the attorney judged best\xe2\x80\x94lack of intent, not self-defense\xe2\x80\x94and Edwards was convicted of both attempted murder and battery.

He must \xe2\x80\x9cbe made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation,\xe2\x80\x9d and the record must \xe2\x80\x9cestablish that \xe2\x80\x98he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel.</em> <em>McCann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/269/index.html">317 U.

Edwards was warned extensively of the risks of proceeding <em>pro se</em>.  The trial judge found that Edwards had \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and voluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d waived his right to counsel at his first trial, App. 512a, and at his second trial the judge denied him the right to represent himself only by \xe2\x80\x9ccarv[ing] out\xe2\x80\x9d a new \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d to the right beyond the standard of knowing and voluntary waiver, <em>id.,</em> at 527a.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a defendant appreciates the risks of forgoing counsel and chooses to do so voluntarily, the Constitution protects his ability to present his own defense even when that harms his case.  In fact waiving counsel \xe2\x80\x9cusually\xe2\x80\x9d does so.  <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/168/index.html">465 U. S. 168</a>, 177, n.\xc2\xa08 (1984); see also <em>Faretta</em>, 422 U. S., at 834.  We have nonetheless said that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchoice must be honored out of \xe2\x80\x98that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  What the Constitution requires is not that a State\xe2\x80\x99s case be subject to the most rigorous adversarial testing possible\xe2\x80\x94after all, it permits a defendant to eliminate <em>all </em>adversarial testing by pleading guilty.  What the Constitution requires is that a defendant be given the right to challenge the State\xe2\x80\x99s case against him using the arguments <em>he </em>sees fit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Godinez, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/509/389/index.html"></a><a href="/us/509/389/index.html">509 U. S. 389</a>, we held that the Due Process Clause posed no barrier to permitting a defendant who suffered from mental illness both to waive his right to counsel and to plead guilty, so long as he was competent to stand trial and knowingly and voluntarily waived trial and the counsel right.  <em>Id.</em>, at 391, 400.  It was \xe2\x80\x9cnever the rule at common law\xe2\x80\x9d that a defendant could be competent to stand trial and yet incompetent to either exercise or give up some of the rights provided for his defense.  <em>Id.</em>, at 404 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  We rejected the invitation to craft a higher competency standard for waiving counsel than for standing trial.  That proposal, we said, was built on the \xe2\x80\x9cflawed premise\xe2\x80\x9d that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompetence to represent himself\xe2\x80\x9d was the relevant measure:  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <em>waive the right</em>, not the competence to represent himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 399.  We grounded this on <em>Faretta</em>\xe2\x80\x99s candid acknowledgment that the Sixth Amendment protected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to conduct a defense to his disadvantage.  509 U. S. at 399\xe2\x80\x93400.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is correct that this case presents a variation on <em>Godinez:</em> It presents the question not whether another constitutional requirement (in <em>Godinez</em>, the proposed higher degree of competence required for a waiver) limits a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to elect self-representation, but whether a State\xe2\x80\x99s view of fairness (or of other values) permits it to strip the defendant of this right.  But that makes the question before us an easier<em> </em>one.<em> </em>While one constitutional requirement must yield to another in case of conflict, nothing permits a State, because of <em>its </em>view of what is fair, to deny a constitutional protection.  Although \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of the rights set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/548/140/index.html">548 U. S. 140</a>, 145 (2006).  Thus, although the Confrontation Clause aims to produce fairness by ensuring the reliability of testimony, States may not provide for unconfronted testimony to be used at trial so long as it is reliable.  <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a>, 61 (2004).  We have rejected an approach to individual liberties that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then eliminates the right.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 145 (quoting <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/836/index.html">497 U. S. 836</a>, 862 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, the right of self-representation has been accorded the same respect as other constitutional guarantees.  The only circumstance in which we have permitted the State to deprive a defendant of this trial right is the one under which we have allowed the State to deny <em>other </em>such rights: when it is necessary to enable the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion.  That overriding necessity, we have said, justifies forfeiture of even the Sixth Amendment right to be present at trial\xe2\x80\x94if, after being threatened with removal, a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cinsists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/337/index.html">397 U. S. 337</a>, 343 (1970).  A <em>pro se </em>defendant may not \xe2\x80\x9cabuse the dignity of the courtroom,\xe2\x80\x9d nor may he fail to \xe2\x80\x9ccomply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law,\xe2\x80\x9d and a court may \xe2\x80\x9cterminate\xe2\x80\x9d the self-representation of a defendant who \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Faretta, supra, </em>at 834\xe2\x80\x93835, n.\xc2\xa046.  This ground for terminating self-representation is unavailable here, however, because Edwards was not even allowed to begin to represent himself, and because he was respectful and compliant and did not provide a basis to conclude a trial could not have gone forward had he been allowed to press his own claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond this circumstance, we have never constrained the ability of a defendant to retain \xe2\x80\x9cactual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what we have termed \xe2\x80\x9cthe core of the <em>Faretta </em>right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins, supra</em>, at 178.  Thus, while <em>Faretta </em>recognized that the right of self-representation does not bar the court from appointing standby counsel, we explained in <em>Wiggins </em>that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>pro se </em>defendant must be allowed to control the organization and content of his own defense, to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in <em>voir dire, </em>to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U. S., at 174.  Furthermore, because \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple voices \xe2\x80\x98for the defense\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d could \xe2\x80\x9cconfuse the message the defendant wishes to convey,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 177, a standby attorney\xe2\x80\x99s participation would be barred when it would \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy the jury\xe2\x80\x99s perception that the defendant is representing himself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 178.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have explained, I would not adopt an approach to the right of self-representation that we have squarely rejected for other rights\xe2\x80\x94allowing courts to disregard the right when doing so serves the purposes for which the right was intended.   But if I were to adopt such an approach, I would remain in dissent, because I believe the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the purposes of the right of self-representation is inaccurate to boot.  While there is little doubt that preserving individual \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dignity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (to which the Court refers), <em>ante,</em> at 11, is paramount among those purposes, there is equally little doubt that the loss of \xe2\x80\x9cdignity\xe2\x80\x9d the right is designed to prevent is <em>not </em>the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s making a fool of himself by presenting an amateurish or even incoherent defense.  Rather, the dignity at issue is the supreme human dignity of being master of one\xe2\x80\x99s fate rather than a ward of the State\xe2\x80\x94the dignity of individual choice.  <em>Faretta </em>explained that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s counsel clause should not be invoked to impair \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the exercise of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] free choice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to dispense with the right, 422 U. S., at 815 (quoting <em>Adams</em>, 317 U. S., at 280); for \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever else may be said of those who wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt that they understood the inestimable worth of free choice,\xe2\x80\x9d 422 U. S., at 833\xe2\x80\x93834.  Nine years later, when we wrote in <em>Wiggins </em>that the self-representation right served the \xe2\x80\x9cdignity and autonomy of the accused,\xe2\x80\x9d 465 U. S., at 177, we explained in no uncertain terms that this meant according every defendant the right to his say in court.  In particular, we said that individual dignity and autonomy barred standby counsel from participating in a manner that would to \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy the jury\xe2\x80\x99s perception that the defendant is representing himself,\xe2\x80\x9d and meant that \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>pro se </em>defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 178.  In sum, if the Court is to honor the particular conception of \xe2\x80\x9cdignity\xe2\x80\x9d that underlies the self-representation right, it should respect the autonomy of the individual by honoring his choices knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A further purpose that the Court finds is advanced by denial of the right of self-representation is the purpose of assuring that trials \xe2\x80\x9cappear fair to all who observe them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  To my knowledge we have never denied a defendant a right simply on the ground that it would make his trial appear less \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d to outside observers, and I would not inaugurate that principle here.  But were I to do so, I would not apply it to deny a defendant the right to represent himself when he knowingly and voluntarily waives counsel.  When Edwards stood to say that \xe2\x80\x9cI have a defense that I would like to represent or present to the Judge,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 523a, it seems to me the epitome of both actual and apparent unfairness for the judge to say, I have heard \xe2\x80\x9cyour desire to proceed by yourself and I\xe2\x80\x99ve denied your request, so your attorney will speak for you from now on,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 530a. </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may be that the Court permits a State to deprive mentally ill defendants of a historic component of a fair trial because it is suspicious of the constitutional footing of the right of self-representation itself.  The right is not explicitly set forth in the text of the Sixth Amendment, and some Members of this Court have expressed skepticism about <em>Faretta\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>holding.  See <em>Martinez, supra</em>, at 156\xe2\x80\x93158 (questioning relevance of historical evidence underlying <em>Faretta\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>holding); 528 U. S., at 164 (Breyer, J., concurring) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cjudges closer to the firing line have sometimes expressed dismay about the practical consequences\xe2\x80\x9d of the right of self-representation).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Sixth Amendment makes no mention of the right to forgo counsel, it provides the defendant, and not his lawyer, the right to call witnesses in his defense and to confront witnesses against him, and counsel is permitted to assist in \xe2\x80\x9c<em>his</em> defence\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  Our trial system, however, allows the attorney representing a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cfull authority to manage the conduct of the trial\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an authority without which \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he adversary process could not function effectively.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/400/index.html">484 U. S. 400</a>, 418 (1988); see also <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Nixon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/175/index.html">543 U. S. 175</a>, 187 (2004).  We have held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe client must accept the consequences of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to forgo cross-examination, to decide not to put certain witnesses on the stand, or to decide not to disclose the identity of certain witnesses in advance of trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 418.   Thus, in order for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to call his own witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, and to put on a defense to be anything more than \xe2\x80\x9ca tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant must have consented to the representation of counsel.  <em>Faretta, supra,</em> at 821.  Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cthe defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for in a very real sense, it is not <em>his</em> defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts of this case illustrate this point with the utmost clarity.  Edwards wished to take a self-defense case to the jury.  His counsel preferred a defense that focused on lack of intent.  Having been denied the right to conduct his own defense, Edwards was convicted without having had the opportunity to present to the jury the grounds he believed supported his innocence.  I do not doubt that he likely would have been convicted anyway.  But to hold that a defendant may be deprived of the right to make legal arguments for acquittal simply because a state-selected agent has made different arguments on his behalf is, as Justice Frankfurter wrote in <em>Adams, supra</em>, at 280, to \xe2\x80\x9cimprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  In singling out mentally ill defendants for this treatment, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not even have the questionable virtue of being politically correct.  At a time when all society is trying to mainstream the mentally impaired, the Court permits them to be deprived of a basic constitutional right\xe2\x80\x94for their own good.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding is extraordinarily vague.  The Court does not accept Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s position that self-representation can be denied \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.  It does not even hold that Edwards was properly denied his right to represent himself.  It holds only that lack of mental competence can under some circumstances form a basis for denying the right to proceed <em>pro se</em>, <em>ante, </em>at<em> </em>1.  We will presumably give some meaning to this holding in the future, but the indeterminacy makes a bad holding worse.  Once the right of self-representation for the mentally ill is a sometime thing, trial judges will have every incentive to make their lives easier\xe2\x80\x94to avoid the painful necessity of deciphering occasional pleadings of the sort contained in the Appendix to today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94by appointing knowledgeable and literate counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I think a defendant who is competent to stand trial, and who is capable of knowing and voluntary waiver of assistance of counsel, has a constitutional right to conduct his own defense, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
