Din\xe2\x80\x99s petition was approved, but Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application was ultimately denied.  A consular officer informed Berashk that he was inadmissible under \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B), which excludes aliens who have engaged in \xe2\x80\x9c[t]errorist activities,\xe2\x80\x9d but the officer provided no further information.  Unable to obtain a more detailed explanation for Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa denial, Din filed suit in Federal District Court, which dismissed her complaint.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Din had a protected liberty interest in her marriage that entitled her to review of the denial of Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa.  It further held that the Government deprived her of that liberty interest without due process when it denied Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application without providing a more detailed explanation of its reasons. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">718 F.\xc2\xa03d 856, vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas, concluded that the Government did not deprive Din of any constitutional right entitling her to due process of law.

Supporting this conclusion is the fact that, by Din\xe2\x80\x99s own admission, Berashk worked for the Taliban government.  These considerations lend to the conclusion that there was a bona fide factual basis for exclusion, absent an affirmative showing of bad faith on the consular officer\xe2\x80\x99s part, which Din has not plausibly alleged.

Naturally, one would expect him\xe2\x80\x94not Din\xe2\x80\x94to bring this suit.  But because Berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien, he has no right of entry into the United States, and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission.  See <i>Kleindienst</i> v. <i>Mandel</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753,\n762 (1972)\n.  So, Din attempts to bring suit on his behalf, alleging that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s denial of her <i>husband\xe2\x80\x99s</i> visa application violated <i>her</i> constitutional rights.  See App. 36\xe2\x80\x9337, Complaint \xc2\xb656.  In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse.  There is no such constitutional right.

Under this process, the citizen-relative first files a petition on behalf of the alien living abroad, asking to have the alien classified as an immediate relative.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(f), 1154(a)(1).  If and when a petition is approved, the alien may apply for a visa by submitting the required documents and appearing at a United States Embassy or consulate for an interview with a consular officer.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71201(a)(1), 1202.

Co.</i> v. <i>Haslip</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9336 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), it remains the case that <i>no</i> process is<i> </i>due if one is not deprived of \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Swarthout</i> v. <i>Cooke</i>, \n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 216,\n219 (2011)\n (<i>per curiam</i>).  The first question that we must ask, then, is whether the denial of Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application deprived Din of any of these interests.  Only if we answer in the affirmative must we proceed to consider whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s explanation afforded sufficient process.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Due Process Clause has its origin in Magna Carta.  As originally drafted, the Great Charter provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed; nor will we not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers, or <i>by the law of the land</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Magna Carta, ch. 29, in 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 45 (1797) (emphasis added).  The Court has recognized that at the time of the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification, the words \xe2\x80\x9cdue process of law\xe2\x80\x9d were understood \xe2\x80\x9cto convey the same meaning as the words \xe2\x80\x98by the law of the land\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in Magna Carta.  <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i> v. <i>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</i>, 18 How. 272, 276 (1856).  Although the terminology associated with the guarantee of due process changed dramatically between 1215 and 1791, the general scope of the underlying rights protected stayed roughly constant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Edward Coke, whose Institutes \xe2\x80\x9cwere read in the American Colonies by virtually every student of law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Klopfer</i> v. <i>North Carolina</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213,\n225 (1967)\n, thoroughly described the scope of the interests that could be deprived only pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Magna Carta, he wrote, ensured that, without due process, \xe2\x80\x9cno man [may] be taken or imprisoned\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cdisseised of his lands, or tenements, or dispossessed of his goods, or chattels\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cput from his livelihood without answer\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cbarred to have the benefit of the law\xe2\x80\x9d; denied \xe2\x80\x9cthe franchises, and priviledges, which the subjects have of the gift of the king\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cexiled\xe2\x80\x9d; or \xe2\x80\x9cfore-judged of life, or limbe, disherited, or put to torture, or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Coke, <i>supra,</i> at 46\xe2\x80\x9348.  Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s description of the rights protected by Magna Carta is similar, al-though he discusses them in terms much closer to the \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property\xe2\x80\x9d terminology used in the\n \nFifth Amendment.  He described first an interest in \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal security,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconsist[ing] in a person\xe2\x80\x99s legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health,and his reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 125 (1769).  Second, the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal liberty of individuals\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconsist[ed] in the power of loco-motion, of changing situation, or removing one\xe2\x80\x99s person to whatsoever place one\xe2\x80\x99s own inclination may direct; without imprisonment or restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 130.  And finally, a person\xe2\x80\x99s right to property included \xe2\x80\x9cthe free use, enjoyment, and disposal of all his acquisitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 134.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Din, of course, could not conceivably claim that the denial of Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application deprived her\xe2\x80\x94or for that matter even Berashk\xe2\x80\x94of life or property; and under the above described historical understanding, a claim that it deprived her of liberty is equally absurd.  The Government has not \xe2\x80\x9ctaken or imprisoned\xe2\x80\x9d Din, nor has it \xe2\x80\x9cconfine[d]\xe2\x80\x9d her, either by \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping [her] against h[er] will in a private house, putting h[er] in the stocks, arresting or forcibly detaining h[er] in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 132.  Indeed, not even Berashk has suffered a deprivation of liberty so understood.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Despite this historical evidence, this Court has seen fit on several occasions to expand the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d under the Due Process Clause to include certain implied \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  (The reasoning presumably goes like this: If you have a right to do something, you are free to do it, and deprivation of freedom is a deprivation of \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94never mind the original meaning of that word in the Due Process Clause.)  These implied rights have been given <i>more</i> protection than \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property\xe2\x80\x9d properly understood.  While one may be dispossessed of property, thrown in jail, or even executed so long as proper procedures are followed, the enjoyment of implied constitutional rights cannot be limited at all, except by provisions that are \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Flores</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 292\n\xe2\x80\x93302 (1993).  Din does not explicitly argue that the Government has violated this absolute prohibition of the <i>substantive</i> component of the Due Process Clause, likely because it is obvious that a law barring aliens engaged in terrorist activities from entering this country <i>is</i> narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.  She nevertheless insists that, because enforcement of the law affects her enjoyment of an implied fundamental liberty, the Govern-ment must first provide her a full battery of procedural-due-process protections.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I think it worth explaining why, <i>even if</i> one accepts the textually unsupportable doctrine of implied fundamental rights, Din\xe2\x80\x99s arguments would fail.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cextending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. place[s] the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 702,\n720 (1997)\n, and because the \xe2\x80\x9cguideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Collins</i> v. <i>Harker Heights,</i>\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115,\n125 (1992)\n, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>  Accordingly, before conferring constitutional status upon a previously unrecognized \xe2\x80\x9cliberty,\xe2\x80\x9d we have required \xe2\x80\x9ca careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as a demonstration that the interest is \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it was] sacrificed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Glucksberg,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 720\xe2\x80\x93721 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Din describes the denial of Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application as implicating, alternately, a \xe2\x80\x9cliberty interest in her marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 28, a \xe2\x80\x9cright of association with one\xe2\x80\x99s spouse,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 18, \xe2\x80\x9ca liberty interest in being reunited with certain blood relatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 22, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe liberty interest of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen under the Due Process Clause to be free from arbitrary restrictions on his right to live with his spouse,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>  To be sure, this Court has at times indulged a propensity for grandiloquence when reviewing the sweep of implied rights, describing them so broadly that they would include not only the interests Din asserts but many others as well.  For example: \xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt, [the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause] denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in anyof the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, [and] to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i>\n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 390,\n399 (1923)\n.  But this Court is not bound by dicta, especially dicta that have been repudiated by the holdings of our subsequent cases.  And the actual holdings of the cases Din relies upon hardly establish the capacious right she now asserts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the States in <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1967)\n, <i>Zablocki</i> v. <i>Redhail</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374 (1978)\n, and <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 78 (1987)\n, the Federal Government here has not attempted to forbid a marriage.  Al-though Din and the dissent borrow language from those cases invoking a fundamental right to marriage, they both implicitly concede that no such right has been infringed in this case.  Din relies on the \xe2\x80\x9cassociational interests in marriage that necessarily are protected by the right to marry,\xe2\x80\x9d and that are \xe2\x80\x9cpresuppose[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by later cases establishing a right to marital privacy.  Brief for Respondent 16, 18.  The dissent supplements the fundamental right to marriage with a fundamental right to live in the United States in order to find an affected liberty interest.  <i>Post</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Attempting to abstract from these cases some liberty interest that might be implicated by Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa denial, Din draws on even more inapposite cases.  <i>Meyer</i>, for example, invalidated a state statute proscribing the teaching of foreign language to children who had not yet passed the eighth grade, reasoning that it violated the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children.\xe2\x80\x9d  262 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 400.  <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters, </i>\n\n268 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510\n\xe2\x80\x93535 (1925), extended <i>Meyer</i>, finding that a law requiring children to attend public schools \xe2\x80\x9cinterferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Moore</i> v. <i>East Cleveland, </i>\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 494\n\xe2\x80\x93506 (1977), extended this interest in raising children to caretakers in a child\xe2\x80\x99s extended family, striking down an ordinance that limited occupancy of a single-family house to members of a nuclear family on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ecisions concerning child rearing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. long have been shared with grandparents or other relatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  And <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i>,\n\n381 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479,\n485 (1965)\n, concluded that a law criminalizing the use of contraceptives by married couples violated \xe2\x80\x9cpenumbral rights of \xe2\x80\x98privacy and repose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d protecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe sacred precincts of the marital bedroom\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rights which do not plausibly extend into the offices of our consulates abroad.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in the cases Din cites establishes a free-floating and categorical liberty interest in marriage (or any other formulation Din offers) sufficient to trigger constitutional protection whenever a regulation in any way touches upon an aspect of the marital relationship.  Even if our cases could be construed so broadly, the relevant question is not whether the asserted interest \xe2\x80\x9cis consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive-due-process line of cases,\xe2\x80\x9d but whether it is supported by \xe2\x80\x9cthis Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Glucksberg</i>, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 723\xe2\x80\x93724 (emphasis deleted).  Even if we might \xe2\x80\x9cimply\xe2\x80\x9d a liberty interest in marriage generally speaking, that must give way when there is a tradition denying the specific<i> </i>application of that general interest.  Thus, <i>Glucksberg</i> rejected a claimed liberty interest in \xe2\x80\x9cself-sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal autonomy\xe2\x80\x9d that extended to assisted suicide when there was a longstanding tradition of outlawing the practice of suicide.  <i>Id.</i>, at 724, 727\xe2\x80\x93728 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, a long practice of regulating spousal immigration precludes Din\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the denial of Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application has deprived her of a fundamental liberty interest.  Although immigration was effectively unregu-lated prior to 1875, as soon as Congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of regulations that erected serious impediments to a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring a spouse into the United States.  See Abrams, What Makes the Family Special? 80 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 7, 10\xe2\x80\x9316 (2013).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Most strikingly, perhaps, the Expatriation Act of 1907 provided that \xe2\x80\x9cany American woman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ch. 2534,\n\n34Stat.\n1228.  Thus, a woman in Din\xe2\x80\x99s position not only lacked a liberty interest that might be affected by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s visa application, she lost her <i>own</i> rights as a citizen upon marriage.  When Congress began to impose quotas on immigration by country of origin less than 15 years later, with the Immigration Act of 1921, it omitted fianc\xc3\xa9s and husbands from the family relations eligible for preferred status in the allocation of quota spots.  \xc2\xa72(d),\n\n42Stat.\n6.  Such relations were similarly excluded from the relations eligible for nonquota status, when that status was expanded three years later.  Immigration Act of 1924, \xc2\xa74(a),\n\n43Stat.\n155.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, these early regulations were premised on the derivative citizenship of women, a legacy of the law of coverture that was already in decline at the time.  C. Bredbenner, A Nationality of Her Own 5 (1998).  Modern equal-protection doctrine casts substantial doubt on the permissibility of such asymmetric treatment of women citizens in the immigration context, and modern moral judgment rejects the premises of such a legal order.  Never-theless, this all-too-recent practice repudiates any con-tention that Din\xe2\x80\x99s asserted liberty interest is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Glucksberg</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 720 (citations and internal quotations marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, the law showed little more solicitude for the marital relationship when it was a male resident or citizen seeking admission for his fianc\xc3\xa9e or wife.  The Immigration Act of 1921 granted nonquota status only to unmarried, minor children of citizens, \xc2\xa72(a), while granting fianc\xc3\xa9es and wives preferred status <i>within</i> the allocation of quota spots, \xc2\xa72(d).  In other words, a citizen could move his spouse forward in the line, but once all the quota spots were filled for the year, the spouse was barred without exception.  This was not just a theoretical possibility: As one commentator has observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or many immigrants, the family categories did little to help, because the quotas were so small that the number of family members seeking slots far outstripped the number available.\xe2\x80\x9d  Abrams, <i>supra,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although Congress has tended to show \xe2\x80\x9ca continuing and kindly concern .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the unity and the happiness of the immigrant family,\xe2\x80\x9d E. Hutchinson, Legislative History of American Immigration Policy 1798\xe2\x80\x931965, p. 518 (1981), this has been a matter of legislative grace rather than fundamental right.  Even where Congress has provided special privileges to promote family immigration, it has also \xe2\x80\x9cwritten in careful checks and qualifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  This Court has consistently recognized that these various distinctions are \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our Government, and we have no judicial authority to substitute our political judgment for that of the Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fiallo</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787,\n798 (1977)\n.  Only by diluting the meaning of a fundamental liberty interest and jettisoning our established jurisprudence could we conclude that the denial of Berashk\xe2\x80\x99s visa application implicates any of Din\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental liberty interests.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Justice Breyer suggests that procedural due process rights attach to liberty interests that either are (1) created by nonconstitutional law, such as a statute, or (2) \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d so as to \xe2\x80\x9cflow \xe2\x80\x98implicit[ly]\xe2\x80\x99 from the design, object, and nature of the Due Process Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 2.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first point is unobjectionable, at least given this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law.  See, <i>e.g., Goldberg</i> v. <i>Kelly</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254\n, and  n.\xc2\xa08 (1970); <i>Collins</i> 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 129.  But it is unhelpful to Din, who does not argue that a statute confers on her a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  Justice Breyer attempts to make this argument for Din, latching onto language in <i>Wilkinson</i> v. <i>Austin</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209,\n221 (2005)\n, saying that a liberty interest \xe2\x80\x9cmay arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such an \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation\xe2\x80\x9d has been created here, he asserts, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. surrounds marriage with a host of legal protections to the point that it creates a strong expectation that government will not deprive married individuals of their freedom to live together without strong reasons and (in individual cases) without fair procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post,</i> at 3.  But what <i>Wilkinson </i>meant by an \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation or interest\xe2\x80\x9d was not that sort of judicially unenforceable substantial hope, but a present and legally recognized substantive entitlement.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*  As sole support for its conclusion that nonconstitutional law can create constitutionally protected liberty interests, <i>Wilkinson</i> cited <i>Wolff</i> v. <i>McDonnell</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 539\n\xe2\x80\x93558 (1974), which held that a prisoner could not be deprived of statutory good-time credit without procedural due process.  That was not because a prisoner might have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a strong expectation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the government would not deprive him of good-time credit \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98without strong reasons\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fair procedure,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but because \xe2\x80\x9cthe State itself has not only provided a statutory <i>right</i> to good time [credit] but also specifies that it is to be forfeited <i>only</i> for serious misbehavior,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 557 (emphasis added).  The legal benefits afforded to marriages and the preferential treatment accorded to visa applicants with citizen relatives are insufficient to confer on Din a right that can be deprived only pursuant to procedural due process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s second point\xe2\x80\x94that procedural due process rights attach even to some nonfundamental liberty interests that have <i>not</i> been created by statute\xe2\x80\x94is much more troubling.  He relies on the implied-fundamental-rights cases discussed above to divine a \xe2\x80\x9cright of spouses to live together and to raise a family,\xe2\x80\x9d along with \xe2\x80\x9ca citizen\xe2\x80\x99s right to live within this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But perhaps recognizing that our established methodology for identifying fundamental rights cuts against his conclusion, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <i>supra</i>, he argues that the term \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d in the Due Process Clause includes implied rights that, although not so fundamental as to deserve substantive-due-process protection, are important enough to deserve procedural-due-process protection.  <i>Post</i>, at 2.  In other words, there are two categories of implied rights protected by the Due Process Clause: really fundamental rights, which cannot be taken away at all absent a compelling state interest; and not-so-fundamental rights, whichcan be taken away so long as procedural due process is observed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent fails to cite a single case supporting its novel theory of implied nonfundamental rights.  It is certainly true that <i>Vitek</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480 (1980)\n, and <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Harper</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 210 (1990)\n, do not entail implied <i>fundamental</i> rights, but this is because they do not entail <i>implied</i> rights at all.  <i>Vitek</i> concerned the involuntary commitment of a prisoner, deprivation of the expressly protected right of liberty under the original understanding of the term, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Among the historic liberties\xe2\x80\x99 protected by the Due Process Clause is the \xe2\x80\x98right to be free from, and to obtain judicial relief for, unjustified intrusions on personal security.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Vitek</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 492.  The same is true of <i>Harper</i>, which concerned forced administration of psychotropic drugs to an inmate.  494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 214.  Arguably, <i>Paul</i> v. <i>Davis</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 693 (1976)\n, also addressed an interest expressly contemplated within the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 125 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe right of personal security consists in a person\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reputation\xe2\x80\x9d).  But that case is of no help to the dissent anyway, since it found no liberty interest entitled to the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  <i>Paul</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 713\xe2\x80\x93714.  Finally, the dissent points to <i>Goss</i> v. <i>Lopez</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 565,\n574 (1975)\n, a case that \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[d] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a property interest\xe2\x80\x9d a student\xe2\x80\x99s right to a public education conferred by Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s express statutory creation of a public school system; and further concluded that the student\xe2\x80\x99s 10-day suspension implicated the constitutionally grounded liberty interest in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a person\xe2\x80\x99s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, the dissent identifies no case holding that there is an implied nonfundamental right protected by procedural due process, and only one case even <i>suggesting</i> that there is.  That suggestion, in <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Organization of Foster Families For Equality &amp; Reform</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 816 (1977)\n, is contained in dictum in a footnote, <i>id.</i>, at 842, n.\xc2\xa048.  The holding of the case was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedures provided by New York State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and by New York Cit[y] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are adequate to protect <i>whatever</i> liberty interests appellees <i>may</i> have.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 856 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The footnoted dictum that Justice Breyer proposes to elevate to constitutional law is a dangerous doctrine.  It vastly expands the scope of our implied-rights jurisprudence by setting it free from the requirement that the liberty interest be \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 720\xe2\x80\x93721 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even shallow-rooted liberties would, thanks to this new procedural-rights-only notion of quasi-fundamental rights, qualify for judicially imposed procedural requirements.  Moreover, Justice Breyer gives no basis for distinguishing the fundamental rights recognized in the cases he depends on from the <i>nonfundamental</i> right he believes they give rise to in the present case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither Din\xe2\x80\x99s right to live with her spouse nor her right to live within this country is implicated here.  There is a \xe2\x80\x9csimple distinction between government action that di-rectly affects a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s legal rights, or imposes a direct re-straint on his liberty, and action that is directed against a third party and affects the citizen only indirectly or incidentally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Bannon</i> v. <i>Town Court Nursing Center</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 773,\n788 (1980)\n.  The Government has not refused to recognize Din\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Berashk, and Din remains free to live with her husband anywhere in the world that both individuals are permitted to reside.  And the Government has not expelled Din from the country.  It has simply determined that Kanishka Berashk engaged in terrorist activities within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and has therefore denied him admission into the country.  This might, indeed, deprive Din of something \xe2\x80\x9cimportant,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>,<i> </i>at 2, but if that is the criterion for Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s new pairing of substantive and procedural due process, we are in for quite a ride.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because Fauzia Din was not deprived of \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property\xe2\x80\x9d when the Government denied Kanishka Berashk admission to the United States, there is no process due to her under the Constitution.  To the extent that she received any explanation for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision, this was more than the Due Process Clause required.

See <i>ibid.  </i>The Court emphasized it did not address \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat\n \nFirst Amendment or other grounds may be available for attacking an exercise of discretion for which no justification whatsoever is advanced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The reasoning and the holding in <i>Mandel</i> control here.  That decision was based upon due consideration of the congressional power to make rules for the exclusion of aliens, and the ensuing power to delegate authority to the Attorney General to exercise substantial discretion in that field.  <i>Mandel </i>held that an executive officer\xe2\x80\x99s decision denying a visa that burdens a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s own constitutional rights is valid when it is made \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 770.  Once this standard is met, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against\xe2\x80\x9d the constitutional interests of citizens the visa denial might implicate.  <i>Ibid.  </i>This reasoning has particular force in the area of national security, for which Congress has provided specific statutory directions pertaining to visa applications by noncitizens who seek entry to this country.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Like the professors who sought an audience with Dr. Mandel, Din claims her constitutional rights were burdened by the denial of a visa to a noncitizen, namely her husband.  And as in <i>Mandel</i>, the Government provided a reason for the visa denial: It concluded Din\xe2\x80\x99s husband was inadmissible under \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s terrorism bar.  Even assuming Din\xe2\x80\x99s rights were burdened directly by the visa denial, the remaining question is whether the reasons given by the Government satisfy <i>Mandel</i>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfacially legitimate and bona fide\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  I conclude that they do.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the consular officer\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Din\xe2\x80\x99s husband was ineligible for a visa was controlled by specific statutory factors.  The provisions of \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B) establish specific criteria for determining terrorism-related inadmissibility.  The consular officer\xe2\x80\x99s citation of that provision suffices to show that the denial rested on a determination that Din\xe2\x80\x99s husband did not satisfy the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 plenary power to \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[y] the conditions of the privilege of entry into the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States ex rel. Knauff</i> v. <i>Shaughnessy</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 537,\n543 (1950)\n, it follows that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to exclude an alien it determines does not satisfy one or more of those conditions is facially legitimate under <i>Mandel</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s citation of \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B) also indicates it relied upon a bona fide factual basis for denying a visa to Berashk.  Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Chemical Foundation, Inc.</i>,\n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9315 (1926).  Din claims due process requires she be provided with the facts underlying this determination, arguing <i>Mandel </i>required a similar factual basis.  It is true the Attorney General there disclosed the facts motivating his decision to deny Dr. Mandel a waiver, and that the Court cited those facts as demonstrating \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General validly exercised the plenary power that Congress delegated to the Executive.\xe2\x80\x9d  408 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 769.  But unlike the waiver provision at issue in <i>Mandel</i>, which granted the Attorney General nearly unbridled discretion, \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B) specifies discrete factual predicates the consular officer must find to exist before denying a visa.  Din, moreover, admits in her Complaint that Berashk worked for the Taliban government, App. 27\xe2\x80\x9328, which, even if itself insufficient to support exclusion, provides at least a facial connection to terrorist activity.  Absent an affirmative showing of bad faith on the part of the consular officer who denied Berashk a visa\xe2\x80\x94which Din has not plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity\xe2\x80\x94<i>Mandel </i>instructs us not to \xe2\x80\x9clook behind\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of Berashk for additional factual details beyond what its express reliance on \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B) encompassed.  See 408 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 770.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government, furthermore, was not required, as Din claims, to point to a more specific provision within \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B).  To be sure, the statutory provision the consular officer cited covers a broad range of conduct.  And Din perhaps more easily could mount a challenge to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s visa denial if she knew the specific subsection on which the consular officer relied.  Congress understood this problem, however.  The statute generally requires the Government to provide an alien denied a visa with the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific provision or provisions of law under which the alien is inadmissible,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71182(b)(1); but this notice requirement does not apply when, as in this case, a visa application is denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.  \xc2\xa71182(b)(3).  Notably, the Government is not prohibited from offering more details when it sees fit, but the statute expressly refrains from requiring it to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress evaluated the benefits and burdens of notice in this sensitive area and assigned discretion to the Executive to decide when more detailed disclosure is appropriate.  This considered judgment gives additional support to the independent conclusion that the notice given was constitutionally adequate, particularly in light of the national security concerns the terrorism bar addresses.  See <i>Fiallo</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787\n\xe2\x80\x93796 (1977); see also <i>INS</i> v. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415,\n425 (1999)\n.  And even if Din is correct that sensitive facts could be reviewed by courts <i>in camera</i>, the dangers and difficulties of handling such delicate security material further counsel against requiring disclosure in a case such as this.  Under <i>Mandel</i>, respect for the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 broad power over the creation and administration of the immigration system extends to determinations of how much information the Government is obliged to disclose about a consular officer\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a visa to an alien abroad.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, my conclusion is that the Government satisfied any obligation it might have had to provide Din with a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for its action when it provided notice that her husband was denied admission to the country under \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B).  By requiring the Government to provide more, the Court of Appeals erred in adjudicating Din\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3420631">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 13\xe2\x80\x931402</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">JOHN F.

And the Government has failed to provide her with the procedure that is constitutionally \xe2\x80\x9cdue.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Swarthout</i> v. <i>Cooke</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 216,\n219 (2011)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (setting forth the Court\xe2\x80\x99s two-step inquiry for procedural due process claims).  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The plurality opinion (which is not controlling) concludes that Ms. Din lacks the kind of liberty interest to which the Due Process Clause provides procedural protections.  <i>Ante, </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x9315.

I agree with Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s assumption.  More than that, I believe that Ms. Din possesses that kind of constitutional interest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The liberty interest that Ms. Din seeks to protect consists of her freedom to live together with her husband in the United States.  She seeks <i>procedural, </i>not <i>substantive, </i>protection for this freedom.  Compare <i>Wilkinson</i> v. <i>Austin</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209,\n221 (2005)\n (Due Process Clause requires compliance with fair <i>procedures</i> when the government deprives an individual of certain \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d interests), with <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Flores</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 292,\n302 (1993)\n (Due Process Clause limits the extent to which government can <i>substantively</i> regulate certain \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d rights, \xe2\x80\x9cno matter what process is provided\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Organization of Foster Families For Equality &amp; Reform</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 816,\n842, n.\n48 (1977)\n (liberty interests arising under the Constitution for procedural due process pur-poses are not the same as fundamental rights requiring substantive due process protection).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our cases make clear that the Due Process Clause entitles her to such procedural rights as long as (1) she seeks protection for a liberty interest sufficiently important for procedural protection to flow \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d from the design, object, and nature of the Due Process Clause, or (2) nonconstitutional law (a statute, for example) creates \xe2\x80\x9can expectation\xe2\x80\x9d that a person will not be deprived of that kind of liberty without fair procedures.  <i>Wilkinson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 221.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The liberty for which Ms. Din seeks protection easily satisfies both standards.  As this Court has long recognized, the institution of marriage, which encompasses the right of spouses to live together and to raise a family, is central to human life, requires and enjoys community support, and plays a central role in most individuals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9corderly pursuit of happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska</i>,\n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 390,\n399 (1923)\n.

Similarly, the Court has long recognized that a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s right to live within this country, being fundamental, enjoys basic procedural due process protection.  See <i>Ng Fung Ho</i> v. <i>White</i>,\n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276\n\xe2\x80\x93285 (1922); <i>Baumgartner</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n322 U.\xc2\xa0S. 665,\n670 (1944)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, the law, including visa law, surrounds marriage with a host of legal protections to the point that it creates a strong expectation that government will not deprive married individuals of their freedom to live together without strong reasons and (in individual cases) without fair procedure.<b> </b> Cf. <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 78\n\xe2\x80\x9396 (1987) (noting various legal benefits of marriage);\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71151(b)(2)(A)(i) (special visa preference for spouse of an American citizen).  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s response\xe2\x80\x94that nonconstitutional law creates an \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation\xe2\x80\x9d that merits procedural protection under the Due Process Clause only if there is an unequivocal statutory right, <i>ante,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312\xe2\x80\x94is sorely mistaken.  His argument rests on the rights/privilege distinction that this Court rejected almost five decades ago, in the seminal case of <i>Goldberg</i> v. <i>Kelly</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254,\n262 (1970)\n.  See generally <i>Board of Regents of State Colleges</i> v. <i>Roth</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564,\n571 (1972)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court has fully and finally rejected the wooden distinction between \xe2\x80\x98rights\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98privileges\xe2\x80\x99 that once seemed to govern the applicability of procedural due process rights\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 572 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99 must be broad indeed\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s more general response\xe2\x80\x94claiming that I have created a new category of constitutional rights, <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x94misses the mark.  I break no new ground here.  Rather, this Court has <i>already</i> recognized that the Due Process Clause guarantees that the government will not, without fair procedure, deprive individuals of a host of rights, freedoms, and liberties that are no more important, and for which the state has created no greater expectation of continued benefit, than the liberty interest at issue here.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Wolff</i> v. <i>McDonnell</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 539\n\xe2\x80\x93557 (1974) (prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s right to maintain \xe2\x80\x9cgoodtime\xe2\x80\x9d credits shortening term of imprisonment; procedurally protected liberty interest based on nonconstitutional law); <i>Paul</i> v. <i>Davis</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 693,\n701 (1976)\n (right to certain aspects of reputation; procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the Constitution); <i>Goss</i> v. <i>Lopez</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 565\n\xe2\x80\x93575 (1975) (student\xe2\x80\x99s right not to be suspended from school class; procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the Constitution); <i>Vitek</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480\n\xe2\x80\x93495 (1980) (prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s right against involuntary commitment; procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the Constitution); <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Harper</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 210\n\xe2\x80\x93222 (1990) (mentally ill prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s right not to take psychotropic drugs; procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the Constitution); see generally <i>Goldberg</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 262\xe2\x80\x93263 (right to welfare benefits; procedurally protected property interest based on nonconstitutional law).  But cf. <i>ante, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9314 (plurality opinion) (making what I believe are unsuccessful efforts to distinguish these cases).  How could a Constitution that protects individuals against the arbitrary deprivation of so diverse a set of interests not also offer some form of procedural protection to a citizen threatened with governmental deprivation of her freedom to live together with her spouse in America?  As compared to reputational harm, for example, how is Ms. Din\xe2\x80\x99s liberty interest any less worthy of due process protections?</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The more difficult question is the nature of the procedural protection required by the Constitution.  After all, sometimes, as with the military draft, the law separates spouses with little individualized procedure.  And sometimes, as with criminal convictions, the law provides procedure to one spouse but not to the other.  Unlike criminal convictions, however, neither spouse here has received any procedural protection.  Cf. <i>Ingraham</i> v. <i>Wright</i>,\n\n430 U. S. 651 (1977)\n (availability of alternative procedures can satisfy due process).  Compare <i>Shaughnessy</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Mezei</i>,\n\n345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 206\n,213 (1953) (no due process protections for aliens outside United States), with <i>Zadvydas</i> v. <i>Davis</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678,\n693 (2001)\n (such protections are available for aliens inside United States).  And, unlike the draft (justified by a classic military threat), the deprivation does not apply similarly to hundreds of thousands of American families.  Cf. <i>Bi-Metallic Investment Co.</i> v. <i>State Bd. of Equalization of Colo.</i>,\n\n239 U.\xc2\xa0S. 441,\n445 (1915)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather, here, the Government makes individualized visa determinations through the application of a legal rule to particular facts.  Individualized adjudication normally calls for the ordinary application of Due Process Clause procedures.  <i>Londoner</i> v. <i>City and County of Denver</i>,\n\n210 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373\n\xe2\x80\x93386 (1908).  And those procedures normally include notice of an adverse action, an opportunity to present relevant proofs and arguments, before a neutral decisionmaker, and reasoned decisionmaking.  See <i>Hamdi</i> v. <i>Rumsfeld</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507,\n533 (2004)\n (plurality opinion); see also Friendly, Some Kind of a Hearing, 123 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1267, 1278\xe2\x80\x931281 (1975).  These procedural protections help to guarantee that government will not make a decision directly affecting an individual arbitrarily but will do so through the reasoned application of a rule of law.  It is that rule of law, stretching back at least 800 years to Magna Carta, which in major part the Due Process Clause seeks to protect.  <i>Hurtado</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n110 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516,\n527 (1884)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, we need not consider all possible procedural due process elements.  Rather we consider only the minimum procedure that Ms. Din has requested\xe2\x80\x94namely, a statement of reasons, some kind of explanation, as to why the State Department denied her husband a visa.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have often held that this kind of statement, permitting an individual to understand <i>why </i>the government acted as it did, is a fundamental element of due process.  See, <i>e.g., Goldberg</i>, 397 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267\xe2\x80\x93268; <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Sindermann</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 593,\n603 (1972)\n; <i>Morrissey</i> v. <i>Brewer</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471,\n485,\n489 (1972)\n; <i>Wolff</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 563\xe2\x80\x93564; <i>Goss</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 581; <i>Mathews</i> v. <i>Eldridge</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 319\n\xe2\x80\x93346 (1976); <i>Cleveland Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Loudermill</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 532,\n546 (1985)\n; <i>Wilkinson</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 224; <i>Hamdi</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 533 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is so in part because a statement of reasons, even one provided after a visa denial, serves much the same function as a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d of a proposed action.  It allows Ms. Din, who suffered a \xe2\x80\x9cserious loss,\xe2\x80\x9d a fair \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to meet\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe case\xe2\x80\x9d that has produced separation from her husband. See <i>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm.</i> v. <i>McGrath</i>,\n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123\n\xe2\x80\x93172 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also <i>Hamdi</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 533 (plurality opinion); <i>Wolff</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 563; Friendly, <i>supra</i>, at 1280 (\xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d must provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe grounds for\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant action).  Properly apprised of the grounds for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s action, Ms. Din can then take appropriate action\xe2\x80\x94whether this amounts to an appeal, internal agency review, or (as is likely here) an opportunity to submit additional evidence and obtain reconsideration, 22 CFR 42.81(e) (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I recognize that our due process cases often determine the constitutional insistence upon a particular procedure by balancing, with respect to that procedure, the \xe2\x80\x9cprivate interest\xe2\x80\x9d at stake, \xe2\x80\x9cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation\xe2\x80\x9d absent the sought-after protection, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in not providing additional procedure.  <i>Eldridge</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 335; but cf. <i>Hamdi</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 533 (plurality opinion) (suggesting minimal due process requirements cannot be balanced away).  Here \xe2\x80\x9cbalancing\xe2\x80\x9d would not change the result.  The \xe2\x80\x9cprivate interest\xe2\x80\x9d is important, the risk of an \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous deprivation\xe2\x80\x9d is significant, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in not providing a reason is nor-mally small, at least administratively speaking.  Indeed, Congress requires the State Department to provide a reason for a visa denial in most contexts.\xc2\xa0\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(b)(1).  Accordingly, in the absence of some highly unusual circumstance (not shown to be present here, see <i>infra</i>,<i> </i>at 9), the Constitution requires the Government to provide an adequate reason why it refused to grant Ms. Din\xe2\x80\x99s husband a visa.  That reason, in my view, could be either the factual basis for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision or a sufficiently specific statutory subsection that conveys effectively the same information.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Justice Kennedy, without denying that Ms. Din was entitled to a reason, believes that she received an adequate reason here.

I do not see how either statement could count as adequate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For one thing, the statutory provision to which it refers, \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B), sets forth, not one reason, but dozens.  It is a complex provision with 10 different subsections, many of which cross-reference other provisions of law.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>.  Some parts cover criminal conduct that is particularly serious, such as hijacking aircraft and assassination.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I), (IV).  Other parts cover activity that, depending on the factual circumstances, cannot easily be labeled \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist.\xe2\x80\x9d  One set of cross-referenced subsections, for example, brings within the section\xe2\x80\x99s visa prohibition any individual who has \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer[red] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [any] material financial benefit\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has a subgroup which engages\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cafford[ing] material support .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any individual who .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. plans\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of any .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. weapon .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with intent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to cause substantial damage to property.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI), (vi)(III), (iv)(VI)(bb), (iii)(V).  At the same time, some subsections provide the visa applicant with a defense; others do not.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI)(dd) (permitting applicant to show \xe2\x80\x9cby clear and convincing evidence that the actor did not know, and should not reasonably have known, that the organization was a terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x9d).  Taken together the subsections, directly or through cross-reference, cover a vast waterfront of human activity potentially benefitting, sometimes in major ways, sometimes hardly at all, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly, sometimes a few people, sometimes many, sometimes those with strong links, sometimes those with hardly a link, to a loosely or strongly connected group of individuals, which, through many different kinds of actions, might fall within the broad statutorily defined term \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., Daneshvar</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d 615, 628 (CA6 2004) (alleging material support for selling newspapers); <i>Singh</i> v. <i>Wiles</i>, 747 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1223, 1227 (WD Wash. 2010) (alleging material support for letting individuals sleep on a temple floor).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another thing, the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s reason did not set forth any factual basis for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Cf., <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Wilkinson</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 225\xe2\x80\x93226 (prison administrators must inform prisoners of \xe2\x80\x9cfactual basis\xe2\x80\x9d for extreme solitary confinement).  Perhaps the Department denied the visa because Ms. Din\xe2\x80\x99s husband at one point was a payroll clerk for the Afghan Government when that government was controlled by the Taliban.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  But there is no way to know if that is so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The generality of the statutory provision cited and the lack of factual support mean that here, the reason given is analogous to telling a criminal defendant only that he is accused of \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking the law\xe2\x80\x9d; telling a property owner only that he cannot build because environmental rules forbid it; or telling a driver only that police pulled him over because he violated traffic laws.  As such, the reason given cannot serve its procedural purpose.  It does not permit Ms. Din to assess the correctness of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion; it does not permit her to determine what kinds of facts she might provide in response; and it does not permit her to learn whether, or what kind of, defenses might be available.  In short, any \xe2\x80\x9creason\xe2\x80\x9d that Ms. Din received is not constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Seemingly aware that he cannot deny these basic legal principles, Justice Kennedy rests his conclusions upon two considerations that, in his view, provide sufficient grounds for an exception.  <i>Ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Most importantly, he says that ordinary rules of due process must give way here to national security concerns.  But just what are those concerns?  And how do they apply here?  Ms. Din\xe2\x80\x99s counsel stated at oral argument that there were no such concerns in this case.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.  And the Solicitor General did not deny that statement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> In other cases, such concerns may exist.  But, when faced with the need to provide public information without compromising security interests, the Government has found ways to do so, for example, by excising sensitive portions of documents requested by the press, members of the public, or other public officials.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(1).  Moreover, agencies and courts have found ways to conduct proceedings in private, through internal review or <i>in camera </i>proceedings, and thereby protect sensitive information.  See <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592,\n604 (1988)\n; Brief for Respondent 48\xe2\x80\x9352, and n.\xc2\xa020; Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 23\xe2\x80\x9328.  Would these (or other) methods prove adequate in other cases where a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to live in America with her spouse is at issue?  Are they even necessary here?  The Government has not explained.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I do not deny the importance of national security, the need to keep certain related information private, or the need to respect the determinations of the other branches of Government in such matters.  But protecting ordinary citizens from arbitrary government action is fundamental.  Thus, the presence of security considerations does not suspend the Constitution.  <i>Hamdi</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 527\xe2\x80\x93537 (plurality opinion).  Rather, it requires us to take security needs into account when determining, for example, what \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cdue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Yet how can we take proper account of security considerations without knowing what they are, without knowing how and why they require modification of traditional due process requirements, and without knowing whether other, less restrictive alternatives are available?  How exactly would it harm important security interests to give Ms. Din a better explanation?  Is there no way to give Ms. Din such an explanation while also maintaining appropriate secrecy?  I believe we need answers to these questions before we can accept as constitutional a major departure from the procedural requirements that the Due Process Clause ordinarily demands.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Kennedy also looks for support to the fact that Congress specifically exempted the section here at issue, \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B), from the statutory provision requiring the State Department to provide a reason for visa denials.  \xc2\xa71182(b)(3).  An exception from a statutory demand for a reason, however, is not a command to do the opposite; rather, at most, it leaves open the question whether other law requires a reason.  Here that other law is the Constitution, not a statute.  In my view, the Due Process Clause requires the Department to provide an adequate reason.  And, I believe it has failed to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">APPENDIX</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">Title 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa01182(a)(3) provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"><b>\xe2\x80\x9c<b>(B) Terrorist activities</b></b></p><b>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c<b>(i) In general</b></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cAny alien who\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(I) has engaged in a terrorist activity;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(II) a consular officer, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, is engaged in or is likely to engage after entry in any terrorist activity (as defined in clause (iv));</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(III) has, under circumstances indicating an intention to cause death or serious bodily harm, incited terrorist activity;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(IV) is a representative (as defined in clause (v)) of\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(aa) a terrorist organization (as defined in clause (vi)); or</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(bb) a political, social, or other group that endorses or espouses terrorist activity;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(V) is a member of a terrorist organization described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vi);</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(VI) is a member of a terrorist organization described in clause (vi)(III), unless the alien can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alien did not know, and should not reasonably have known, that the organization was a terrorist organization;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(VII) endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(VIII) has received military-type training (as defined in section 2339D(c)(1) of title 18) from or on behalf of any organization that, at the time the training was received, was a terrorist organization (as defined in clause (vi)); or</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(IX) is the spouse or child of an alien who is inadmissible under this subparagraph, if the activity causing the alien to be found inadmissible occurred within the last 5 years,</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cis inadmissible.
