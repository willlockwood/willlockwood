(Prometheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases.  When ingested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the bloodstream.  Because patients metabolize these drugs differently, doctors have found it difficult to determine whether a particular patient\xe2\x80\x99s dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective.  The patent claims here set forth processes embodying researchers\xe2\x80\x99 findings that identify correlations between metabolite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision.

But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and market its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test.  Prometheus sued Mayo contending that Mayo\xe2\x80\x99s test infringed its patents.  The District Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary judgment to Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomena\xe2\x80\x94namely, the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity and efficacy of thiopurine drugs\xe2\x80\x94and therefore are not patentable.  The Federal Circuit reversed, finding the processes to be patent eligible under the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmachine or transformation test.\xe2\x80\x9d  On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of Bilski v.

The three additional steps in the claimed processes here are not themselves natural laws but neither are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claims.  The \xe2\x80\x9cadministering\xe2\x80\x9d step simply identifies a group of people who will be interested in the correlations, namely, doctors who used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders.  Doctors had been using these drugs for this purpose long before these patents existed.  And a \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition against patenting abstract ideas \xe2\x80\x98cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bilski, supra, at ___.  The \xe2\x80\x9cwherein\xe2\x80\x9d clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test results when making their treatment decisions.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining\xe2\x80\x9d step tells a doctor to measure patients\xe2\x80\x99 metabolite levels, through whatever process the doctor wishes to use.  Because methods for making such determinations were well known in the art, this step simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field.  Such activity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.  Parker v. Flook, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584\n.  Finally, considering the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.

In Diehr, the overall process was patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole.  450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 187.  These additional steps transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.  But in Flook, the additional steps of the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and the particular chemical processes at issue were all \xe2\x80\x9cwell known,\xe2\x80\x9d to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no \xe2\x80\x9cinventive concept\xe2\x80\x9d in the claimed application of the formula.  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 594.  Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is weaker than Diehr\xe2\x80\x99s patent-eligible claim and no stronger than Flook\xe2\x80\x99s unpatentable one.  The three steps add nothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field.

See, e.g., Benson, 409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 67, 68.  Rewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might encourage their discovery.  But because those laws and principles are \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic tools of scientific and technological work,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 67, there is a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process is no more than a general instruction to \xe2\x80\x9capply the natural law,\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify.  The patent claims at issue implicate this concern.  In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correlations they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision regardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the inference he draws using the correlations.  And they threaten to inhibit the development of more refined treatment recommendations that combine Prometheus\xe2\x80\x99 correlations with later discoveries.  This reinforces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent.

Because the way in which people metabolize thiopurine compounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug affects different people differently, and it has been difficult for doctors to determine whether for a particular patient a given dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the time the discoveries embodied in the patents were made, scientists already understood that the levels in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s blood of certain metabolites, including, in particular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6\xe2\x80\x93TG) and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6\xe2\x80\x93MMP), were correlated with the likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine drug could cause harm or prove ineffective.

Claim 1, for example, states that if the levels of 6\xe2\x80\x93TG in the blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopurine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells, then the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side effects.  While it takes a human action (the administration of a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this relation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in principle apart from any human action.  The relation is a consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds are metabolized by the body\xe2\x80\x94entirely natural processes.  And so a patent that simply describes that relation sets forth a natural law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question before us is whether the claims do significantly more than simply describe these natural relations.  To put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add enough to their statements of the correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws?  We believe that the answer to this question is no.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has additional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself.  A patent, for example, could not simply recite a law of nature and then add the instruction \xe2\x80\x9capply the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Einstein, we assume, could not have patented his famous law by claiming a process consisting of simply telling linear accelerator operators to refer to the law to determine how much energy an amount of mass has produced (or vice versa).  Nor could Archimedes have secured a patent for his famous principle of flotation by claiming a process consisting of simply telling boat builders to refer to that principle in order to determine whether an object will float.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat else is there in the claims before us?  The process that each claim recites tells doctors interested in the subject about the correlations that the researchers discovered.  In doing so, it recites an \xe2\x80\x9cadministering\xe2\x80\x9d step, a \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining\xe2\x80\x9d step, and a \xe2\x80\x9cwherein\xe2\x80\x9d step.  These additional steps are not themselves natural laws but neither are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the \xe2\x80\x9cadministering\xe2\x80\x9d step simply refers to the relevant audience, namely doctors who treat patients with certain diseases with thiopurine drugs.  That audience is a pre-existing audience; doctors used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders long before anyone asserted these claims.  In any event, the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition against patenting abstract ideas \xe2\x80\x98cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Diehr, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 191\xe2\x80\x93192).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the \xe2\x80\x9cwherein\xe2\x80\x9d clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, at most adding a suggestion that he should take those laws into account when treating his patient.  That is to say, these clauses tell the relevant audience about the laws while trusting them to use those laws appropriately where they are relevant to their decisionmaking (rather like Einstein telling linear accelerator operators about his basic law and then trusting them to use it where relevant).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining\xe2\x80\x9d step tells the doctor to determine the level of the relevant metabolites in the blood, through whatever process the doctor or the laboratory wishes to use.  As the patents state, methods for determining metabolite levels were well known in the art.  \xe2\x80\x99623 patent, col. 9, ll. 12\xe2\x80\x9365, 2 App. 11.  Indeed, scientists routinely measured metabolites as part of their investigations into the relationships between metabolite levels and efficacy and toxicity of thiopurine compounds.  \xe2\x80\x99623 patent, col. 8, ll. 37\xe2\x80\x9340, id., at 10.  Thus, this step tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists who work in the field.  Purely \xe2\x80\x9cconventional or obvious\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[pre]-solution activity\xe2\x80\x9d is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.  Flook, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 590; see also Bilski, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas \xe2\x80\x98cannot be circumvented by\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. adding \xe2\x80\x98insignificant post-solution activity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Diehr, supra, at 191\xe2\x80\x93192)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, to consider the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.  See Diehr, supra, at 188 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made\xe2\x80\x9d).  Anyone who wants to make use of these laws must first administer a thiopurine drug and measure the resulting metabolite concentrations, and so the combination amounts to nothing significantly more than an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that the three steps simply tell doctors to gather data from which they may draw an inference in light of the correlations.  To put the matter more suc- cinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about certain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well-understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community; and those steps, when viewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum of their parts taken separately.  For these reasons we believe that the steps are not sufficient to transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications of those regularities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents reinforces our conclusion.  The cases most directly on point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court reached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of processes that embodied the equivalent of natural laws.  The Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method for molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, molded products.  The process used a known mathematical equation, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when (depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the time the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of the rubber) to open the press.  It consisted in effect of the steps of: (1) continuously monitoring the temperature on the inside of the mold, (2) feeding the resulting numbers into a computer, which would use the Arrhenius equation to continuously recalculate the mold-opening time, and (3) configuring the computer so that at the appropriate moment it would signal \xe2\x80\x9ca device\xe2\x80\x9d to open the press.  Diehr, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 177\xe2\x80\x93179.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court pointed out that the basic mathematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable.  But it found the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole.  Those steps included \xe2\x80\x9cinstalling rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly determining the temperature of the mold, constantly re- calculating the appropriate cure time through the use of the formula and a digital computer, and automatically opening the press at the proper time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 187.  It nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional.  And so the patentees did not \xe2\x80\x9cseek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation,\xe2\x80\x9d but sought \xe2\x80\x9conly to foreclose from others the use of that equation in conjunction with all of the other steps in their claimed process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  These other steps apparently added to the formula something that in terms of patent law\xe2\x80\x99s objectives had significance\xe2\x80\x94they transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe process in Flook (held not patentable) provided a method for adjusting \xe2\x80\x9calarm limits\xe2\x80\x9d in the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons.  Certain operating conditions (such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates), which are continuously monitored during the conversion process, signal inefficiency or danger when they exceed certain \xe2\x80\x9calarm limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  The claimed process amounted to an improved system for updating those alarm limits through the steps of: (1) measuring the current level of the variable, e.g., the temperature; (2) using an apparently novel mathematical algorithm to calculate the current alarm limits; and (3) adjusting the system to reflect the new alarm-limit values.  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 585\xe2\x80\x93587.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court, as in Diehr, pointed out that the basic mathematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable.  But it characterized the claimed process as doing nothing other than \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] a[n unpatentable] formula for computing an updated alarm limit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Flook, supra, at 586.  Unlike the process in Diehr, it did not \xe2\x80\x9cexplain how the variables used in the formula were to be selected, nor did the [claim] contain any disclosure relating to chemical processes at work or the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting the alarm limit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Diehr, supra, at 192, n.\xc2\xa014; see also Flook, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 586.  And so the other steps in the process did not limit the claim to a particular application.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he chemical processes involved in catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the practice of monitoring the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits to trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must be recomputed and readjusted, and the use of comput- ers for \xe2\x80\x98automatic monitoring-alarming\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d were all \xe2\x80\x9cwell known,\xe2\x80\x9d to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no \xe2\x80\x9cinventive concept\xe2\x80\x9d in the claimed application of the formula.  Id., at 594.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]ost-solution activity\xe2\x80\x9d that is purely \xe2\x80\x9cconventional or obvious,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court wrote, \xe2\x80\x9ccan[not] transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 589, 590.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe claim before us presents a case for patentability that is weaker than the (patent-eligible) claim in Diehr and no stronger than the (unpatentable) claim in Flook.  Beyond picking out the relevant audience, namely those who administer doses of thiopurine drugs, the claim sim- ply tells doctors to: (1) measure (somehow) the current level of the relevant metabolite, (2) use particular (unpatentable) laws of nature (which the claim sets forth) to calculate the current toxicity/inefficacy limits, and (3) reconsider the drug dosage in light of the law.  These instructions add nothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field.  And since they are steps that must be taken in order to apply the laws in question, the effect is simply to tell doctors to apply the law somehow when treating their patients.  The process in Diehr was not so characterized; that in Flook was characterized in roughly this way.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther cases offer further support for the view that simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and ideas patentable.  This Court has previously discussed in detail an English case, Neilson, which involved a patent claim that posed a legal problem very similar to the problem now before us.  The patent applicant there asserted a claim\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cfor the improved application of air to produce heat in fires, forges, and furnaces, where a blowing apparatus is required.  [The invention] was to be applied as follows: The blast or current of air produced by the blowing apparatus was to be passed from it into an air-vessel or receptacle made sufficiently strong to endure the blast; and through or from that vessel or receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into the fire, the receptacle be kept artificially heated to a considerable temperature by heat externally applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morse, 15 How., at 114\xe2\x80\x93115.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe English court concluded that the claimed process did more than simply instruct users to use the principle that hot air promotes ignition better than cold air, since it explained how the principle could be implemented in an inventive way.  Baron Parke wrote (for the court):\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very difficult to distinguish [Neilson\xe2\x80\x99s claim] from the specification of a patent for a principle, and this at first created in the minds of some of the court much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine embodying a principle, and a very valuable one.  We think the case must be considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in this\xe2\x80\x94by interposing a receptacle for heated air between the blowing apparatus and the furnace.  In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the application of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which was before of cold air, in a heated state to the furnace.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neilson v. Harford, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Cases, at 371.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThus, the claimed process included not only a law of nature but also several unconventional steps (such as inserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle externally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that confined the claims to a particular, useful application of the principle.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process for hedging risks of price changes by, for example, contracting to purchase commodities from sellers at a fixed price, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a drop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a fixed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge against a price increase.  One claim described the process; another reduced the process to a mathematical formula.  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933).  The Court held that the described \xe2\x80\x9cconcept of hedging\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9can unpatentable abstract idea.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  The fact that some of the claims limited hedging to use in commodities and energy markets and specified that \xe2\x80\x9cwell-known random analysis techniques [could be used] to help establish some of the inputs into the equation\xe2\x80\x9d did not undermine this conclusion, for \xe2\x80\x9cFlook established that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 15).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, in Benson the Court considered the patentability of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general purpose digital computer.  The claims \xe2\x80\x9cpurported to cover any use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital computer of any type.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 64, 65.  The Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d might be patentable.  Id., at 67 (quoting Mackay Radio, 306 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 94).  But it held that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, was not a patentable application of that principle.  For the mathematical formula had \xe2\x80\x9cno substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Benson, supra, at 71.  Hence the claim (like the claims before us) was overly broad; it did not differ significantly from a claim that just said \xe2\x80\x9capply the algorithm.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has repeatedly emphasized this last mentioned concern, a concern that patent law not inhibit further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of laws of nature.  Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as unpatentable Samuel Morse\xe2\x80\x99s general claim for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. however developed, for making or printing intelligible characters, letters, or signs, at any distances,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 15 How., at 86.  The Court explained:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cFor aught that we now know some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover a mode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric or galvanic current, without using any part of the process or combination set forth in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s specification.  His invention may be less complicated\xe2\x80\x94less liable to get out of order\xe2\x80\x94less expensive in construction, and in its operation.  But yet if it is covered by this patent the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benefit of it without the permission of this patentee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 113.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, in Benson the Court said that the claims before it were \xe2\x80\x9cso abstract and sweeping as to cover both known and unknown uses of the [mathematical formula].\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 67, 68.  In Bilski the Court pointed out that to allow \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioners to patent risk hedging would pre-empt use of this approach in all fields.\xe2\x80\x9d  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  And in Flook the Court expressed concern that the claimed process was simply \xe2\x80\x9ca formula for computing an updated alarm limit,\xe2\x80\x9d which might \xe2\x80\x9ccover a broad range of potential uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 586.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese statements reflect the fact that, even though rewarding with patents those who discover new laws of nature and the like might well encourage their discovery, those laws and principles, considered generally, are \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic tools of scientific and technological work.\xe2\x80\x9d  Benson, supra, at 67.  And so there is a danger that the grant of patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation premised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process amounts to no more than an instruction to \xe2\x80\x9capply the natural law,\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify.  See generally Lemley, Risch, Sichelman, &amp; Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1315 (2011) (hereinafter Lemley) (arguing that \xc2\xa7101 reflects this kind of concern); see also C.

They tell a treating doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the statistical relationships they describe.  In doing so, they tie up the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent treatment decision whether that treatment does, or does not, change in light of the inference he has drawn using the correlations.  And they threaten to inhibit the development of more refined treatment recommendations (like that embodied in Mayo\xe2\x80\x99s test), that combine Prometheus\xe2\x80\x99 correlations with later discovered features of metabolites, human physiology or individual patient characteristics.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining\xe2\x80\x9d step too is set forth in highly general language covering all processes that make use of the correlations after measuring metabolites, including later discovered processes that measure metabolite levels in new ways.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe need not, and do not, now decide whether were the steps at issue here less conventional, these features of the claims would prove sufficient to invalidate them.  For here, as we have said, the steps add nothing of significance to the natural laws themselves.  Unlike, say, a typical patent on a new drug or a new way of using an existing drug, the patent claims do not confine their reach to particular applications of those laws.  The presence here of the basic underlying concern that these patents tie up too much future use of laws of nature simply reinforces our conclusion that the processes described in the patents are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have considered several further arguments in support of Prometheus\xe2\x80\x99 position.  But they do not lead us to adopt a different conclusion.  First, the Federal Circuit, in upholding the patent eligibility of the claims before us, relied on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ransformation and reduction of an article \xe2\x80\x98to a different state or thing\xe2\x80\x99 is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\xe2\x80\x9d  Benson, supra, at 70\xe2\x80\x9371 (emphasis added); see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937); Diehr, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 184; Flook, supra, at 588, n.\xc2\xa09; Cochrane v. Deener, \n\n94 U.\xc2\xa0S. 780, \n788 (1877)\n.  It reasoned that the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible, since they involve transforming the human body by administering a thiopurine drug and transforming the blood by analyzing it to determine metabolite levels.  628 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1356\xe2\x80\x931357.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first of these transformations, however, is irrelevant.  As we have pointed out, the \xe2\x80\x9cadministering\xe2\x80\x9d step simply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are likely interested in applying the law of nature.  See supra, at 9.  And the second step could be satisfied without transforming the blood, should science develop a totally different system for determining metabolite levels that did not involve such a transformation.  See supra, at 18.  Regardless, in stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation\xe2\x80\x9d test is an \xe2\x80\x9cimportant and useful clue\xe2\x80\x9d to patentability, we have neither said nor implied that the test trumps the \xe2\x80\x9claw of nature\xe2\x80\x9d exclusion.  Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937) (emphasis added).  That being so, the test fails here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Prometheus argues that, because the particular laws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld.  Thus, it encourages us to draw distinctions among laws of nature based on whether or not they will interfere significantly with innovation in other fields now or in the future.  Brief for Respondent 42\xe2\x80\x9346; see also Lemley 1342\xe2\x80\x931344 (making similar argument).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the underlying functional concern here is a relative one: how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to the contribution of the inventor.  See supra, at 17.  A patent upon a narrow law of nature may not inhibit future research as seriously as would a patent upon Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s law of relativity, but the creative value of the discovery is also considerably smaller.  And, as we have previously pointed out, even a narrow law of nature (such as the one before us) can inhibit future research.  See supra, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, our cases have not distinguished among different laws of nature according to whether or not the principles they embody are sufficiently narrow.  See, e.g., Flook, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584\n (holding narrow mathematical formula unpatentable).  And this is understandable.  Courts and judges are not institutionally well suited to making the kinds of judgments needed to distinguish among differ- ent laws of nature.  And so the cases have endorsed a bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas and the like, which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding-block\xe2\x80\x9d concern.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the Government argues that virtually any step beyond a statement of a law of nature itself should transform an unpatentable law of nature into a potentially patentable application sufficient to satisfy \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s demands.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae.  The Government does not necessarily believe that claims that (like the claims before us) extend just minimally beyond a law of nature should receive patents.  But in its view, other statutory provisions\xe2\x80\x94those that insist that a claimed process be novel, \n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102, that it not be \xe2\x80\x9cobvious in light of prior art,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7103, and that it be \xe2\x80\x9cfull[y], clear[ly], concise[ly], and exact[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d described, \xc2\xa7112\xe2\x80\x94can perform this screening function.  In particular, it argues that these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under \xc2\xa7102.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis approach, however, would make the \xe2\x80\x9claw of nature\xe2\x80\x9d exception to \xc2\xa7101 patentability a dead letter.  The approach is therefore not consistent with prior law.  The relevant cases rest their holdings upon section 101, not later sections.

Intuitively, one would suppose that a newly discovered law of nature is novel.  The Government, however, suggests in effect that the novelty of a component law of nature may be disregarded when evaluating the novelty of the whole.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27.  But \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102 and 103 say nothing about treating laws of nature as if they were part of the prior art when applying those sections.  Cf.

That research, which includes research leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is expensive; it \xe2\x80\x9cha[s] made the United States the world leader in this field\xe2\x80\x9d; and it requires protection.

The American Medical Association, the American College of Medical Genetics, the American Hospital Association, the American Society of Human Genetics, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Association for Molecular Pathology, and other medical organizations tell us that if \xe2\x80\x9cclaims to exclusive rights over the body\xe2\x80\x99s natural responses to illness and medical treatment are permitted to stand, the result will be a vast thicket of exclusive rights over the use of critical scientific data that must remain widely available if physicians are to provide sound medical care.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for American College of Medical Genetics et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 7; see also App. to Brief for Association Internationale pour la Protection de la Propri\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 Intellectuelle et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae A6, A16 (methods of medical treatment are not patentable in most of Western Europe).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not find this kind of difference of opinion surprising.  Patent protection is, after all, a two-edged sword.  On the one hand, the promise of exclusive rights provides monetary incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery.  On the other hand, that very exclusivity can impede the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention, by, for example, raising the price of using the patented ideas once created, requiring potential users to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing patents and pending patent applications, and requiring the negotiation of complex licensing arrangements.  At the same time, patent law\xe2\x80\x99s general rules must govern inventive activity in many different fields of human endeavor, with the result that the practical effects of rules that reflect a general effort to balance these considerations may differ from one field to another.
