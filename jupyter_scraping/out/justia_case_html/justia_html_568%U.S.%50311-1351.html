The FTCA, as originally enacted, afforded tort victims a remedy against the United States, but did not preclude suit against the alleged tortfeasor as sole or joint defendant.  Several agency-specific statutes postdating the FTCA, however, immunized certain federal employees from personal liability for torts committed in the course of their official duties.  One such statute, the Gonzalez Act, makes the remedy against the United States under the FTCA preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical personnel.  \n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71089(a).

Naval Hospital.  He filed suit, naming the United States and the surgeon as defendants and asserting, inter alia, a claim of battery, based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to operate shortly before the surgery took place.  Finding that the surgeon had acted within the scope of his employment, the District Court released him and substituted the United States as sole defendant.  The Government moved to dismiss the battery claim, relying on the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception.  Levin countered that the Gonzalez Act, in particular, \xc2\xa71089(e), renders that exception inapplicable when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by a military physician.  The District Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  Affirming, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \xc2\xa71089(e) served only to buttress the immunity from personal liability granted military medical personnel in \xc2\xa71089(a), and did not negate the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Gonzalez Act direction in \xc2\xa71089(e) abrogates the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception and therefore permits Levin\xe2\x80\x99s suit against the United States alleging medical battery by a Navy doctor acting within the scope of his employment.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9315.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0To determine whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity is waived for batteries, the Court looks to \xc2\xa71089(e)\xe2\x80\x99s language, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving the \xe2\x80\x98words used\xe2\x80\x99 their \xe2\x80\x98ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Moskal v. United States, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n.  Levin claims that the operative clause of \xc2\xa71089(e), which provides that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to medical malpractice claims, is qualified by the provision\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of this section,\xe2\x80\x9d which confines the operative clause to claims alleging malpractice by personnel in the armed forces and the other agencies specified in the Gonzalez Act.  The Government, in contrast, argues that \xc2\xa71089(e)\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause instructs courts to pretend, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d the Gonzalez Act, that \xc2\xa72680(h) does not secure the Government against liability for intentional torts, including battery, even though \xc2\xa72680(h) does provide that shelter.  The choice between the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dueling constructions is not a difficult one.  Section 1089(e)\xe2\x80\x99s operative clause states, in no uncertain terms, that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception, \xc2\xa72680(h), \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa71089(e)\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause confines the abrogation of \xc2\xa72680(h) to medical personnel employed by the agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act.  Had Congress wanted to adopt the Government\xe2\x80\x99s counterfactual interpretation, it could have used more precise language, as it did in \xc2\xa71089(c), a subsection adjacent to \xc2\xa71089(e).

That reading conflicts with the view the Government stated in United States v. Smith, \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 160\n.  There, the question was whether a person injured abroad due to a military doctor\xe2\x80\x99s negligence may seek compensation from the doctor in a U.\xc2\xa0S. court, for the FTCA gave them no recourse against the Government on a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k).  In arguing that such persons also lacked recourse to a suit against the doctor, the Government contended that the Liability Reform Act made \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he remedy against the United States\xe2\x80\x9d under the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(b)(1).  This interpretation, the Government argued, would not override the Gonzalez Act, which would continue to serve two important functions: Title \n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual military doctors sued abroad where foreign law might govern; and the Gonzalez Act would allow an FTCA suit against the United States if the doctor performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did not consent.  Adopting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction, the Court held that \xc2\xa72679(b)(1) grants all federal employees, including medical personnel, immunity for acts within the scope of their employment, even when the FTCA provides no remedy against the United States.  499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 166.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current reading of \xc2\xa71089(e), the Liability Reform Act overrides the Gonzalez Act except in the atypical circumstances in which indemnification of the doctor under \xc2\xa71089(f)(1) remains possible, while under Levin\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the Gonzalez Act does just what the Government said it did in Smith.

But this Court sees nothing dispositively different about the wording of the two provisions, and neither did the Government when it argued in the District Court that \xc2\xa71089(e) and \xc2\xa77316(f) are functionally indistinguishable.

Seeking compensation from the United States, Levin sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346(b), 2671\xe2\x80\x932680, which waives the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from tort suits, but excepts from the waiver certain intentional torts, including battery, \xc2\xa72680(h).  Levin relied on the Gonzalez Act, \n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71089, which makes the remedy against the United States under the FTCA preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical personnel, \xc2\xa71089(a).  In the provision at issue in this case, \xc2\xa71089(e), the Gonzalez Act declares that, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act, the intentional tort exception to the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. functions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government reads \xc2\xa71089(e) simply to shore up \xc2\xa71089(a)\xe2\x80\x99s immunization of medical personnel against tort liability.  Levin, in contrast, reads \xc2\xa71089(e) to establish his right to bring a claim of medical battery against the United States under the FTCA without encountering the intentional tort exception.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the District of Guam, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, dismissed Levin\xe2\x80\x99s battery claim based on the reading of the Gonzalez Act proffered by the Government.  We find the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading strained, and Levin\xe2\x80\x99s, far more compatible with the text and purpose of the federal legislation.  We therefore reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FTCA, enacted in 1946, \xe2\x80\x9cwas designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the United States from suits in tort.\xe2\x80\x9d  Richards v. United States, \n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n6 (1962)\n.  The Act gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims against the United States for \xe2\x80\x9cinjury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission\xe2\x80\x9d of federal employees acting within the scope of their employment.  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  Substantively, the FTCA makes the United States liable \xe2\x80\x9cto the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72674, under the law of the place where the tort occurred, \xc2\xa71346(b)(1), subject to enumerated exceptions to the immunity waiver, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72680(a)\xe2\x80\x93(n).

Judgment against the United States in an FTCA action would bar a sub- sequent action against the federal employee whose conduct gave rise to the claim, \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72676, but plaintiffs were not obliged to proceed exclusively against the Government.

Targeted immunity statutes enacted around the same time as the Gonzalez Act similarly shielded medical personnel employed by specific agencies.  See supra, at 3, n.\xc2\xa02.

Shielding all federal employees from personal liability without regard to agency affiliation or line of work, the personal immunity provision of the Liability Reform Act tracks the text of \xc2\xa71089(a).  The comprehensive enactment, however, did not repeal the Gonzalez Act, Smith, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 172, or, presumably, any of the other laws covering medical personnel employed at particular agencies.  Unlike the Gonzalez Act and kindred statutes, the Liability Reform Act does not reference, as \xc2\xa71089(e) does, the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception, \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(h).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petitioner, Steven Alan Levin, a veteran, was diagnosed with a cataract in his right eye.

Dr. Bishop recommended that Levin undergo \xe2\x80\x9cphacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement,\xe2\x80\x9d a surgical procedure involving extraction of the cataract and insertion of an artificial replacement lens.  Levin signed forms consenting to the operation, which took place on March 12, 2003.  Shortly before the surgery began, Levin alleges, he orally withdrew his consent twice, but Dr. Bishop con- ducted the operation nevertheless.  Due to complications oc- curring while the surgery was underway, Levin developed corneal edema, a condition that left him with diminished eyesight, discomfort, problems with glare and depth-of-field vision, and in need of ongoing medical treatment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLevin sought compensation for the untoward results of the surgery.  After exhausting administrative remedies, he commenced a civil action in the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the District of Guam.  Naming the United States and Dr. Bishop as defendants, Levin asserted claims of battery, based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to the surgery, and negligence, based on alleged flaws in Dr. Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s performance of the operation.  Accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s representation that Dr. Bishop was acting within the scope of his employment while performing the surgery, the District Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to release Dr. Bishop and substitute the United States as sole defendant.  When Levin failed to produce expert testimony in support of his negligence allegations, the court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment on that claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNext, the Government moved to dismiss the battery claim.  The District Court no longer had jurisdiction over Levin\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Government argued, because the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception, \xc2\xa72680(h), disallows suits against the United States for battery.  Levin countered that the Gonzalez Act, in particular, \xc2\xa71089(e), renders the intentional tort exception inapplicable when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by an armed forces physician.  The District Court rejected Levin\xe2\x80\x99s plea and granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

That was so, he maintained, because \xc2\xa71089(e) negated \xc2\xa72680(h), the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception.  The Court of Appeals thought Levin\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Gonzalez Act \xe2\x80\x9cplausible,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cnot the best reading of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  663 F.\xc2\xa03d 1059, 1062 (2011).  As perceived by the Ninth Circuit, \xc2\xa71089(e) had a limited office, serving only to buttress the immunity from personal liability granted military medical personnel in \xc2\xa71089(a).  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]lever tort plaintiffs,\xe2\x80\x9d the court conjectured, might argue in future cases that because the FTCA does not authorize battery claims against the United States, such claims may be asserted against military doctors notwithstanding \xc2\xa71089(a).  Ibid.  Section 1089(e) foreclosed that argument, but the provision did nothing more, the court concluded.  Satisfied that \xc2\xa71089(e) served the dominant purpose of the Gonzalez Act\xe2\x80\x94to immunize covered medical personnel against malpractice liability\xe2\x80\x94and did not unequivocally waive the United\xc2\xa0States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity from battery claims, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), recognizing that Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether the controlling provision of the Gonzalez Act, \xc2\xa71089(e), authorizes battery claims against the United States when military doctors operate without the patient\xe2\x80\x99s consent.

The provision of the Gonzalez Act at issue, \xc2\xa71089(e), has two components: an introductory clause and an operative clause.  The introductory clause prefaces \xc2\xa71089(e) with \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  The operative clause instructs that \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(h), the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort exception, \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply to any cause of action arising out of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. negligent or wrongful\xe2\x80\x9d conduct taken \xe2\x80\x9cin the performance of medical, dental or related health care functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71089(e).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe set out below the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dueling constructions of \xc2\xa71089(e).  Levin reads \xc2\xa71089(e) to negate \xc2\xa72680(h) for battery claims involving medical personnel of the armed forces and other specified agencies.  He trains first on the operative clause of \xc2\xa71089(e), which contains this direc- tive: The intentional tort exception to the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to claims alleging medical malpractice.  But, he points out, if left unqualified, the operative clause would expose the United States to liability for medical malpractice committed by federal employees across all agencies.  The introductory clause, Levin maintains, supplies the qualification: It confines the operative clause to claims covered by \xe2\x80\x9cthis section,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., claims alleging malpractice by personnel in the armed forces and the other agencies specified in the Gonzalez Act.  Because Levin\xe2\x80\x99s claim concerning Dr. Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s alleged battery fits that category, Levin concludes, he may sue to recover from the United States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government, in contrast, reads \xc2\xa71089(e)\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause as instructing courts to pretend, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d the Gonzalez Act, that \xc2\xa72680(h) does not secure the Government against liability for intentional torts, including battery, even though \xc2\xa72680(h) does provide that shelter.  Congress included this counterfactual instruction in the Gonzalez Act, the Government successfully argued in the Ninth Circuit, \xe2\x80\x9cto guard against the negative inference that, if no remedy against the United States were available for a medical battery claim, a remedy against an individual defendant must exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 8.  Warding off this mistaken inference, the Government asserts, \xc2\xa71089(e) eliminates any doubt that the military medical personnel covered by \xc2\xa71089(a) are personally immune from malpractice liability.  Ensuring that immunity, the Government reminds us, was the very purpose of the Gonzalez Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe choice between these alternative readings of \xc2\xa71089(e) is not difficult to make.

Had Congress wanted to guard against any inference that individual employees may be liable, despite \xc2\xa71089(a)\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the remedy against the United States is exclusive, see supra, at 4, n. 3, Congress might have stated, \xe2\x80\x9csubsection (a) applies even when \xc2\xa72680(h) precludes recovery against the United States under the FTCA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Or, Congress might have provided that \xc2\xa72680(h) shall be \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered\xe2\x80\x9d inapplicable, a formulation commonly employed to direct courts to make counterfactual assumptions.

To explain why this is so, we describe the situation before the Court in United States v. Smith, \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 160\n.  Smith presented the question whether persons injured abroad due to a military doctor\xe2\x80\x99s negligence may seek compensation in a U.\xc2\xa0S. court from the doctor who caused the injury.  Because the FTCA excludes from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k), the plaintiffs in Smith had no remedy against the United States.  They also lacked recourse to a suit in this country against the doctor, the Government urged, for the Liability Reform Act made \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he remedy against the United States\xe2\x80\x9d under the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive of any other civil action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(b)(1).  Were that the case, the plaintiffs responded, the Liability Reform Act would effectively repeal the Gonzalez Act.  See Brief for Respondents in Smith, O. T. 1990, No. 89\xe2\x80\x931646, pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9346.  In particular, they observed, \n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71089(f)(1) authorizes the head of an agency to indemnify military doctors \xe2\x80\x9cassigned to a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d whose negligent conduct injures a patient.  But the indemnification provision would have no work to do, the plaintiffs argued, if the Liability Reform Act foreclosed suit against the doctor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNot so, the Government responded.  The Gonzalez Act would continue to serve two important functions.  First, \xc2\xa71089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual military doctors sued abroad where foreign law, rather than the FTCA, might govern.  Brief for United States in Smith 34 (citing Powers v. Schultz, 821 F.\xc2\xa02d 295, 297\xe2\x80\x93298 (CA5 1987)).  Second, the Gonzalez Act would allow an FTCA suit against the United States if the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice ranked as \xe2\x80\x9cintentional,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., if he performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did not consent.  See Brief for United States in Smith 32\xe2\x80\x9334; Reply Brief in Smith 12 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he provision of the Gonzalez Act waiving sovereign immunity as to medical malpractice claims sounding in intentional tort, \n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71089(e), will enable plaintiffs to pursue those claims against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the Government told this Court, \xe2\x80\x9cin view of the continued need for the provisions of the Gonzalez Act even after the enactment of the [Liability] Reform Act, leaving that statute on the books was an entirely sensible drafting decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 13.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAdopting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Liability Reform Act, we held in Smith that \xc2\xa72679(b)(1) grants all federal employees, including medical personnel, immunity for acts within the scope of their employment, even when an FTCA exception (such as \xc2\xa72680(k)) left the plaintiff without a remedy against the United States.  499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 166.

See Brief for United States 24, n.\xc2\xa08.  Under its current reading, the Liability Reform Act does indeed override the Gonzalez Act save in two slim applications: If a military doctor employed by the United States is sued in a foreign court, or is detailed to a non-federal institution, indemnification of the doctor under \xc2\xa71089(f)(1) would remain possible.  See id., at 26.  Under Levin\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71089(e), the Gonzalez Act does just what the Government said that legislation did in briefing Smith: It renders \xc2\xa72680(h) inapplicable to medical batteries committed by military personnel within the scope of their employment, thereby permitting civil actions against the United States by persons situated as Levin is.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEndeavoring to inject ambiguity into \xc2\xa71089(e) notwithstanding its direction that \xe2\x80\x9csection 2680(h) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not apply,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government refers to \n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77316, a parallel statute that confers immunity on medical personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  As enacted in 1965, \xc2\xa77316\xe2\x80\x99s statutory predecessor had no provision akin to \xc2\xa71089(e).  See \n\n79Stat.\n1156, \n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74116 (1970 ed.).  Congress added such a provision in 1988, but it was not a carbon copy of \xc2\xa71089(e).  In particular, the new provision did not include the words that preface \xc2\xa71089(e).  It reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe exception provided in section 2680(h) of title 28 shall not apply to any claim arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission of any person described in subsection (a) of this section in furnishing medical care or treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77316(f).
