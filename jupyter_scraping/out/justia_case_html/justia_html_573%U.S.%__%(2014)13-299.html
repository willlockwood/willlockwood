Allowing debtors to protect funds in traditional and Roth IRAs ensures that debtors will be able to meet their basic needs during their retirement years.  By contrast, nothing about an inherited IRA\xe2\x80\x99s legal characteristics prevent or discourage an individual from using the entire balance immediately after bankruptcy for purposes of current consumption.  The \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d exemption should not be read in a manner that would convert the bankruptcy objective of protecting debtors\xe2\x80\x99 basic needs into a \xe2\x80\x9cfree pass,\xe2\x80\x9d Schwab v.

Their claim that funds in an inherited IRA are retirement funds because, at some point, they were set aside for retirement, conflicts with ordinary usage and would render the term \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C), superfluous.  Congress could have achieved the exact same result without specifying the funds as \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the absence of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest,\xe2\x80\x9d which appears in many other \xc2\xa7522 exemptions, does not indicate that \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C) covers funds intended for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s retirement.  Where used, that phrase works to limit the value of the asset that the debtor may exempt from her estate, not to distinguish between a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and the assets of another.  Also unpersuasive is petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s sentence structure\xe2\x80\x94i.e., a broad category, here, \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds,\xe2\x80\x9d followed by limiting language, here, \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94prevents the broad category from performing any independent limiting work.  This is not the only way in which the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that\xe2\x80\x9d may be read, and this argument reintroduces the problem that makes the term \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  Finally, the possibility that an account holder can leave an inherited IRA intact until retirement and take only the required minimum distributions does not mean that an inherited IRA bears the legal characteristics of retirement funds.

The question presented is whether funds contained in an inherited individual retirement account (IRA) qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of this bankruptcy exemption.  We hold that they do not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        When an individual debtor files a bankruptcy petition, her \xe2\x80\x9clegal or equitable interests .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in property\xe2\x80\x9d become part of the bankruptcy estate.  \xc2\xa7541(a)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cTo help the debtor obtain a fresh start,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to exempt from the estate limited interests in certain kinds of property.  Rousey v. Jacoway,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320,\n325 (2005)\n.  The exemption at issue in this case allows debtors to protect \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds to the extent those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C), (d)(12).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The enumerated sections of the Internal Revenue Code cover many types of accounts, three of which are relevant here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The first two are traditional and Roth IRAs, which are created by\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408 and \xc2\xa7408A, respectively.  Both types of accounts offer tax advantages to encourage individuals to save for retirement.  Qualified contributions to traditional IRAs, for example, are tax-deductible.  \xc2\xa7219(a).  Roth IRAs offer the opposite benefit: Although contributions are not tax-deductible, qualified distributions are tax-free.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7408A(c)(1), (d)(1).  To ensure that both types of IRAs are used for retirement purposes and not as general tax-advantaged savings vehicles, Congress made certain withdrawals from both types of accounts subject to a 10 percent penalty if taken before an accountholder reaches the age of 59\xc2\xbd.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa772(t)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2); see also n.\xc2\xa04, infra.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The third type of account relevant here is an inher-ited IRA.  An inherited IRA is a traditional or Roth IRA that has been inherited after its owner\xe2\x80\x99s death.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7408(d)(3)(C)(ii), 408A(a).  If the heir is the owner\xe2\x80\x99s spouse, as is often the case, the spouse has a choice: He or she may \xe2\x80\x9croll over\xe2\x80\x9d the IRA funds into his or her own IRA, or he or she may keep the IRA as an inherited IRA (subject to the rules discussed below).  See Internal Revenue Service, Publication 590: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), p. 18 (Jan. 5, 2014).  When anyone other than the owner\xe2\x80\x99s spouse inherits the IRA, he or she may not roll over the funds; the only option is to hold the IRA as an inherited account.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Inherited IRAs do not operate like ordinary IRAs.  Unlike with a traditional or Roth IRA, an individual may withdraw funds from an inherited IRA at any time, without paying a tax penalty.  \xc2\xa772(t)(2)(A)(ii).  Indeed, the owner of an inherited IRA not only may but must withdraw its funds: The owner must either withdraw the entire balance in the account within five years of the original owner\xe2\x80\x99s death or take minimum distributions on an annual basis.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.408\xe2\x80\x938 (2013) (Q\xe2\x80\x931 and A\xe2\x80\x931(a) incorporating \xc2\xa71.401(a)(9)\xe2\x80\x933 (Q\xe2\x80\x931 and A\xe2\x80\x931(a))); see generally D. Cartano, Taxation of Individual Retirement Accounts \xc2\xa732.02[A] (2013).  And unlike with a traditional or Roth IRA, the owner of an inherited IRA may never make contributions to the account.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7219(d)(4).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2000, Ruth Heffron established a traditional IRA and named her daughter, Heidi Heffron-Clark, as the sole beneficiary of the account.  When Ms. Heffron died in 2001, her IRA\xe2\x80\x94which was then worth just over $450,000\xe2\x80\x94passed to her daughter and became an inherited IRA.  Ms. Heffron-Clark elected to take monthly distri-butions from the account.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In October 2010, Ms. Heffron-Clark and her husband, petitioners in this Court, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  They identified the inherited IRA, by then worth roughly $300,000, as exempt from the bankruptcy estate under\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C).  Respondents, the bankruptcy trustee and unsecured creditors of the estate, objected to the claimed exemption on the ground that the funds in the inherited IRA were not \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Bankruptcy Court agreed, disallowing the exemption.  In\xc2\xa0re Clark, 450 B.\xc2\xa0R. 858, 866 (WD Wisc. 2011).  Relying on the \xe2\x80\x9cplain language of \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C),\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that an inherited IRA \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not contain anyone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98retirement funds,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because unlike with a traditional IRA, the funds are not \xe2\x80\x9csegregated to meet the needs of, nor distributed on the occasion of, any person\xe2\x80\x99s retirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 863.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The District Court reversed, explaining that the exemption covers any account containing funds \xe2\x80\x9coriginally\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caccumulated for retirement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  In\xc2\xa0re Clark, 466 B.\xc2\xa0R. 135, 139 (WD Wisc. 2012).  The Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  In\xc2\xa0re Clark, 714 F.\xc2\xa03d 559 (2013).  Pointing to the \xe2\x80\x9c[d]if-ferent rules govern[ing] inherited\xe2\x80\x9d and noninherited IRAs, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cinherited IRAs represent an opportunity for current consumption, not a fund of retirement savings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 560, 562.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling and the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in In\xc2\xa0re Chilton, 674 F.\xc2\xa03d 486 (2012).  571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).

See Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7).  The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfund[s]\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9csum[s] of money .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. set aside for a specific purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  American Heritage Dictionary 712 (4th ed. 2000).

Section 522(b)(3)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d is therefore properly understood to mean sums of money set aside for the day an individual stops working.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties agree that, in deciding whether a given set of funds falls within this definition, the inquiry must be an objective one, not one that \xe2\x80\x9cturns on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s subjective purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 43\xe2\x80\x9344; see also Brief for Respondents 26.  In other words, to determine whether funds in an account qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds,\xe2\x80\x9d courts should not engage in a case-by-case, fact-intensive examination into whether the debtor actually planned to use the funds for retirement purposes as opposed to current consumption.  Instead, we look to the legal characteristics of the account in which the funds are held, asking whether, as an objective matter, the account is one set aside for the day when an individual stops working.  Cf. Rousey, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 332 (holding that traditional IRAs are included within \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption for \xe2\x80\x9ca payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. age\xe2\x80\x9d based on the legal characteristics of traditional IRAs).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Three legal characteristics of inherited IRAs lead us to conclude that funds held in such accounts are not objectively set aside for the purpose of retirement.  First, the holder of an inherited IRA may never invest additional money in the account.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7219(d)(4).  Inherited IRAs are thus unlike traditional and Roth IRAs, both of which are quintessential \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  For where inherited IRAs categorically prohibit contributions, the entire purpose of traditional and Roth IRAs is to provide tax incentives for accountholders to contribute regularly and over time to their retirement savings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, holders of inherited IRAs are required to withdraw money from such accounts, no matter how many years they may be from retirement.  Under the Tax Code, the beneficiary of an inherited IRA must either withdraw all of the funds in the IRA within five years after the year of the owner\xe2\x80\x99s death or take minimum annual distributions every year.  See \xc2\xa7408(a)(6); \xc2\xa7401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.408\xe2\x80\x938 (Q\xe2\x80\x931 and A\xe2\x80\x931(a) incorporating \xc2\xa71.401(a)(9)\xe2\x80\x933 (Q\xe2\x80\x931 and A\xe2\x80\x931(a))).  Here, for example, petitioners elected to take yearly distributions from the inherited IRA; as a result, the account decreased in value from roughly $450,000 to less than $300,000 within 10 years.  That the tax rules governing inherited IRAs routinely lead to their diminution over time, regardless of their holders\xe2\x80\x99 proxim-ity to retirement, is hardly a feature one would expect of an account set aside for retirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, the holder of an inherited IRA may withdraw the entire balance of the account at any time\xe2\x80\x94and for any purpose\xe2\x80\x94without penalty.  Whereas a withdrawal from a traditional or Roth IRA prior to the age of 59\xc2\xbd triggers a 10 percent tax penalty subject to narrow exceptions, see n.\xc2\xa04, infra\xe2\x80\x94a rule that encourages individuals to leave such funds untouched until retirement age\xe2\x80\x94there is no similar limit on the holder of an inherited IRA.  Funds held in inherited IRAs accordingly constitute \xe2\x80\x9ca pot of money that can be freely used for current consumption,\xe2\x80\x9d 714 F.\xc2\xa03d., at 561, not funds objectively set aside for one\xe2\x80\x99s retirement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our reading of the text is consistent with the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s exemption provisions.  As a general matter, those provisions effectuate a careful balance between the interests of creditors and debtors.  On the one hand, we have noted that \xe2\x80\x9cevery asset the Code permits a debtor to withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schwab v. Reilly,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 770,\n791 (2010)\n.  On the other hand, exemptions servethe important purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[ing] the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s essential needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Security Industrial Bank,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70,\n83 (1982)\n (Blackmun, J., concurring injudgment).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Allowing debtors to protect funds held in traditional and Roth IRAs comports with this purpose by helping to ensure that debtors will be able to meet their basic needs during their retirement years.  At the same time, the legal limitations on traditional and Roth IRAs ensure that debtors who hold such accounts (but who have not yet reached retirement age) do not enjoy a cash windfall by virtue of the exemption\xe2\x80\x94such debtors are instead required to wait until age 59\xc2\xbd before they may withdraw the funds penalty-free.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The same cannot be said of an inherited IRA.  For if an individual is allowed to exempt an inherited IRA from her bankruptcy estate, nothing about the inherited IRA\xe2\x80\x99s legal characteristics would prevent (or even discourage) the individual from using the entire balance of the account on a vacation home or sports car immediately after her bankruptcy proceedings are complete.  Allowing that kind of exemption would convert the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s purposes of preserving debtors\xe2\x80\x99 ability to meet their basic needs and ensuring that they have a \xe2\x80\x9cfresh start,\xe2\x80\x9d Rousey, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 325, into a \xe2\x80\x9cfree pass,\xe2\x80\x9d Schwab, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 791.  We decline to read the retirement funds provision in that manner.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 counterarguments are not without force, they do not overcome the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 primary argument is that funds in an inherited IRA are retirement funds because\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether they currently sit in an account bearing the legal characteristics of a fund set aside for retirement\xe2\x80\x94they did so at an earlier moment in time.  After all, petitioners point out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe initial owner\xe2\x80\x9d of the account \xe2\x80\x9cset aside the funds in question for retirement by depositing them in a\xe2\x80\x9d traditional or Roth IRA.  Brief for Petitioners 21.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [initial] owner\xe2\x80\x99s death does not in any way affect the funds in the account.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We disagree.  In ordinary usage, to speak of a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d implies that the funds are currently in an account set aside for retirement, not that they were set aside for that purpose at some prior date by an entirely different person.  Under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contrary logic, if an individual withdraws money from a traditional IRA and gives it to a friend who then deposits it into a checking account, that money should be forever deemed \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d because it was originally set aside for retirement.  That is plainly incorrect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        More fundamentally, the backward-looking inquiry urged by petitioners would render a substantial portion of\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s text superfluous.  The funds contained in every individual-held account exempt from taxation under the Tax Code provisions enumerated in \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C) have been, at some point in time, \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  So on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view, rather than defining the exemption to cover \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds to the extent that those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under [the enumerated sections] of the Internal Revenue Code,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress could have achieved the exact same result through a provision covering any \xe2\x80\x9cfund or account that is exempt from taxation under [the enumerated sections].\xe2\x80\x9d  In other words, \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C) requires that funds satisfy not one but two conditions in order to be exempt: the funds must be \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds,\xe2\x80\x9d and they must be held in a covered account.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading would write out of the statute the first element.  It therefore flouts the rule that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Corley v. United States,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303,\n314 (2009)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners respond that many of \xc2\xa7522\xe2\x80\x99s other exemptions refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest\xe2\x80\x9d in various kinds of property.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa7522(d)(2) (exempting \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest, not to exceed [$3,675] in value, in one motor vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 522(b)(3)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s retirement funds exemption, by contrast, includes no such reference.  As a result, petitioners surmise, Congress must have meant the provision to cover funds that were at one time retirement accounts, even if they were for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s retirement.  Brief for Petitioners 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  But Congress used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest\xe2\x80\x9d in the other exemptions in a different manner\xe2\x80\x94not to distinguish between a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and the assets of another person but to set a limit on the value of the particular asset that a debtor may exempt.  For example, the statute allows a debtor to protect \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he debtor\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate interest, not to exceed [$1,550] in value, in jewelry.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7522(d)(4).  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he debtor\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate interest\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision is just a means of introducing the $1,550 limit; it is not a means of preventing debtors from exempting other persons\xe2\x80\x99 jewelry from their own bankruptcy proceedings (an interpretation that would serve little apparent purpose).  And Congress had noneed to use the same \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest\xe2\x80\x9d formulation in \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C) for the simple reason that it imposed a value limitation on the amount of exemptible retirement funds in a separate provision, \xc2\xa7522(n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners next contend that even if their interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98retirement funds\xe2\x80\x99 does not independently exclude anything from the scope of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d that poses no problem because Congress actually intended that result.  Reply Brief 5\xe2\x80\x936.  In particular, petitioners suggest that when a sentence is structured as \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C) is\xe2\x80\x94starting with a broad category (\xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d), then winnowing it down through limiting language (\xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that\xe2\x80\x9d the funds are held in a particular type of account)\xe2\x80\x94it is often the case that the broad category does no independent limiting work.  As counsel for petitioners noted at oral argument, if a tax were to apply to \xe2\x80\x9csports teams to the extent that they are members of the major professional sports leagues,\xe2\x80\x9d the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csports teams\xe2\x80\x9d would not provide any additional limitation on the covered entities.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There are two problems with this argument.  First, while it is possible to conceive of sentences that use \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that\xe2\x80\x9d construction in a manner where the initial broad category serves no exclusionary purpose, that is not the only way in which the phrase may be used.  For example, a tax break that applies to \xe2\x80\x9cnonprofit organizations to the extent that they are medical or scientific\xe2\x80\x9d would not apply to a for-profit pharmaceutical company because the initial broad category (\xe2\x80\x9cnonprofit organizations\xe2\x80\x9d) provides its own limitation.  Just so here; in order to qualify for bankruptcy protection under \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(C), funds must be both \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d and in an account exempt from taxation under one of the enumerated Tax Code sections.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, to accept petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument would reintroduce the surplusage problem already discussed.  Supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  And although petitioners are correct that \xe2\x80\x9cthe only effect of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xe2\x80\x98retirement funds\xe2\x80\x99 would seemingly be to deny bankruptcy exemption to inherited IRAs,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 2, as between one interpretation that would render statutory text superfluous and another that would render it meaningful yet limited, we think the latter more faithful to the statute Congress wrote.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, petitioners argue that even under the inquiry we have described, funds in inherited IRAs should still qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d because the holder of such an account can leave much of its value intact until her retirement if she invests wisely and chooses to take only the minimum annual distributions required by law.  See Brief for Petitioners 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  But the possibility that some investors may use their inherited IRAs for retirement purposes does not mean that inherited IRAs bear the defining legal characteristics of retirement funds.  Were it any other way, money in an ordinary checking account (or, for that matter, an envelope of $20 bills) would also amount to \xe2\x80\x9cretirement funds\xe2\x80\x9d because it is possible for an owner to use those funds for retirement.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit isaffirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa7522, debtors may elect to claim exemptions either under federal law, see \xc2\xa7522(b)(2), or state law, see \xc2\xa7522(b)(3).
