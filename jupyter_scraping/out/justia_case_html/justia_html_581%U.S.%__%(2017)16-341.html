In 1897, Congress enacted a patent specific venue statute.  This new statute (\xc2\xa71400(b)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor) permitted suit in the district of which the defendant was an \xe2\x80\x9cinhabitant\xe2\x80\x9d or in which the defendant both maintained a \xe2\x80\x9cregular and established place of business\xe2\x80\x9d and committed an act of infringement.\n\n29Stat.\n695.

This Court addressed the scope of \xc2\xa71400(b)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in <i>Stonite, </i>concluding that it constituted \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d and thus was not supplemented or modified by the general venue provisions.  315 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 563.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">In 1948, Congress recodified the patent venue statute as \xc2\xa71400(b).  That provision, which remains unaltered today, uses \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cinhabit[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  At the same time, Congress also enacted the general venue statute, \xc2\xa71391, which defined \xe2\x80\x9cresidence\xe2\x80\x9d for corporate defendants.  In <i>Fourco</i>, this Court reaffirmed <i>Stonite</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, observing that Congress enacted \xc2\xa71400(b) as a standalone venue statute and that nothing in the 1948 recodification evidenced an intent to alter that status, even the fact that \xc2\xa71391(c) by \xe2\x80\x9cits terms\xe2\x80\x9d embraced \xe2\x80\x9call actions,\xe2\x80\x9d 353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228.  The Court also concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d in the recodified version bore the same meaning as \xe2\x80\x9cinhabit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the pre-1948 version.  See <i>id.</i>, at 226. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This landscape remained effectively unchanged until 1988, when Congress amended the general venue statute, \xc2\xa71391(c).  The revised provision stated that it applied \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>VE Holding Corp.</i> v. <i>Johnson Gas Appliance Co.</i>, 917 F.\xc2\xa02d 1574, 1578, the Federal Circuit held that, in light of this amendment, \xc2\xa71391(c) established the definition for all other venue statutes under the same \xe2\x80\x9cchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xc2\xa71400(b).  In 2011, Congress adopted the current version of \xc2\xa71391, which provides that its general definition applies \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or all venue purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federal Circuit reaffirmed <i>VE Holding</i> in the case below<i>.  </i>Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x937.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0In <i>Fourco</i>, this Court definitively and unambiguously held that the word \xe2\x80\x9creside[nce]\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71400(b), as applied to domestic corporations, refers only to the State of incorporation.  Because Congress has not amended \xc2\xa71400(b) since <i>Fourco</i>, and neither party asks the Court to reconsider that decision, the only question here is whether Congress changed \xc2\xa71400(b)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning when it amended \xc2\xa71391.  When Congress intends to effect a change of that kind, it ordinarily provides a relatively clear indication of its intent in the amended provision\xe2\x80\x99s text.  No such indication appears in the current version of \xc2\xa71391.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Respondent points out that the current \xc2\xa71391(c) provides a default rule that, on its face, applies without exception \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or all venue purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the version at issue in <i>Fourco </i>similarly provided a default rule that applied \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for venue purposes,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 223, and those phrasings are not materially different in this context.  The addition of the word \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d to the already comprehensive provision does not suggest that Congress intended the Court to reconsider its decision in <i>Fourco</i>.  Any argument based on this language is even weaker now than it was when the Court rejected it in <i>Fourco</i>.  <i>Fourco </i>held that \xc2\xa71400(b) retained a meaning distinct from the default definition contained in \xc2\xa71391(c), even though the latter, by its terms, included no exceptions.  The current version of \xc2\xa71391 includes a saving clause, which expressly states that the provision does not apply when \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided by law,\xe2\x80\x9d thus making explicit the qualification that the <i>Fourco </i>Court found implicit in the statute.  Finally, there is no indication that Congress in 2011 ratified the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>VE Holding</i>.

The patent venue statute,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71400(b), provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>Fourco Glass Co.</i> v. <i>Transmirra Products Corp.</i>,\n\n353 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222,\n226 (1957)\n, this Court concluded that for purposes of \xc2\xa71400(b) a domestic corporation \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d only in its State of incorporation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In reaching that conclusion, the Court<i> </i>rejected the argument that \xc2\xa71400(b) incorporates the broader definition of corporate \xe2\x80\x9cresidence\xe2\x80\x9d contained in the general venue statute,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391(c).  353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228.  Congress has not amended \xc2\xa71400(b) since this Court construed it in <i>Fourco</i>, but it has amended \xc2\xa71391 twice.  Section 1391 now provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or all venue purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d a corporation \xe2\x80\x9cshall be deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court\xe2\x80\x99s personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71391(a), (c).  The issue in this case is whether that definition supplants the definition announced in <i>Fourco </i>and allows a plaintiff to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against a corporation in any district in which the corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction.  We conclude that the amendments to \xc2\xa71391 did not modify the meaning of \xc2\xa71400(b) as interpreted by <i>Fourco</i>.  We therefore hold that a domestic corporation \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d only in its State of incorporation for purposes of the patent venue statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner, which is organized under Indiana law and headquartered in Indiana, manufactures flavored drink mixes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Respondent, which is organized under Delaware law and has its principal place of business in Illinois, is a competitor in the same market.  As relevant here, respondent sued petitioner in the District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s products infringed one of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s patents.  Although petitioner is not registered to conduct business in Delaware and has no meaningful local presence there, it does ship the al-legedly infringing products into the State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner moved to dismiss the case or transfer venue to the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, arguing that venue was improper in Delaware.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71406.  Citing <i>Fourco</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a corporation resides only in its State of incorporation for patent infringement suits, petitioner argued that it did not \xe2\x80\x9cresid[e]\xe2\x80\x9d in Delaware under the first clause of \xc2\xa71400(b).  It further argued that it had no \xe2\x80\x9cregular and established place of business\xe2\x80\x9d in Delaware under the second clause of \xc2\xa71400(b).  Relying on Circuit precedent, the District Court rejected these arguments, 2015 WL 5613160 (D Del., Sept. 24, 2015), and the Federal Circuit denied a petition for a writ of mandamus,<i> In\xc2\xa0re TC Heartland LLC</i>, 821 F.\xc2\xa03d 1338 (2016).  The Federal Circuit concluded that subsequent statutory amendments had effectively amended \xc2\xa71400(b) as construed in <i>Fourco</i>, with the result that \xc2\xa71391(c) now supplies the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71400(b).  821 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1341\xe2\x80\x931343.  Under this logic, because the District of Delaware could exercise personal jurisdiction over petitioner, petitioner resided in Delaware under \xc2\xa71391(c) and, therefore, under \xc2\xa71400(b).

The Judiciary Act of 1789 permitted a plaintiff to file suit in a federal district court if the defendant was \xe2\x80\x9can inhabitant\xe2\x80\x9d of that district or could be \xe2\x80\x9cfound\xe2\x80\x9d for service of process in that district.  Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \xc2\xa711,\n\n1Stat.\n79.  The Act covered patent cases as well as other civil suits. <i> Stonite Products Co.</i> v. <i>Melvin Lloyd Co.</i>,\n\n315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,\n563 (1942)\n.  In 1887, Congress amended the statute to permit suit only in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant or, in diversity cases, of which either the plaintiff or defendant was an inhabitant.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1887, \xc2\xa71, 24 Stat. 552; see also <i>Stonite</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 563\xe2\x80\x93564.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>In</i> <i>re Hohorst</i>,\n\n150 U.\xc2\xa0S. 653\n\xe2\x80\x93662 (1893), arguably suggested that the 1887 Act did not apply to patent cases.  As a result, while some courts continued to apply the Act to patent cases, others refused to do so and instead permitted plaintiffs to bring suit (in line with the pre-1887 regime) anywhere a defendant could be found for service of process.  See <i>Stonite</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 564\xe2\x80\x93565.  In 1897, Congress resolved the confusion by enacting a patent specific venue statute.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 395,\n\n29Stat.\n695.  In so doing, it \xe2\x80\x9cplaced pat-ent infringement cases in a class by themselves, outside the scope of general venue legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. </i>v. <i>Kockum Industries, Inc.</i>,\n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 706,\n713 (1972)\n.

At the time, a corporation was understood to \xe2\x80\x9cinhabit\xe2\x80\x9d <i>only</i> the State in which it was incorporated.  <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Quincy Mining Co.</i>,\n\n145 U.\xc2\xa0S. 444\n\xe2\x80\x93450 (1892).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court addressed the scope of \xc2\xa71400(b)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in <i>Stonite</i>.  In that case, the two defendants inhabited different districts within a single State.  The plaintiff sought to sue them both in the same district, invoking a then governing general venue statute that, if applicable, permitted it to do so.  315 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 562\xe2\x80\x93563.  This Court rejected the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s venue choice on the ground that the patent venue statute constituted \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d and thus was not supplemented or modified by the general venue provisions.  <i>Id.,</i> at 563.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the patent venue statute \xe2\x80\x9cwas adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights,\xe2\x80\x9d a purpose that would be undermined by interpreting it \xe2\x80\x9cto dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 565\xe2\x80\x93566.

See Act of June 25, 1948,\n\n62Stat.\n936.  The recodified provision, which remains unaltered today, states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71400(b) (1952 ed.).

That provision stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] corporation may be sued in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business, and such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71391(c) (1952 ed.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Following the 1948 legislation, courts reached differing conclusions regarding whether \xc2\xa71400(b)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d incorporated \xc2\xa71391(c)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cresidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Fourco</i>, 353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 224, n.\xc2\xa03 (listing cases).  In <i>Fourco</i>, this Court reviewed a decision of the Second Circuitholding that \xc2\xa71391(c) defined residence for purposes of \xc2\xa71400(b), \xe2\x80\x9cjust as that definition is properly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. incorporated into other sections of the venue chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trans-mirra Prods. Corp. </i>v. <i>Fourco Glass Co.</i>, 233 F.\xc2\xa02d 885, 886 (1956).  This Court squarely rejected that interpretation, reaffirming <i>Stonite</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that \xc2\xa71400(b) \xe2\x80\x9cis the sole and exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement actions, and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not to be supplemented by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xc2\xa71391(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 229.  The Court observed that Congress enacted \xc2\xa71400(b) as a standalone venue statute and that nothing in the 1948 recodification evidenced an intent to alter that status.  The fact that \xc2\xa71391(c) by \xe2\x80\x9cits terms\xe2\x80\x9d embraced \xe2\x80\x9call actions\xe2\x80\x9d was not enough to overcome the fundamental point that Congress designed \xc2\xa71400(b) to be \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete, independent and alone controlling in its sphere.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 228.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d in the recodified version of \xc2\xa71400(b) bore the same meaning as \xe2\x80\x9cinhabit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the pre-1948 version.

The substitution of \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cinhabit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d thus did not suggest any alteration in the venue rules for corporations in patent cases.  Accordingly, \xc2\xa71400(b) continued to apply to domestic corporations in the same way it always had: They were subject to venue only in their States of incorporation.  See <i>ibid. </i>(The use of \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnegat[es] any intention to make corporations suable, in patent infringement cases, where they are merely \xe2\x80\x98doing business,\xe2\x80\x99 because those synonymous words [\xe2\x80\x9cinhabitant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cresident\xe2\x80\x9d] mean <i>domicile</i> and, in respect of corporations, mean the state of incorporation only\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This landscape remained effectively unchanged until 1988, when Congress amended the general venue statute, \xc2\xa71391(c), to provide that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter, a defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced.\xe2\x80\x9d  Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act, \xc2\xa71013(a),\n\n102Stat.\n4669.  The Federal Circuit in <i>VE Holding Corp.</i> v. <i>Johnson Gas Appliance Co.</i>, 917 F.\xc2\xa02d 1574 (1990), announced its view of the effect of this amendment on the meaning of the patent venue statute.  The court reasoned that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cexact and classic language of incorporation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 1579, and that \xc2\xa71391(c) accord-ingly established the definition for all other venue statutes under the same \xe2\x80\x9cchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1580.  Because \xc2\xa71400(b) fell within the relevant chapter, the Federal Circuit concluded that \xc2\xa71391(c), \xe2\x80\x9con its face,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cclearly applies to \xc2\xa71400(b), and thus redefines the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x98resides\xe2\x80\x99 in that section.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1578.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Following <i>VE Holding</i>, no new developments occurred until Congress adopted the current version of \xc2\xa71391 in 2011 (again leaving \xc2\xa71400(b) unaltered).  See Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011, \xc2\xa7202,\n\n125Stat.\n763.  Section 1391(a) now provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthis section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa71391(c)(2), in turn, provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or all venue purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d certain entities, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court\xe2\x80\x99s personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  In its decision below, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed <i>VE Holding</i>, reasoning that the 2011 amendments provided no basis to reconsider its prior decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We reverse the Federal Circuit.  In <i>Fourco</i>, this Court definitively and unambiguously held that the word \xe2\x80\x9creside[nce]\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71400(b) has a particular meaning as applied to domestic[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] corporations: It refers only to the State of incorporation.  Congress has not amended \xc2\xa71400(b) since <i>Fourco</i>, and neither party asks us to reconsider our holding in that case.  Accordingly, the only question we must answer is whether Congress changed the meaning of \xc2\xa71400(b) when it amended \xc2\xa71391.  When Congress intends to effect a change of that kind, it ordinarily provides a relatively clear indication of its intent in the text of the amended provision.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Madigan</i>,\n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500,\n506 (1937)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he modification by implication of the settled construction of an earlier and different section is not favored\xe2\x80\x9d); A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 331 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cA clear, authoritative judicial holding on the meaning of a particular provision should not be cast in doubt and subjected to challenge whenever a related though not utterly inconsistent provision is adopted in the same statute or even in an affiliated statute\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The current version of \xc2\xa71391 does not contain any indication that Congress intended to alter the meaning of \xc2\xa71400(b) as interpreted in <i>Fourco</i>.  Although the current version of \xc2\xa71391(c) provides a default rule that applies \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or all venue purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d the version at issue in <i>Fourco </i>similarly provided a default rule that applied \xe2\x80\x9cfor venue purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this context, we do not see any material difference between the two phrasings.  See <i>Pure Oil Co. </i>v. <i>Suarez</i>,\n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 202\n\xe2\x80\x93205 (1966) (construing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for venue purposes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to cover \xe2\x80\x9call venue statutes\xe2\x80\x9d).  Respondent argues that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all venue purposes\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98all venue purposes\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94not \xe2\x80\x98all venue purposes <i>except</i> for patentvenue.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 21.  The plaintiffs in <i>Fourco </i>advanced the same argument.  See 353 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe main thrust of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument is that \xc2\xa71391(c) is clear and unambiguous and that its terms include all actions\xe2\x80\x94including patent infringement actions\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court was not persuaded then, and the addition of the word \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d to the already comprehensive provision does not suggest that Congress intended for us to reconsider that conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This particular argument is even weaker under the current version of \xc2\xa71391 than it was under the provision in place at the time of <i>Fourco</i>, because the current provision includes a saving clause expressly stating that it does not apply when \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  On its face, the version of \xc2\xa71391(c) at issue in <i>Fourco</i> included no exceptions, yet this Court still held that \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71400(b) retained its original meaning contrary to \xc2\xa71391(c)\xe2\x80\x99s default definition.  <i>Fourco</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding rests on even firmer footing now that \xc2\xa71391\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause expressly contemplates that certain venue statutes may retain definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d that conflict with its default definition.  In short, the saving clause makes explicit the qualification that this Court previously found implicit in the statute.  See <i>Pure Oil</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 205 (interpreting earlier version of \xc2\xa71391 to apply \xe2\x80\x9cto all venue statutes using residence as a criterion, at least in the absence of contrary restrictive indications in any such statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  Respondent suggests that the saving clause in \xc2\xa71391(a) does not apply to the definitional provisions in \xc2\xa71391(c), Brief for Respondent 31\xe2\x80\x9332, but that interpretation is belied by the text of \xc2\xa71391(a), which makes clear that the saving clause applies to the entire \xe2\x80\x9csection.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa71391(a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cExcept as otherwise provided by law\xe2\x80\x94 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. this <i>section </i>shall govern the venue of all civil actions\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, there is no indication that Congress in 2011 ratified the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>VE Holding</i>.  If anything, the 2011 amendments undermine that decision\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.  As petitioner points out, <i>VE Holding </i>relied heavily\xe2\x80\x94indeed, almost exclusively\xe2\x80\x94on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision in 1988 to replace \xe2\x80\x9cfor venue purposes\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of venue <i>under this chapter</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) in \xc2\xa71391(c).  Congress deleted \xe2\x80\x9cunder this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d in 2011 and worded the current version of \xc2\xa71391(c) almost identically to the original version of the statute.  Compare \xc2\xa71391(c) (2012 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[f]or all venue purposes\xe2\x80\x9d) with \xc2\xa71391(c) (1952 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cfor venue purposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, nothing in the text suggests congressional approval of <i>VE Holding</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As applied to domestic corporations, \xe2\x80\x9creside[nce]\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71400(b) refers only to the State of incorporation.
