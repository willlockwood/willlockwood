When Hana Financial sued Hana Bank for trademark infringement, Hana Bank invoked in defense the tacking doctrine, under which lower courts have provided that a trademark user may make certain modifications to its mark over time while, in limited circumstances, retaining its priority position.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim was tried before a jury, and the District Court adopted in substantial part the jury instruction on tacking proposed by petitioner.  The jury returned a verdict in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s favor.

First, it may be true that the \xe2\x80\x9clegal equivalents\xe2\x80\x9d test involves a legal standard, but such \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mixed question[s] of law and fact,\xe2\x80\x99 [have] typi-cally been resolved by juries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gaudin</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 512.  And any concern that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard can be remedied by crafting careful jury instructions.  Second, petitioner offers no support for its claim that tacking determinations create new law in a unique way that requires those determinations to be reserved for judges.  Third, petitioner worries that the predictability required for a functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking questions are assigned to juries, but offers no reason why trademark tacking should be treated differently from the tort, contract, and criminal justice systems, where juries answer often-dispositive factual questions or make dispositive applications of legal standards to facts.  Finally, in arguing that judges have historically resolved tacking disputes, petitioner points to cases arising in the contexts of bench trials, summary judgment, and the like, in which it is undisputed that judges may resolve tacking disputes.

The party who first uses a mark in commerce is said to have priority over other users.  Recognizing that trademark users ought to be permitted to make certain modifications to their marks over time without losing priority, lower courts have provided that, in limited circumstances, a party may clothe a new mark with the priority position of an older mark.  This doctrine is called \xe2\x80\x9ctacking,\xe2\x80\x9d and lower courts have found tacking to be available when the original and revised marks are \xe2\x80\x9clegal equivalents\xe2\x80\x9d in that they create the same, continuing commercial impression.  The question presented here is whether a judge or a jury should determine whether tacking is available in a given case.  Because the tacking inquiry operates from the perspective of an ordinary purchaser or consumer, we hold that a jury should make this determination.</p><p>I</p><p>                    Petitioner, Hana Financial, and respondent Hana Bank, a subsidiary of respondent Hana Financial Group, both provide financial services to individuals in the United States.  Hana Bank (hereinafter respondent) was established in 1971 as a Korean entity called Korea Investment Finance Corporation.  In 1991, that entity changed its name to \xe2\x80\x9cHana Bank\xe2\x80\x9d and began using this name in Korea.  In 1994, it established a service called Hana Overseas Korean Club to provide financial services to Korean expatriates, and specifically advertised that service in the United States.  Those advertisements used the name \xe2\x80\x9cHana Overseas Korean Club\xe2\x80\x9d in both English and Korean, and included the name \xe2\x80\x9cHana Bank\xe2\x80\x9d in Korean and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdancing man\xe2\x80\x9d logo.  See App. 206.  In 2000, respondent changed the name of the Hana Overseas Ko-rean Club to \xe2\x80\x9cHana World Center.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 2002, respondent began operating a bank in the United States under the name \xe2\x80\x9cHana Bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  This enterprise amounted to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s first physical presence in the United States.</p><p>                    Petitioner was established in 1994 as a California corporation called Hana Financial.  It began using that name and an associated trademark in commerce in 1995.  In 1996, it obtained a federal trademark registration for a pyramid logo with the name \xe2\x80\x9cHana Financial\xe2\x80\x9d for use in connection with financial services.</p><p>                    In 2007, petitioner sued respondent, alleging infringement of its \xe2\x80\x9cHana Financial\xe2\x80\x9d mark.  As relevant here, respondent denied infringement by invoking the tacking doctrine and claiming that it had priority.  The District Court initially granted summary judgment to respondent on the infringement claim, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there were genuine issues of material fact as to priority.  On remand, the infringement claim was tried before a jury.  The District Court adopted in substantial part the jury instruction proposed by petitioner, and, without objection from petitioner, instructed the jury as follows:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cA party may claim priority in a mark based on the first use date of a similar but technically distinct mark where the previously used mark is the legal equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguish-able therefrom such that consumers consider both as the same mark.  This is called \xe2\x80\x98tacking.\xe2\x80\x99  The marks must create the same, continuing commercial impression, and the later mark should not materially differ from or alter the character of the mark attemptedto be tacked.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 173; see <i>id.,</i> at 140 (proposedinstruction).</p><p>The jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, and the District Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p><p>                    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The court explained that, although tacking applies only in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptionally narrow circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d 735 F.\xc2\xa03d 1158, 1160 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98requires a highly fact-sensitive inquiry\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9creserved for the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>One Industries, LLC</i> v. <i>Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Neal Distributing, Inc.</i>, 578 F.\xc2\xa03d 1154, 1160 (CA9 2009)).

Indeed, we have long recognized across a variety of doctrinal contexts that, when the relevant question is how an ordinary person or community would make an assessment, the jury is generally the decisionmaker that ought to provide the fact-intensive answer.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Gaudin</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506,512 (1995) (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98delicate assessments of the inferences a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable [decisionmaker]\xe2\x80\x99 would draw . . .

If the facts warrant it, a judge may decide a tacking question on a motion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50, 56(a).  And if the parties have opted to try their case before a judge, the judge may of course decide a tacking question in his or her factfinding capacity.  We hold only that, when a jury trial has been requested and when the facts do not warrant entry of summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law, the question whether tacking is warranted must be decided by a jury.</p><p>III</p><p>                    Attempting to overcome our conclusion, petitioner offers four reasons why, in its view, tacking is a question of law that should be resolved by a judge.  None persuades us.</p><p>                    Petitioner first observes that the \xe2\x80\x9clegal equivalents\xe2\x80\x9d test involves the application of a legal standard.  See Brief for Petitioner 20.  True enough, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe application-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question . . . , commonly called a \xe2\x80\x98mixed question of law and fact,\xe2\x80\x99 has typically been resolved by juries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gaudin</i>, 515 U. S., at 512; see <i>id.</i>, at 514 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he jury\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibility is not merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and draw the ultimate conclusion . . .\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Fenton</i>,474 U. S. 104,113 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate . . . question\xe2\x80\x9d).  The \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d analysis that takes place during the tacking inquiry is no different.  And insofar as petitioner is concerned that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard, the solution is to craft careful jury instructions that make that standard clear.  Here, however, petitioner can hardly criticize the instruction the District Court gave the jury, as it was essentially the instruction petitioner proposed.</p><p>                    Second, petitioner argues that tacking determinations will \xe2\x80\x9ccreate new law that will guide future tacking disputes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a task reserved for judges.  Brief for Petitioner 21.  It is not at all clear, however, why a tacking determination in a particular case will \xe2\x80\x9ccreate new law\xe2\x80\x9d any more than will a jury verdict in a tort case, a contract dispute,<b> </b>or a criminal proceeding.  Petitioner insists that tacking questions \xe2\x80\x9chave to be\xe2\x80\x9d resolved by comparing two marks in a given case \xe2\x80\x9cagainst those addressed in other tacking cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 22, but we do not agree.  Of course, in deciding summary judgment motions, or in making rulings in bench trials, judges may look to past cases holding that trademark owners either were or were not entitled to tacking as a matter of law.  But petitioner offers no support for the claim that tacking cases \xe2\x80\x9chave to be\xe2\x80\x9d resolved by reliance on precedent.  Indeed, in many of the cases petitioner cites in support of this argument, the courts in question relied on precedent only to define the relevant legal standard.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Specht </i>v. <i>Google Inc.</i>, 758 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 570, 583\xe2\x80\x93585 (ND Ill. 2010), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 747 F.\xc2\xa03d 929 (CA7 2014); <i>Children\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Servs. PLLC </i>v. <i>Kresch</i>, 2008 WL 1901245, *1\xe2\x80\x93*2 (ED Mich., Apr. 25, 2008), aff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99d <i>sub\xc2\xa0nom. Children\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Servs., P. L. L. C. </i>v. <i>Saiontz, Kirk &amp; Miles, P. A.</i>, 2009 WL 1868809 (CA6, June 18, 2009).[<a href="#F2">2</a>] </p><p>                    Third, and related, petitioner worries that the predict-ability required for a functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking questions are assigned to juries.  See Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  But, again, the same could be said about the tort, contract, and criminal justice systems: In all of these areas, juries answer often-dispositive fac-tual questions or make dispositive applications of legal standards to facts.  The fact that another jury, hearing the same case, might reach a different conclusion may make the system \xe2\x80\x9cunpredictable,\xe2\x80\x9d but it has never stopped us from employing juries in these analogous contexts.  Petitioner has offered no reason why trademark tacking ought to be treated differently.  Moreover, decisionmaking in fact-intensive disputes necessarily requires judgment calls.  Regardless of whether those judgment calls are made by juries or judges, they necessarily involve some degree of uncertainty, particularly when they have to do with how reasonable persons would behave.</p><p>                    Finally, petitioner argues that, as a historical matter, judges have resolved tacking disputes.  See Brief for Petitioner 30\xe2\x80\x9335.  But petitioner relies on cases in which judges have resolved tacking disputes in bench trials, at summary judgment, or the like.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Drexel Enterprises, Inc. </i>v. <i>Richardson</i>, 312 F.\xc2\xa02d 525, 526 (CA10 1962) (\xe2\x80\x9c[This action] was tried without a jury\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Perfectform Corp.</i> v. <i>Perfect Brassiere Co.</i>, 256 F.\xc2\xa02d 736, 738 (CA3 1958) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district court dismissed the complaint\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> John Morrell &amp; Co. </i>v. <i>Hauser Packing Co.</i>,<i> </i>20 F.\xc2\xa02d 713 (CA9 1927) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the court below, there was a dismissal of both the bill and of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Beech-Nut Packing Co.</i> v. <i>P. Lorillard Co.</i>, 299 F. 834, 835 (NJ 1924) (equitable claims tried solely before a judge).  As we have noted, it is undisputed that judges may resolve tacking disputes in those contexts.  But recognizing as much does not gainsay our conclusion that, when a jury is to be empaneled and when the facts warrant neither summary judgment nor judgment as a matter of law, tacking is a question for the jury.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    The Ninth Circuit correctly held that whether two marks may be tacked for purposes of determining priority is a question for the jury.
