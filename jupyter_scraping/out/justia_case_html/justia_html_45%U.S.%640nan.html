Trusting to this, and fully believing that said transcript would be duly sent up by the clerk to the Supreme Court, this affiant applied to Daniel W. Dickenson, a member of Congress, and amply solvent, to become his surety for the costs of the Supreme Court, which he promised to do.  The said Dickenson was taken sick, and, as he informed affiant, had written to Joseph H. Peyton and Mr. Rayner, members of Congress, to become the sureties for costs.  Affiant has been informed this day for the first time, by his counsel in the circuit court, that the transcript of said record had not been forwarded by the clerk as aforesaid.  Affiant sends the same accompanying this affidavit, and prays that said record be filed and the case docketed, and if said suit be dismissed, that the same be set aside, the record filed, and the case docketed."</p>\n<p>"WILL.

The cause of the failure to file is accounted for and explained in the affidavit now submitted to the Court.

It did not appear that all reasonable exertion had been used by the party.  The judgment appealed from was given in May, 1840, and the case was not docketed and dismissed until February, 1845.  In the meantime, the plaintiff in error appears to have relied upon the clerk of the court below to send the record up.  The effort to obtain security for costs was very faint.  If such reasons are allowed to be sufficient to reinstate a case after dismissal under the rule, the rule itself may as well be abolished.  Certainly, a court which passes a rule has power to relax it, whenever a proper occasion shall offer.  But this motion does not apply to a case which has been dismissed.  It is not to reinstate that case, but it is to call forth the power of the court in another case, upon another writ of error.  The act of Congress divides appeals into two classes, giving to them very different rights.  Where the party is diligent and prosecutes his writ of error without delay, the law gives a supersedeas.  But if he is dilatory, the law is reluctant to deprive him of the benefit of an appeal, but subjects him to the risk of an execution.  Thus the rights of creditor and debtor are both protected.  But in order to prevent a vexatious and lingering suit and to supply an omission in the act, a rule of court compels the appellant to prosecute his suit under the penalty of dismissal by an application from the appellee.  The appellant has his choice either to prosecute his appeal with or without the benefit of a supersedeas, and the act of Congress has made a clear distinction between these two modes.  But the present motion is to take a case out of one of these classes and put it in the other.</p>\n<p>The case of <em>Stockton v.

Whereupon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 45 U.

Hardeman, defendants, a judgment was rendered by the said circuit court, at the May term, 1839, of said court, in favor of the said plaintiff, and against the said defendants, for the sum of $8,293.45, with interest thereon at the rate of eight percentum per annum, together with costs and charges of suit, on which judgment an execution of <em>fieri facias</em> issued, and was levied by the marshal of said district on certain property of said defendants, which property was left in the hands of the defendants upon their executing a forthcoming bond, with one W. P. Perkins as security, and which forthcoming bond was returned by the said marshal to the said circuit court at the next November term thereof, A.D. 1839, \'Forfeited,\' having thereby, according to the laws of Mississippi, the force and effect of a judgment against the said defendants and the said security for the aforesaid debt, interest, and costs, and upon which last-mentioned judgment an execution of <em>fieri facias</em> was issued against the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the said William Hardeman, D. Hardeman, and W. P. Perkins, for the amount of the said judgment, interest, and costs, as aforesaid, as also for the sum of $133.81 additional costs subsequently accruing; upon which execution, the aforesaid marshal returned that he had received thereon \'$9,125 in Union money, or post notes of the Union Bank,\' which said return of the marshal last aforesaid the said circuit court, at a subsequent term, to-wit, on 20 May, A.D. 1840, set aside, and awarded an alias <em>fieri facias</em> on the judgment last aforesaid.  Whereupon, the said Wm. Hardeman, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="644">Page 45 U. S. 644</a></p><p> D. Hardeman, and W. P. Perkins sued out a writ of error in due form of law and in proper time, and filed their bond in error, with sufficient security approved by one of the judges of the said circuit court, so as to operate <em>per se</em> as a supersedeas, and which said writ of error was abated and quashed by the order of this Court on 28 February, A.D. 1845, by virtue of the forty-third rule of court, in consequence of the failure of the aforesaid plaintiffs in error to file a transcript of the record of the case with the clerk of this Court, and to have their case docketed, in compliance with the rules of court.  Whereupon, the aforesaid plaintiffs in error sued out another writ of error in due form of law, filed their bond in error in a sum double the amount of the aforesaid judgment, with sufficient security approved by one of the judges of the aforesaid circuit court, and a citation having been regularly taken out, served upon the defendant in error, and duly returned, as by the inspection of the transcript of the record of the said circuit court, which was brought into the Supreme Court of the United States by virtue of said writ of error, agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, fully and at large appears.  And whereas, in the present term of December, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty-five, it is made to appear, on affidavit to the said Supreme Court of the United States, that the failure of the aforesaid plaintiffs in error to file the transcript of the record and docket the writ of error first aforesaid mentioned, and which operated <em>per se</em> as a supersedeas, was not owing to any neglect or fault on their part, but wholly attributable to the neglect of the clerk of the said circuit court to make out in due time, and as requested by the said plaintiffs in error, a transcript of the record, as alleged in said affidavit, and that in consequence thereof they are exposed to an execution on the aforesaid judgment.  It is thereupon now here ordered by this Court, that a writ of supersedeas be, and the same is, hereby awarded, to be directed to the aforesaid marshal, commanding and enjoining him and his deputies to stay any and all proceedings upon any execution which may have been issued on the aforesaid judgment of the said circuit court in said case, and which has or may come to his hands, and that he return any such execution with the writ of supersedeas to the said circuit court, and that the judges of the said circuit court cause any such writ of execution to be stayed, and to stay any execution or further proceedings of every kind and character on the judgment of the said circuit court in this case, pending the aforesaid writ of error in this Court."</p>\n<p>"You, therefore, the Marshal of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi, are hereby commanded, that from every and all proceedings on any execution on the aforesaid judgment, or in any wise molesting the said defendants on the account aforesaid, you entirely surcease, as being superseded, and that you </p><p><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 45 U. S. 645</a></p><p> do forthwith return any such execution in your hands, together with this supersedeas, to the said circuit court, as you will answer the contrary at your peril.  And you, the judges of the said circuit court, are hereby commanded to stay any execution which may have issued as aforesaid, and to stay any execution or further proceedings on the aforesaid judgment of the said circuit court in this case, pending the writ of error last aforesaid in this Court."</p>\n<p>"Witness the Honorable ROGER B.
