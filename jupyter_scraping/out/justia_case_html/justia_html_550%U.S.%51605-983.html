Regarding Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s IEP as deficient, the Winkelmans unsuccessfully appealed through IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative review process.  Proceeding without counsel, they then filed a federal-court complaint on their own behalf and on Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  The District Court granted respondent judgment on the pleadings.  The Sixth Circuit entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent appeal unless they obtained an attorney, citing Circuit precedent holding that because the right to a free appropriate public education belongs only to the child, and IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing minor children, IDEA does not allow nonlawyer parents to proceed <em>pro se</em> in federal court.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights, which are not limited to procedural and reimbursement-related matters but encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for their child.

S. 49</a>, 53, in the development of each child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71412(a)(4), 1414(d).  They are IEP team members, \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(B), and their \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfor enhancing [their child\xe2\x80\x99s] education\xe2\x80\x9d must be considered by the team, \xc2\xa71414(d)(3)(A)(ii).  A State must, moreover, give \xe2\x80\x9cany party\xe2\x80\x9d who objects to the adequacy of the education provided, the IEP\xe2\x80\x99s construction, or related matter the opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto present a complaint \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(b)(6), and engage in an administrative review process that culminates in an \xe2\x80\x9cimpartial due process hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(A), before a hearing officer.  \xe2\x80\x9cAny party aggrieved by the [hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s] findings and decision \xe2\x80\xa6 [has] the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A).  A court or hearing officer may require a state agency \xe2\x80\x9cto reimburse the parents \xe2\x80\xa6 for the cost of [private school] enrollment if \xe2\x80\xa6 the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  IDEA also governs when and to what extent a court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, see \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), including an award \xe2\x80\x9cto a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0These various provisions accord parents independent, enforceable rights.  Parents have enforceable rights at the administrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert those rights in federal court at the adjudication stage.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues that parental involvement is contemplated only to the extent parents represent their child\xe2\x80\x99s interests, but this view is foreclosed by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  The grammatical structure of IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of protecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(B), would make no sense unless \xe2\x80\x9crights\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the parents\xe2\x80\x99 rights as well as the child\xe2\x80\x99s.  Other provisions confirm this view.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71415(a).  Even if this Court were inclined to ignore the Act\xe2\x80\x99s plain text and adopt respondent\xe2\x80\x99s countertextual reading, the Court disagrees that sole purpose driving IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication of a child\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  It is not novel for parents to have a recognized legal interest in their child\xe2\x80\x99s education and upbringing.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions also contradict the variation on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that parents can be \xe2\x80\x9cparties aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d for aspects of the hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s findings and decision relating to certain procedures and reimbursements, but not \xe2\x80\x9cparties aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to any challenge not implicating those limited concerns.  The IEP proceedings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their child\xe2\x80\x99s educational program.  The Act also allows expansive challenge by parents of \xe2\x80\x9cany matter\xe2\x80\x9d related to the proceedings and requires that administrative resolution be based on whether the child \xe2\x80\x9creceived a free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(f)(3(E), with judicial review to follow.  The text and structure of IDEA create in parents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs implicated by the process but also in the substantive decision to be made.  Incongruous results would follow, moreover, were the Court to accept the proposition that parents\xe2\x80\x99 IDEA rights are limited to certain nonsubstantive matters.  It is difficult to disentangle the Act\xe2\x80\x99s procedural and reimbursement-related rights from its substantive ones, and attempting to do so would impose upon parties a confusing and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might differentiate between these matters.  This bifurcated regime would also leave some parents without any legal remedy.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondent misplaces its reliance on <em>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 548 U. S. ___, when it contends that because IDEA was passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, it must provide clear notice before it can be interpreted to provide independent rights to parents.  <em>Arlington </em>held that IDEA had not furnished clear notice before requiring States to reimburse experts\xe2\x80\x99 fees to prevailing parties in IDEA actions.  However, this case does not invoke <em>Arlington</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule, for the determination that IDEA gives parents independent, enforceable rights does not impose any substantive condition or obligation on States that they would not otherwise be required by law to observe.  The basic measure of monetary recovery is not expanded by recognizing that some rights repose in both the parent and the child.  Increased costs borne by States defending against suits brought by nonlawyers do not suffice to invoke Spending Clause concerns, particularly in light of provisions in IDEA that empower courts to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to prevailing educational agencies if a parent files an action for an \xe2\x80\x9cimproper purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III).  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit erred in dismissing the Winkelmans\xe2\x80\x99 appeal for lack of counsel.  Because parents enjoy rights under IDEA, they are entitled to prosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf.  In light of this holding, the Court need not reach petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument concerning whether IDEA entitles parents to litigate their child\xe2\x80\x99s claims <em>pro se.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.

They had sought review related to concerns they had over whether their youngest child, 6-year-old Jacob, would progress well at Pleasant Valley Elementary School, which is part of the Parma City School District in Parma, Ohio.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jacob has autism spectrum disorder and is covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Act or IDEA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71400 <em>et seq</em>.  (2000 ed. and Supp. IV).  His parents worked with the school district to develop an individualized education program (IEP), as required by the Act.  All concede that Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s parents had the statutory right to contribute to this process and, when agreement could not be reached, to participate in administrative proceedings including what the Act refers to as an \xe2\x80\x9cimpartial due process hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disagreement at the center of the current dispute concerns the procedures to be followed when parents and their child, dissatisfied with the outcome of the due process hearing, seek further review in a United States District Court.  The question is whether parents, either on their own behalf or as representatives of the child, may proceed in court unrepresented by counsel though they are not trained or licensed as attorneys.  Resolution of this issue requires us to examine and explain the provisions of IDEA to determine if it accords to parents rights of their own that can be vindicated in court proceedings, or alternatively, whether the Act allows them, in their status as parents, to represent their child in court proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Parma City School District, a participant in IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s educational spending program, accepts federal funds for assistance in the education of children with disabilities.  As a condition of receiving funds, it must comply with IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s mandates.  IDEA requires that the school district provide Jacob with a \xe2\x80\x9cfree appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d which must operate in accordance with the IEP that Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s parents, along with school officials and other individuals, develop as members of Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIEP Team.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The school district proposed an IEP for the 2003\xe2\x80\x932004 school year that would have placed Jacob at a public elementary school.  Regarding this IEP as deficient under IDEA, Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s nonlawyer parents availed themselves of the administrative review provided by IDEA.  They filed a complaint alleging respondent had failed to provide Jacob with a free appropriate public education; they appealed the hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the claims in this complaint to a state-level review officer; and after losing that appeal they filed, on their own behalf and on behalf of Jacob, a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  In reliance upon 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) they challenged the administrative decision, alleging, among other matters: that Jacob had not been provided with a free appropriate public education; that his IEP was inadequate; and that the school district had failed to follow procedures mandated by IDEA.  Pending the resolution of these challenges, the Winkelmans had enrolled Jacob in a private school at their own expense.  They had also obtained counsel to assist them with certain aspects of the proceedings, although they filed their federal complaint, and later their appeal, without the aid of an attorney.  The Winkelmans\xe2\x80\x99 complaint sought reversal of the administrative decision, reimbursement for private-school expenditures and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees already incurred, and, it appears, declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding it had provided Jacob with a free appropriate public education.  Petitioners, proceeding without counsel, filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  Relying on its recent decision in <em>Cavanaugh</em> v. <em>Cardinal Local School Dist</em>., 409 F.\xc2\xa03d 753 (2005), the Court of Appeals entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans\xe2\x80\x99 appeal unless they obtained counsel to represent Jacob.  See Order in No. 05\xe2\x80\x933886 (Nov. 4, 2005), App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a.  In <em>Cavanaugh</em> the Court of Appeals had rejected the proposition that IDEA allows nonlawyer parents raising IDEA claims to proceed <em>pro se </em>in federal court.  The court ruled that the right to a free appropriate public education \xe2\x80\x9cbelongs to the child alone,\xe2\x80\x9d 409 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 757, not to both the parents and the child.  It followed, the court held, that \xe2\x80\x9cany right on which the [parents] could proceed on their own behalf would be derivative\xe2\x80\x9d of the child\xe2\x80\x99s right, <em>ibid.</em>, so that parents bringing IDEA claims were not appearing on their own behalf, <em>ibid.</em>  See also 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71654 (allowing parties to prosecute their own claims<em> pro se</em>).  As for the parents\xe2\x80\x99 alternative argument, the court held, nonlawyer parents cannot litigate IDEA claims on behalf of their child because IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing minor children.<em> </em>409 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 756.  As the court in <em>Cavanaugh</em> acknowledged, its decision brought the Sixth Circuit in direct conflict with the First Circuit, which had concluded, under a theory of \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory joint rights,\xe2\x80\x9d that the Act accords to parents the right to assert IDEA claims on their own behalf.  See <em>Maroni</em> v. <em>Pemi-Baker Regional School Dist</em>., 346 F.\xc2\xa03d 247, 249, 250 (CA1 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners sought review in this Court.  In light of the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether a nonlawyer parent of a child with a disability may prosecute IDEA actions <em>pro se</em> in federal court, we granted certiorari.  549 U. S. ___ (2006).  Compare <em>Cavanaugh</em>,<em> supra</em>, with <em>Maroni</em>, <em>supra;</em> see also <em>Mosely</em> v. <em>Board of Ed</em>. <em>of Chicago</em>, 434 F.\xc2\xa03d 527 (CA7 2006); <em>Collinsgru</em> v. <em>Palmyra Bd. of Ed</em>., 161 F.\xc2\xa03d 225 (CA3 1998); <em>Wenger</em> v. <em>Canastota Central School Dist</em>., 146 F.\xc2\xa03d 123 (CA2 1998) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Devine</em> v. <em>Indian River Cty.

Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 primary theory is that the Act makes parents real parties in interest to IDEA actions, not \xe2\x80\x9cmer[e] guardians of their children\xe2\x80\x99s rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 16.  If correct, this allows Mr. and Mrs. Winkelman back into court, for there is no question that a party may represent his or her own interests in federal court without the aid of counsel.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71654 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel . . .\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioners cannot cite a specific provision in IDEA mandating in direct and explicit terms that parents have the status of real parties in interest.  They instead base their argument on a comprehensive reading of IDEA.  Taken as a whole, they contend, the Act leads to the necessary conclusion that parents have independent, enforceable rights.  Brief for Petitioners 14 (citing <em>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</em> v. <em>Nigh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/50/index.html">543 U. S. 50</a>, 60 (2004)).  Respondent, accusing petitioners of \xe2\x80\x9cknit[ting] together various provisions pulled from the crevices of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d to support these claims, Brief for Respondent 19, reads the text of IDEA to mean that any redressable rights under the Act belong only to children, <em>id</em>., at 19\xe2\x80\x9340.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree that the text of IDEA resolves the question presented.  We recognize, in addition, that a proper interpretation of the Act requires a consideration of the entire statutory scheme.  See <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486 (2006).  Turning to the current version of IDEA, which the parties agree governs this case, we begin with an overview of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The goals of IDEA include \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  To this end, the Act includes provisions governing four areas of particular relevance to the Winkelmans\xe2\x80\x99 claim: procedures to be followed when developing a child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP; criteria governing the sufficiency of an education provided to a child; mechanisms for review that must be made available when there are objections to the IEP or to other aspects of IDEA proceedings; and the requirement in certain circumstances that States reimburse parents for various expenses.  See generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71412(a)(10), 1414, 1415.  Although our discussion of these four areas does not identify all the illustrative provisions, we do take particular note of certain terms that mandate or otherwise describe parental involvement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IDEA requires school districts to develop an IEP for each child with a disability, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71412(a)(4), 1414(d), with parents playing \xe2\x80\x9ca significant role\xe2\x80\x9d in this process, <em>Schaffer</em> v. <em>Weast</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/49/index.html">546 U. S. 49</a>, 53 (2005).  Parents serve as members of the team that develops the IEP.  \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(B).  The \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns\xe2\x80\x9d parents have \xe2\x80\x9cfor enhancing the education of their child\xe2\x80\x9d must be considered by the team.  \xc2\xa71414(d)(3)(A)(ii).  IDEA accords parents additional protections that apply throughout the IEP process.  See, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71414(d)(4)(A) (requiring the IEP Team to revise the IEP when appropriate to address certain information provided by the parents); \xc2\xa71414(e) (requiring States to \xe2\x80\x9censure that the parents of [a child with a disability] are members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute also sets up general procedural safeguards that protect the informed involvement of parents in the development of an education for their child.  See, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71415(a) (requiring States to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish and maintain procedures \xe2\x80\xa6 to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71415(b)(1) (mandating that States provide an opportunity for parents to examine all relevant records).  See generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414, 1415.  A central purpose of the parental protections is to facilitate the provision of a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71401(9), which must be made available to the child \xe2\x80\x9cin conformity with the [IEP],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71401(9)(D).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act defines a \xe2\x80\x9cfree appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to an IEP to be an educational instruction \xe2\x80\x9cspecially designed . . . to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71401(29), coupled with any additional \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98related services\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9crequired to assist a child with a disability to benefit from [that instruction],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71401(26)(A).

The education must, among other things, be provided \xe2\x80\x9cunder public supervision and direction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmeet the standards of the State educational agency,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinclude an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the State involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The instruction must, in addition, be provided at \xe2\x80\x9cno cost to parents.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71401(29).  See generally <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty.</em> v. <em>Rowley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/176/index.html">458 U. S. 176</a> (1982) (discussing the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfree appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the statutory precursor to IDEA).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a party objects to the adequacy of the education provided, the construction of the IEP, or some related matter, IDEA provides procedural recourse: It requires that a State provide \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n opportunity for any party to present a complaint . . . with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(b)(6).  By presenting a complaint a party is able to pursue a process of review that, as relevant, begins with a preliminary meeting \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the parents of the child discuss their complaint\xe2\x80\x9d and the local educational agency \xe2\x80\x9cis provided the opportunity to [reach a resolution].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(B)(i)(IV).  If the agency \xe2\x80\x9chas not resolved the complaint to the satisfaction of the parents within 30 days,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(B)(ii), the parents may request an \xe2\x80\x9cimpartial due process hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(A), which must be conducted either by the local educational agency or by the state educational agency, <em>ibid</em>., and where a hearing officer will resolve issues raised in the complaint, \xc2\xa71415(f)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IDEA sets standards the States must follow in conducting these hearings.  Among other things, it indicates that the hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cshall be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation,\xe2\x80\x9d the officer may find a child \xe2\x80\x9cdid not receive a free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d only if the violation</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(I)\xe2\x80\x82impeded the child\xe2\x80\x99s right to a free appropriate public education;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(II)\xe2\x80\x82significantly impeded the parents\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents\xe2\x80\x99 child; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(III)\xe2\x80\x82caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf the local educational agency, rather than the state educational agency, conducts this hearing, then \xe2\x80\x9cany party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decision to the State educational agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(g)(1).  Once the state educational agency has reached its decision, an aggrieved party may commence suit in federal court: \xe2\x80\x9cAny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hearing officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A); see also \xc2\xa71415(i)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IDEA, finally, provides for at least two means of cost recovery that inform our analysis.  First, in certain circumstances it allows a court or hearing officer to require a state agency \xe2\x80\x9cto reimburse the parents [of a child with a disability] for the cost of [private school] enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  Second, it sets forth rules governing when and to what extent a court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  See \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  Included in this section is a provision allowing an award \xe2\x80\x9cto a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>\xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners construe these various provisions to accord parents independent, enforceable rights under IDEA.  We agree.  The parents enjoy enforceable rights at the administrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert these rights in federal court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute sets forth procedures for resolving disputes in a manner that, in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s express terms, contemplates parents will be the parties bringing the administrative complaints.  In addition to the provisions we have cited, we refer also to \xc2\xa71415(b)(8) (requiring a state educational agency to \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop a model form to assist parents in filing a complaint\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71415(c)(2) (addressing the response an agency must provide to a \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x99s due process complaint notice\xe2\x80\x9d); and \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe parent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint\xe2\x80\x9d).  A wide range of review is available: Administrative complaints may be brought with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cany matter relating to . . . the provision of a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(b)(6)(A).  Claims raised in these complaints are then resolved at impartial due process hearings, where, again, the statute makes clear that parents will be participating as parties.  See generally <em>supra, </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  See also \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(C) (indicating \xe2\x80\x9c[a] parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing\xe2\x80\x9d within a certain period of time); \xc2\xa71415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9ca parent\xe2\x80\x99s right to a due process hearing\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute then grants \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made [by the hearing officer] . . . the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in these interlocking provisions excludes a parent who has exercised his or her own rights from statutory protection the moment the administrative proceedings end.  Put another way, the Act does not <em>sub silentio</em> or by implication bar parents from seeking to vindicate the rights accorded to them once the time comes to file a civil action.  Through its provisions for expansive review and extensive parental involvement, the statute leads to just the opposite result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, resisting this line of analysis, asks us to read these provisions as contemplating parental involvement only to the extent parents represent their child\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view IDEA accords parents nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral tools related to the child\xe2\x80\x99s underlying substantive rights\xe2\x80\x94not freestanding or independently enforceable rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation, though, is foreclosed by provisions of the statute.  IDEA defines one of its purposes as seeking \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(B).  The word \xe2\x80\x9crights\xe2\x80\x9d in the quoted language refers to the rights of parents as well as the rights of the child; otherwise the grammatical structure would make no sense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further provisions confirm this view.  IDEA mandates that educational agencies establish procedures \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(a).  It presumes parents have rights of their own when it defines how States might provide for the transfer of the \xe2\x80\x9crights accorded to parents\xe2\x80\x9d by IDEA, \xc2\xa71415(m)(1)(B), and it prohibits the raising of certain challenges \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other individual right of action that a parent or student may maintain under [the relevant provisions of IDEA],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(10)(E), 1412(a)(14)(E).  To adopt respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute would require an interpretation of these statutory provisions (and others) far too strained to be correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defending its countertextual reading of the statute, respondent cites a decision by a Court of Appeals concluding that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creferences to parents are best understood as accommodations to the fact of the child\xe2\x80\x99s incapacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Doe</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Baltimore Cty.</em>, 165 F.\xc2\xa03d 260, 263 (CA4 1998); see also Brief for Respondent 30.  This, according to respondent, requires us to interpret all references to parents\xe2\x80\x99 rights as referring in implicit terms to the child\xe2\x80\x99s rights\xe2\x80\x94which, under this view, are the only enforceable rights accorded by IDEA.  Even if we were inclined to ignore the plain text of the statute in considering this theory, we disagree that the sole purpose driving IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication of a child\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  It is not a novel proposition to say that parents have a recognized legal interest in the education and upbringing of their child.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Pierce</em> v. <em>Society of Sisters</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/index.html">268 U. S. 510</a>, 534\xe2\x80\x93535 (1925) (acknowledging \xe2\x80\x9cthe liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Meyer</em> v. <em>Nebraska</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/index.html">262 U. S. 390</a>, 399\xe2\x80\x93401 (1923).  There is no necessary bar or obstacle in the law, then, to finding an intention by Congress to grant parents a stake in the entitlements created by IDEA.  Without question a parent of a child with a disability has a particular and personal interest in fulfilling \xe2\x80\x9cour national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71400(c)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore find no reason to read into the plain language of the statute an implicit rejection of the notion that Congress would accord parents independent, enforceable rights concerning the education of their children.  We instead interpret the statute\xe2\x80\x99s references to parents\xe2\x80\x99 rights to mean what they say: that IDEA includes provisions conveying rights to parents as well as to children.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A variation on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument has persuaded some Courts of Appeals.  The argument is that while a parent can be a \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d for aspects of the hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s findings and decision, he or she cannot be a \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to all IDEA-based challenges.  Under this view the causes of action available to a parent might relate, for example, to various procedural mandates, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Collinsgru</em>, 161 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 233, and reimbursement demands, see, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  The argument supporting this conclusion proceeds as follows: Because a \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d is, by definition, entitled to a remedy, and parents are, under IDEA, only entitled to certain procedures and reimbursements as remedies, a parent cannot be a \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to any claim not implicating these limited matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is contradicted by the statutory provisions we have recited.  True, there are provisions in IDEA stating parents are entitled to certain procedural protections and reimbursements; but the statute prevents us from placing too much weight on the implications to be drawn when other entitlements are accorded in less clear language.  We find little support for the inference that parents are excluded by implication whenever a child is mentioned, and vice versa.  Compare, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71411(e)(3)(E) (barring States from using certain funds for costs associated with actions \xe2\x80\x9cbrought on behalf of a child\xe2\x80\x9d but failing to acknowledge that actions might also be brought on behalf of a parent) with \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i) (allowing recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability\xe2\x80\x9d but failing to acknowledge that a child might also be a prevailing party).  Without more, then, the language in IDEA confirming that parents enjoy particular procedural and reimbursement-related rights does not resolve whether they are also entitled to enforce IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s other mandates, including the one most fundamental to the Act: the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consider the statutory structure.  The IEP proceedings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their child\xe2\x80\x99s educational program.  Among other things, IDEA requires the IEP Team, which includes the parents as members, to take into account any \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns\xe2\x80\x9d parents have \xe2\x80\x9cfor enhancing the education of their child\xe2\x80\x9d when it formulates the IEP.  \xc2\xa71414(d)(3)(A)(ii).  The IEP, in turn, sets the boundaries of the central entitlement provided by IDEA: It defines a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for that parent\xe2\x80\x99s child.  \xc2\xa71401(9).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute also empowers parents to bring challenges based on a broad range of issues.  The parent may seek a hearing on \xe2\x80\x9cany matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(b)(6)(A).  To resolve these challenges a hearing officer must make a decision based on whether the child \xe2\x80\x9creceived a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E).  When this hearing has been conducted by a local educational agency rather than a state educational agency, \xe2\x80\x9cany party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decision\xe2\x80\x9d to the state educational agency.  \xc2\xa71415(g)(1).  Judicial review follows, authorized by a broadly worded provision phrased in the same terms used to describe the prior stage of review: \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny party aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d may bring \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These provisions confirm that IDEA, through its text and structure, creates in parents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs implicated by this process but also in the substantive decisions to be made.  We therefore conclude that IDEA does not differentiate, through isolated references to various procedures and remedies, between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents.  As a consequence, a parent may be a \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71415(i)(2) with regard to \xe2\x80\x9cany matter\xe2\x80\x9d implicating these rights.  See \xc2\xa71415(b)(6)(A).  The status of parents as parties is not limited to matters that relate to procedure and cost recovery.  To find otherwise would be inconsistent with the collaborative framework and expansive system of review established by the Act.  Cf. <em>Cedar Rapids Community School Dist</em>. v. <em>Garret F</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/66/index.html">526 U. S. 66</a>, 73 (1999) (look-\ning to IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coverall statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d to interpret its provisions).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion is confirmed by noting the incongruous results that would follow were we to accept the proposition that parents\xe2\x80\x99 IDEA rights are limited to certain nonsubstantive matters.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s procedural and reimbursement-related rights are intertwined with the substantive adequacy of the education provided to a child, see, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E), see also \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii), and it is difficult to disentangle the provisions in order to conclude that some rights adhere to both parent and child while others do not.  Were we nevertheless to recognize a distinction of this sort it would impose upon parties a confusing and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might in practice differentiate between these matters.  It is, in addition, out of accord with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s design to interpret the Act to require that parents prove the substantive inadequacy of their child\xe2\x80\x99s education as a predicate for obtaining, for example, reimbursement under \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii), yet to prevent them from obtaining a judgment mandating that the school district provide their child with an educational program demonstrated to be an appropriate one.  The adequacy of the educational program is, after all, the central issue in the litigation.  The provisions of IDEA do not set forth these distinctions, and we decline to infer them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The bifurcated regime suggested by the courts that have employed it, moreover, leaves some parents without a remedy.  The statute requires, in express terms, that States provide a child with a free appropriate public education \xe2\x80\x9cat public expense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71401(9)(A), including specially designed instruction \xe2\x80\x9cat no cost to parents,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71401(29).  Parents may seek to enforce this mandate through the federal courts, we conclude, because among the rights they enjoy is the right to a free appropriate public education for their child.  Under the countervailing view, which would make a parent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce IDEA dependant on certain procedural and reimbursement-related rights, a parent whose disabled child has not received a free appropriate public education would have recourse in the federal courts only under two circumstances: when the parent happens to have some claim related to the procedures employed; and when he or she is able to incur, and has in fact incurred, expenses creating a right to reimbursement.  Otherwise the adequacy of the child\xe2\x80\x99s education would not be regarded as relevant to any cause of action the parent might bring; and, as a result, only the child could vindicate the right accorded by IDEA to a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The potential for injustice in this result is apparent.  What is more, we find nothing in the statute to indicate that when Congress required States to provide adequate instruction to a child \xe2\x80\x9cat no cost to parents,\xe2\x80\x9d it intended that only some parents would be able to enforce that mandate.  The statute instead takes pains to \xe2\x80\x9censure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(B).  See, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71415(e)(2) (requiring that States implement procedures to ensure parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education); \xc2\xa71415(e)(2)(A)(ii) (requiring that mediation procedures not be \xe2\x80\x9cused to deny or delay a parent\xe2\x80\x99s right to a due process hearing . . . or to deny any other rights afforded under this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. \xc2\xa71400(c)(3) (noting IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s success in \xe2\x80\x9censuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights.  These rights, which are not limited to certain procedural and reimbursement-related matters, encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for the parents\xe2\x80\x99 child.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent contends, though, that even under the reasoning we have now explained petitioners cannot prevail without overcoming a further difficulty.  Citing our opinion in <em>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), respondent argues that statutes passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, such as IDEA, must provide \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear notice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d before they can burden a State with some new condition, obligation, or liability.  Brief for Respondent 41.  Respondent contends that because IDEA is, at best, ambiguous as to whether it accords parents independent rights, it has failed to provide clear notice of this condition to the States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9349.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Arlington </em>is misplaced.  In <em>Arlington</em> we addressed whether IDEA required States to reimburse experts\xe2\x80\x99 fees to prevailing parties in IDEA actions.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress attaches conditions to a State\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of federal funds,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe conditions must be set out \xe2\x80\x98unambiguously.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U. S. 1</a>, 17 (1981)).  The question to be answered in <em>Arlington</em>, therefore, was whether IDEA \xe2\x80\x9cfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)<em>.  </em>We found it did not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instant case presents a different issue, one that does not invoke the same rule.  Our determination that IDEA grants to parents independent, enforceable rights does not impose any substantive condition or obligation on States they would not otherwise be required by law to observe.  The basic measure of monetary recovery, moreover, is not expanded by recognizing that some rights repose in both the parent and the child.  Were we considering a statute other than the one before us, the Spending Clause argument might have more force: A determination by the Court that some distinct class of people has independent, enforceable rights might result in a change to the States\xe2\x80\x99 statutory obligations.  But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues our ruling will, as a practical matter, increase costs borne by the States as they are forced to defend against suits unconstrained by attorneys trained in the law and the rules of ethics.  Effects such as these do not suffice to invoke the concerns under the Spending Clause.  Furthermore, IDEA does afford relief for the States in certain cases.  The Act empowers courts to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a prevailing educational agency whenever a parent has presented a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint or subsequent cause of action . . . for any improper purpose, such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III).

Parents enjoy rights under IDEA; and they are, as a result, entitled to prosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf.  The decision by Congress to grant parents these rights was consistent with the purpose of IDEA and fully in accord with our social and legal traditions.  It is beyond dispute that the relationship between a parent and child is sufficient to support a legally cognizable interest in the education of one\xe2\x80\x99s child; and, what is more, Congress has found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by . . . strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71400(c)(5).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of our holding we need not reach petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alternative argument, which concerns whether IDEA entitles parents to litigate their child\xe2\x80\x99s claims <em>pro se</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</font></font></div><font caps="1"><font caps="1">\n</font></font></div><font caps="1"><font caps="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962411">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF SCALIA, J.<br/>\nWINKELMAN V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71400 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), when they seek reimbursement for private school expenses or redress for violations of their own procedural rights, but not when they seek a judicial determination that their child\xe2\x80\x99s free appropriate public education (or FAPE) is substantively inadequate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether parents may bring suits under the IDEA without a lawyer depends upon the interaction between the IDEA and the general <em>pro se</em> provision in the Judiciary Act of 1789.  The latter, codified at 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71654, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all courts of the United States <em>the parties</em> may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  The IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s right-to-sue provision, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny <em>party aggrieved</em> by the findings and decision [of a hearing officer] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the [administrative] complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  Thus, when parents are \xe2\x80\x9cparties aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d under the IDEA, they are \xe2\x80\x9cparties\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71654, entitled to sue on their own behalf.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As both parties agree, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; Brief for Respondent 37, \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[a] party entitled to a remedy; esp., a party whose personal, pecuniary, or property rights have been adversely affected by another person\xe2\x80\x99s actions or by a court\xe2\x80\x99s decree or judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004); see also <em>ante</em>, at 12.  This case thus turns on the rights that the IDEA accords to parents, and the concomitant remedies made available to them.  Only with respect to such rights and remedies are parents properly viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cparties aggrieved,\xe2\x80\x9d capable of filing their own cases in federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A review of the statutory text makes clear that, as relevant here, the IDEA grants parents only two types of rights.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  First, under certain circumstances \xe2\x80\x9ca court or a hearing officer may require the [school district] to reimburse <em>the parents</em>\xe2\x80\x9d for private school expenditures \xe2\x80\x9cif the court or hearing officer finds that the [school district] had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added).  Second, parents are accorded a variety of procedural protections, both during the development of their child\xe2\x80\x99s individualized education program (IEP), see, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(B)(i) (parents are members of their child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP team); \xc2\xa71415(b)(1) (parents must have an opportunity to examine records and participate in IEP meetings), and in any subsequent administrative challenges, see, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(b)(6), (8) (parents may file administrative due process complaints).  It is clear that parents may object to procedural violations at the administrative due process hearing, see \xc2\xa71415(b)(6)(A), and that a hearing officer may provide relief to parents for certain procedural infractions, see \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(ii).  Because the rights to reimbursement and to the various procedural protections are accorded to parents themselves, they are \xe2\x80\x9cparties aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d when those rights are infringed, and may accordingly proceed <em>pro se </em>when seeking to vindicate them.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court goes further, however, concluding that parents may proceed <em>pro se</em> not only when they seek reimbursement or assert procedural violations, but also when they challenge the substantive adequacy of their child\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE\xe2\x80\x94so that parents may act without a lawyer <em>in every IDEA case</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9316.  In my view, this sweeps far more broadly than the text allows.  Out of this sprawling statute the Court cannot identify even <em>a single</em> provision stating that parents have the substantive right to a FAPE.  The reason for this is readily understandable: The right to a free appropriate public education obviously inheres in the child, for it is he who receives the education.  As the IDEA instructs, participating States must provide a \xe2\x80\x9cfree appropriate public education \xe2\x80\xa6 to all children with disabilities\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71412(a)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  The statute is replete with references to the fact that a FAPE belongs to the child.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(A) (IDEA designed \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71408(a)(2)(C)(i) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of a child\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9creceive a free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71411(e)(3)(F)(i) (same); \xc2\xa71414(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (referring to an agency \xe2\x80\x9cthat is responsible for making a free appropriate public education available to a child\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71415(b)(6)(A) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe provision of a free appropriate public education to [a] child\xe2\x80\x9d).  The parents of a disabled child no doubt have an <em>interest</em> in seeing their child receive a proper education.  But there is a difference between an <em>interest</em> and a statutory <em>right</em>.  The text of the IDEA makes clear that parents have no <em>right</em> to the education itself.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concedes, as it must, that while the IDEA gives parents the right to reimbursement and procedural protection in explicit terms, it does not do so for the supposed right to the education itself.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The obvious inference to be drawn from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear and explicit conferral of discrete types of rights upon parents and children, respectively, is that it does not by accident confer the parent-designated rights upon children, or the children-designated rights upon parents.  The Court believes, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute prevents us from placing too much weight on [this] implicatio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  That conclusion is in error.  Nothing in \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute,\xe2\x80\x9d undermines the obvious \xe2\x80\x9cimplication\xe2\x80\x9d of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s scheme.  What the Court relies upon for its conclusion that parents have a substantive right to a FAPE is not the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory structure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, but rather the myriad <em>procedural</em> guarantees accorded to parents in the administrative process, see <em>ibid.</em>  But allowing parents, by means of these guarantees, to help shape the contours of their child\xe2\x80\x99s education is simply not the same as giving <em>them </em>the right to that education.  Nor can the Court sensibly rely on the provisions governing due process hearings and administrative appeals, the various provisions that refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), or the fact that the right-to-sue provision, \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A), refers to the administrative complaint, which in turn allows parents to challenge \xe2\x80\x9cany matter\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the provision of a FAPE, \xc2\xa71415(b)(6)(A).  These provisions prove nothing except what all parties concede: that parents <em>may</em> represent their child <em>pro se</em> at the administrative level.  See Brief for Petitioners 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 40; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12; Brief for Respondent 13, 44; see also <em>Collingsru</em> v. <em>Palmyra Bd. of Ed.</em>, 161 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 232 (CA3 1998).  Parents thus have the power, at the administrative stage, to litigate <em>all</em> of the various rights under the statute since at that stage they are acting not only on their <em>own </em>behalf, but on behalf of <em>their child</em> as well.  This tells us nothing whatever about <em>whose</em> rights they are.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s spraying statutory sections about like buckshot cannot create a substantive parental right to education where none exists.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Harkening back to its earlier discussion of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctext and structure\xe2\x80\x9d (by which it means the statute\xe2\x80\x99s procedural protections), the Court announces the startling proposition that, in fact, the \xe2\x80\x9cIDEA does not differentiate \xe2\x80\xa6 between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  If that were so, the Court could have spared us its painful effort to craft a distinctive parental right out of scattered procedural provisions.  But of course it is not so.  The IDEA quite clearly differentiates between the rights accorded to parents and their children.  See <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Roanoke City School Bd.</em>, 432 F.\xc2\xa03d 294, 299 (CA4 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]arents and children are distinct legal entities under the IDEA\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  As even petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 <em>amici</em> agree, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress specifically indicated that parents have rights under the Act that are separate from and independent of their children\xe2\x80\x99s rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 18.  Does the Court seriously contend that a child has a right to reimbursement, when the statute most definitively provides that if \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the parents</em> of a child with a disability\xe2\x80\x9d enroll that child in private school, \xe2\x80\x9ca court \xe2\x80\xa6 may require the [school district] to reimburse <em>the parents</em> for the cost of that enrollment\xe2\x80\x9d?  \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added); see also Brief for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 21 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe right of reimbursement runs to the parents\xe2\x80\x9d).  Does the Court believe that a child has a procedural right under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(C)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which gives <em>parents</em> the power to excuse an IEP team member from attending an IEP meeting?  The IDEA does not remotely envision communal \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court believes that because parents must prove the substantive inadequacy of a FAPE before obtaining reimbursement, \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), and because the suitability of a FAPE may also be at issue when procedural violations are alleged, \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(ii), it is \xe2\x80\x9cout of accord with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s design\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent [parents] from obtaining a judgment mandating that the school district provide their child\xe2\x80\x9d with a FAPE.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  That is a total non sequitur<em>. </em> That Congress has required parents to demonstrate the inadequacy of their child\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE in order to vindicate their own rights says nothing about whether parents possess an underlying right to education.  The Court insists that the right to a FAPE is the right \xe2\x80\x9cmost fundamental to the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  Undoubtedly so, but that sheds no light upon whom the right belongs to, and hence upon who can sue in their own right.  Congress has used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s job to apply that language, not to run from it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court further believes that a distinction between parental and child rights will prove difficult to administer.  I fail to see why that is so.  Before today, the majority of Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have allowed parents to sue <em>pro se</em> with respect to some claims, but not with respect to the denial of a FAPE.  See <em>Mosely </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Chicago</em>, 434 F.\xc2\xa03d 527, 532 (CA7 2006); <em>Collingsru,</em> 161 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 233; <em>Wenger</em> v. <em>Canastota Central School Dist.</em>, 146 F.\xc2\xa03d 123, 126 (CA2 1998) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Devine</em> v. <em>Indian River Cty. School Bd.</em>, 121 F.\xc2\xa03d 576, 581, n.\xc2\xa017 (CA11 1997).  The Court points to no evidence suggesting that this majority rule has caused any confusion in practice.  Nor do I see how it could, since the statute makes clear and easily administrable distinctions between parents\xe2\x80\x99 and children\xe2\x80\x99s legal entitlements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court charges that the approach taken by the majority of Courts of Appeals would perpetrate an \xe2\x80\x9cinjustice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, since parents who do not seek reimbursement or allege procedural violations would be \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  That, of course, is not true.  They will have the same remedy as all parents who sue to vindicate their children\xe2\x80\x99s rights: the power to bring suit, represented by counsel.  But even indulging the Court\xe2\x80\x99s perception that it is unfair to allow some but not all IDEA parents to proceed <em>pro se</em>, that complaint is properly addressed to Congress, which structured the rights as it has, and limited suit to \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  And there are good reasons for it to have done so.  <em>Pro se</em> cases impose unique burdens on lower courts\xe2\x80\x94and on defendants, in this case the schools and school districts that must hire their own lawyers.  Since <em>pro se </em>complaints are prosecuted essentially for free, without screening by knowledgeable attorneys, they are much more likely to be unmeritorious.  And for courts to figure them out without the assistance of plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s counsel is much more difficult and time-consuming.  In both categories of <em>pro se </em>parental suit permitted under a proper interpretation of the statute, one or the other of these burdens is reduced.  Actions seeking reimbursement are less likely to be frivolous, since not many parents will be willing to lay out the money for private education without some solid reason to believe the FAPE was inadequate.  And actions alleging procedural violations can ordinarily be disposed of without the intensive record-review that characterizes suits challenging the suitability of a FAPE.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners sought reimbursement, alleged procedural violations, and requested a declaration that their child\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE was substantively inadequate.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  I agree with the Court that they may proceed <em>pro se</em> with respect to the first two claims, but I disagree that they may do so with respect to the third.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 2, 18, petitioners also argue that even if parents do not have their own rights under the statute, they nonetheless may act on behalf of their child without retaining a lawyer.  Both sides agree, however, that the common law generally prohibited lay parents from representing their children in court, a manifestation of the more general common-law rule that nonattorneys cannot litigate the interests of another.  See Brief for Petitioners 37; Brief for Respondent 9\xe2\x80\x9310; see also, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Collingsru</em> v. <em>Palmyra Bd. of Ed.</em>, 161 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 232 (CA3 1998).

Parents acquire such a right (in limited circumstances) only when they enroll their child in a private institution.  \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Contrary to indications in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 13, and to the apparent language of the statute, a hearing officer does not always render a decision \xe2\x80\x9con substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(i) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  That provision is \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to clause (ii),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n matters alleging a procedural violation\xe2\x80\x9d a hearing officer can grant relief if \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedural inadequacies \xe2\x80\xa6 significantly impeded the parents\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents\xe2\x80\x99 child,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(ii)(II).  It is true that a hearing officer who accepts such an allegation nominally grants relief by concluding that the child did not receive a FAPE, \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(ii), but it is clear from the structure of the statute that this is not a decision on the substantive adequacy of the FAPE, but rather the label attached to a finding of procedural defect.
