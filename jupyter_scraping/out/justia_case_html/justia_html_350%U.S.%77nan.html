Even assuming such appellate power to exist under the Seventh Amendment, we find that the Court of Appeals was not justified, on this record, in regarding the denial of a new trial, upon a remittitur of part of the verdict, as an abuse of discretion.  For, apart from that question, as we view the evidence, we think that the action of the trial court was not without support in the record, and accordingly that its action should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeals. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 350 U.
