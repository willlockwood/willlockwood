First, the distributive canon has the most force when one-to-one matching is present, but here, the statute would require matching some of three nouns with one of two gerunds.

But here, \xe2\x80\x9csalesman .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. primarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles\xe2\x80\x9d is an apt description of a service advisor.

But the FLSA exempts many categories of employees from this requirement.  See \xc2\xa7213.

See Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, \xc2\xa79,\n\n75Stat.\n73.  Congress then narrowed that exemption to cover \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements, or aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, \xc2\xa7209,\n\n80Stat.\n836.  In 1974, Congress enacted the version of the exemption at issue here.  It provides that the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s overtime-pay requirement does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This language has long been understood to cover service advisors.

Reg. 5896 (1970) (codified at 29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(4) (1971)), the federal courts rejected that view, see <i>Brennan</i> v. <i>Deel Motors, Inc.</i>, 475 F.\xc2\xa02d 1095 (CA5 1973); <i>Brennan</i> v. <i>North Bros.

After these decisions, the Department issued an opinion letter in 1978, explaining that service advisors are exempt in most cases.  See Dept. of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter No. 1520 (WH\xe2\x80\x93467) (1978), [1978\xe2\x80\x931981 Transfer Binder] CCH Wages\xe2\x80\x93Hours Administrative Rulings \xc2\xb631,207.  From 1978 to 2011, Congress made no changes to the exemption, despite amending \xc2\xa7213 nearly a dozen times.  The Department also continued to acquiesce in the view that service advisors are exempt.  See Dept. of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Field Operations Handbook, Insert No. 1757, 24L04(k) (Oct. 20, 1987), online at https://perma.cc/5GHD-KCJJ (as last visited Mar. 28, 2018).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2011, however, the Department reversed course.

Nonetheless, it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not intend to exempt service advisors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 929.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit began by noting that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s 1966\xe2\x80\x931967 Occupational Outlook Handbook listed 12 job titles in the table of contents that could be found at a car dealership, including \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile mechanics,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile parts countermen,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile salesmen,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile service advisors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 930.  Because the FLSA exemption listed three of these positions, but not service advisors, the Ninth Circuit concluded that service advisors are not exempt.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Ninth Circuit also determined that service advisors are not primarily engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cservicing\xe2\x80\x9d automobiles, which it defined to mean \xe2\x80\x9conly those who are actually occupied in the repair and maintenance of cars.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 931.  And the Ninth Circuit further concluded that the exemption does not cover salesmen who are primarily engaged in servicing.  <i>Id.,</i> at 933.  In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit invoked the distributive canon.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 214 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cDistributive phrasing applies each expression to its appropriate referent\xe2\x80\x9d).

A salesman sells; a partsman services; and a mechanic services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 934.  Finally, the Court of Appeals noted that its interpretation was supported by the principle that exemptions to the FLSA should be construed narrowly,<i> id.</i>, at 935, and the lack of any \xe2\x80\x9cmention of service advisors\xe2\x80\x9d in the legislative history, <i>id.</i>, at 939.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), and now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The FLSA exempts from its overtime-pay requirement \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).

The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d is someone who sells goods or services.  See 14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a] man whose business it is to sell goods or conduct sales\xe2\x80\x9d); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1262 (1966) (\xe2\x80\x9ca man who sells goods, services, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Service advisors do precisely that.  As this Court previously explained, service advisors \xe2\x80\x9csell [customers] services for their vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Encino I,</i> 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Service advisors are also \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  The word \xe2\x80\x9cservicing\xe2\x80\x9d in this context can mean either \xe2\x80\x9cthe action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he action of providing a service.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 39; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language, at 1304 (\xe2\x80\x9cto make fit for use; repair; restore to condition for service\xe2\x80\x9d).

If you ask the average customer who services his car, the primary, and perhaps only, person he is likely to identify is his service advisor.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">True, service advisors do not spend most of their time physically repairing automobiles.  But the statutory language is not so constrained.  All agree that partsmen, for example, are \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 40; Brief for Respondents 41\xe2\x80\x9344.  But partsmen, like service advisors, do not spend most of their time under the hood.

In other words, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles\xe2\x80\x9d must include some individuals who do not physically repair automobiles themselves but who are integrally involved in the servicing process.

Using that canon, it matched \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cselling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpartsma[n] [and] mechanic\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cservicing.\xe2\x80\x9d  We reject this reasoning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of the exemption covers \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>\xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  The exemption uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to connect all of its nouns and gerunds, and \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9calmost always disjunctive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Woods, </i>\n\n571 U.\xc2\xa0S. 31,\n45 (2013)\n.  Thus, the use of \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to join \xe2\x80\x9cselling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cservicing\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that the exemption covers a salesman primarily engaged in either activity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unsurprisingly, statutory context can overcome the ordinary, disjunctive meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cor.\xe2\x80\x9d  The distributive canon, for example, recognizes that sometimes \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here a sentence contains several antecedents and several consequents,\xe2\x80\x9d courts should \xe2\x80\x9cread them distributively and apply the words to the subjects which, by context, they seem most properly to relate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2A N. Singer &amp; S. Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa747:26, p.\xc2\xa0448 (rev. 7th ed. 2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But here, context favors the ordinary disjunctive meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d for at least three reasons.  First, the distributive canon has the most force when the statute allows for one-to-one matching.  But here, the distributive canon would mix and match some of three nouns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csalesman, partsman, or mechanic\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with one of two gerunds\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cselling or servicing.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  We doubt that a legislative drafter would leave it to the reader to figure out the precise combinations.  Second, the distributive canon has the most force when an ordinary, disjunctive reading is linguistically impossible.  Cf., <i>e.g., Huidekoper\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee </i>v. <i>Douglass</i>, 3 Cranch 1, 67 (1805) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (applying the distributive canon when a purely disjunctive reading \xe2\x80\x9cwould involve a contradiction in terms\xe2\x80\x9d).  But as explained above, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csalesman .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. primarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles\xe2\x80\x9d not only makes sense; it is an apt description of a service advisor.  Third, a narrow distributive phrasing is an unnatural fit here because the entire exemption bespeaks breadth.  It begins with the word \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Ali</i> v. <i>Federal Bureau of</i> <i>Prisons</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214,\n219 (2008)\n (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cexpansive meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it uses the disjunctive word \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d three times.  In fact, all agree that the third list in the exemption\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cautomobiles, trucks, or farm implements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94modifies every other noun and gerund.  But it would be odd to read the exemption as starting with a distributive phrasing and then, halfway through and without warning, switching to a disjunctive phrasing\xe2\x80\x94all the while using the same word (\xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d) to signal both meanings.  See <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Gardner</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115,\n118 (1994)\n (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cvigorous\xe2\x80\x9d presumption that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a term is repeated within a given sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cis used to mean the same thing\xe2\x80\x9d).  The more natural reading is that the exemption covers any combination of its nouns, gerunds, and objects.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit also invoked the principle that exemptions to the FLSA should be construed narrowly.  845 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 935\xe2\x80\x93936. We reject this principle as a useful guidepost for interpreting the FLSA.  Because the FLSA gives no \xe2\x80\x9ctextual indication\xe2\x80\x9d that its exemptions should be construed narrowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason to give [them] anything other than a fair (rather than a \xe2\x80\x98narrow\xe2\x80\x99) interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scalia, Reading Law, at 363.  The narrow-construction principle relies on the flawed premise that the FLSA \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pursues\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d its remedial purpose \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98at all costs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Express Co.</i> v. <i>Italian Colors Restaurant</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228,\n234 (2013)\n (quoting <i>Rodriguez</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522\n\xe2\x80\x93526 (1987) (<i>per curiam</i>)); see also <i>Henson</i> v. <i>Santander Consumer USA Inc.</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is quite mistaken to assume .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that whatever might appear to further the statute\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective must be the law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  But the FLSA has over two dozen exemptions in \xc2\xa7213(b) alone, including the one at issue here.  Those exemptions are as much a part of the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose as the overtime-pay requirement.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9cLegislation is, after all, the art of compromise, the limitations expressed in statutory terms often the price of passage\xe2\x80\x9d).  We thus have no license to give the exemption anything but a fair reading.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the Ninth Circuit relied on two extraneous sources to support its interpretation: the Department\xe2\x80\x99s 1966\xe2\x80\x931967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  We find neither persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit first relied on the Department\xe2\x80\x99s 1966\xe2\x80\x931967 Occupational Outlook Handbook.  It identified 12 jobs from the Handbook\xe2\x80\x99s table of contents that it thought could be found at automobile dealerships.  See 845 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 930.  The Ninth Circuit then stressed that the exemption aligns with three of those job titles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[a]utomobile mechanics,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]utomobile parts countermen,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]utomobile salesmen\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but not \xe2\x80\x9c[a]utomobile service advisors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit cited nothing, however, suggesting that the exemption was meant to align with the job titles listed in the Handbook.  To the contrary, the exemption applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is not limited, like the term in the Handbook, to \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile salesmen.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d plainly includes service advisors.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit also relied on legislative history to support its interpretation.  See <i>id</i>., at 936\xe2\x80\x93939.  Specifi- cally, it noted that the legislative history discusses \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics\xe2\x80\x9d but never discusses service advisors.  <i>Id</i>., at 939.  Although the Ninth Circuit had previously found that same legislative history \xe2\x80\x9cinconclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Encino</i>, 780 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1275, on remand it was \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly persuaded\xe2\x80\x9d that the legislative history demonstrated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to exclude service advisors, 845 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 939.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit was right the first time.  As we have explained, the best reading of the statute is that service advisors are exempt.  Even for those Members of this Court who consider legislative history, silence in the legislative history, \xe2\x80\x9cno matter how \xe2\x80\x98clanging,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d cannot defeat the better reading of the text and statutory context.  <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479\n, n.\xc2\xa013 (1985).  If the text is clear, it needs no repetition in the legislative history; and if the text is ambiguous, silence in the legislative history cannot lend any clarity.  See <i>Avco Corp.</i> v. <i>Department of Justice</i>, 884 F.\xc2\xa02d 621, 625 (CADC 1989).  Even if Congress did not foresee all of the applications of the statute, that is no reason not to give the statutory text a fair reading.  See <i>Union Bank</i> v. <i>Wolas</i>,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 151,\n158 (1991)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, we conclude that service advisors are exempt from the overtime-pay requirement of the FLSA because they are \xe2\x80\x9csalesm[e]n .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. primarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).

Congress did not exempt numerous other categories of dealership employees, among them, automobile painters, upholsterers, bookkeeping workers, cashiers, janitors, purchasing agents, shipping and receiving clerks, and, most relevant here, service advisors.

Hruska) (\xe2\x80\x9cAre we going to say to the farmer who needs a part .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on Sunday: You cannot get a spark plug .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because the partsman is not exempt, but you can have machinery repaired by a mechanic who is exempt[?]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although some Senators opposed adding partsmen to the exemption because, as they understood the job\xe2\x80\x99s demands, partsmen did not work irregular hours, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>id.,</i> at 20505 (remarks of Sen. Clark), the crux of the debate underscores the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That rationale has no application here.  Unlike salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics, service advisors \xe2\x80\x9cwor[k] ordinary, fixed schedules on-site.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 47 (citing Handbook, at 316).  Respondents, for instance, work <i>regular</i> 11-hour shifts, at all times of the year, for a weekly minimum of 55 hours.  See App. 54.  Service advisors thus do not implicate the concerns underlying the \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A) exemption.  Indeed, they are precisely the type of workers Congress intended the FLSA to shield \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the evil of overwork,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Barrentine</i> v. <i>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 728,\n739 (1981)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I note, furthermore, that limiting the exemption to the three delineated jobs\xe2\x80\x94salesman, partsman, and mechanic\xe2\x80\x94does not leave the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in selling  or servicing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A), without utility.  Congress included that language to ensure that only employees who actually perform the tasks commonly associated with the enumerated positions would be covered.  Otherwise, for example, a worker who acts as a \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d in name only could lose the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s protections merely because of the formal title listed on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s payroll records.  See <i>Bowers</i> v. <i>Fred Haas Toyota World</i>, 2017 WL 5127289, *4 (SD Tex., June 21, 2017) (\xe2\x80\x9c[An employee\xe2\x80\x99s] title alone is not dispositive of whether he meets the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. exemption.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, by partsmen \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>servicing</i> automobiles,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress meant nothing more than partsmen primarily engaged in <i>the ordinary duties of a partsman</i>, <i>i.e., </i>requisitioning, supplying, and repairing parts.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The inclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cpartsman\xe2\x80\x9d therefore should not result in the removal of service advisors from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s protections.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner contends that \xe2\x80\x9caffirming the decision below would disrupt decades of settled expectations\xe2\x80\x9d while exposing \xe2\x80\x9cemployers to substantial retroactive liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 51.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]any dealerships,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner urges, \xe2\x80\x9chave offered compensation packages based primarily on sales commissions,\xe2\x80\x9d in reliance on court decisions and agency guidance ranking service advisors as exempt.  <i>Id.,</i> at 51\xe2\x80\x9352.

As the Court previously acknowledged, see <i>Encino Motorcars, </i>579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), the FLSA provides an affirmative defense that explicitly protects regulated parties from retroactive liability for actions taken in good-faith reliance on superseded agency guidance.  See\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7259(a).  Given the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding view that service advisors fit within the \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A) exemption, see <i>ante,</i> at 2, the reliance defense would surely shield employers from retroactive liability were the Court to construe the exemption properly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress, moreover, has spoken directly to the treatment of <i>commission</i>-based workers.  The FLSA exempts from its overtime directives any employee of a \xe2\x80\x9cretail or service establishment\xe2\x80\x9d who receives more than half of his or her pay on commission, so long as the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cregular rate of pay\xe2\x80\x9d is more than 1\xc2\xbd times the minimum wage.  \xc2\xa7207(i).
