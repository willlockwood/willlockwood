The thirteen jurors unanimously found petitioner guilty. On appeal, petitioner argued that the use of a thirteen-member jury violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c), that the Rule is not waivable, and that even if it is, it can only be waived by a defendant personally and not by counsel. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner, through his counsel, had waived compliance with Rule 24(c). It concluded that "[b]ecause the waiver herein was neither prejudicial nor of constitutional magnitude and was made in the presence of the defendant in open court, . . . the failure to obtain appellant\'s personal assent . . ., [if erroneous,] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/790/208/">790 F.2d 208</a> (CA2 1986).
