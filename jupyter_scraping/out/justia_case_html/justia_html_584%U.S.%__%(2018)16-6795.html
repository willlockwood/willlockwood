He secured new counsel, but his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.  A third legal team sought, unsuccessfully, state habeas relief, claiming trial-level ineffective assistance of counsel but not counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental health and alcohol and drug abuse during the trial\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase.  His fourth set of attorneys did raise that failure in a federal habeas petition, but because the claim had never been raised in state court, the District Court held, it was barred by procedural default.  That decision was vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of <i>Martinez</i> v. <i>Ryan</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x94where this Court held that an Arizona prisoner seeking federal habeas relief could overcome the procedural default of a trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by showing that the claim is substantial and that state habeas counsel was also ineffective in failing to raise the claim in a state habeas proceeding\xe2\x80\x94and <i>Trevino </i>v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 413\n\xe2\x80\x94which extended that holding to Texas prisoners.  Petitioner filed an <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> motion asking the District Court for funding to develop his claim that both his trial and state habeas counsel were ineffective, relying on\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(f), which provides, in relevant part, that a district court \xe2\x80\x9cmay authorize\xe2\x80\x9d funding for \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative, expert, or other services .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court found his claim precluded by procedural default and thus denied his funding request.  The Fifth Circuit also rejected the funding claim under its precedent: that a \xc2\xa73599(f) funding applicant must show that he has a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial need\xe2\x80\x9d for investigative or other services, and that funding may be denied when an applicant fails to present \xe2\x80\x9ca viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  817 F.\xc2\xa03d 888, 895\xe2\x80\x93896.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held:</i></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s funding request was a judicial decision subject to appellate review under the standard jurisdictional provisions.

Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request was made by motion in his federal habeas proceeding, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding.  And resolution of the funding question requires the application of a legal standard\xe2\x80\x94whether the funding is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d for effective representation\xe2\x80\x94that demands an evaluation of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of obtaining habeas relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in support of her claim that \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s funding requests are nonadversarial and administrative are unpersuasive.  First, that the requests can be decided <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte </i>does not make the proceeding nonadversarial.  The habeas proceeding here was clearly adversarial.  And petitioner and respondent plainly have adverse interests on the funding question and have therefore squared off as adversaries.  The mere fact that a \xc2\xa73599 funding request may sometimes be made <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte </i>is thus hardly dispositive.  Second, nothing in \xc2\xa73599 even hints that the funding decisions may be revised by the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts.  Lower court cases that appear to have accepted Administrative Office review of certain Criminal Justice Act (CJA) payments, even if a proper interpretation of the CJA, are inapposite.  Finally, the fact that \xc2\xa73599(g)(2) requires funding in excess of the generally applicable statutory cap to be approved by the circuit\xe2\x80\x99s chief judge or another designated circuit judge, instead of by a panel of three, does not make the proceeding administrative.  If Congress wishes to make certain rulings reviewable by a single circuit judge, the Constitution does not stand in the way.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit did not apply the correct legal standard in affirming the denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s funding request.  Section 3599 authorizes funding for the \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d services of experts, investigators, and the like.  But the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that applicants show a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial need\xe2\x80\x9d for the services is arguably a more demanding standard.  Section 3599 appears to use the term \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to mean something less than essential.  Because it makes little sense to refer to something as being \xe2\x80\x9creasonably essential,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concludes that the statutory phrase calls for the district court to determine, in its discretion, whether a reasonable attorney would regard the services as sufficiently important, guided by considerations detailed in the opinion.  The term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d in the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test, however, suggests a heavier burden.  And that court exacerbated the difference by also requiring a funding applicant to present \xe2\x80\x9ca viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  That rule that is too restrictive after <i>Trevino</i>, see 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 429, because, in cases where funding stands a credible chance of enabling a habeas petitioner to overcome the procedural default obstacle, it may be error for a district court to refuse funding.  That being said, district courts were given broad discretion in assessing funding requests when Congress changed the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall authorize\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor statute, see\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7848(q)(9), to \xe2\x80\x9cmay authorize\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73599(f).  A funding applicant must not be expected to prove that he will be able to win relief if given the services, but the \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d test does require an assessment of the likely utility of the services requested.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative ground for affirmance\xe2\x80\x94that funding is never \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d where a habeas petitioner seeks to present a procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim that depends on facts outside the state-court record\xe2\x80\x94remains open for the Fifth Circuit to consider on remand.

Petitioner moved for funding under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0), which makes funds available if they are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d but petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion was denied.  We hold that the lower courts applied the wrong legal standard, and we therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 1997, petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a Texas court.  Evidence at trial showed that he and two accomplices invaded the home of a 67-year-old Houston woman, Santiaga Paneque, bound her with duct tape and electrical cord, beat and strangled her, and then made off with a stash of her belongings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury also heard testimony from Henry Nuila regarding an incident that occurred about two weeks after the murder.  Petitioner was drunk at the time, and he revealed to Nuila that he had recently murdered a woman in Houston.  Petitioner then brandished an Uzi machinegun and threatened to murder Nuila if he did not help petitioner kill his two accomplices.  Fortunately for Nuila, petitioner kept talking until he eventually passed out; Nuila then called the police, who arrested petitioner, still in possession of the gun.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the jury found petitioner guilty, it was asked to determine whether he should be sentenced to death or to life in prison.  In order to impose a death sentence, Texas law required the jury to answer the following three questions.  First, would petitioner pose a continuing threat to society?  Second, had he personally caused the death of the victim, intended to kill her, or anticipated that she would be killed?  Third, in light of all the evidence surrounding the crime and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s background, were there sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of life without parole instead of death?  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(b), (e) (Vernon Cum. Supp. 2017).  Only if the jury gave a unanimous yes to the first two questions, and a unanimous no to the third question, could a death sentence be imposed; otherwise, petitioner would receive a sentence of life without parole.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(d)(2), (f\xc2\xa0)(2), (g).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In asking the jury to impose a death sentence, the prosecution supplemented the trial record with evidence of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s criminal record and his encounter with a man named Candelario Martinez a few days after the murder.  Martinez told the jury that he was standing in a hotel parking lot waiting for a friend when petitioner approached and began to make small talk.  Before long, petitioner pulled out a machinegun and forced Martinez into a room where two of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s compatriots were holding Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s friend at knifepoint.  Ordered to lie down on the bathroom floor and await his execution, Martinez begged for his life while petitioner and his cohorts haggled about who would carry out the killing.  Finally, petitioner relented, but he threatened to kill Martinez and his family if he contacted the police.  Petitioner then stole Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s truck.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel presented very little mitigation evidence.  This was due, at least in part, to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s steadfast refusal for many months to allow his lawyers to contact his family members, who were living in Honduras and might have testified about his character and upbringing.  Petitioner gave in on the eve of trial, and at that point, according to the state habeas courts, his lawyers \xe2\x80\x9cmade every effort to contact [his] family.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 171.  They repeatedly contacted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s family members and urged them to attend the trial; they requested that the U.\xc2\xa0S. Embassy in Honduras facilitate family members\xe2\x80\x99 travel to the United States; and they met in person with the Honduran Consulate to seek assistance.  But these efforts were to no avail.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sister told his legal team that the family would not leave Honduras because the journey would create economic hardship and because their father was ill and had killed one of their neighbors.  A defense attorney who spoke to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mother testified that she seemed unconcerned about her son\xe2\x80\x99s situation.  In general, the state habeas courts found, petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cdid nothing to assist counsel\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to contact his family and did not want them contacted by the consulate or counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 174.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the end, the only mitigation evidence introduced by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel consisted of three letters from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s English instructor.  The letters, each two sentences long, described petitioner as \xe2\x80\x9ca serious and attentive student who is progressing well in English.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury unanimously concluded that petitioner should be sentenced to death, and a capital sentence was imposed.  Petitioner secured new counsel to handle his appeal, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 1998.  <i>Ayestas</i> v. <i>State</i>, No. 72,928, App. 115.  Petitioner did not seek review at that time from this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal was still pending, a third legal team filed a habeas petition on his behalf in state court.  This petition included several claims of trial-level ineffective assistance of counsel, but the petition did not assert that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental health and abuse of alcohol and drugs.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s quest for state habeas relief ended unsuccessfully in 2008.  <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> <i>Ayestas</i>, No. WR\xe2\x80\x9369,674\xe2\x80\x9301 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App., Sept. 10, 2008), 2008 WL 4151814 (<i>per curiam</i>) (unpublished).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2009, represented by a fourth set of attorneys, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, and this time he <i>did</i> allege that his right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial was violated because his attorneys failed to conduct an adequate search for mitigation evidence.  As relevant here, petitioner argued that trial counsel overlooked evidence that he was mentally ill and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.  <i>Ayestas </i>v. <i>Thaler</i>, Civ. Action No. H\xe2\x80\x9309\xe2\x80\x932999 (SD Tex., Jan. 26, 2011), 2011 WL 285138, *4.  Petitioner alleged that he had a history of substance abuse, and he noted that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia while the state habeas proceeding was still pending.  See Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in <i>Ayestas</i> v. <i>Quarterman</i>, No. 4:09\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x932999 (SD Tex.), Doc. 1, pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  Petitioner claimed that trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance caused prejudice because there was a reasonable chance that an adequate investigation would have produced mitigation evidence that would have persuaded the jury to spare his life.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Among the obstacles standing between petitioner and federal habeas relief, however, was the fact that he never raised this trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in state court.  The District Court therefore held that the claim was barred by procedural default, <i>Ayestas </i>v. <i>Thaler</i>, 2011 WL 285138, *4\xe2\x80\x93*7, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, <i>Ayestas </i>v. <i>Thaler</i>, 462 Fed. Appx. 474, 482 (2012) (<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner sought review in this Court, and we vacated the decision below and remanded for reconsideration in light of two of our subsequent decisions, <i>Martinez</i> v. <i>Ryan</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2012)\n, and <i>Trevino </i>v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 413 (2013)\n.  <i>Ayestas</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1015 (2013)\n.  <i>Martinez</i> held that an Arizona prisoner seeking federal habeas relief could overcome the procedural default of a trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by showing that the claim is substantial and that state habeas counsel was also ineffective in failing to raise the claim in a state habeas proceeding.  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 14.  <i>Trevino</i> extended that holding to Texas prisoners, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 416\xe2\x80\x93417, and on remand, petitioner argued that he fell within <i>Trevino</i> because effective state habeas counsel would have uncovered evidence showing that trial counsels\xe2\x80\x99 investigative efforts were deficient.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To assist in developing these claims, petitioner filed an <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> motion asking the District Court for $20,016 in funding to conduct a search for evidence supporting his petition.  He relied on\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0), which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cUpon a finding that investigative, expert, or other services are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant, whether in connection with issues relating to guilt or the sentence, the court may authorize the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys to obtain such services on behalf of the defendant and, if so authorized, shall order the payment of fees and expenses therefor.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner averred that the funds would be used to conduct an investigation that would show that his trial counsel and his state habeas counsel were ineffective.  Accordingly, he claimed, the investigation would establish both that his trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not barred by procedural default and that he was entitled to resentencing based on the denial of his\n \nSixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court refused the funding request and ultimately denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.  <i>Ayestas </i>v. <i>Stephens</i>, Civ. Action No. H\xe2\x80\x9309\xe2\x80\x932999, (SD Tex., Nov. 18, 2014), 2014 WL 6606498, *6\xe2\x80\x93*7.  On the merits of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s new ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, the District Court held that petitioner failed both prongs of the <i>Strickland</i> test.  See <i>Strickland </i>v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984)\n.  Noting that most of the evidence bearing on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental health had emerged only after he was sentenced, the court concluded that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial lawyers were not deficient in failing to find such evidence in time for the sentencing proceeding.  2014 WL 6606498, *5.  In addition, the court found that state habeas counsel did not render deficient performance by failing to investigate petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s history of substance abuse, and that, in any event, petitioner was not prejudiced at the sentencing phase of the trial or during the state habeas proceedings because the potential mitigation evidence at issue would not have made a difference to the jury in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe extremely brutal nature of [the] crime and [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] history of criminal violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect to funding, the District Court pointed to  Fifth Circuit case law holding that a \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0) funding applicant cannot show that investigative services are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d unless the applicant can show that he has a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial need\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for those services.  <i>Id.,</i> at *6.  In addition, the court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Fifth Circuit upholds the denial of funding\xe2\x80\x9d when, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ca petitioner has .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. failed to supplement his funding request with a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given its holding that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s new ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was precluded by procedural default, this rule also doomed his request for funding.

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that a COA was not needed for review of the funding issue, but it rejected that claim for essentially the same reasons as the District Court, citing both the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial need\xe2\x80\x9d test and the rule that funding may be denied when a funding applicant fails to present \xe2\x80\x9ca viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ayestas </i>v. <i>Stephens</i>, 817 F.\xc2\xa03d 888, 895\xe2\x80\x93896 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Such administrative decisions are not the kind of decisions or orders\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> decisions or orders made in a judicial capacity\xe2\x80\x94to which the relevant jurisdictional provisions apply.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent argues that the denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s funding request was just such an administrative decision, but the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling does not remotely resemble the sort of administrative decisions noted above.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request was made by motion in his federal habeas proceeding, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding.  And as we will explain, resolution of the funding question requires the application of a legal standard\xe2\x80\x94whether the funding is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d for effective representation\xe2\x80\x94that demands an evaluation of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of obtaining habeas relief.  We have never held that a ruling like that is administrative and thus not subject to appellate review under the standard jurisdictional provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent claims that two factors support the conclusion that the funding decision was administrative, but her argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondent first argues as follows: Judicial proceedings must be adversarial;\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0) funding adjudications are not adversarial because the statute allows requests to be decided <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i>; therefore, \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0) funding adjudications are not judicial in nature.  This reasoning is flawed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is certainly true that cases and controversies in our legal system are adversarial in nature, <i>e.g., Bond </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211,\n217 (2011)\n; <i>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Haworth</i>,\n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227\n\xe2\x80\x93241 (1937), but here, both the habeas proceeding as a whole and the adjudication of the specific issue of funding were adversarial.  That the habeas proceeding was adversarial is beyond dispute.  And on the funding question, petitioner and respondent plainly have adverse interests and have therefore squared off as adversaries.  The motion for funding was formally noted as \xe2\x80\x9copposed\xe2\x80\x9d on the Disrict Court\xe2\x80\x99s docket.  App. 341.  That is not surprising: On one side, petitioner is seeking funding that he hopes will prevent his execution.  On the other, respondent wants to enforce the judgment of the Texas courts and to do so without undue delay.  Petitioner and respondent have vigorously litigated the funding question all the way to this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In arguing that the funding dispute is nonadversarial, respondent attaches too much importance to the fact that the request was made <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i>.  As we have noted, the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> nature of a proceeding has not been thought to imply that an act otherwise within a judge\xe2\x80\x99s lawful jurisdiction was deprived of its judicial character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Forrester</i> v. <i>White</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219,\n227 (1988)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In our adversary system, <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> motions are disfavored, but they have their place.  See, <i>e.g., Hohn</i>,<i> supra,</i> at 248 (application for COA); <i>Dalia</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238,\n255 (1979)\n (application for a search warrant);\n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71805(a) (application to conduct electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence);\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72518(3) (applications to intercept \xe2\x80\x9cwire, oral, or electronic communications\xe2\x80\x9d);\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71116(d)(1)(A) (application to seize certain goods and counterfeit marks involved in violations of the trademark laws); Fed.

See <i>Hohn</i>, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 249; <i>Tutun </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n270 U.\xc2\xa0S. 568,\n577 (1926)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s second argument is based on the vener- able principle \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress cannot vest review of the decisions of Article III courts in\xe2\x80\x9d entities other than \xe2\x80\x9csuperior courts in the Article III hierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc</i>.,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211\n\xe2\x80\x93219 (1995) (citing <i>Hayburn\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, 2 Dall. 409 (1792)).  Respondent claims that \xc2\xa73599 funding decisions may be revised by the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts and that this shows that such decisions must be administrative.  This argument, however, rests on a faulty premise.  Nothing in \xc2\xa73599 even hints that review by the Director of the Administrative Office is allowed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests in part on a handful of old lower court cases that appear to have accepted Administrative Office review of Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (CJA) payments that had been authorized by a District Court and approved by the chief judge of the relevant Circuit.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Aadal</i>, 282 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 664, 665 (SDNY 1968); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Gast</i>, 297 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 620, 621\xe2\x80\x93622 (Del. 1969); see also <i>United States </i>v. <i>Hunter</i>, 385 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 358, 362 (DC 1974).  The basis for these decisions was a provision of the CJA,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A(h) (1964 ed.), stating that CJA payments \xe2\x80\x9cshall be made under the supervision of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is not clear whether these decisions correctly interpreted the CJA,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] but in any event, no similar language appears in \xc2\xa73599.  And respondent has not identified a single instance in which the Director of the Administrative Office or any other nonjudicial officer has attempted to review or alter a \xc2\xa73599 decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 requests for CJA funds are markedly different from the funding application at issue here.  Attorneys appointed under the CJA typically submit those requests after the conclusion of the case, and the prosecution has no stake in the resolution of the matter.  The judgment in the criminal case cannot be affected by a decision on compensation for services that have been completed, and any funds awarded come out of the budget of the Judiciary, not the Executive.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A(i) (2012 ed.).  Thus, the adversaries in the criminal case are not pitted against each other.  In this case, on the other hand, as we have explained, petitioner and respondent have strong adverse interests.  For these reasons, we reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the adjudication of the funding issue is nonadversarial and administrative.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent, however, claims that the funding decision is administrative for an additional reason.  \xe2\x80\x9cA \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0) funding determination is properly deemed administrative,\xe2\x80\x9d she contends, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be revised outside the traditional Article III judicial hierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 23.  The basis for this argument is a provision of \xc2\xa73599 stating that funding in excess of the generally applicable statutory cap of $7,500 must be approved by the chief judge of the circuit or another designated circuit judge.  \xc2\xa73599(g)(2).  If a funding decision is judicial and not administrative, respondent suggests, it could not be reviewed by a single circuit judge as opposed to a panel of three.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument confuses what is familiar with what is constitutionally required.  Nothing in the Constitution ties Congress to the typical structure of appellate review established by statute.  If Congress wishes to make certain rulings reviewable by a single circuit judge, rather than a panel of three, the Constitution does not stand in the way.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Satisfied that we have jurisdiction, we turn to the question whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct legal standard when it affirmed the denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s funding request.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 3599(a) authorizes federal courts to provide funding to a party who is facing the prospect of a death sentence and is \xe2\x80\x9cfinancially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reason- ably necessary services.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute applies to defendants in federal cases, \xc2\xa73599(a)(1), as well as to state and federal prisoners seeking collateral relief in federal court, \xc2\xa73599(a)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here we are concerned not with legal representation but with services provided by experts, investigators, and the like.  Such services must be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary for the representation of the [applicant]\xe2\x80\x9d in order to be eligible for funding.  \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0).  If the statutory standard is met, a court \xe2\x80\x9cmay authorize the [applicant\xe2\x80\x99s] attorneys to obtain such services on [his] behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit has held that individuals seeking funding for such services must show that they have a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial need\xe2\x80\x9d for the services.  817 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 896; <i>Allen </i>v.<i> Stephens</i>, 805 F.\xc2\xa03d 617, 626 (2015); <i>Ward </i>v.<i> Stephens</i>, 777 F.\xc2\xa03d 250, 266, cert. denied, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  Petitioner contends that this interpretation is more demanding than the standard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94set out in the statute.  And although the difference between the two formulations may not be great, petitioner has a point.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the strictest sense of the term, something is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d only if it is essential.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1510 (1993) (something is necessary if it \xe2\x80\x9cmust be by reason of the nature of things,\xe2\x80\x9d if it \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be otherwise by reason of inherent qualities\xe2\x80\x9d); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 275\xe2\x80\x93276 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (defining the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d).  But in ordinary speech, the term is often used more loosely to refer to something that is merely important or strongly desired.  (\xe2\x80\x9cI need a vacation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cI need to catch up with an old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d)  The term is sometimes used in a similar way in the law.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d in the Necessary and Proper Clause does not mean \xe2\x80\x9c<i>absolutely</i> necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 414\xe2\x80\x93415 (1819), and a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d business expense under the Internal Revenue Code,\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7162(a), may be an expense that is merely helpful and appropriate, <i>Commissioner</i> v. <i>Tellier</i>,\n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 687,\n689 (1966)\n.  As Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary puts it, the term \xe2\x80\x9cmay import absolute physical necessity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or conducive to the end sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979) (Black\xe2\x80\x99s).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 3599 appears to use the term \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to mean something less than essential.  The provision applies to services that are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d but it makes little sense to refer to something as being \xe2\x80\x9creasonably essential.\xe2\x80\x9d  What the statutory phrase calls for, we conclude, is a determination by the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, as to whether a reasonable attorney would regard the services as sufficiently important, guided by the considerations we set out more fully below.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csubstantial need\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is arguably more demanding.  We may assume that the term \xe2\x80\x9cneed\xe2\x80\x9d is comparable to \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, that something is \xe2\x80\x9cneeded\xe2\x80\x9d if it is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d suggests a heavier burden than the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9creasonably.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare 13 OED 291 (defining \xe2\x80\x9creasonably\xe2\x80\x9d to mean, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ufficiently, suitably, fairly\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]airly or pretty well\xe2\x80\x9d) with 17 <i>id</i>.<i>,</i> at 66\xe2\x80\x9367 (defining \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to \xe2\x80\x9creasons, causes, evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly or solidly established\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1456 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]air, proper, or moderate under the circumstances .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

In those cases in which funding stands a credible chance of enabling a habeas petitioner to overcome the obstacle of procedural default, it may be error for a district court to refuse funding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress has made it clear, however, that district courts have broad discretion in assessing requests for funding.  Section 3599\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor declared that district courts \xe2\x80\x9cshall authorize\xe2\x80\x9d funding for services deemed \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7848(q)(9) (1988 ed.).  Applying this provision, courts of appeals reviewed district court funding decisions for abuse of discretion.  <i>E.g.,</i> <i>Bonin </i>v.<i> Calderon</i>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d 815, 837 (CA9 1995); <i>In re Lindsey</i>, 875 F.\xc2\xa02d 1502, 1507, n. 4 (CA11 1989); <i>United States </i>v.<i> Alden</i>, 767 F.\xc2\xa02d 314, 319 (CA7 1984).  Then, as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\n\n110Stat.\n1226, Congress changed the verb from \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmay,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus made it perfectly clear that determining whether funding is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d is a decision as to which district courts enjoy broad discretion.  See <i>Kingdomware Technologies, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A natural consideration informing the exercise of that discretion is the likelihood that the contemplated services will help the applicant win relief.  After all, the proposed services must be \xe2\x80\x9c<i>reasonably</i> necessary\xe2\x80\x9d for the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s representation, and it would not be reasonable\xe2\x80\x94in fact, it would be quite unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94to think that services are necessary to the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s representation if, realistically speaking, they stand little hope of helping him win relief.  Proper application of the \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d standard thus requires courts to consider the potential merit of the claims that the applicant wants to pursue, the likelihood that the services will generate useful and admissible evidence, and the prospect that the applicant will be able to clear any procedural hurdles standing in the way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be clear, a funding applicant must not be expected to <i>prove</i> that he will be able to win relief if given the services he seeks.  But the \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d test requires an assessment of the likely utility of the services requested, and \xc2\xa73599(f\xc2\xa0) cannot be read to guarantee that an applicant will have enough money to turn over every stone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner does not deny this.

We do not have jurisdiction if jurisdiction was lacking in the Court of Appeals, and the jurisdiction of a court of appeals to entertain an appeal from a final order in a habeas proceeding is dependent on the issuance of a COA.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c)(l); <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134,\n142 (2012)\n. In this case, petitioner appealed an order of the District Court that denied both his request for funding under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599 and his underlying habeas claims.  The Court of Appeals denied a COA as to the merits of his request for habeas relief but held that a COA was not required insofar as petitioner challenged the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of funding under \xc2\xa73599.  The Fifth Circuit relied on <i>Harbison</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 180 (2009)\n, in which a prisoner appealed from an order that denied counsel under \xc2\xa73599 for a state clemency proceeding but that did not address the merits of any habeas petition.  This Court held that a COA was not required.  Here, petitioner took his appeal from the final order in his habeas proceeding. The parties have not briefed whether that difference between <i>Harbison </i>and the present case is relevant or whether an appeal from a denial of a \xc2\xa73599 request for funding would fit within the COA framework, and we find it unnecessary to resolve the issue.  Though we take no view on the merits, we will assume for the sake of argument that the Court of Appeals could not entertain petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa73599 claim without the issuance of a COA. We may review the denial of a COA by the lower courts.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Cockrell</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322\n\xe2\x80\x93327 (2003).  When the lower courts deny a COA and we conclude that their reason for doing so was flawed, we may reverse and remand so that the correct legal standard may be applied.  See <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 473\n\xe2\x80\x93486, 489\xe2\x80\x93490 (2000).  We take that course here.

That should come as no surprise, as the Fifth Circuit required capital habeas petitioners to show a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial need\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for services, when the statute requires only a showing that the services are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonably necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 16.  \xe2\x80\x9cSubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, imposes a higher burden than \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 16.  The Fifth Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cexacerbated the problem\xe2\x80\x9d by requiring a showing of \xe2\x80\x9ca viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally barred,\xe2\x80\x9d which ignores \xe2\x80\x9cthat investigation might enable a petitioner .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to overcome the obstacle of procedural default.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Specifically, Ayestas claims that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to conduct an investigation of his mental health and substance abuse, which could have been presented at the penalty phase of the trial to convince the jury to spare his life.  As the Court notes, however, Ayestas faces a hurdle in presenting this ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in his federal habeas petition, as his state postconviction counsel never presented that claim in the Texas collateral proceedings.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To overcome that procedural default, Ayestas relies on <i>Martinez</i> v. <i>Ryan</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2012)\n, and <i>Trevino</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 413 (2013)\n.  In those cases, this Court recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular concern\xe2\x80\x9d in the application of a procedural default rule that would prevent a petitioner from \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[ing] a claim of trial error,\xe2\x80\x9d especially \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the claim is one of ineffective assistance of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Martinez</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 12.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe right to the effective assistance of counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cis a bedrock principle in our justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court thus held that where the \xe2\x80\x9cstate procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was ineffective.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trevino</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 429 (quoting <i>Martinez</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17; alteration omitted).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Therefore, the fact that Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 postconviction counsel failed to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in state court does not bar federal review of that claim if Ayestas can show that the \xe2\x80\x9cattorney in his first collateral proceeding was ineffective\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9chis claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 18.  The substantiality of the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim and the ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel are both analyzed under the familiar framework set out in <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cIneffective assistance under <i>Strickland</i> is deficient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, with performance being measured against an objective standard of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Beard</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374,\n380 (2005)\n (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Remember, however, the specific context in which ineffective assistance is being considered in Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 case: a request under \xc2\xa73599(f) for investigative services, which requires a showing only that \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney would regard the services as sufficiently important.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  Ayestas is not \xe2\x80\x9cexpected to <i>prove</i> that he will be able to win relief if given the services he seeks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 18 (emphasis in original).  A court simply must consider at this stage \xe2\x80\x9cthe potential merit of the claims that the applicant wants to pursue, the likelihood that the services will generate useful and admissible evidence, and the prospect that the applicant will be able to clear any procedural hurdles standing in the way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  Thus, the inquiry is not whether Ayestas can prove that his trial counsel was ineffective under <i>Strickland</i> or whether he will succeed in overcoming the procedural default under <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino</i>.  Rather, at this \xc2\xa73599(f) request stage, the focus is on the potential merit of these claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With this framework in mind, the focus first is on the evidence of the deficient performance of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 state-appointed counsel.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Trial counsel secured the appointment of an investigator, who met with Ayestas shortly after the appointment.  For nearly 15 months, however, there was apparently no investigation into Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 history in preparation for trial.  Counsel instructed the investi- gator \xe2\x80\x9cto resume investigation\xe2\x80\x9d only about a month before jury selection.  Record 878.  The investigator then subpoenaed psychological and disciplinary prison records and had Ayestas fill out a questionnaire, in response to which Ayestas revealed that he had experienced multiple head traumas and had a history of substance abuse.  Jail records also noted a rules infraction for possession of home-made intoxicants.  Trial counsel never followed up on any of this information, sought further related records, or had Ayestas evaluated by a mental health professional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">About two weeks before jury selection, trial counsel for the first time reached out to Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 family in Honduras.  Shortly thereafter, five days before trial, counsel wrote Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 family stating that she needed them to come testify.  Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 family agreed, but they indicated that they could not obtain visas because a letter that trial counsel was supposed to have sent to the U.\xc2\xa0S. Embassy to facilitate their travel never arrived, and ultimately no family members appeared at Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 trial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The guilt phase lasted two days, and trial counsel presented no witnesses.  The penalty phase lasted less than a day, and trial counsel presented two minutes of mitigation evidence consisting of three letters from an instructor who taught English classes to Ayestas in prison, attesting that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca serious and attentive student.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 41\xe2\x80\x9343.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On this record, Ayestas has made a strong showing that trial counsel was deficient.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unquestioned that under the prevailing professional norms at the time of [Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99] trial, counsel had an obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of [his] background.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Porter</i> v. <i>McCollum</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30,\n39 (2009)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 trial counsel \xe2\x80\x9cclearly did not satisfy those norms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  With a client facing a possible death sentence, counsel and her investigator did not start looking into Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 personal history until the eve of trial.  The little the investigator uncovered\xe2\x80\x94head trauma and a history of substance abuse\xe2\x80\x94should have prompted further inquiry.  Yet trial counsel did nothing.  Even if Ayestas prohibited counsel from contacting his family in Honduras until the start of trial was imminent, see <i>ante,</i> at 3,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] that still would not explain why counsel failed to perform any other mitigation investigation, see <i>Porter</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 40 (noting that even if the defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cuncooperative, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that does not obviate the need for defense counsel to conduct <i>some </i>sort of mitigation investigation (emphasis in original)).  In the end, the decision to sentence Ayestas to death was made in less than one day, and his counsel spent less than two minutes presenting mitigation to the jury.  <i>Two minutes</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has recognized that the decision not to present mitigation may be supported in certain cases by \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d provided the reviewing court is satisfied with \xe2\x80\x9cthe adequacy of the investigations supporting those judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510,\n521 (2003)\n.  But this does not appear to be one of those cases.  There is nothing in the record that would support the conclusion that counsel chose the two-minutes-of-mitigation strategy after careful investigation and consideration of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 case.  Instead, counsel for the most part \xe2\x80\x9cdid not even take the first step of interviewing witnesses or requesting records\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which [they] should have been aware.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Porter</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 39\xe2\x80\x9340.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In evaluating the potential merit of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 claim, the Fifth Circuit misapplied <i>Strickland</i> and the \xc2\xa73599(f) standard.  It reasoned that Ayestas had not presented a viable claim that trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 mental illness because, as he was not diagnosed with schizophrenia until his time in prison, there was nothing that flagged mental illness issues prior to trial.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  See <i>Ayestas</i> v. <i>Stephens</i>, 817 F.\xc2\xa03d 888, 895\xe2\x80\x93897 (2016) (<i>per curiam</i>).  The absence of a documented diagnosis, however, did not excuse trial counsel from their \xe2\x80\x9cobligation to conduct a thorough investigation of [Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99] background.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Porter</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In fact, the obligation to investigate exists in part precisely because it is all too common for individuals to go years battling an undiagnosed and untreated mental illness.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, the Fifth Circuit failed to consider that one of the purposes of the \xc2\xa73599(f) investigation was to look at Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 life around the time of the crime and trial to determine if there were mitigating circumstances that trial counsel could have discovered, such as whether symptoms of his schizophrenia had begun to manifest even before his diagnosis.  The Court makes clear today that in evaluating \xc2\xa73599(f) funding requests, courts must consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe likelihood that the services will generate useful and admissible evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 17.  It was error, therefore, for the Fifth Circuit to evaluate the merit of the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim and to deny \xc2\xa73599(f) funding based solely on an evaluation of the evidence in the record at the time of the request, without evaluating the potential evidence that Ayestas sought.  <i>Ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The evidence concerning the deficiency of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 state postconviction counsel is similarly strong.  State postconviction counsel retained the services of a mitigation specialist, who prepared an investigation plan noting that it was \xe2\x80\x9cobvious no social history investigation was conducted\xe2\x80\x9d and that the jury had \xe2\x80\x9cheard nothing about [Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. mental health, possible mental illness, [or] substance abuse history.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 81, 266.  The plan also noted that it was \xe2\x80\x9cclear that [Ayestas] had a history of substance abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 721; see also App. 267.  The specialist recommended a comprehensive investigation into Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 biological, psychological, and social history to explore, <i>inter alia</i>, issues related to addiction and mental health.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">State postconviction counsel failed to follow these recommendations.  He did nothing to investigate issues related to Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 mental health or substance abuse.  Notably, Ayestas suffered a psychotic episode and was diagnosed with schizophrenia while his state postconviction application was pending.  Moreover, in 2003, a counsel-arranged evaluation pursuant <i>Atkins</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304 (2002)\n, noted concerns about Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdelusional thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 139\xe2\x80\x93140.  These events still did not prompt counsel to investigate Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 mental health history.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, state postconviction counsel explored the circumstances of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, conducted some juror interviews, and interviewed Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 mother and sisters, obtaining affidavits regarding Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 upbringing in Honduras and their interactions with trial counsel.  Postconviction counsel eventually filed an application that contained a narrow claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel with respect to mitigation regarding the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 failure to secure the attendance of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 family members at trial.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied the application, relying on the affidavit submitted by trial counsel, see n.\xc2\xa04, <i>supra</i>, to find no ineffectiveness in failing to get Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 family to attend trial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit concluded that Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 state postconviction counsel was not ineffective because, in its view, Ayestas had not established any deficiency at trial in the failure to investigate mental health and substance abuse mitigation.  See 817 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 898.  That conclusion, as noted in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>, was based on a misapplication of <i>Strickland</i> and the \xc2\xa73599(f) standard, and thus cannot support a finding that the failure to present the claim in postconviction proceedings was \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic.\xe2\x80\x9d  817 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 898.  Nor is there anything else in the record that would excuse that deficiency.  State postconviction counsel ignored his own mitigation specialist, who alerted him to a serious failing in the trial because the jury heard virtually no mitigation and to the serious failings of trial counsel because of the failure to conduct a social history investigation of Ayestas.  Even after Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 psychotic episode, schizophrenia diagnosis, and documented tendencies of \xe2\x80\x9cdelusional thinking\xe2\x80\x9d during the course of the representation, state postconviction counsel did nothing.  As with trial counsel, the record provides no support for any \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic justification\xe2\x80\x9d to disregard completely a mitigation investigation of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 mental health and substance abuse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Strickland</i> next requires consideration of prejudice.  To establish prejudice, this Court has held that a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 694.  In cases alleging a failure to investigate mitigation, as here, the Court must \xe2\x80\x9creweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wiggins</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 534.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even with the scant evidence in the record at this time as to what Ayestas could have presented to the jury in the form of mitigation, Ayestas has made a strong showing that his claim has potential merit.  That trial counsel presented only two minutes of mitigation already goes a long way to establishing prejudice.  In fact, the State emphasized to the jury at sentencing:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he have anything there that would lead you to conclude there is some type of mitigation, anything at all?  There is no drug problem .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no health problem .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no alcohol problem.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [O]nly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. these three pieces of paper .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  Making steps to learn a second language does not lessen his moral blameworthiness .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 4747.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State, in contrast, presented evidence of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 criminal history as well as victim impact testimony.  After deliberating for only 25 minutes, the jury assessed a punishment of death against Ayestas, finding that he was a future danger, that he intended to cause death or anticipated the loss of life, and that there were no mitigating circumstances that warranted imposition of a life sentence over a death sentence.  Had just one juror dissented on a single one of these findings, no death sentence could have been imposed.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \xc2\xa72(g) (Vernon Cum. Supp. 2017); see also <i>ante,</i> at 2.  With even minimal investigation by trial counsel, at least one may well have, as this Court has held that evidence of mental illness and substance abuse is relevant to assessing moral culpability.  See <i>Rompilla</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 393; <i>Porter</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  Instead, the jury \xe2\x80\x9cheard almost nothing that would humanize [him] or allow them to accurately gauge his moral culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 41.  There is thus good reason to believe that, were Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa73599(f) motion granted, he could establish prejudice under <i>Strickland</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit held otherwise based on its belief that no amount of mitigation would have changed the outcome of the sentencing given the \xe2\x80\x9cbrutality of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  817 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 898.  That \xe2\x80\x9cbrutality of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d rationale is simply contrary to our directive in case after case that, in assessing prejudice, a court must \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the totality of the available mitigation evidence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and reweigh it against the evidence in aggravation.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Porter</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 41 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see also <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362\n\xe2\x80\x93398 (2000); <i>Wiggins</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 534.  By considering aggravation in isolation, the Fifth Circuit directly contravened this fundamental principle.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, Ayestas has made a strong showing that he is entitled to \xc2\xa73599(f) funding.  As the Court notes, the statute affords district courts some discretion in these funding determinations, even where a petitioner shows the services are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonably necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  Exercise of that discretion may be appropriate if there is a showing of gamesmanship or where the State has provided funding for the same investigation services, as Ayestas conceded at argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.  Nonetheless, the troubling failures of counsel at both the trial and state postconviction stages of Ayestas\xe2\x80\x99 case are exactly the types of facts that should prompt courts to afford investigatory services to ensure that trial errors that go to a \xe2\x80\x9cbedrock principle in our justice system\xe2\x80\x9d do not go unaddressed.  <i>Martinez</i>,<i> </i>566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 12.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court also declines to consider arguments that respondent advanced that were neither presented nor passed on below.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19. </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The reason for this exception is evident.
