He sought habeas relief in Georgia Superior Court, claiming that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness during sentencing violated the\n \nSixth Amendment.  The court denied the petition, in relevant part, because it concluded that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not deficient and had not prejudiced Wilson.  The Georgia Supreme Court summarily denied his application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal.  Wilson subsequently filed a federal habeas petition, raising the same ineffective-assistance claim.  The District Court assumed that his counsel was deficient but deferred to the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that any deficiencies did not prejudice Wilson.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  First, however, the panel concluded that the District Court was wrong to \xe2\x80\x9clook though\xe2\x80\x9d the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s unexplained decision and assume that it rested on the grounds given in the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, rather than ask what arguments \xe2\x80\x9ccould have supported\xe2\x80\x9d the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s summary decision.  The en banc court agreed with the panel\xe2\x80\x99s methodology.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A federal habeas court reviewing an unexplained state-court decision on the merits should \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d that decision to the last related state-court decision that provides a relevant rationale and presume that the unexplained decision adopted the same reasoning.

In <i>Ylst</i>, where the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposed a procedural default, the Court presumed that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Since <i>Ylst</i>, every Circuit to have considered the matter, but for the Eleventh Circuit, has applied a \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption even where the state courts did not apply a procedural bar to review, and most Circuits applied the presumption prior to <i>Ylst</i>.  The presumption is often realistic, for state higher courts often issue summary decisions when they have examined the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning and found nothing significant with which they disagree.  The presumption also is often more efficiently applied than a contrary approach that would require a federal court to imagine what might have been the state court\xe2\x80\x99s supportive reasoning. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The State argues that <i>Harrington</i> v. <i>Richter,</i>\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86\n, controls here and that <i>Ylst </i>should apply, at most, where the federal habeas court is trying to determine whether a state-court decision without opinion rested on a state procedural ground or whether the state court reached the merits of a federal issue.  <i>Richter</i>, however, did not directly concern the issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94whether to \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the silent state higher court opinion to the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned opinion in order to determine the reasons for the higher court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  In <i>Richter</i>, there was no lower court opinion to look to.  And <i>Richter</i> does not say that <i>Ylst</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning does not apply in the context of an unexplained decision on the merits.  Indeed, this Court has \xe2\x80\x9clooked though\xe2\x80\x9d to lower court decisions in cases involving the merits.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Premo</i> v. <i>Moore,</i>\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115, 123\n\xe2\x80\x93133.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s further arguments are unconvincing.  It points out that the \xe2\x80\x9clook though\xe2\x80\x9d presumption may not accurately identify the grounds for a higher court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption is not an absolute rule.  Additional evidence that might not be sufficient to rebut the presumption in a case like <i>Ylst</i>, where the lower court rested on a state-law procedural ground, would allow a federal court to conclude that counsel has rebutted the presumption in a case decided on the merits.  For instance, a federal court may conclude that the presumption is rebutted where counsel identifies convincing alternative arguments for affirmance that were made to the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, or equivalent evidence such as an alternative ground that is obvious in the state-court record.  The State also argues that this Court does not necessarily presume that a federal court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 silent opinion adopts the reasoning of the court below, but that is a different context.  Were there to be a \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach as a general matter in that context, judges and lawyers might read those decisions as creating, through silence, binding circuit precedent.  Here, a federal court \xe2\x80\x9clooks through\xe2\x80\x9d the silent decision for a specific and narrow purpose, to identify the grounds for the higher court\xe2\x80\x99s decision as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act requires.  Nor does the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach show disrespect for the States; rather, it seeks to replicate the grounds for the higher state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Finally, the \xe2\x80\x9clook though\xe2\x80\x9d approach is unlikely to lead state courts to write full opinions where they would have preferred to decide summarily, at least not to any significant degree.

In that case, a federal habeas court simply reviews the specific reasons given by the state court and defers to those reasons if they are reasonable.  We have affirmed this approach time and again.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Porter</i> v. <i>McCollum</i>,558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30, 39\xe2\x80\x9344 (2009) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Beard</i>,545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374, 388\xe2\x80\x93392 (2005); <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510, 523\xe2\x80\x93538 (2003).</p><p>The issue before us, however, is more difficult.  It concerns how a federal habeas court is to find the state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons when the relevant state-court decision on the merits, say, a state supreme court decision, does not come accompanied with those reasons.  For instance, the decision may consist of a one-word order, such as \xe2\x80\x9caffirmed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdenied.\xe2\x80\x9d  What then is the federal habeas court to do?   We hold that the federal court should \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the unexplained decision to the last related state-court decision that does provide a relevant rationale.  It should then presume that the unexplained decision adopted the same reasoning.  But the State may rebut the presumption by showing that the unexplained affirmance relied or most likely did rely on different grounds than the lower state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, such as alternative grounds for affirmance that were briefed or argued to the state supreme court or obvious in the record it reviewed.  </p><p>I</p><p>In 1997 a Georgia jury convicted petitioner, Marion Wilson, of murder and related crimes.  After a sentencing hearing, the jury sentenced Wilson to death.  In 1999 the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence, <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 271 Ga. 811, 525 S. E. 2d 339 (1999), and this Court denied his petition for certiorari, <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Georgia</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 838 (2000).</p><p>Wilson then filed a petition for habeas corpus in a state court, the Superior Court for Butts County.  Among other things, he claimed that his counsel was \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d during his sentencing, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  See <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668, 687 (1984) (setting forth \xe2\x80\x9ctwo components\xe2\x80\x9d of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim: \xe2\x80\x9cthat counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense\xe2\x80\x9d).  Wilson identified new evidence that he argued trial counsel should have introduced at sentencing, namely, testimony from various witnesses about Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s childhood and the impairment of the frontal lobe of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s brain.</p><p>After a hearing, the state habeas court denied the petition in relevant part because it thought Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s evidence did not show that counsel was \xe2\x80\x9cdeficient,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in any event, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find and present the new evidence that Wilson offered had not prejudiced Wilson.  <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Terry</i>, No. 2001\xe2\x80\x93v\xe2\x80\x9338 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Dec. 1, 2008), App. 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, that was because the new evidence was \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible on evidentiary grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9ccumulative of other testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise would not have, in reasonable probability, changed the outcome of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 61.  Wilson applied to the Georgia Supreme Court for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But the Georgia Supreme Court denied the application without any explanatory opinion.  <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Terry</i>, No. 2001\xe2\x80\x93v\xe2\x80\x9338 (May 3, 2010), App. 87, cert. denied,562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1093 (2010).</p><p>Wilson subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.  He made what was essentially the same \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  After a hearing, the District Court denied Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Humphrey</i>, No. 5:10\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93489 (Dec. 19, 2013), App. 88\xe2\x80\x9389.  The court assumed that Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had indeed been \xe2\x80\x9cdeficient\xe2\x80\x9d in failing adequately to investigate Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s background and physical condition for mitigation evidence and to present what he likely would have found at the sentencing hearing.  <i>Id.</i>, at 144.  But, the court nonetheless deferred to the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that these deficiencies did not \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson, primarily because the testimony of many witnesses was \xe2\x80\x9ccumulative,\xe2\x80\x9d and because the evidence of physical impairments did not include any physical examination or other support that would have shown the state-court determination was \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 187; see <i>Richter</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111\xe2\x80\x93112.</p><p>Wilson appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.  <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Warden</i>, 774 F.\xc2\xa03d 671 (2014).  The panel first held that the District Court had used the wrong method for determining the reasoning of the relevant state court, namely, that of the Georgia Supreme Court (the final and highest state court to decide the merits of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s claims).  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 678.  That state-court decision, the panel conceded, was made without an opinion.  But, the federal court was wrong to \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d that decision and assume that it rested on the grounds given in the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Instead of \xe2\x80\x9clooking through\xe2\x80\x9d the decision to the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the federal court should have asked what arguments \xe2\x80\x9ccould have supported\xe2\x80\x9d the Georgia Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to grant permission to appeal.  The panel proceeded to identify a number of bases that it believed reasonably could have supported the decision.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 678\xe2\x80\x93681.</p><p>The Eleventh Circuit then granted Wilson rehearing en banc so that it could consider the matter of methodology.  <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Warden</i>, 834 F.\xc2\xa03d 1227 (2016).  Ultimately six judges (a majority) agreed with the panel and held that its \xe2\x80\x9ccould have supported\xe2\x80\x9d approach was correct.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1235.  Five dissenting judges believed that the District Court should have used the methodology it did use, namely, the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1242\xe2\x80\x931247, 1247\xe2\x80\x931269.  Wilson then sought certiorari here.  Because the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion creates a split among the Circuits, we granted the petition.  Compare <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>at 1285  (applying \xe2\x80\x9ccould have supported\xe2\x80\x9d approach), with <i>Grueninger </i>v. <i>Director, Va.

That conclusion has parallels in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  In <i>Ylst</i> v. <i>Nunnemaker</i>, a defendant, convicted in a California state court of murder, appealed his conviction to the state appeals court where he raised a constitutional claim based on <i>Miranda </i>v. <i>Arizona</i>,384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1966).501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 797, 799\xe2\x80\x93800 (1991).  The appeals court rejected that claim, writing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an objection based upon a <i>Miranda</i> violation cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 799.  The defendant then similarly challenged his conviction in the California Supreme Court and on collateral review in several state courts (including once again the California Supreme Court).  In each of these latter instances the state court denied the defendant relief (or review).  In each instance the court did so without an opinion or other explanation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 799\xe2\x80\x93800.</p><p>Subsequently, the defendant asked a federal habeas court to review his constitutional claim.  <i>Id.,</i> at 800.  The higher state courts had given no reason for their decision.  And this Court ultimately had to decide how the federal court was to find the state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in those circumstances.  Should it have \xe2\x80\x9clooked through\xe2\x80\x9d the unreasoned decisions to the state procedural ground articulated in the appeals court or should it have used a different method?</p><p>In answering that question Justice Scalia wrote the following for the Court:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem we face arises, of course, because many formulary orders are not meant to convey <i>anything</i> as to the reason for the decision.  Attributing a reason is therefore both difficult and artificial.  We think that the attribution necessary for federal habeas purposes can be facilitated, and sound results more often assured, by applying the following presumption: Where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim, later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.  If an earlier opinion \xe2\x80\x98fairly appear[s] to rest primarily upon federal law,\xe2\x80\x99 we will presume that no procedural default has been invoked by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the judgment or its consequences in place.  Similarly where, as here, the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default, we will presume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 803 (citation omitted).</p><p>Since <i>Ylst</i>, every Circuit to have considered the matter has applied this presumption, often called the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption, but for the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x94even where the state courts did not apply a procedural bar to review.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  And most Federal Circuits applied it prior to <i>Ylst</i>.  See <i>Ylst</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 803 (citing <i>Prihoda </i>v. <i>McCaughtry</i>, 910 F.\xc2\xa02d 1379, 1383 (CA7 1990); <i>Harmon </i>v. <i>Barton</i>, 894 F.\xc2\xa02d 1268, 1272 (CA11 1990); <i>Evans </i>v. <i>Thompson</i>, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 117, 123, n.\xc2\xa02 (CA4 1989); <i>Ellis </i>v. <i>Lynaugh</i>, 873 F.\xc2\xa02d 830, 838 (CA5 1989)).</p><p>That is not surprising in light of the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption is often realistic, for state higher courts often (but certainly not always, see <i>Redmon </i>v. <i>Johnson</i>, 2018 WL 415714 (Ga., Jan. 16, 2018)) write \xe2\x80\x9cdenied\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caffirmed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdismissed\xe2\x80\x9d when they have examined the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning and found nothing significant with which they disagree.</p><p>Moreover, a \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption is often (but not always) more efficiently applied than a contrary approach\xe2\x80\x94an approach, for example, that would require a federal habeas court to imagine what might have been the state court\xe2\x80\x99s supportive reasoning.  The latter task may prove particularly difficult where the issue involves state law, such as state procedural rules that may constrain the scope of a reviewing court\xe2\x80\x99s summary decision, a matter in which a federal judge often lacks comparative expertise.  See <i>Ylst,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 805.</p><p>The State points to a later case, <i>Harrington</i> v. <i>Richter</i>,562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86 (2011), which, it says, controls here instead of<i> Ylst</i>.  In its view, <i>Ylst </i>should apply, at most, to cases in which the federal habeas court is trying to determine whether a state-court decision without opinion rested on a state procedural ground (for example, a procedural default) or whether the state court has reached the merits of a federal issue.  In support, it notes that <i>Richter</i> held that the state-court decisions to which AEDPA refers include summary dispositions, <i>i.e.</i>, decisions without opinion.  <i>Richter</i> added that \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual conclusion does not require that there be an opinion from the state court explaining the state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98.</p><p><i>Richter</i> then said that, where \xe2\x80\x9ca state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>And the Court concluded that, when \xe2\x80\x9ca federal claim has been presented to a state court and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 99.</p><p>In our view, however, <i>Richter</i> does not control here.  For one thing, <i>Richter</i> did not directly concern the issue before us\xe2\x80\x94whether to \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the silent state higher court opinion to the reasoned opinion of a lower court in order to determine the reasons for the higher court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Indeed, it could not have considered that matter, for in <i>Richter</i>, there was no lower court opinion to look to.  That is because the convicted defendant sought to raise his federal constitutional claim for the first time in the California Supreme Court (via a direct petition for habeas corpus, as California law permits).  <i>Id.</i>, at 96.</p><p>For another thing, <i>Richter</i> does not say the reasoning of <i>Ylst </i>does not apply in the context of an unexplained decision on the merits.  To the contrary, the Court noted that it was setting forth a presumption, which \xe2\x80\x9cmay be overcome when there is reason to think some other explanation for the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is more likely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Richter</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  And it referred in support to <i>Ylst</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 803.</p><p>Further, we have \xe2\x80\x9clooked through\xe2\x80\x9d to lower court decisions in cases involving the merits.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Premo </i>v. <i>Moore</i>,562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115, 123\xe2\x80\x93133 (2011); <i>Sears</i> v. <i>Upton</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 945, 951\xe2\x80\x93956 (2010) (<i>per curiam</i>).  Indeed, we de- cided one of those cases, <i>Premo</i>, on the same day we decided <i>Richter</i>.  And in our opinion in <i>Richter</i> we referred to <i>Premo</i>.  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 91.  Had we intended <i>Richter</i>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccould have supported\xe2\x80\x9d framework to apply even where there is a reasoned decision by a lower state court, our opinion in <i>Premo </i>would have looked very different.  We<i> </i>did not even cite the reviewing state court\xe2\x80\x99s summary affirmance.  Instead, we focused exclusively on the actual reasons given by the lower state court, and we deferred to those reasons under AEDPA.  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 132 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s decision involved no unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>III</p><p>The State\xe2\x80\x99s further arguments do not convince us.  The State points out that there could be many cases in which a \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption does not accurately identify the grounds for the higher court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  And we agree.  We also agree that it is more likely that a state supreme court\xe2\x80\x99s single word \xe2\x80\x9caffirm\xe2\x80\x9d rests upon alternative grounds where the lower state court decision is unreasonable than, <i>e.g.,</i> where the lower court rested on a state-law proce- dural ground, as in <i>Ylst</i>.  But that is why we have set forth a presumption and not an absolute rule.  And the unreasonableness of the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision itself provides some evidence that makes it less likely the state supreme court adopted the same reasoning.  Thus, additional evidence that might not be sufficient to rebut the presumption in a case like <i>Ylst</i> would allow a federal court to conclude that counsel has rebutted the presumption in a case like this one.  For instance, a federal habeas court may conclude that counsel has rebutted the presumption on the basis of convincing alternative arguments for affirmance made to the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court or equivalent evidence presented in its briefing to the federal court similarly establishing that the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court relied on a different ground than the lower state court, such as the existence of a valid ground for affirmance that is obvious from the state-court record.  The dissent argues that the Georgia Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision in <i>Redmon </i>v. <i>Johnson</i> rebuts the presumption in Georgia because that court indicated its summary decisions should not be read to adopt the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  <i>Post</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  This misses the point.  A presumption that can be rebutted by evidence of, for instance, an alternative ground that was argued or that is clear in the record was the likely basis for the decision is in accord with full and proper respect for state courts, like those in Georgia, which have well-established systems and procedures in place in order to ensure proper consideration to the arguments and contention in the many cases they must process to determine whether relief should be granted when a criminal conviction or its ensuing sentence is challenged.  </p><p>The State also points out that we do not necessarily presume that a silent opinion of a federal court of appeals adopts the reasoning of the court below.  The dissent similarly invokes these \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional rules of appellate practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>post</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 10.  But neither the State nor the dissent provides examples of similar context.  Were we to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach in respect to silent federal appeals court decisions as a general matter in other contexts, we would risk judges and lawyers reading those decisions as creating, through silence, a precedent that could be read as binding throughout the circuit\xe2\x80\x94just what a silent decision may be thought not to do.  Here, however, we \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the silent decision for a spe- cific and narrow purpose\xe2\x80\x94to identify the grounds for the higher court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, as AEDPA directs us to do.  See<i> supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  We see no reason why the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s silence should be taken as binding precedent outside this context, for example, as a statewide binding interpretation of state law.</p><p>Further, the State argues that the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach shows disrespect for the States.  See Brief for Respondent 39 (\xe2\x80\x9cWilson\xe2\x80\x99s approach to summary decisions reflects an utter lack of faith in the ability of the highest state courts to adjudicate constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do not believe this is so.  Rather the presumption seeks to replicate the grounds for the higher state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Where there are convincing grounds to believe the silent court had a different basis for its decision than the analysis followed by the previous court, the federal habeas court is free, as we have said, to find to the contrary.  In our view, this approach is more likely to respect what the state court actually did, and easier to apply in practice, than to ask the federal court to substitute for silence the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s thought as to more supportive reasoning.</p><p>Finally, the State argues that the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach will lead state courts to believe they must write full opinions where, given the workload, they would have preferred to have decided summarily.  Though the matter is empirical, given the narrowness of the context, we do not believe that they will feel compelled to do so\xe2\x80\x94at least not to any significant degree.  The State offers no such evidence in the many Circuits that have applied <i>Ylst</i> outside the procedural context.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5.</p><p>For these reasons, we reverse the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3888146">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 16\xe2\x80\x936855</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">MARION WILSON, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> ERIC SELLERS, WARDEN</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[April 17, 2018]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After a state supreme court issues a summary order sustaining a criminal conviction, should a federal habeas court reviewing that decision presume it rests only on the reasons found in a lower state court opinion?  The answer is no.  The statute governing federal habeas review permits no such \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption.  Nor do traditional principles of appellate review.  In fact, we demand the <i>opposite</i> presumption for our work\xe2\x80\x94telling readers that we independently review each case and that our summary affirmances may be read only as signaling agreement with a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and not necessarily its reasons.  Because I can discern no good reason to treat the work of our state court colleagues with less respect than we demand for our own, I would reject petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption and must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even so, some good news can be found here.  While the Court agrees to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption, it does so only after making major modifications to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.  The Court tells us that the presumption should count for little in cases \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the lower state court decision is unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d because it is not \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d a state supreme court would adopt unreasonable reasoning.   <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  In cases like that too, the Court explains, federal courts remain free to sustain state court convictions whenever reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cground[s] for affirmance [are] obvious from the state-court record\xe2\x80\x9d or appear in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions in state court or the federal habeas proceeding.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Exactly right, and exactly what the law has always demanded.  So while the Court takes us on a journey through novel presumptions and rebuttals, it happily returns us in the end very nearly to the place where we began and belonged all along.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To see the problem with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption, start with the statute.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governs federal review of state criminal convictions.  It says a federal court may not grant habeas relief overturning a state court conviction \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d unless (among other things) the petitioner can show that the state court proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  As the text and our precedent make clear, a federal habeas court must focus its review on the final state court decision on the merits, not any preceding decision by an inferior state court.  See <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Fisher</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 34, 40 (2011)\n.  Nor does it matter whether the final state court decision comes with a full opinion or in a summary order: the same deference is due all final state court decisions.  <i>Harrington</i> v. <i>Richter</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86, 98 (2011)\n; <i>Cullen</i> v. <i>Pinholster</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170, 187 (2011)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot of these directions is clear.  Even when the final state court decision \xe2\x80\x9cis unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burden still must be met by showing <i>there was no reasonable basis</i> for the state court to deny relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Richter</i>,<i> </i>562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98 (emphasis added).  And before a federal court can disregard a final summary state court decision, it \xe2\x80\x9cmust determine what arguments or theories .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>could have supporte[d]</i> the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 102 (emphasis added).  Far from suggesting federal courts should presume a state supreme court summary order rests on views expressed in a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, then, AEDPA and our precedents require more nearly the <i>opposite</i> presumption: federal courts must presume the order rests on any reasonable basis the law and facts allow.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If this standard seems hard for a habeas petitioner to overcome, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is because it was meant to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  In AEDPA, Congress rejected the notion that federal habeas review should be \xe2\x80\x9ca substitute for ordinary error correction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  Instead, AEDPA \xe2\x80\x9creflects the view that habeas corpus is a \xe2\x80\x98guard against <i>extreme malfunctions</i> in the state criminal justice systems.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 102<i> </i>(emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe reasons for this approach are familiar.  \xe2\x80\x98Federal habeas review of state convictions frustrates both the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x99  It \xe2\x80\x98disturbs the State\xe2\x80\x99s significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 103 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner and the Court today labor to distinguish these authorities, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how they might succeed.  They point to the fact that in <i>Richter</i> no state court had issued a reasoned order, while here a lower state court did.  See Brief for Petitioner 28\xe2\x80\x9330; <i>ante, </i>at 8.  But on what account of AEDPA or <i>Richter</i> does that factual distinction make a legal difference?  Both the statute and our precedent explain that federal habeas review looks to the final state court decision, not any decision preceding it.  Both instruct that to dislodge the final state court decision a petitioner must prove it involved an unreasonable application of federal law.  And to carry that burden in the face of a final state court summary decision, <i>Richter</i> teaches that the petitioner must show no lawful basis could have reasonably supported it.  To observe that some final state court summary decisions are preceded by lower court reasoned opinions bears no more relevance to the AEDPA analysis than to say that some final state court summary decisions are issued on Mondays.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unable to distinguish <i>Richter</i>, petitioner seeks to confine it by caricature.  Because that case requires a federal court to \xe2\x80\x9cimagine\xe2\x80\x9d its own arguments for denying habeas relief and engage in \xe2\x80\x9cdecision-making-by-hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d he argues it should be limited to its facts.  Brief for Petitioner 28\xe2\x80\x9330, 33; Reply Brief 9.  But the Court today does not adopt petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, and for good reason: <i>Richter</i> requires no such thing.  In our adversarial system a federal court generally isn\xe2\x80\x99t <i>required</i> to imagine or hypothesize arguments that neither the parties before it nor any lower court has presented.  To determine if a reason-able basis \xe2\x80\x9ccould have supported\xe2\x80\x9d a summary denial of habeas relief under <i>Richter</i>, a federal court must look to the state lower court opinion (if there is one), any argument presented by the parties in the state proceedings, and any argument presented in the federal habeas proceeding.  Of course, a federal court sometimes may con-sider on its own motion alternative bases for denying habeas relief apparent in the law and the record, but it does not generally bear an <i>obligation</i> to do so.  See <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Mil-yard</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463, 471\n\xe2\x80\x93473 (2012) (discussing <i>Day</i> v. <i>McDonough</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 198 (2006)\n, and <i>Granberry</i> v. <i>Greer</i>,\n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129 (1987)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor is that the end of the problems with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption.  It also defies traditional rules of appellate practice that informed Congress\xe2\x80\x99s work when it adopted AEDPA and that should inform our work today.  <i>McQuiggin </i>v. <i>Perkins</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, 398\n, n.\xc2\xa03 (2013).  Appellate courts usually have an independent duty to review the facts and law in the cases that come to them.  Often they see errors in lower court opinions.  But often, too, they may affirm on alternative bases either argued by the parties or (sometimes) apparent to them on the face of the record.  See, <i>e.g., SEC </i>v.<i> Chenery Corp.</i>,\n\n318 U.\xc2\xa0S. 80, 88 (1943)\n (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the result is correct \xe2\x80\x98although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Wood</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 473.  And a busy appellate court sometimes may not see the profit in devoting its limited resources to explaining the error and the alternative basis for affirming when the outcome is sure to remain the same, so it issues a summary affirmance instead.  To reflect these realities, this Court has traditionally warned readers <i>against </i>presuming our summary affirmance orders rest on reasons articulated in lower court opinions.  <i>Comptroller of Treasury of Md.</i>  v. <i>Wynne</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (slip op., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A] summary affirmance is an affirmance of the judgment only,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98the rationale of the affirmance may not be gleaned solely from the opinion below\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Mandel</i> v. <i>Bradley</i>,\n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173, 176 (1977)\n (<i>per curiam</i>).  The courts of appeals have issued similar warnings for similar reasons about their own summary orders.  See, <i>e.g., Rates Technology, Inc. </i>v. <i>Mediatrix Telecom, Inc.</i>, 688 F.\xc2\xa03d 742, 750 (CA Fed. 2012); <i>DeShong</i> v. <i>Seaboard Coast Line R.\xc2\xa0Co.</i>, 737 F.\xc2\xa02d 1520, 1523 (CA11 1984).  And respect for this traditional principle of appellate practice surely weighs against presuming a state court\xe2\x80\x99s summary disposition rests solely on a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  On what account could we reasonably demand more respect for our summary decisions than we are willing to extend to those of our state court colleagues?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner and the Court offer only this tepid reply.  They suggest that their \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption seeks to reflect \xe2\x80\x9crealistic[ally]\xe2\x80\x9d the basis on which the state summary decision rests.  See Brief for Petitioner 44; <i>ante, </i>at 7.  But to the extent this is a claim that their presumption comports realistically with longstanding traditions of appellate practice, it is wrong for the reasons just laid out.  In fact, applying traditional understandings of appellate practice, this Court has refused to presume that state appellate courts even read lower court opinions rather than just the briefs before them.  See<i> Baldwin </i>v.<i> Reese</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, 31 (2004)\n.  And surely it is a mystery how the Court might today presume state supreme courts <i>rely</i> on that which it traditionally presumes they do not <i>read.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the argument here is instead an empirical claim that the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption comports realistically with what happened in this case and others like it, it is wrong too.  Petitioner was convicted in Georgia.  And during the pendency of this case in our Court, the Georgia Supreme Court issued an order confirming that lower courts in that State may not \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] that when this Court summarily denies an application to appeal an order denying habeas corpus relief, we necessarily agree with everything said in that order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Redmon </i>v.<i> Johnson</i>, 809 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 468, 472 (Ga. 2018).  The court explained that it has long followed just this rule for all the reasons you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.  It independently reviews the facts and law in each habeas case.  If it finds something it thinks might amount to a consequential error, the court sets the case for argument and usually prepares a full opinion.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n many occasions,\xe2\x80\x9d the court finds only \xe2\x80\x9cinconsequential errors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 471.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  And in these cases the court normally issues a summary affirmance because the costs associated with full treatment of the appeal outweigh the benefits of correcting what is at most harmless error, especially given the court\xe2\x80\x99s heavy caseload and the need to attend to more consequential matters.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption thus does not seek to reflect reality; it seeks to deny it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The presumption is especially unrealistic in another way.  The Court and petitioner presume that a summary order by a state supreme court adopts <i>all the specific reasons</i> expressed by a lower state court.  In doing so, they disregard a far more realistic possibility: that the state supreme court might have relied only on the same <i>grounds</i> for the denial of relief as did the lower court without necessarily adopting all its reasoning.  Here, the lower state court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Strickland</i> claim on the grounds that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not deficient and peti-tioner suffered no prejudice.  And it gave several reasons for its conclusions: for example, the evidence petitioner sought to admit \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been inadmissible on evidentiary grounds, cumulative of other testimony, or otherwise would not have, in reasonable probability, changed the outcome of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 61.  In summarily denying relief, the state supreme court might have reached the same conclusions (no deficient performance and no prejudice) without resting on the exact same reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption cannot be squared with AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s text, traditional rules, or Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s actual practice, petitioner and the Court contend it is at least consistent with <i>Ylst</i> v. <i>Nunnemaker</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 797 (1991)\n.  See Brief for Petitioner 38; <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x938.  But it is not.  In habeas review of state court convictions, federal courts may only review questions of federal law.  So if a state court decision rejecting a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal law claim rests on a state procedural defect (say the petitioner filed too late under state rules), federal courts generally have no authority to reach the federal claim.  <i>Ylst</i> simply teaches that, if a lower state court opinion expressly relied on an independent and adequate state ground, we should presume a later state appellate court summary disposition invoked it too.  See 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 801, 803.  The decision thus seeks to protect state court decisions from displacement and reaches a result consistent with the traditional rule that a summary order invokes<i> all </i>fairly presented bases for affirmance.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither can <i>Ylst</i> be reimagined today as meaning anything more.  The case came years before AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s new standards for habeas review and can offer nothing useful about them.  The work of interpreting AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s demands was left instead to <i>Richter</i>.  And, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, <i>Richter</i> forecloses petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption.  Of course, and as petitioner stresses, <i>Richter</i> didn\xe2\x80\x99t overrule <i>Ylst</i>.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s for the simple reason that <i>Ylst</i> continues to do important, if limited, work in the disposition of procedural default claims because \xe2\x80\x9cAEDPA did not change the application of pre-AEDPA procedural default principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  B. Means, Federal Habeas Manual \xc2\xa79B:3 (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Uncomfortable questions follow too from any effort to reimagine <i>Ylst</i>.  If we were to take <i>Ylst</i> as suggesting that summary decisions presumptively rely only on the reasons found in lower court opinions, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we have to overrule our many precedents like <i>Wynne</i> and <i>Mandel</i> that explicitly reject any such presumption?  Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t circuit courts have to discard their own similar precedents?  See <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Consistency would seem to demand no less.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only answer petitioner and the Court offer is no answer at all.  Consistency, they suggest, is overrated.  <i>Everywhere else</i> in the law we should retain the usual rule that a summary affirmance can\xe2\x80\x99t be read as presumptively resting on the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons.  They encourage us to use <i>Ylst</i> only as a tool for making a <i>special exception</i> for AEDPA cases: here and here alone should we adopt petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption.  Brief for Petitioner 18, 20; <i>ante, </i>at 10 (stating that \xe2\x80\x9cwe \xe2\x80\x98look through\xe2\x80\x99 the silent decision for a specific and narrow purpose\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA).  But just stating this good-for-habeas-only rule should be enough to reject it.  Summary orders that happen to arise in state habeas cases should receive no less respect than those that arise anywhere else in the law.  If anything, they should receive <i>more</i> respect, because federal habeas review of state court decisions \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intrudes on  state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Richter, </i>562 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 103.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s novel presumption not only lacks any provenance in the law, it promises nothing for its trouble.  Consider the most obvious question it invites, one suggested by the facts of our own case: what happens when a state supreme court issues an order explaining that its summary affirmances do not necessarily adopt the reasons in lower court opinions?  Should that be enough to rebut the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption?  After defending the presumption, even the dissent in the Eleventh Circuit decision under review recognized that a disclaimer along these lines should suffice to rebut it.  See <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Warden</i>, 834 F.\xc2\xa03d 1227, 1263 (2016) (en banc) (opinion of J. Pryor, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Georgia Supreme Court could simply issue a one-line order denying an application for a certificate of probable cause that indicates agreement with the result the superior court reached but not the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for rejecting the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, of course, the Georgia Supreme Court has recently responded to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s invitation by issuing just such a disclaimer.  So in the end petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption seems likely to accomplish nothing for him and only needless work for others\xe2\x80\x94inducing more state supreme courts to churn out more orders restating the obvious fact that their summary dispositions don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily rest on the reasons given by lower courts.  Along the way, too, it seems federal courts will have their hands full.  For while the Eleventh Circuit dissent had no difficulty acknowledging that an order like Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s suffices to overcome petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption, the Court today refuses to supply the same obvious  answer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider, too, the questions that would follow in the unlikely event a general order like the one from the Georgia Supreme Court wasn\xe2\x80\x99t considered enough to overcome petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption.  Quickly federal courts would be forced to decide: does the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption survive even when a state supreme court includes language in <i>every</i> summary order explaining that its decision does not necessarily adopt the reasoning below?  What if the state supreme court says something slightly different but to the same effect, declaring in each case that it has independently considered the relevant law and evidence before denying relief?  And if we start dictating what state court disclaimers should look like and where they should appear, what exactly is left of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s direction that our review is intended to guard only against \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98extreme malfunctions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in state criminal justice systems?  <i>Richter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 102.  Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be slipping into the business of \xe2\x80\x9ctell[ing] state courts how they must write their opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d something this Court has long said federal habeas courts \xe2\x80\x9chave no power\xe2\x80\x9d to do?  <i>Coleman</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722, 739 (1991)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Apart from whether a (general or case-specific) order from a state supreme court suffices to overcome petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption, there\xe2\x80\x99s the question what else might.  Say a lower state court opinion includes an error but the legal briefs or other submissions presented to the state supreme court supply sound alternative bases for affirmance.  In those circumstances, should a federal habeas court really presume that the state supreme court chose to repeat the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s mistake rather than rely on the solid grounds argued to it by the parties?  What if a sound alternative basis for affirmance is presented for the first time in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 federal habeas submissions: are we to presume that the state supreme court was somehow less able to identify a reasonable basis for affirmance than federal habeas counsel?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here at least the Court does offer an answer.  Petitioner insists that federal courts should presume that state supreme court summary orders rest on <i>unreasonable</i> lower state court opinions even in the face of <i>reasonable</i> alternative arguments presented to the state supreme court or in federal habeas proceedings.  But seeming to recognize the unreasonableness of this request, the Court opts to reshape radically petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed presumption before adopting it.  First, the Court states that \xe2\x80\x9cit is more likely that a state supreme court\xe2\x80\x99s single word \xe2\x80\x98affirm\xe2\x80\x99 rests upon alternative grounds where the lower state court decision is unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  Then, the Court proceeds to explain that \xe2\x80\x9ca federal habeas court may conclude that counsel has rebutted the presumption on the basis of convincing alternative arguments for affirmance made to the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court or equivalent evidence presented in its briefing to the federal court similarly establishing that the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court relied on a different ground than the lower state court, such as the existence of a valid ground for affirmance that is obvious from the state-court record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reshaping of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption reveals just how futile this whole business really is.  If, as the Court holds, the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption can be rebutted \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the lower state court decision is unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see what good it does.  Peti-tioner sought to assign <i>unreasonable</i> lower court opinions to final state court summary decisions.  To hear now that essentially only <i>reasonable</i> (and so sustainable) lower state court opinions are presumptively adopted by final state court summary decisions will surely leave him sour on this journey and federal habeas courts scratching their heads about the point of it all.  And if, as the Court also tells us, a federal habeas court can always deny relief on a basis that is apparent from the record or on the basis of alternative arguments presented by the parties in state or federal proceedings, then the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d presumption truly means nothing and we are back where we started.  With the Court\xe2\x80\x99s revisions to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption, a federal habeas court is neither obliged to <i>look through</i> exclusively to the reasons given by a lower state court, nor required to <i>presume</i> that a summary order adopts those reasons.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All this is welcome news of a sort.  The Court may promise us a future of foraging through presumptions and rebuttals.  But at least at the end of it we rest knowing that what was true before remains true today: a federal habeas court should look at all the arguments presented in state and federal court and examine the state court record.  And a federal habeas court should sustain a state court summary decision denying relief if those materials reveal a basis to do so reasonably consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings.  Exactly what a federal court applying the statute and <i>Richter</i> has had to do all along.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x935.  And exactly what the Eleventh Circuit correctly held it had to do in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Today, petitioner invites us to adopt a novel presumption that AEDPA, traditional principles of appellate review, and Georgia practice all preclude.  It\xe2\x80\x99s an invitation that requires us to treat the work of state court colleagues with disrespect we would not tolerate for our own.  And all to what end?  None at all, it turns out.  As modified by the Court, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption nearly drops us back where we began, with only trouble to show for the effort.  Respectfully, I would decline the invitation to this circuitous journey and just affirm.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Petitioner and the Court separately suggest that <i>Premo</i> v. <i>Moore</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115 (2011)\n, supports their position because the Court there did not follow <i>Richter</i>\xe2\x80\x99s approach.

It did not rely on an unreasonable basis provided by a lower court to grant habeas relief, as petitioner seeks to have us do.  <i>Moore </i>thus accords with AEDPA and our precedents, while petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s presumption does not. </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0In language that will sound familiar to all judges and lawyers involved in litigating habeas claims, the Georgia Supreme Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are many examples of inconsequential errors, but among the most common are the following: The habeas court rejects a claim both on a procedural ground and, alternatively, on the substantive merits.  This Court determines that one of those rulings appears factually or legally erroneous, but the other is correct, so an appeal would result in the habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment being affirmed on the correct ground. In addressing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984)\n, the habeas court rules that counsel did not perform deficiently as alleged. That ruling appears to be erroneous, but this Court determines based on our review of the record that no prejudice resulted from the deficient performance, so an appeal would result in affirming the habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  See <i>id.,</i> at 697; <i>Rozier</i> v. <i>Caldwell</i>, 300 Ga. 30, 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (2016). In addressing other claims that require the petitioner to prove each element of a multi-part test, such as a claim under <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83 (1963)\n, the habeas court makes factual or legal errors regarding the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proof of one element but correctly concludes (or the record clearly shows) that the petitioner has not proved another required element.  An appeal would result in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s affirming the habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. The habeas court misstates a legal standard in one part of its order, but recites the standard correctly elsewhere in the order, and it is clear that the judgment is correct applying the right standard. In addressing a habeas petition with multitudinous claims, the habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s order fails to explicitly rule on a claim, but the record shows that the claim is entirely meritless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Redmon</i>, 809 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d, at<i> </i>471 (some citations omitted). </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he burdens of invoking the full appellate process, including writing opinions simply to point out factual or legal errors that do not affect the judgment, are significant for this Court.
