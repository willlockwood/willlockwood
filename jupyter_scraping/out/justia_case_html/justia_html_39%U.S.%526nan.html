Gratiot, 39 U.S. 14 Pet. 526 526 (1840)</h3><p><b>United States v. Gratiot</b></p><p><b>39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 526</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The United States instituted an action on a bond given by the defendants, conditioned that certain of the obligors who had taken from the agent of the United States, under the authority of the President of the United States, a license for smelting lead ore, bearing date September 1, 1834, should fully execute and comply with the terms and conditions of a license for purchasing and smelting lead ore at the United States\' lead mines on the Upper Mississippi River in the State of Illinois for the period of one year.  The defendants demurred to the declaration, and the question was presented to the circuit court of Illinois whether the President of the United States had power, under the Act of Congress of 3 March, 1807, to make a contract for purchasing and smelting lead ore at the lead mines of the United States on the Upper Mississippi.  This question was certified from the circuit to the Supreme Court of the United States.  <em>Held</em> that the President of the United States has power, under the Act of Congress of 3 March, 1807, to make the contract on which this suit was instituted.</p>\n<p>The power over the public lands is vested in Congress by the Constitution without limitation, and has been considered the foundation on which the territorial governments rest.</p>\n<p>The cases of,<em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#422">McCulloch v.

Canter,</a></span></em> 1 Pet. 542, cited.</p>\n<p>The words "dispose of" the public lands, used in the Constitution of the United States, cannot, under the decisions of the Supreme Court, receive any other construction than that Congress has the power, in its discretion, to authorize the leasing of the lead mines on the public lands in the territories of the United States.  There can be no apprehensions of any encroachments upon state rights by the creation of a numerous tenantry within the borders of the states from the adoption of such measures.</p>\n<p>The authority given to the President of the United States to lease the lead mines is limited to a term not exceeding five years.  This limitation, however, is not to be construed as a prohibition to renew the leases from time to time if he thinks proper so to do.  The authority is limited to a short period, so as not to interfere with the power of Congress to make other dispositions of the mines should they think the same necessary.</p>\n<p>The legal understanding of a lease for years, is a contract for the possession and profits of land for a determinate period, with the recompense of rent.  It is not necessary that the rent should be in money.  If reserved in kind, it is rent in contemplation of law.</p>\n<p>The law of 1807, authorizing the leasing of the lead mines, was passed before Illinois was organized as a state.  She cannot now complain of any disposition or regulation of the lead mines previously made by Congress.  She surely cannot claim a right to the public lands within her limits.</p>\n<p>On the first day of September, 1834, the defendants entered into the following bond to the United States, having executed the same under their respective hands and seals:</p>\n<p>"Know all men by these presents, that we, J.

Sixty days are allowed after the expiration of this license to close all business under it, but it is understood that no purchase or hauling of ore is to take place after the license is expired.

GOLDTHORP"</p>\n<p>"PETER AYDELOTT"</p>\n<p>"ABRAHAM BLAYLEN"</p>\n<p>Which being read and heard, the defendants interposed a general demurrer to the declaration. and upon the argument of the demurrer, the opinions of the judges were opposed upon the following point.</p>\n<p>"Whether the President of the United States had power under the Act of Congress of 3 March, 1807, to make the contract set forth in the declaration,"</p>\n<p>which point has been duly certified to this Court. The act of Congress referred to is entitled, "an act making provision for the disposal of the public lands situate between the United States military tract, and the Connecticut reserve, and for other purposes."</p>\n<p>This act establishes a land office and makes provisions for the disposal of the lands of the United States referred to in the title of the act, and among other things, the fifth section declares as follows:</p>\n<p>"That the several lead mines in the Indiana Territory, together with as many sections contiguous to each as shall be deemed necessary by the President of the United States, shall be reserved for the future disposal of the United States.  And any grant which may hereafter be made for a tract of land containing a lead mine which had been discovered previous to the purchase of such tract from the United States shall be considered fraudulent and null, and the President of the United States shall be and is hereby authorized to lease any lead mine which has been or may hereafter be discovered in the Indiana Territory for a term not exceeding five years."</p>\n<p>That the mines now in question lie within the territory referred to in the act of Congress, and are the property of the United States is not denied.  And the Constitution of the United States (article four, section three) provides,</p>\n<p>"That Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property, belonging to the United States."</p>\n<p>The term "territory," as here used, is merely descriptive of one kind of property, and is equivalent to the word "lands."  And Congress has the same power over it as over any other property belonging to the United States, and this power is vested in Congress without limitation, and has been considered the foundation upon which the territorial governments rest.  In the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#422">McCulloch v. State of Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 422, the Chief Justice, in giving the opinion of the Court, speaking of this article and the powers of Congress growing out of it, applies it to territorial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 39 U. S. 538</a></p><p> governments, and says all admit their constitutionality.</p>\n<p>And again, in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/26/511/case.html#542">American Insurance Company v. Canter,</a></span></em> 1 Pet. 542, in speaking of the cession of Florida under the treaty with Spain, he says that Florida, until she shall become a state, continues to be a territory of the United States government by that clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property of the United States.  If such are the powers of Congress over the lands belonging to the United States, the words "dispose of" cannot receive the construction contended for at the bar -- that they vest in Congress the power only to sell and not to lease such lands.  The disposal must be left to the discretion of Congress.  And there can be no apprehensions of any encroachments upon state rights by the creation of a numerous tenantry within their borders, as has been so strenuously urged in the argument.  The law of 1807, authorizing the leasing of the lead mines, was passed before Illinois was organized as a state, and she cannot now complain of any disposition or regulation of the lead mines previously made by Congress.  She surely cannot claim a right to the public lands within her limits.</p>\n<p>It has been the policy of the government at all times in disposing of the public lands to reserve the mines for the use of the United States.  And their real value cannot be ascertained without causing them to be explored and worked under proper regulations.  The authority given to the President to lease the lead mines is limited to a term not exceeding five years; this limitation, however, is not to be construed as a prohibition to renew the leases from time to time if he shall think proper so to do.  The authority is limited to a short period so as not to interfere with the power of Congress to make other disposition of the mines should it think proper so to do.  Does, then, the contract upon which the present action is founded fall within the authority given to the President to lease the lead mines?  Or in other words, is this contract a lease within the meaning of the law?  In construing this contract, the bond and what is called "the license for smelting" are to be taken as parts of the same instrument, and purport to have been made by the defendants, with T. C. Legate, superintending the United States\' lead mines, acting under the direction of the Secretary of War, who must be presumed to be acting under the authority of the President, especially as the permission given by the contract in terms is said to be by and with the approbation of the President of the United States.  This contract purports to be a license for smelting lead ore, and it is objected that this is not a lease within the meaning of the act of Congress.  But this objection is not well founded.  It is a contract for one year, and of course within the time limited by the law, which gives to the President authority to lease for five years.  Is it, then, a lease?  The legal understanding of a lease for years is a contract for the possession and profits of land for a determinate period, with the recompense of rent.  The contract in question is strictly within this definition.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 39 U. S. 539</a></p><p> business of smelting is a part of the operation of mining, although it may be a distinct branch from that of digging the ore; but the law ought not to be so construed as to require the whole operation to be embraced in the same contract.  They are different operations, requiring different qualifications and distinct regulations.  This contract is for the possession of land.  The work is to be performed at the United States\' lead mines, and must of course be performed within the limits prescribed by law to be attached to such mines.  And there is an express permission to use as much fuel as is necessary to carry on the smelting business and to cultivate as much land as will suffice to furnish teams, &amp;c., with provender, and there is an express reservation of the rent of six pounds of every hundred pounds of lead smelted, with special and particular stipulation for securing the same.  It is not necessary that the rent should be in money.  If received in kind, it is rent in contemplation of law.</p>\n<p><em>We are accordingly of opinion that the question certified in the record, must be answered in the affirmative.</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Illinois, and on the point and question on which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion and which was certified to this Court for its opinion agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court that "the President had power, under the Act of 3 March, 1807, to make the contract set forth in the declaration."  Whereupon, it is ordered and adjudged by this Court that it be so certified to the said circuit court accordingly.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
