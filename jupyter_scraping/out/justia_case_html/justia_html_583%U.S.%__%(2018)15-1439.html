The Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) creates private rights of action to aid the enforcement of obligations pertaining to securities offerings.  The Act authorizes both federal and state courts to exercise jurisdiction over those private suits and, more unusually, bars the removal of such suits from state to federal court.  The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), which regulates not the original issuance of securities but all their subsequent trading, is also enforceable through private rights of action.  But all suits brought under the 1934 Act fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (Reform Act) amended both Acts, in order to stem perceived abuses of the class-action vehicle in securities litigation.  The Reform Act included both substantive reforms, applicable in state and federal court alike, and procedural reforms, applicable only in federal court.  Rather than face these new obstacles, plaintiffs began filing securities class actions under state law. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">To prevent this end run around the Reform Act, Congress passed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), whose amendments to the 1933 Act are at issue in this case.  As relevant here, those amendments include two operative provisions, two associated definitions, and two \xe2\x80\x9cconforming amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">First,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777p(b) completely disallows (in both state and federal courts) \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d alleging dishonest practices \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s definitions, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action\xe2\x80\x9d means a class action in which \xe2\x80\x9cdamages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa777p(f)(2).  And the term \xe2\x80\x9ccovered security\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a security listed on a national stock exchange.  \xc2\xa777p(f)(3).  Next, \xc2\xa777p(c) provides for the removal of certain class actions to federal court, where they are subject to dismissal.  Finally, SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconforming amendments\xe2\x80\x9d add two new phrases to \xc2\xa777v(a), the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision.  The first creates an exception to \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s general removal bar through the language \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in section 77p(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  The other\xe2\x80\x94the key provision in this case\xe2\x80\x94expresses a caveat to the general rule that state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act.  With this conforming amendment, \xc2\xa777v(a) now provides that state and federal courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided in section 77p .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to covered class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court refers to this provision as the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept clause.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondents, three pension funds and an individual (Investors), purchased shares of stock in petitioner Cyan, Inc., in an initial public offering.  After the stock declined in value, the Investors brought a damages class action against Cyan in state court, alleging 1933 Act violations.  They did not assert any claims based on state law.  Cyan moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexcept clause\xe2\x80\x9d stripped state courts of power to adjudicate 1933 Act claims in \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Investors maintained that SLUSA left intact state courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over all suits\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94alleging only 1933 Act claims.  The state courts agreed with the Investors and denied Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  This Court granted certiorari to decide whether SLUSA deprived state courts of jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d asserting only 1933 Act claims.  The Court also addresses a related question raised by the federal Government as <i>amicus curiae</i> and addressed by the parties in briefing and argument: whether SLUSA enabled defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions from state to federal court for adjudication.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0SLUSA did nothing to strip state courts of their longstanding jurisdiction to adjudicate class actions brought under the 1933 Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"> (a)\xc2\xa0SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s text, read most straightforwardly, leaves this jurisdiction intact.  The background rule of \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x94in place since the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage\xe2\x80\x94gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over all suits \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce any liability or duty created by\xe2\x80\x9d that statute.  And the except clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided in section 77p of this title with respect to covered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ensures that in any case in which \xc2\xa777v(a) and \xc2\xa777p conflict, \xc2\xa777p will control.  The critical question for this case is therefore whether \xc2\xa777p limits state-court jurisdiction over class actions brought under the 1933 Act.  It does not.  Section 77p bars certain securities class actions based on <i>state </i>law but it says nothing, and so does nothing, to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over class actions based on <i>federal </i>law.  That means \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s background rule\xe2\x80\x94under which a state court may hear the Investors\xe2\x80\x99 1933 Act suit\xe2\x80\x94continues to govern.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"> Cyan argues that the except clause\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d points the reader to \xc2\xa777p(f)(2), which defines that term to mean a suit seeking damages on behalf of more than fifty persons\xe2\x80\x94without mentioning anything about whether the suit is based on state or federal law.  But that view cannot be squared with the except clause\xe2\x80\x99s wording for two independent reasons.  First, the except clause points to \xe2\x80\x9csection 77p\xe2\x80\x9d as a whole\xe2\x80\x94not to paragraph 77p(f)(2).  Had Congress intended to refer to \xc2\xa777p(f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition alone, it presumably would have done so.  See <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>SW General, Inc.</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Second, a definition, like \xc2\xa777p(f)(2), does not \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[]\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cexcept[ion],\xe2\x80\x9d but instead gives meaning to a term\xe2\x80\x94and Congress well knows the difference between those two functions.  Not one of the 30-plus provisions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d cross-references a <i>definition.  </i></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Structure and context also support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the except clause.  Because Cyan treats the broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action\xe2\x80\x9d as altering \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional grant, its construction would prevent state courts from deciding any 1933 Act class suits seeking damages for more than fifty plaintiffs, thus stripping state courts of jurisdiction over suits about securities raising no particular national interest.  That result is out of line with SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s overall scope.  Moreover, it is highly unlikely that Congress upended the 65-year practice of state courts\xe2\x80\x99 adjudicating all manner of 1933 Act cases (including class actions) by way of a mere conforming amendment.  See <i>Director of Revenue of Mo.</i> v. <i>CoBank ACB</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316\n. Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on legislative purpose and history is unavailing.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Cyan insists that the only way for SLUSA to serve the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s objectives was by divesting state courts of jurisdiction over all sizable 1933 Act class actions.  Specifically, it claims that its reading is necessary to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s procedural measures, which apply only in federal court, by bringing 1933 Act class actions in state court.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">But Cyan ignores a different way in which SLUSA served the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s objectives\xe2\x80\x94which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the statute fully effects.  The Reform Act included substantive sections protecting defendants in suits brought under the federal securities laws.  Plaintiffs circumvented those provisions by bringing their complaints of securities misconduct under state law instead.  Hence emerged SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s bar on state-law class actions (and its removal provision to ensure their dismissal)\xe2\x80\x94which guaranteed that the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s heightened substantive standards would govern all future securities class litigation.  SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s preamble states that the statute is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto limit the conduct of securities class actions under state law, and for other purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n112Stat.\n3227, and this Court has underscored, over and over, SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose to preclude certain vexing state-law<i> </i>class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kircher</i> v. <i>Putnam Funds Trust</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 633\n.  That object\xe2\x80\x94which SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s text actually reflects\xe2\x80\x94does not depend on stripping state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act class suits, as Cyan proposes.  For wherever those suits go forward, the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive protections necessarily apply.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">SLUSA also went a good distance toward ensuring that federal courts would play the principal role in adjudicating securities class actions by means of its revisions to the <i>1934</i> Act.  Because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over 1934 Act claims, forcing plaintiffs to bring class actions under the 1934 statute instead of state law also forced them to file in federal court.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Cyan finally argues that the except clause would serve no purpose at all unless it works as Cyan says.  But Congress could have envisioned the except clause as the ultimate fail-safe device, designed to safeguard \xc2\xa777p\xe2\x80\x99s class-action bar come whatever might.  Congress has been known to legislate in that hyper-vigilant way, to \xe2\x80\x9cremov[e] any doubt\xe2\x80\x9d as to things not particularly doubtful in the first instance.  <i>Marx</i> v. <i>General Revenue Corp.</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371\n\xe2\x80\x93384.  If ever it had reason to legislate in that fashion, it was in SLUSA\xe2\x80\x94whose very impetus lay in the success of class action attorneys in \xe2\x80\x9cbypass[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Reform Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kircher</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.  And regardless of any uncertainty surrounding Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for drafting the except clause, there is no sound basis for giving that clause a broader reading than its language can bear, especially in light of the dramatic change such an interpretation would work in the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional framework.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0SLUSA does not permit defendants to remove class actions alleging only 1933 Act claims from state to federal court.  The Government argues that \xc2\xa777p(c) allows defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions to federal court as long as they allege the kinds of misconduct listed in \xc2\xa777p(b).  But most naturally read, \xc2\xa777p(c) refutes, not supports, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Section 77p(c) allows for removal of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny covered class action brought in any State court involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  The covered class actions \xe2\x80\x9cset forth\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa777p(b) are state-law class actions alleging securities misconduct.  Federal-law suits are not \xe2\x80\x9cclass action[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as set forth in subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, they remain subject to the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s removal ban.  This Court has held as much, concluding that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777p(b) and 77p(c) apply to the exact same universe of class actions.  <i>Kircher</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 643\xe2\x80\x93644.  The \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward reading\xe2\x80\x9d of those two provisions is that removal under \xc2\xa777p(c) is \xe2\x80\x9climited to those [actions] precluded by the terms of subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 643.

First, did SLUSA strip state courts of jurisdiction over class actions alleging violations of only the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act),48Stat.74, as amended,15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777a <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>?  And second, even if not, did SLUSA empower defendants to remove such actions from state to federal court?  We answer both questions no.</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Congress enacted two laws, in successive years, to promote honest practices in the securities markets.  The 1933 Act required companies offering securities to the public to make \xe2\x80\x9cfull and fair disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of relevant information.  <i>Pinter</i> v. <i>Dahl</i>,486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622,646 (1988).  And to aid enforcement of those obligations, the statute created private rights of action.  Congress authorized both federal and state courts to exercise jurisdiction over those private suits.  See \xc2\xa722(a),48Stat.86 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall have jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State and Territorial courts, of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this title\xe2\x80\x9d).  More unusually, Congress also barred the removal of such actions from state to federal court.  <i>Id.,</i> at 87<i> </i>(\xe2\x80\x9cNo case arising under this title and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  So if a plaintiff chose to bring a 1933 Act suit in state court, the defendant could not change the forum.</p><p>Congress\xe2\x80\x99s next foray, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), operated differently.  See48Stat.881, as amended,15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778a <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>  That statute regulated not the original issuance of securities but instead all their subsequent trading, most commonly on national stock exchanges.  See <i>Blue Chip Stamps </i>v. <i>Manor Drug Stores</i>,421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 723,752 (1975).  The 1934 Act, this Court held, could also be enforced through private rights of action.  See <i>id.,</i> at 730, and n.\xc2\xa04.  But Congress determined that all those suits should fall within the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of the federal courts.  \xc2\xa727,48Stat.902\xe2\x80\x93903.  So a plaintiff could never go to state court to litigate a 1934 Act claim.</p><p>In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (Reform Act),109Stat.737, amended both the 1933 and the 1934 statutes in mostly identical ways.  Congress passed the Reform Act principally to stem \xe2\x80\x9cperceived abuses of the class-action vehicle in litigation involving nationally traded securities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</i> v. <i>Dabit</i>,547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 71,81 (2006).  Some of the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions made substantive changes to the 1933 and 1934 laws, and applied even when a 1933 Act suit was brought in state court.  For instance, the statute created a \xe2\x80\x9csafe harbor\xe2\x80\x9d from federal liability for certain \xe2\x80\x9cforward-looking statements\xe2\x80\x9d made by company officials.15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777z\xe2\x80\x932 (1933 Act); \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x935 (1934 Act).  Other Reform Act provisions modified the procedures used in litigating securities actions, and applied only when such a suit was brought in federal court.  To take one example, the statute required a lead plaintiff in any class action brought under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to file a sworn certification stating, among other things, that he had not purchased the relevant security \xe2\x80\x9cat the direction of plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa777z\xe2\x80\x931(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1933 Act); \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1934 Act).</p><p>But the Reform Act fell prey to the law of \xe2\x80\x9cunintended consequence[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dabit</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82.  As this Court previously described the problem: \xe2\x80\x9cRather than face the obstacles set in their path by the Reform Act, plaintiffs and their representatives began bringing class actions under state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>That \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenon was a novel one\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and an unwelcome one as well.  <i>Ibid.  </i>To prevent plaintiffs from circumventing the Reform Act, Congress again undertook to modify both securities laws.</p><p>The result was SLUSA, whose amendments to the 1933 Act are at issue in this case.  Those amendments include, as relevant here, two operative provisions, two associated definitions, and two \xe2\x80\x9cconforming amendments\xe2\x80\x9d to the 1933 law\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional section.112Stat.3230.  (SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s amendments to the 1934 Act include essentially the same operative provisions and definitions.  See <i>Dabit</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82, n.\xc2\xa06.  But Congress decided that the 1934 law\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive jurisdiction provision needed no conforming amendments.)  The added material\xe2\x80\x94now found in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777p and 77v(a) and set out in full in this opinion\xe2\x80\x99s appendix\xe2\x80\x94goes as follows.</p><p>First, \xc2\xa777p(b) altogether prohibits certain securities class actions based on state law.  That provision\xe2\x80\x94which we sometimes (and somewhat prosaically) refer to as the state-law class-action bar\xe2\x80\x94reads:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be maintained in any State or Federal court by any private party  alleging\xe2\x80\x94</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(1) an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security; or</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(2) that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>According to SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s definitions, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action\xe2\x80\x9d means a class action in which \xe2\x80\x9cdamages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa777p(f)(2).  And the term \xe2\x80\x9ccovered security\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a security listed on a national stock exchange.  \xc2\xa777p(f)(3) (cross-referencing \xc2\xa777r(b)).  So taken all in all, \xc2\xa777p(b) completely disallows (in both state and federal courts) sizable class actions that are founded on state law and allege dishonest practices respecting a nationally traded security\xe2\x80\x99s purchase or sale.</p><p>Next, \xc2\xa777p(c) provides for the removal of certain class actions to federal court, as well as for their subsequent disposition:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cAny covered class action brought in any State court involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal district court for the district in which the action is pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The first chunk of that provision identifies the removable cases, partly by way of a cross-reference (\xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d) to the just-described class-action bar.  The final clause of the provision (\xe2\x80\x9cand shall be subject to subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d) indicates what should happen to a barred class suit <i>after </i>it has been removed: The \xe2\x80\x9cproper course is to dismiss\xe2\x80\x9d the action.  <i>Kircher</i> v. <i>Putnam Funds Trust</i>,547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 633,644 (2006).  As this Court has explained, \xc2\xa777p(c) \xe2\x80\x9cavails a defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of further litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state court, but of termination of the proceedings altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 645, n.\xc2\xa012.<i> </i>The point of providing that option, everyone here agrees, was to ensure the dismissal of a prohibited state-law class action even when a state court \xe2\x80\x9cwould not adequately enforce\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa777p(b)\xe2\x80\x99s bar.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3; see Brief for Petitioners 7; Brief for Respondents 20.</p><p>Finally, the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision, codified at \xc2\xa777v(a), now includes two new phrases framed as exemptions\xe2\x80\x94SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s self-described \xe2\x80\x9cconforming amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d112Stat.3230; see <i>supra,</i> at 3.  The less significant of the pair, for our purposes, reflects the allowance for removing certain class actions described above.  Against the backdrop of the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s general removal bar, see <i>supra,</i> at 2, that added (italicized) material reads:</p><p><i>\xe2\x80\x9cExcept as provided in section 77p(c) of this title</i>, no case arising under this subchapter and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The more important of the conforming amendments in this case expresses a caveat to the general rule, see <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932, that state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act.  As amended (again, with the new material in italics), the relevant sentence now reads:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall have jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State and Territorial courts, <i>except as provided in section 77p of this title with respect to covered class actions</i>, of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Throughout this opinion, we refer to the italicized words just above as the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Its meaning is at the heart of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute in this Court.</p><p>B</p><p>The petitioners in this case are Cyan, a telecommunications company, and its officers and directors (together, Cyan).  The respondents are three pension funds and an individual (together, Investors) who purchased shares of Cyan stock in an initial public offering.  After the stock declined in value, the Investors brought a damages class action against Cyan in California Superior Court.  Their complaint alleges that Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s offering documents contained material misstatements, in violation of the 1933 Act.  It does not assert any claims based on state law.</p><p>Cyan moved to dismiss the Investors\xe2\x80\x99 suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  It argued that what we have termed SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexcept clause\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>the amendment made to \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s concurrent-jurisdiction grant\xe2\x80\x94stripped state courts of power to adjudicate 1933 Act claims in \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Investors did not dispute that their suit qualifies as such an action under SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s definition, see \xc2\xa777p(f)(2).  But they maintained that SLUSA left intact state courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over all suits\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94alleging only 1933 Act claims.  The California Superior Court agreed with the Investors and denied Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a.  The state appellate courts then denied review of that ruling.  See <i>id.,</i> at 15a\xe2\x80\x9316a.</p><p>We granted Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), to resolve a split among state and federal courts about whether SLUSA deprived state courts of jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d asserting only 1933 Act claims.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>In opposing Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional position here, the Federal Government as <i>amicus curiae</i> raised another question: whether SLUSA enabled defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions from state to federal court for adjudication.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 23\xe2\x80\x9331.  That question is not directly presented because Cyan never attempted to remove the Investors\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  But the removal issue is related to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdictional arguments, and both Cyan and the Investors addressed it in briefing and argument.  See Brief for Petitioners 39\xe2\x80\x9340; Brief for Respondents 31\xe2\x80\x9335; Tr. of Arg. 31, 53\xe2\x80\x9356, 74\xe2\x80\x9376, 80.  Accordingly, we consider as well the scope of \xc2\xa777p(c)\xe2\x80\x99s removal authorization.</p><p>II</p><p>By its terms, \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexcept clause\xe2\x80\x9d does nothing to deprive state courts of their jurisdiction to decide class actions brought under the 1933 Act.  And Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s various appeals to SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes and legislative history fail to overcome the clear statutory language.  The statute says what it says\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps better put here, does not say what it does not say.  State-court jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims thus continues undisturbed.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>A</p><p>SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s text, read most straightforwardly, leaves in place state courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims, including when brought in class actions.  Recall that the background rule of \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x94in place since the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage\xe2\x80\x94gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over all suits \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce any liability or duty created by\xe2\x80\x9d that statute.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  The except clause\xe2\x80\x94once again, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided in section 77p of this title with respect to covered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is drafted as a limitation on that rule: It ensures that in any case in which \xc2\xa777v(a) and \xc2\xa777p come into conflict, \xc2\xa777p will control.  The critical question for this case is therefore whether \xc2\xa777p limits state-court jurisdiction over class actions brought under the 1933 Act.  It does not.  As earlier described, \xc2\xa777p bars certain securities class actions based on <i>state </i>law.  See \xc2\xa777p(b); <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  And as a corollary of that prohibition, it authorizes removal of those suits so that a federal court can dismiss them.  See \xc2\xa777p(c); <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  But the section says nothing, and so does nothing, to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over class actions based on <i>federal </i>law.  That means the background rule of \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x94under which a state court may hear the Investors\xe2\x80\x99 1933 Act suit\xe2\x80\x94continues to govern.</p><p> Cyan offers an alternative reading, in which one of SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s definitional provisions works to alter state-court jurisdiction.  According to Cyan, the except clause\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class actions\xe2\x80\x9d points the reader to, and only to, \xc2\xa777p(f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of that term.  See Brief for Petitioners 16.  And that definition states that a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action\xe2\x80\x9d is a suit seeking damages on behalf of more than 50 persons\xe2\x80\x94without mentioning anything about whether the suit is based on state or federal law.  Cyan thus concludes that the except clause exempts all sizable class actions\xe2\x80\x94including the Investors\xe2\x80\x99 suit\xe2\x80\x94from \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s conferral of jurisdiction on state courts.</p><p>But that view cannot be squared with the except clause\xe2\x80\x99s wording for two independent reasons.  To start with, the except clause points to \xe2\x80\x9csection 77p\xe2\x80\x9d as a whole\xe2\x80\x94not to paragraph 77p(f)(2).  Cyan wants to cherry pick from the material covered by the statutory cross-reference.  But if Congress had intended to refer to the definition in \xc2\xa777p(f)(2) alone, it presumably would have done so\xe2\x80\x94just by adding a letter, a number, and a few parentheticals.  As this Court recently explained, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress often drafts statutes with hierarchical schemes\xe2\x80\x94section, subsection, paragraph, and on down the line.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>SW General, Inc.</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9).  And \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen Congress want[s] to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph, it sa[ys] so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  It said no such thing in the except clause.</p><p>In any event, the definitional paragraph on which Cyan relies cannot be read to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[]\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cexcept[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d to the rule of concurrent jurisdiction, in the way SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s except clause requires.  A definition does not provide an exception, but instead gives meaning to a term\xe2\x80\x94and Congress well knows the difference between those two functions.  Thousands of statutory provisions use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d followed by a cross-reference in order to indicate that one rule should prevail over another in any circumstance in which the two conflict; we count more than 30 such constructions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts alone.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  Not one of those 30-plus provisions cross-references a <i>definition</i>; nor has Cyan pointed to a single such example from the whole rest of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.  And the Congress enacting SLUSA had no reason to attempt that peculiar maneuver for the first time.  If Congress had wanted to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act class actions, it had an easy way to do so: just insert into \xc2\xa777p an exclusive federal jurisdiction provision (like the 1934 Act\xe2\x80\x99s) for such suits.  That rule, when combined with the except clause, would have done the trick because it would have \xe2\x80\x9cprovided\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cexcept[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s grant of concurrent jurisdiction; by contrast, a mere definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action\xe2\x80\x9d (as a damages suit on behalf of 50-plus people) does not so provide.</p><p>SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s <i>other </i>conforming amendment illustrates the two ways in which Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the except clause departs from its language.  Recall that \xc2\xa777v(a) includes a general bar on removal.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And recall that SLUSA appended to that prohibition the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in section 77p(c)\xe2\x80\x9d to reflect the statute\xe2\x80\x99s new permission to remove certain class actions.  See <i>supra,</i>  at 5.  In <i>that </i>\xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided\xe2\x80\x9d phrase\xe2\x80\x94just four sentences down from the except clause central to this case\xe2\x80\x94Congress pinpointed a subsection of \xc2\xa777p, rather than citing the entire section for only one of its parts.  Still more, that cross-referenced subsection contains an operative provision that could limit a rule, rather than a mere definition of a statutory term.  In short, Congress wrote the removal bar\xe2\x80\x99s except clause in just the way a reader of legislation would expect\xe2\x80\x94and not in the wholly irregular way Cyan proposes for the except clause at issue here.  Especially given the two provisions\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinterrelationship and close proximity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Commissioner</i> v. <i>Lundy</i>,516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235,250 (1996), the one conforming amendment highlights how far Cyan seeks to stretch the text of the other.</p><p>Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation also fits poorly with the remainder of the statutory scheme.  Because Cyan treats the broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action\xe2\x80\x9d as altering \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional grant, its construction would prevent state courts from deciding any 1933 Act class suits seeking damages for more than 50 plaintiffs.  That would include suits not involving a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered security\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>a security traded on a national stock exchange.  \xc2\xa777p(f)(3); Brief for Petitioners 29 (conceding that point).  But this Court has emphasized that SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s operative provisions (including its state-law class-action bar, see \xc2\xa777p(b)) apply to only \xe2\x80\x9ctransactions in covered securities\xe2\x80\x9d: The statute \xe2\x80\x9cex- presses no concern\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ctransactions in uncovered securi- ties\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94precisely because they are not traded on national markets.  <i>Chadbourne &amp; Parke LLP</i> v. <i>Troice</i>,571 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377, ___ (2014) (slip. op., at 9); see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (SLUSA does not regard suits involving uncovered securities as \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of distinct federal concern\xe2\x80\x9d).  Those securities, the Court explained, are \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily of state concern,\xe2\x80\x9d and SLUSA \xe2\x80\x9cmaintains state legal authority\xe2\x80\x9d to address them.  <i>Chadbourne</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  Except that under Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s view, SLUSA would not.  Instead, the law would strip state courts of jurisdiction over suits about securities raising no particular national interest.  That result is out of line with SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s overall scope.</p><p>And finally, Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s take on the except clause reads too much into a mere \xe2\x80\x9cconforming amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d112Stat.3230.  The change Cyan claims that clause made to state-court jurisdiction is the very opposite of a minor tweak.  When Congress passed SLUSA, state courts had for 65 years adjudicated all manner of 1933 Act cases, including class actions.  Indeed, defendants could not even remove those cases to federal court, as schemes of concurrent jurisdiction almost always allow.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  State courts thus had as much or more power over the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement as over any federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s.  To think Cyan right, we would have to believe that Congress upended that entrenched practice not by any direct means, but instead by way of a conforming amendment to \xc2\xa777v(a) (linked, in its view, with only a definition).  But Congress does not make \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x94but entirely implicit\xe2\x80\x94change[s]\xe2\x80\x9d through \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical and conforming amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Director of Revenue of Mo.</i> v. <i>CoBank ACB</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316,324 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Or to use the more general (and snappier) formulation of that rule, relevant to all \xe2\x80\x9cancillary provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress does not \xe2\x80\x9chide elephants in mouseholes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,468 (2001).  That is yet one more reason to reject Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s view of SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p><p>B</p><p>Faced with such recalcitrant statutory language, Cyan stakes much of its case on legislative purpose and history.  See Brief for Petitioners 20\xe2\x80\x9333, 36\xe2\x80\x9337; Reply Brief 7\xe2\x80\x9311, 17\xe2\x80\x9321.  Its claims come in two forms\xe2\x80\x94one relating to the goals of SLUSA as a whole and the other relating to the aims of the except clause.  Even assuming clear text can ever give way to purpose, Cyan would need some monster arguments on this score to create doubts about SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  The points Cyan raises come nowhere close to that level.</p><p>1</p><p>According to Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s broad purposive argument, Congress could not \xe2\x80\x9cmake good on the promise of the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which was its principal intention in enacting SLUSA\xe2\x80\x94without divesting state courts of jurisdiction over all sizable 1933 Act class actions.  Brief for Petitioners 20.  Remember that the Reform Act contained a number of procedural measures (for example, a sworn-certification requirement for lead plaintiffs, see \xc2\xa777z\xe2\x80\x931(a)(2)(A)) that apply only in federal court.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  Plaintiffs bringing 1933 Act class actions could avoid those provisions simply by filing in state court; after all, those suits were not even removable by defendants.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d Cyan claims, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted SLUSA to finish the job\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by shutting down the state forum and shifting all 1933 Act class actions to the federal one.  Brief for Petitioners 21.  In support of that view, Cyan cites several statements in SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative reports\xe2\x80\x94in particular, that SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade the protections that Federal law provides against abusive litigation by filing suit in State, rather than in Federal, court.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 105\xe2\x80\x93803, p.\xc2\xa013 (1998); see H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 105\xe2\x80\x93640, pp. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1998); S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 105\xe2\x80\x93182, p.\xc2\xa03 (1998).</p><p>But to begin with, Cyan ignores a different way in which SLUSA \xe2\x80\x9cserve[d] the [Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s] objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 11\xe2\x80\x94which our view of the statute fully effects.  Recall that the Reform Act also included substantive sections protecting defendants (like a safe harbor for forward-looking statements) in suits brought under the federal securities laws.  See \xc2\xa777z\xe2\x80\x932; <i>supra,</i> at 2.  Plaintiffs could\xe2\x80\x94and did\xe2\x80\x94avoid those provisions by bringing their complaints of securities misconduct under state law instead.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  Hence emerged SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s bar on state-law class actions (and its removal provision to ensure their dismissal)\xe2\x80\x94which guaranteed that the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s heightened substantive standards would govern all future securities class litigation.  SLUSA itself highlights that aim: Its preamble states that the statute is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto limit the conduct of securities class actions under State law, and for other purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d112Stat.3227.  So too, this Court has underscored, over and over, SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose to preclude certain vexing state-law<i> </i>class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kircher</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 645, n.\xc2\xa012; see <i>Dabit</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82 (SLUSA stopped plaintiffs from \xe2\x80\x9cbringing class actions under state law\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Amgen Inc.</i> v. <i>Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds</i>,568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 455,476 (2013)<i> </i>(SLUSA \xe2\x80\x9ccurtailed plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to evade the [Reform Act] by bringing class-action suits under state rather than federal law\xe2\x80\x9d).  That object\xe2\x80\x94which SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s text actually reflects\xe2\x80\x94does not depend on stripping state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act class suits, as Cyan proposes.  For wherever those suits go forward, the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive protections necessarily apply.</p><p>Still more, SLUSA ensured that federal courts would play the principal role in adjudicating securities class actions by means of its revisions to the <i>1934</i> Act.  As explained earlier, SLUSA amended that statute in the same main way it did the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x94by adding a state-law class-action bar.  See \xc2\xa778bb(f\xc2\xa0)(1); <i>supra,</i> at 3.  But there, the change had a double effect: Because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over 1934 Act claims, forcing plaintiffs to bring class actions under the 1934 statute instead of state law also forced them to file in federal court.  That meant the bulk of securities class actions would proceed in federal court\xe2\x80\x94because the 1934 Act regulates all trading of securities whereas the 1933 Act addresses only securities offerings.  See <i>Blue Chip Stamps</i>, 421 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 752 (characterizing the 1933 Act as \xe2\x80\x9ca far narrower statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  So even without Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s contrived reading of the except clause, SLUSA largely accomplished the purpose articulated in its Conference Report: moving securities class actions to federal court.</p><p>To be sure, \xe2\x80\x9clargely\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean \xe2\x80\x9centirely\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but then again, we do not generally expect statutes to fulfill 100% of all of their goals.  See, <i>e.g., Freeman</i> v. <i>Quicken Loans, Inc.</i>,566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624,637 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo legislation pursues its purposes at all costs\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Under our reading of SLUSA, all covered securities class actions must proceed under federal law; most (<i>i.e., </i>those alleging 1934 Act claims) must proceed in federal court; some (<i>i.e., </i>those alleging 1933 Act claims) may proceed in state court.  We do not know why Congress declined to require as well that 1933 Act class actions be brought in federal court; perhaps it was because of the long and unusually pronounced tradition of according authority to state courts over 1933 Act litigation.  See <i>supra,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  But in any event, we will not revise that legislative choice, by reading a conforming amendment and a definition in a most improbable way, in an effort to make the world of securities litigation more consistent or pure.  This Court has long rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>whatever </i>furthers the statute\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective must be the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rodriguez</i> v. <i>United States</i>,480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522,526 (1987) (<i>per curiam</i>).  Even if Congress could or should have done more, still it \xe2\x80\x9cwrote the statute it wrote\xe2\x80\x94meaning, a statute going so far and no further.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Michigan </i>v. <i>Bay Mills Indian Community</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>2</p><p>Yet Cyan has a final argument\xe2\x80\x94that the except clause would serve no purpose at all unless it works as Cyan says.  See Brief for Petitioners 32\xe2\x80\x9333; Reply Brief 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  Here, Cyan relies on an indubitable puzzle.  Section 77v(a), as amended by SLUSA, gives state courts jurisdiction over <i>1933 Act</i> suits \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided in \xc2\xa777p.\xe2\x80\x9d  But \xc2\xa777p provides a bar on only certain <i>state-law </i>suits.  So, Cyan contends, unless we take up its invitation to look to \xc2\xa777p(f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccovered class action,\xe2\x80\x9d the except clause excepts \xe2\x80\x9cexactly nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 8.  (To use an example of our own, it would be as if a parent told her child \xe2\x80\x9cyou may have fruit after dinner, except for lollipops.\xe2\x80\x9d)  What on earth, Cyan asks, would be the point of such a provision?</p><p>The Investors answer that question with a theory about why Congress enacted the except clause.  In their view, the clause was meant to deal with \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d securities class actions\xe2\x80\x94containing both claims brought under the 1933 Act and claims arising under state law.  See Brief for Respondents 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  If not for the except clause, the Investors posit, state courts would have been uncertain about how to handle those suits.  Section 77p clearly instructs courts not to adjudicate the state-law claims; but (the Investors continue) \xc2\xa777v(a) gives state courts jurisdiction over entire \xe2\x80\x9cactions\xe2\x80\x9d brought to enforce the 1933 Act, even if they include additional state-law claims.  What, then, to do?  According to the Investors, the except clause\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to resolve that statutory conflict by making clear that \xc2\xa777p trumps \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x94in other words, that a state court may not entertain state-law claims precluded by \xc2\xa777p(b) even when they are conjoined with 1933 Act claims falling within \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s grant of jurisdiction.</p><p>Truth be told, we are not sure whether Congress had that issue in mind.  On the one hand (and contrary to what the Investors say), we doubt that the except clause was really necessary to address mixed class actions.  Even without that clause, a competent state court faced with such a suit would understand that \xc2\xa777p requires dismissal of the state-law claims\xe2\x80\x94and that \xc2\xa777v(a)\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional grant over 1933 Act suits is not to the contrary.  But on the other hand (and now supporting the Investors\xe2\x80\x99 principal point), Congress may have thought that class-action lawyers would still try to circumvent SLUSA by tacking a 1933 Act claim onto a forbidden state-law class action, on the off chance of finding an error-prone judge.  (After all, the worst that could happen was that the court would throw out the state-law claims, leaving the plaintiff with a permissible 1933 Act suit.)  To prevent such gamesmanship\xe2\x80\x94to make clear beyond peradventure that courts could not entertain the state-law half of mixed class actions\xe2\x80\x94Congress might have added the except clause.</p><p>But even if Congress never specifically considered mixed suits, it could well have added the except clause in a more general excess of caution\xe2\x80\x94to safeguard \xc2\xa777p\xe2\x80\x99s class-action bar come whatever might.  This Court has encountered many examples of Congress legislating in that hyper-vigilant way, to \xe2\x80\x9cremov[e] any doubt\xe2\x80\x9d as to things not particularly doubtful in the first instance.  <i>Marx</i> v. <i>General Revenue Corp.</i>,568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371\xe2\x80\x93384 (2013) (citing <i>Ali</i> v. <i>Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214,226 (2008); <i>Fort Stewart Schools</i> v. <i>FLRA</i>,495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 641,646 (1990)).  (The idea, to return to our prior example, is to make sure that even if the child thinks orange lollipops count as fruit, she will not act on that view.)  And if ever Congress had reason to legislate in that fashion, it was in SLUSA\xe2\x80\x94whose very impetus lay in the success of class-action attorneys in \xe2\x80\x9cbypass[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Reform Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kircher</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.  Heedful of that history of machinations, Congress may have determined to eliminate any risk\xe2\x80\x94even if unlikely or at the time unknown\xe2\x80\x94that a pre-existing grant of power to state courts could be used to obstruct SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s new limitation on what they could decide.  And so (this alternative explanation goes) Congress enacted the except clause\xe2\x80\x94which, in insisting that the limitation prevailed, would function as the ultimate (though with any luck, unneeded) fail-safe device.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>But the most important response to this purposive argument echoes what we have said before about the weaknesses of Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s own construction of the except clause.  In the end, the uncertainty surrounding Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for drafting that clause does not matter.  Nor does the possibility that the risk Congress addressed (whether specific or inchoate) did not exist.  Because irrespective of those points, we have no sound basis for giving the except clause a broader reading than its language can bear.  And that is especially true in light of the dramatic change such an interpretation would work in the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional framework.  Whatever questions remain as to the except clause\xe2\x80\x99s precise purpose\xe2\x80\x94and we do not gainsay there are some\xe2\x80\x94they do not give us permission to devise a statute (and at that, a transformative one) of our own.</p><p>III</p><p>Our last task is to address the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed halfway-house position.  The Government rejects Cyan\xe2\x80\x99s view that SLUSA stripped state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act class actions, for roughly the same reasons we have given.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11\xe2\x80\x9323.  But like Cyan, the Government believes that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would not have been content to leave\xe2\x80\x9d such suits \xe2\x80\x9cstuck in state court,\xe2\x80\x9d where the Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s procedural protections do not apply.  <i>Id.,</i> at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted).  So the Government offers a reading of SLUSA\xe2\x80\x94in particular, of \xc2\xa777p(c)\xe2\x80\x94that would allow defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions to federal court, as long as they allege the kinds of misconduct listed in \xc2\xa777p(b) (<i>e.g., </i>false statements or deceptive devices in connection with a covered security\xe2\x80\x99s purchase or sale).  See <i>id.,</i> at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.</p><p>But most naturally read, \xc2\xa777p(c)\xe2\x80\x94SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s general bar on removal\xe2\x80\x94refutes, not supports, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Once again, see <i>supra,</i> at 4, \xc2\xa777p(c) reads as follows:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cAny covered class action brought in any State court involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal district court for the district in which the action is pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>In other words, the covered class actions described in \xc2\xa777p(b) can be removed to federal court (and, once there, shall be subject to dismissal because precluded, see <i>supra,</i> at 5).  And which are the covered class actions described in \xc2\xa777p(b)?  By this point, no one should have to be reminded: They are <i>state-law </i>class actions alleging securities misconduct.  See \xc2\xa777p(b) (prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cclass action[s] based upon the statutory or common law of any State\xe2\x80\x9d).  So those state-law suits are removable.  But conversely, <i>federal-law</i> suits like this one\xe2\x80\x94alleging only 1933 Act claims\xe2\x80\x94are not \xe2\x80\x9cclass action[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as set forth in subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  So they remain subject to the 1933 Act\xe2\x80\x99s removal ban.</p><p>In fact, this Court already held as much, by concluding in <i>Kircher </i>that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777p(b) and 77p(c) apply to the exact same universe of class actions.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 643\xe2\x80\x93644.  <i>Kircher </i>involved a securities suit that was unaffected by \xc2\xa777p(b)\xe2\x80\x99s class-action bar\xe2\x80\x94there, not because it was based on federal law but because it involved a form of conduct falling outside that subsection.  The Court of Appeals decided that the suit could be removed under \xc2\xa777p(c) even though it was not precluded by \xc2\xa777p(b), thinking (as we later put it) that the removal issue and \xe2\x80\x9cthe preclusion issue [were] distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 638.  We flatly rejected that understanding of the relationship between \xc2\xa777p(b) and \xc2\xa777p(c).  The \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward reading\xe2\x80\x9d of those two provisions, we explained, is that removal is \xe2\x80\x9climited to those [actions] precluded by the terms of subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 643.  And if that were not clear enough, we said it again: Removal under \xc2\xa777p(c) is \xe2\x80\x9crestricted to precluded actions defined by subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 643\xe2\x80\x93644.  And just to pound the point home, we said it yet a third time: \xe2\x80\x9cA covered [class] action is removable if it is precluded.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 646.  <i>Kircher </i>thus forecloses the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  Section 77p(b) does not preclude federal-law class actions.  So under our decision, \xc2\xa777p(c) does not authorize their removal.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>The Government responds with a novel way of understanding \xc2\xa777p(c), which it thinks would allow us to disregard <i>Kircher </i>when a class action like this one is based on federal law.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, first presented at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\xe2\x80\x9333, the words \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d do not modify the entire preceding phrase (basically, any large class action involving a covered security).  Instead, the Government claims, those words modify only the shorter phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a covered security.\xe2\x80\x9d  To support that view, the Government invokes the \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94under which \xe2\x80\x9cthe limiting clause is most naturally applied to the thing that comes immediately before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 36.  The Government then presents a theory of how subsection (b) \xe2\x80\x9cset[s] forth\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[ement]\xe2\x80\x9d of a covered security.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o figure out what that means,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government contends, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look at [\xc2\xa777p](b)(1) and (b)(2), which talk about certain types of misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, false statements or deceptive devices in connection with a covered security\xe2\x80\x99s sale.  <i>Id.,</i> at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  As long as conduct of that kind is implicated in a suit, the Government concludes, it can be removed\xe2\x80\x94even if it is based on federal law and thus does not fall within \xc2\xa777p(b) as a whole.  That view is consistent with <i>Kircher</i>\xe2\x80\x99s result because the action there did not involve the conduct described in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777p(b)(1) and (2).  And as to <i>Kircher</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. well, we should feel free to ignore it.</p><p>But even putting aside respect for precedent, that argument is in many ways flawed.  To start with, the Government provides no good reason to think that \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a covered security.\xe2\x80\x9d  As stated above, the most natural way to view the modifier is as applying to the entire preceding clause\xe2\x80\x94again, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny covered class action brought in any State court involving a covered security.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 19.  That is so because that clause hangs together as a unified whole, referring to a single thing (a type of class action).  Consider the following, grammatically identical construction: \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman dressed to the nines carrying an umbrella, as shown in the picture .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Would anyone think that \xe2\x80\x9cas shown in the picture\xe2\x80\x9d referred to anything less than the well-attired and rain-ready <i>woman</i>?  No.  And so too here, the modifier goes back to the beginning of the preceding clause.  The rule of the last antecedent is not to the contrary.  We have applied that rule when the alternative reading would \xe2\x80\x9cstretch[] the modifier too far\xe2\x80\x9d by asking it to qualify a remote or otherwise disconnected phrase.  <i>Jama</i> v. <i>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</i>,543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335,342 (2005); <i>Lockhart </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4) (using the rule \xe2\x80\x9cwhere it takes more than a little mental energy to process\xe2\x80\x9d a statute\xe2\x80\x99s component parts, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking it a heavy lift to carry the modifier across them all\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  By contrast, we have not applied the rule when the modifier directly follows a concise and \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  <i>Jama</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 344, n.\xc2\xa04.  As it does here.</p><p>But let us assume that the rule of the last antecedent governs: The Government then misapplies it by attaching the modifier to something <i>more </i>than the last thing before it.  The rule, correctly used, would insist that \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only \xe2\x80\x9ca covered security\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because that is the closest \xe2\x80\x9cnoun or noun phrase\xe2\x80\x9d that the modifier could reasonably reference.  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 144 (2012) (quoting R. Burchfield, Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s Modern English Usage (3d ed. 1996)).  But that standard way of applying the rule would not aid the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction, so it goes back yet another word: It attaches \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d to the longer phrase\xe2\x80\x94and a verb phrase at that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c<i>involving</i> a covered security.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.  That maneuver has no grammatical basis.  (It is as if, in the example offered above, someone claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cas shown in the picture\xe2\x80\x9d modified not the woman, nor even the umbrella, but instead the in-between verb phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<i>carrying </i>an umbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d)  The Government is choosing where to start in the sentence (that is, which words to qualify) based only on what best serves its argument.</p><p>But let us even assume that \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d modifies \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a covered security\xe2\x80\x9d: The language would still fail to explain the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Remember that the Government reads the resulting phrase (again, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d) to point only to the forms of wrongful conduct listed in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777p(b)(1) and (2)\xe2\x80\x94for example, false statements or deceptive devices in securities sales.  See <i>supra,</i> at 21.  The problem is that no one would describe those misdeeds with that phrase.  If Congress had meant to refer only to that behavior, rather than to everything in \xc2\xa777p(b), it would have done two things differently.  First, Congress would have written \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d as a whole.  See <i>supra,</i> at 9 (explaining that when Congress wants to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph, it says so).  And second, Congress would have written something like \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving allegations of misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a covered security\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because the latter phrase does not even passably describe \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777(b)(1) and (2)\xe2\x80\x99s catalog of vices.  We will not read \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving allegations of misconduct, as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)\xe2\x80\x9d when Congress did not enact that formulation.  See <i>Lozano </i>v. <i>Montoya Alvarez</i>,572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14) (\xe2\x80\x9cGiven that the drafters did not adopt that alternative, the natural implication is that they did not intend\xe2\x80\x9d to do so).</p><p>And (finally, we promise) even if we could put out of mind all these difficulties, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position runs aground on \xc2\xa777p(c)\xe2\x80\x99s last clause, which states that removed class actions \xe2\x80\x9cshall be subject to subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  That clause, properly understood, points toward dismissal<i> </i>of a removed action.  As we earlier explained, and the Government concedes, Congress enacted \xc2\xa777p(c)\xe2\x80\x99s removal provision out of \xe2\x80\x9cconcern[] that state courts would not adequately enforce\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa777p(b)\xe2\x80\x99s state-law class-action prohibition.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3; see <i>supra,</i> at 5.

As this Court recently noted, some state-law securities claims \xe2\x80\x9crise[] or fall[] on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prove the violation\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal securities statute.  <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</i> v. <i>Manning</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (addressing the 1934 Act).  In such cases, we held, the state-law claims are \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d a liability created by the federal statute, and thus fall within that law\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).  In the absence of the except clause, then, class-action lawyers might well have argued that such state-law claims could be adjudicated under \xc2\xa777v(a) notwithstanding \xc2\xa777p\xe2\x80\x99s bar.  Once again, we think most courts would have rejected that claim and decided that \xc2\xa777p controls\xe2\x80\x94but the except clause eliminates any chance of a contrary holding. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T5">5</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0In light of SLUSA\xe2\x80\x99s text and <i>Kircher</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, it should come as no surprise that all seven Courts of Appeals to have considered the matter have concluded that \xc2\xa777p(c) allows removal of only class actions falling within \xc2\xa777p(b)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.
