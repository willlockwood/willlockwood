The jury convicted petitioner and sentenced him to death.  Both on direct appeal and on remand in light of <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/231/index.html">545 U. S. 231</a>, the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory strikes of certain prospective jurors, including Mr. Brooks, were based on race, in violation of <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U.

S. 322</a>, 328\xe2\x80\x93329).  Unless it is clearly erroneous, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling must be sustained on appeal.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s role is pivotal, for it must evaluate the demeanor of the prosecutor exercising the challenge and the juror being excluded.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0While all of the circumstances bearing on the racial-animosity issue must be consulted in considering a <em>Batson</em> objection or reviewing a ruling claimed to be a <em>Batson </em>error, the explanation given for striking Mr. Brooks, a college senior attempting to fulfill his student-teaching obligation, is insufficient by itself and suffices for a <em>Batson </em>error determination.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0It cannot be presumed that the trial court credited the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s first race-neutral reason, that Mr. Brooks looked nervous.  Deference is owed to a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that an attorney credibly relied on demeanor in exercising a strike, but here, the trial judge simply allowed the challenge without explanation.  Since Mr. Brooks was not challenged until the day after he was questioned and thus after dozens of other jurors had been called, the judge might not have recalled his demeanor.  Or he may have found such consideration unnecessary, instead basing his ruling on the second proffered reason for the strike.  P.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0That reason\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 student-teaching obligation\xe2\x80\x94fails even under the highly deferential standard of review applicable here.  Mr. Brooks was 1 of more than 50 venire members expressing concern that jury service or sequestration would interfere with work, school, family, or other obligations.  Although he was initially concerned about making up lost teaching time, he expressed no further concern once a law clerk reported that the school\xe2\x80\x99s dean would work with Mr. Brooks if he missed time for a trial that week, and the prosecutor did not question him more deeply about the matter.  The proffered reason must be evaluated in light of the circumstances that the colloquy and law clerk report took place on Tuesday, the prosecution struck Mr. Brooks on Wednesday, the trial\xe2\x80\x99s guilt phase ended on Thursday, and its penalty phase ended on Friday.  The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s scenario\xe2\x80\x94that Mr. Brooks would have been inclined to find petitioner guilty of a lesser included offense to obviate the need for a penalty phase\xe2\x80\x94is both highly speculative and unlikely.  Mr. Brooks would be in a position to shorten the trial only if most or all of the jurors had favored a lesser verdict.  Perhaps most telling, the trial\xe2\x80\x99s brevity, which the prosecutor anticipated on the record during <em>voir dire,</em> meant that jury service would not have seriously interfered with Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 ability to complete his student teaching.  The dean offered to work with him, and the trial occurred relatively early in the fall term, giving Mr. Brooks several weeks to make up the time.  The implausibility of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is reinforced by his acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have been at least as serious as Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99.  Under <em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s third stage, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s pretextual explanation gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.  There is no need to decide here whether, in <em>Batson</em> cases, once a discriminatory intent is shown to be a motivating factor, the burden shifts to the prosecution to show that the discriminatory factor was not determinative.  It is enough to recognize that a peremptory strike shown to have been motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent could not be sustained based on any lesser showing by the prosecution.  The record here does not show that the prosecution would have pre-emptively challenged Mr. Brooks based on his nervousness alone, and there is no realistic possibility that the subtle question of causation could be profitably explored further on remand more than a decade after petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial.

He asks us to review a decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court rejecting his claim that the prosecution exercised some of its peremptory jury challenges based on race, in violation of <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986).  We hold that the trial court committed clear error in its ruling on a <em>Batson</em> objection, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The crime for which petitioner was convicted occurred in August 1995.  At that time, petitioner and his wife, Mary, had separated.  On August 15, they discussed the possibility of reconciliation, and Mary agreed to meet with petitioner the next day.  That night, Mary went on a date with Howard Wilson.  During the evening, petitioner repeatedly attempted to page Mary, but she did not respond.  At approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 16, Wilson drove up to the home of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s mother to drop Mary off.  Petitioner was waiting at the scene armed with a knife.  He opened the driver\xe2\x80\x99s side door of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s car and repeatedly stabbed the occupants, killing Wilson and wounding Mary. </p>\n<p align="left">The State charged petitioner with first-degree murder and sought the death penalty based on the aggravating circumstance that petitioner had knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person.  See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 905.4(A)(4) (West Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Voir dire</em> began on Tuesday, August 27, 1996, and proceeded as follows.  During the first phase, the trial court screened the panel to identify jurors who did not meet Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for jury service or claimed that service on the jury or sequestration for the duration of the trial would result in extreme hardship.  More than 50 prospective jurors reported that they had work, family, or other commitments that would interfere with jury service.  In each of those instances, the nature of the conflicting commitments was explored, and some of these jurors were dismissed.  App. 58\xe2\x80\x93164.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the next phase, the court randomly selected panels of 13 potential jurors for further questioning.  <em>Id.,</em> at 166\xe2\x80\x93167.  The defense and prosecution addressed each panel and questioned the jurors both as a group and individually.  At the conclusion of this questioning, the court ruled on challenges for cause.  Then, the prosecution and the defense were given the opportunity to use peremptory challenges (each side had 12) to remove remaining jurors.  The court continued this process of calling 13-person panels until the jury was filled.  In accordance with Louisiana law, the parties were permitted to exercise \xe2\x80\x9cbackstrikes.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is, they were allowed to use their peremptories up until the time when the final jury was sworn and thus were permitted to strike jurors whom they had initially accepted when the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 panels were called.  See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 795(b)(1); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor</em>, 93\xe2\x80\x932201, pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (La. 2/28/96), 669 So.\xc2\xa02d 364, 376.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eighty-five prospective jurors were questioned as members of a panel.  Thirty-six of these survived challenges for cause; 5 of the 36 were black; and all 5 of the prospective black jurors were eliminated by the prosecution through the use of peremptory strikes.  The jury found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder and determined that he should receive the death penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court conditionally affirmed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  The court rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Batson</em> claim but remanded the case for a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>determination of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s competency to stand trial.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>98\xe2\x80\x931078 (La. 4/14/99), 750 So.\xc2\xa02d 832.  Two justices dissented and would have found a <em>Batson</em> violation.  See <em>id.,</em> at 866 (Johnson, J., dissenting), 863 (Lemmon, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the trial court found that petitioner had been competent to stand trial, and the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed that determination.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Snyder,</em> 1998\xe2\x80\x931078 (La. 4/14/04), 874 So.\xc2\xa02d 739.  Petitioner petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, and while his petition was pending, this Court decided <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/231/index.html">545 U. S. 231</a> (2005).  We then granted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Louisiana Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>Miller-El</em>.  See <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/1137/index.html">545 U. S. 1137</a> (2005).  On remand, the Louisiana Supreme Court again rejected Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Batson </em>claim, this time by a vote of 4 to 3.  See 1998\xe2\x80\x931078 (La. 9/6/06), 942 So.\xc2\xa02d 484.

S. 322</a>, 328\xe2\x80\x93329 (2003)).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous.  See <em>Hernandez</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/352/index.html">500 U. S. 352</a>, 369 (1991) (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>, at 372 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  The trial court has a pivotal role in evaluating <em>Batson</em> claims.  Step three of the <em>Batson</em> inquiry involves an evaluation of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, see 476 U. S., at 98, n.\xc2\xa021, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe best evidence [of discriminatory intent] often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hernandez</em>, 500 U. S., at 365 (plurality opinion).  In addition, race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often invoke a juror\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor (<em>e.g.</em>, nervousness, inattention), making the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s first-hand observations of even greater importance.  In this situation, the trial court must evaluate not only whether the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor belies a discriminatory intent, but also whether the juror\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor can credibly be said to have exhibited the basis for the strike attributed to the juror by the prosecutor.  We have recognized that these determinations of credibility and demeanor lie \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98peculiarly within a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s province,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Wainwright</em> v. <em>Witt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/412/index.html">469 U. S. 412</a>, 428 (1985)), and we have stated that \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of exceptional circumstances, we would defer to [the trial court].\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U.

Because we find that the trial court committed clear error in overruling petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Batson</em> objection with respect to Mr. Brooks, we have no need to consider petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim regarding Ms. Scott.  See,<em> e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Vasquez-Lopez</em>, 22 F.\xc2\xa03d 900, 902 (CA9 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Constitution forbids striking even a single prospective juror for a discriminatory purpose\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> 866 F.\xc2\xa02d 103, 105 (CA4 1989); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Clemons,</em> 843 F.\xc2\xa02d 741, 747 (CA3 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Battle</em>, 836 F.\xc2\xa02d 1084, 1086 (CA8 1987); <em>United States</em> v. <em>David</em>, 803 F.\xc2\xa02d 1567, 1571 (CA11 1986).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, the Court made it clear that in considering a <em>Batson</em> objection, or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be <em>Batson</em> error, all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.  545 U. S., at 239.  Here, as just one example, if there were persisting doubts as to the outcome, a court would be required to consider the strike of Ms. Scott for the bearing it might have upon the strike of Mr. Brooks.  In this case, however, the explanation given for the strike of Mr. Brooks is by itself unconvincing and suffices for the determination that there was <em>Batson</em> error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When defense counsel made a <em>Batson</em> objection concerning the strike of Mr. Brooks, a college senior who was attempting to fulfill his student-teaching obligation, the prosecution offered two race-neutral reasons for the strike.  The prosecutor explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI thought about it last night.  Number 1, the main reason is that he looked very nervous to me throughout the questioning.  Number 2, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the fellows that came up at the beginning [of <em>voir dire</em>] and said he was going to miss class.  He\xe2\x80\x99s a student teacher.  My main concern is for that reason, that being that he might, to go home quickly, come back with guilty of a lesser verdict so there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a penalty phase.  Those are my two reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 444.</p>\n<p align="left">\nDefense counsel disputed both explanations, <em>id.,</em> at 444\xe2\x80\x93445, and the trial judge ruled as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to allow the challenge.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to allow the challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 445.  We discuss the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s two proffered grounds for striking Mr. Brooks in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the first reason, the Louisiana Supreme Court was correct that \xe2\x80\x9cnervousness cannot be shown from a cold transcript, which is why \xe2\x80\xa6 the [trial] judge\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation must be given much deference.\xe2\x80\x9d  942 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 496.  As noted above, deference is especially appropriate where a trial judge has made a finding that an attorney credibly relied on demeanor in exercising a strike.  Here, however, the record does not show that the trial judge actually made a determination concerning Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor.  The trial judge was given two explanations for the strike.  Rather than making a specific finding on the record concerning Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor, the trial judge simply allowed the challenge without explanation.  It is possible that the judge did not have any impression one way or the other concerning Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor.  Mr. Brooks was not challenged until the day after he was questioned, and by that time dozens of other jurors had been questioned.  Thus, the trial judge may not have recalled Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor.  Or, the trial judge may have found it unnecessary to consider Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor, instead basing his ruling completely on the second proffered justification for the strike.  For these reasons, we cannot presume that the trial judge credited the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Mr. Brooks was nervous.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second reason proffered for the strike of Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x94his student-teaching obligation\xe2\x80\x94fails even under the highly deferential standard of review that is applicable here.  At the beginning of <em>voir dire</em>, when the trial court asked the members of the venire whether jury service or sequestration would pose an extreme hardship, Mr. Brooks was 1 of more than 50 members of the venire who expressed concern that jury service or sequestration would interfere with work, school, family, or other obligations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Mr. Brooks came forward, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR.

Doctor Tillman at Southern University said that as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s just this week, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see that it would cause a problem with Mr. Brooks completing his observation time within this semester.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(MR. BROOKS APPROACHED THE BENCH)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: We talked to Doctor Tillman and he says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see a problem as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s just this week, you know, he\xe2\x80\x99ll work with you on it.  Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR. JEFFREY BROOKS: Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(MR. JEFFREY BROOKS LEFT THE BENCH).\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 116.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once Mr. Brooks heard the law clerk\xe2\x80\x99s report about the conversation with Doctor Tillman, Mr. Brooks did not express any further concern about serving on the jury, and the prosecution did not choose to question him more deeply about this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The colloquy with Mr. Brooks and the law clerk\xe2\x80\x99s report took place on Tuesday, August 27; the prosecution struck Mr. Brooks the following day, Wednesday, August 28; the guilt phase of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial ended the next day, Thursday, August 29; and the penalty phase was completed by the end of the week, on Friday, August 30.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s second proffered reason for striking Mr. Brooks must be evaluated in light of these circumstances.  The prosecutor claimed to be apprehensive that Mr. Brooks, in order to minimize the student-teaching hours missed during jury service, might have been motivated to find petitioner guilty, not of first-degree murder, but of a lesser included offense because this would obviate the need for a penalty phase proceeding.  But this scenario was highly speculative.  Even if Mr. Brooks had favored a quick resolution, that would not have necessarily led him to reject a finding of first-degree murder.  If the majority of jurors had initially favored a finding of first-degree murder, Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 purported inclination might have led him to agree in order to speed the deliberations.  Only if all or most of the other jurors had favored the lesser verdict would Mr. Brooks have been in a position to shorten the trial by favoring such a verdict.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps most telling, the brevity of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial\xe2\x80\x94something that the prosecutor anticipated on the record during <em>voir dire[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</em>\xe2\x80\x94meant that serving on the jury would not have seriously interfered with Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 ability to complete his required student teaching.  As noted, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial was completed by Friday, August 30.  If Mr. Brooks, who reported to court and was peremptorily challenged on Wednesday, August 28, had been permitted to serve, he would have missed only two additional days of student teaching, Thursday, August 29, and Friday, August 30.  Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 dean promised to \xe2\x80\x9cwork with\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brooks to see that he was able to make up any student-teaching time that he missed due to jury service; the dean stated that he did not think that this would be a problem; and the record contains no suggestion that Mr. Brooks remained troubled after hearing the report of the dean\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.  In addition, although the record does not include the academic calendar of Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 university, it is apparent that the trial occurred relatively early in the fall semester.  With many weeks remaining in the term, Mr. Brooks would have needed to make up no more than an hour or two per week in order to compensate for the time that he would have lost due to jury service.  When all of these considerations are taken into account, the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s second proffered justification for striking Mr. Brooks is suspicious.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The implausibility of this explanation is reinforced by the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have been at least as serious as Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99.  We recognize that a retrospective comparison of jurors based on a cold appellate record may be very misleading when alleged similarities were not raised at trial.  In that situation, an appellate court must be mindful that an exploration of the alleged similarities at the time of trial might have shown that the jurors in question were not really comparable.  In this case, however, the shared characteristic, <em>i.e.</em>, concern about serving on the jury due to conflicting obligations, was thoroughly explored by the trial court when the relevant jurors asked to be excused for cause.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A comparison between Mr. Brooks and Roland Laws, a white juror, is particularly striking.  During the initial stage of <em>voir dire</em>, Mr. Laws approached the court and offered strong reasons why serving on the sequestered jury would cause him hardship.  Mr. Laws stated that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca self-employed general contractor,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ctwo houses that are nearing completion, one [with the occupants] \xe2\x80\xa6 moving in this weekend.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 129.  He explained that, if he served on the jury, \xe2\x80\x9cthe people won\xe2\x80\x99t [be able to] move in.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 130.  Mr. Laws also had demanding family obligations:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[M]y wife just had a hysterectomy, so I\xe2\x80\x99m running the kids back and forth to school, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not originally from here, so I have no family in the area, so between the two things, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of bad timing for me.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nAlthough these obligations seem substantially more pressing than Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99, the prosecution questioned Mr. Laws and attempted to elicit assurances that he would be able to serve despite his work and family obligations.  See ibid.</em> (prosecutor asking Mr. Laws \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f you got stuck on jury duty anyway \xe2\x80\xa6 would you try to make other arrangements as best you could?\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the prosecution declined the opportunity to use a peremptory strike on Mr. Laws.  <em>Id.,</em> at 549.  If the prosecution had been sincerely concerned that Mr. Brooks would favor a lesser verdict than first-degree murder in order to shorten the trial, it is hard to see why the prosecution would not have had at least as much concern regarding Mr. Laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The situation regarding another white juror, John Donnes, although less fully developed, is also significant.  At the end of the first day of <em>voir dire</em>, Mr. Donnes approached the court and raised the possibility that he would have an important work commitment later that week.  <em>Id.,</em> at 349.  Because Mr. Donnes stated that he would know the next morning whether he would actually have a problem, the court suggested that Mr. Donnes raise the matter again at that time.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The next day, Mr. Donnes again expressed concern about serving, stating that, in order to serve, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have to cancel too many things,\xe2\x80\x9d including an urgent appointment at which his presence was essential.  <em>Id.,</em> at 467\xe2\x80\x93468.  Despite Mr. Donnes\xe2\x80\x99 concern, the prosecution did not strike him.  <em>Id.,</em> at 490.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As previously noted, the question presented at the third stage of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, 545 U. S., at 277.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of this pretextual explanation naturally gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.  See <em>id.</em>, at 252 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cpretextual significance\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cstated reason [that] does not hold up\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Purkett</em> v. <em>Elem</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/765/index.html">514 U. S. 765</a>, 768 (1995) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cAt [the third] stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Hernandez</em>, 500 U. S., at 365 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the typical peremptory challenge inquiry, the decisive question will be whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory chal-\nlenge should be believed\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Center</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/502/index.html">509 U. S. 502</a>, 511 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ejection of the de-\nfendant\xe2\x80\x99s proffered [nondiscriminatory] reasons will <em>permit</em> the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other circumstances, we have held that, once it is shown that a discriminatory intent was a substantial or motivating factor in an action taken by a state actor, the burden shifts to the party defending the action to show that this factor was not determinative.  See <em>Hunter</em> v. <em>Underwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/222/index.html">471 U. S. 222</a>, 228 (1985).  We have not previously applied this rule in a <em>Batson</em> case, and we need not decide here whether that standard governs in this context.  For present purposes, it is enough to recognize that a peremptory strike shown to have been motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent could not be sustained based on any lesser showing by the prosecution.  And in light of the circumstances here\xe2\x80\x94including absence of anything in the record showing that the trial judge credited the claim that Mr. Brooks was nervous, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s description of both of its proffered explanations as \xe2\x80\x9cmain concern[s],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 444, and the adverse inference noted above\xe2\x80\x94the record does not show that the prosecution would have pre-emptively challenged Mr. Brooks based on his nervousness alone.  See <em>Hunter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228.  Nor is there any realistic possibility that this subtle question of causation could be profitably explored further on remand at this late date, more than a decade after petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore reverse the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 98, 105, 111, 121, 130, 204.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Louisiana Supreme Court did not hold that petitioner had procedurally defaulted reliance on a comparison of the African-American jurors whom the prosecution struck with white jurors whom the prosecution accepted.

The evaluation of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s motives for striking a juror is at bottom a credibility judgment, which lies \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0peculiarly within a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s province.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hernandez</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/352/index.html">500 U.

Because the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination was a \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible view of the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 369, I would affirm the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court begins by setting out the \xe2\x80\x9cdeferential standard,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, that we apply to a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of a <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986), claim, noting that we will overturn a ruling on the question of discriminatory intent only if it is \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 4.  Under this standard, we \xe2\x80\x9cwill not reverse a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of fact simply because we would have decided the case differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Easley</em> v. <em>Cromartie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/234/index.html">532 U. S. 234</a>, 242 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, a reviewing court must ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, \xe2\x80\x98on the entire evidence,\xe2\x80\x99 it is \xe2\x80\x98left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>United States Gypsum Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/364/index.html">333 U. S. 364</a>, 395 (1948)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges two reasons why a trial court \xe2\x80\x9chas a pivotal role in evaluating <em>Batson</em> claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  First, the Court notes that the trial court is uniquely situated to judge the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s credibility because the best evidence of discriminatory intent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> (quoting <em>Hernandez</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 365 (plurality opinion)).  Second, it recognizes that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-hand observations\xe2\x80\x9d of the juror\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor are of \xe2\x80\x9cgrea[t] importance\xe2\x80\x9d in determining whether the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s neutral basis for the strike is credible.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, however, reveals that it is only paying lipservice to the pivotal role of the trial court.  The Court second-guesses the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determinations in this case merely because the judge did not clarify which of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s neutral bases for striking Mr. Brooks was dispositive.  But we have never suggested that a reviewing court should defer to a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of a <em>Batson</em> challenge only if the trial court made specific findings with respect to each of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s proffered race-neutral reasons.  To the contrary, when the grounds for a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision are ambiguous, an appellate court should not presume that the lower court based its decision on an improper ground, particularly when applying a deferential standard of review.  See <em>Sprint/United Management Co. </em>v. <em>Mendelsohn</em>, <em>ante</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecution offered two neutral bases for striking Mr. Brooks: his nervous demeanor and his stated concern about missing class.  App. 444.  The trial court, in rejecting defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Batson</em> challenge, stated only \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to allow the challenge.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to allow the challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 445.  The Court concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record does not show\xe2\x80\x9d whether the trial court made its determination based on Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor or his concern for missing class, <em>ante, </em>at 6, but then speculates as to what the trial court <em>might</em> have thought about Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor.  As a result of that speculation, the Court concludes that it \xe2\x80\x9ccannot presume that the trial court credited the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Mr. Brooks was nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Inexplicably, however, the Court concludes that it <em>can </em>presume that the trial court impermissibly relied on the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly pretextual concern about Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 teaching schedule, even though nothing in the record supports that interpretation over the one the Court rejects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, if the record suggests anything, it is that the judge was more influenced by Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 nervousness than by his concern for missing class.  Following an exchange about whether his desire to get back to class would make Mr. Brooks more likely to support a verdict on a lesser included offense because it might avoid a penalty phase, defense counsel offered its primary rebuttal to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s proffered neutral reasons.  Immediately after argument on the nervousness point, the judge ruled on the <em>Batson</em> challenge, even interrupting the prosecutor to do so:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cMR. VASQUEZ: His main problem yesterday was the fact that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if he would miss some teaching time as a student teacher.  The clerk called the school and whoever it was and the Dean said that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem.  He was told that this would\ngo through the weekend, and he expressed that that was his only concern, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any other problems.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as him looking nervous, hell, everybody out here looks nervous.

Those jurors, however, were never mentioned in the argument before the trial court, nor were they discussed in the filings or opinions on any of the three occasions this case was considered by the Louisiana Supreme Court.*<footcall num="*">  Petitioner failed to suggest a comparison with those two jurors in his petition for certiorari, and apparently only discovered this \xe2\x80\x9cclear error\xe2\x80\x9d in the record when drafting his brief before this Court.  We have no business overturning a conviction, years after the fact and after extensive intervening litigation, based on arguments not presented to the courts below.  Cf. <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/231/index.html">545 U.

The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s neutral explanation for striking Ms. Scott was that she was unsure about her ability to impose the death penalty.  Like the claims made about Mr. Brooks, there is very little in the record either to support or to undermine the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s asserted rationale for striking Ms. Scott.  But the trial court had the benefit of observing the exchange between the prosecutor and Ms. Scott, and accordingly was in the best position to judge whether the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of her response was credible.  When asked if she could consider the death penalty, her first response was inaudible.  App. 360.
