But it not appearing that it amounted to one thousand dollars, the sum required to give this Court appellate jurisdiction from the final judgments or decrees of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, the court afterwards directed the writ of error to be quashed.  The court was of opinion that there was nothing in controversy but the value of the office, and that its value must be ascertained by the salary. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 20 U.
