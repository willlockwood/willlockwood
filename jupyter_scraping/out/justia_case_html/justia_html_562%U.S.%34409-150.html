Covington told them that he had been shot by respondent Bryant outside Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s house and had then driven himself to the lot.  At trial, which occurred before <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a>, and <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U. S. 813</a>, were decided, the officers testified about what Covington said.  Bryant was found guilty of, <em>inter alia, </em>second-degree murder.  Ultimately, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause, as explained in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis, </em>rendered Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements inadmissible testimonial hearsay. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em> Covington\xe2\x80\x99s identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial statements because they had a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 822.  Therefore, their admission at Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In <em>Crawford, </em>this Court held that in order for testimonial evidence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cdemands \xe2\x80\xa6 unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em> 541 U. S., at 68.  <em>Crawford</em> did not \xe2\x80\x9cspell out a comprehensive definition of \xe2\x80\x98testimonial,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but it noted that testimonial evidence includes, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cpolice interrogations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, Sylvia Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s statements during a station-house interrogation about a stabbing were testimonial, and their admission when her husband, the accused, had \xe2\x80\x9cno opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d for cross-examination due to spousal privilege made out a Sixth Amendment violation.  In <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon,</em> both domestic violence cases,<em> </em>the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the [interrogation\xe2\x80\x99s] primary purpose \xe2\x80\xa6 is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d but they \xe2\x80\x9care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the [interrogation\xe2\x80\x99s] primary purpose is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d 547 U. S.,<em> </em>at 822<em>.</em>  Thus, a recording of a 911 call describing an ongoing domestic disturbance was nontestimonial in <em>Davis, </em>where the victim\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve</em> [the ongoing] emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d and the statements were not formal.  <em>Id., </em>at 827.  But the statements in <em>Hammon </em>were testimonial, where the victim was interviewed after the event in a room separate from her husband and \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately recounted, in response to police questioning\xe2\x80\x9d the past events.  <em>Id.</em>, at 830.  Here,<em> </em>the context is a nondomestic dispute, with the \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d extending beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public.  This context requires additional clarification of what <em>Davis</em> meant<em> </em>by \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 822.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0To make the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d determination, the Court must objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter between the individual and the police occurs and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 statements and actions.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The primary purpose inquiry is objective.  The circumstances in which an encounter occurs\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, at or near a crime scene versus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards\xe2\x80\x94are clearly matters of objective fact.  And the relevant inquiry into the parties\xe2\x80\x99 statements and actions is not the subjective or actual purpose of the particular parties, but the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the parties\xe2\x80\x99 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.  P.\xc2\xa013.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The existence of an \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the encounter is among the most important circumstances informing the interrogation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g., Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 828\xe2\x80\x93830.  An emergency focuses the participants not on \xe2\x80\x9cprov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 822, but on \xe2\x80\x9cend[ing] a threatening situation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 832.  The Michigan Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry.  An assessment of whether an emergency threatening the police and public is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat to the first victim has been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public may continue.  The State Supreme Court also did not appreciate that an emergency\xe2\x80\x99s duration and scope may depend in part on the type of weapon involved; the court below relied on <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em>, where the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of an emergency involving a gun.  A victim\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the victim\xe2\x80\x99s ability to have any purpose at all in responding to police questions and on the likelihood that any such purpose would be a testimonial one.  It also provides important context for first responders to judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the victim, themselves, and the public.  This does not mean that an emergency lasts the entire time that a perpetrator is on the loose, but trial courts can determine in the first instance when an interrogation transitions from nontestimonial to testimonial.  Finally, whether an ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor informing the ultimate inquiry regarding an interrogation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Another is the encounter\xe2\x80\x99s <em>informality.</em>  Formality suggests the absence of an emergency, but informality does not necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent.  The facts here\xe2\x80\x94the questioning occurred in an exposed, public area, before emergency medical services arrived, and in a disorganized fashion\xe2\x80\x94distinguish this case from <em>Crawford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s formal station-house interrogation<em>.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The statements and actions of both the declarant and interrogators also provide objective evidence of the interrogation\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose. Looking to the contents of both the questions and the answers ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to one participant, since both interrogators and declarants may have mixed motives.  Police officers\xe2\x80\x99 dual responsibilities as both first responders and criminal investigators may lead them to act with different motives simultaneously or in quick succession.  And during an ongoing emergency, victims may want the threat to end, but may not envision prosecution.  Alternatively, a severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in answering questions.  Taking into account such injuries does not make the inquiry subjective.  The inquiry still focuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the actual victim\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, which prominently include the victim\xe2\x80\x99s physical state.  Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all participants is also consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior holdings.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Davis,</em> 547 U. S., at 822\xe2\x80\x93823, n.\xc2\xa01.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9323. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the statements and actions of Covington and the police objectively indicate that the interrogation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d 547 U. S., at 822.  The circumstances of the interrogation involved an armed shooter, whose motive for and location after the shooting were unknown and who had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few minutes of the location where police found Covington.  Unlike the emergencies in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em>, this dispute\xe2\x80\x99s potential scope and thus the emergency encompassed a potential threat to the police and the public.  And since this case involved a gun, the physical separation that was sufficient to end the emergency in <em>Hammon</em> was not necessarily sufficient to end the threat here.  Informed by the circumstances of the ongoing emergency, the Court now turns to determining the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of the interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d as evidenced by the statements and actions of Covington and the police.  The circumstances of the encounter provide important context for understanding Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police.  When he responded to their questions, he was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a mortal gunshot wound, and his answers were punctuated with questions about when emergency medical services would arrive.  Thus, this Court cannot say that a person in his situation would have had a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>For their part, the police responded to a call that a man had been shot.  They did not know why, where, or when the shooting had occurred; the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s location; or anything else about the crime.  They asked exactly the type of questions necessary to enable them \xe2\x80\x9cto meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Nothing in Covington\xe2\x80\x99s responses indicated to the police that there was no emergency or that the emergency had ended.  Finally, this situation is more similar to the informal, harried 911 call in <em>Davis</em> than to the structured, station-house interview in <em>Crawford</em>.  The officers all arrived at different times; asked, upon arrival, what had happened; and generally did not conduct a structured interrogation.  The informality suggests that their primary purpose was to address what they considered to be an ongoing emergency, and the circumstances lacked a formality that would have alerted Covington to or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause, as explained in our decisions in <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html">541 U.

We granted the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider whether the Confrontation Clause barred the admission at trial of Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police.  We hold that the circumstances of the interaction between Covington and the police objectively indicate that the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of the interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U.

Therefore, Covington\xe2\x80\x99s identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial statements, and their admission at Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan and remand.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left"><font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Around 3:25 a.m. on April 29, 2001, Detroit, Michigan police officers responded to a radio dispatch indicating that a man had been shot.  At the scene, they found the victim, Anthony Covington, lying on the ground next to his car in a gas station parking lot.  Covington had a gunshot wound to his abdomen, appeared to be in great pain, and spoke with difficulty. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The police asked him \xe2\x80\x9cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71.  Covington stated that \xe2\x80\x9cRick\xe2\x80\x9d shot him at around 3 a.m.  <em>Id.</em>, at 136, and n.\xc2\xa01, 768 N. W. 2d, at 67, and n.\xc2\xa01.  He also indicated that he had a conversation with Bryant, whom he recognized based on his voice, through the back door of Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s house.  Covington explained that when he turned to leave, he was shot through the door and then drove to the gas station, where police found him. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Covington\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with the police ended within 5 to 10 minutes when emergency medical services arrived.  Covington was transported to a hospital and died within hours.  The police left the gas station after speaking with Covington, called for backup, and traveled to Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s house.  They did not find Bryant there but did find blood and a bullet on the back porch and an apparent bullet hole in the back door.  Police also found Covington\xe2\x80\x99s wallet and identification outside the house. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At trial, which occurred prior to our decisions in <em>Crawford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html">541 U.

The jury returned a guilty verdict on charges of second-degree\nmurder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bryant appealed, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.  No. 247039, 2004 WL 1882661 (Aug. 24, 2004) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Bryant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police.  The Supreme Court of Michigan eventually remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of our 2006 decision in <em>Davis</em>.  477 Mich. 902, 722 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 797 (2006).  On remand, the Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements were properly admitted because they were not testimonial.  No. 247039, 2007 WL 675471 (Mar. 6, 2007) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Bryant again appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, which reversed his conviction.  483 Mich. 132, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 65.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the Supreme Court of Michigan, Bryant argued that Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police were testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis</em> and were therefore inadmissible.  The State, on the other hand, argued that the statements were admissible as \xe2\x80\x9cexcited utterances\xe2\x80\x9d under the Michigan Rules of Evidence.  483 Mich., at 142, and n.\xc2\xa06, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 70, and n. 6.  There was no dispute that Covington was unavailable at trial and Bryant had no prior opportunity to cross-examine him.  The court therefore assessed whether Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police identifying and describing the shooter and the time and location of the shooting were testimonial hearsay for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.  The court concluded that the circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cclearly indicate that the \xe2\x80\x98primary purpose\xe2\x80\x99 of the questioning was to establish the facts of an event that had <em>already </em>occurred; the \xe2\x80\x98primary purpose\xe2\x80\x99 was not to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 143, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71.  The court explained that, in its view, Covington was describing past events and as such, his \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose in making these statements to the police . . . was . . . to tell the police who had committed the crime against him, where the crime had been committed, and where the police could find the criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 144, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71.  Noting that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 actions did not suggest that they perceived an ongoing emergency at the gas station, the court held that there was in fact no ongoing emergency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 145\xe2\x80\x93147, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71\xe2\x80\x9373.  The court distinguished the facts of this case from those in <em>Davis</em>, where we held a declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statements in a 911 call to be nontestimonial.  It instead analogized this case to <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Indiana</em>, which we decided jointly with <em>Davis </em>and in which we found testimonial a declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statements to police just after an assault.  See 547 U. S., at 829\xe2\x80\x93832.  Based on this analysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the admission of Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements constituted prejudicial plain error warranting reversal and ordered a new trial.  483 Mich., at 151\xe2\x80\x93153, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  The court did not address whether, absent a Confrontation Clause bar, the statements\xe2\x80\x99 admission would have been otherwise consistent with Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s hearsay rules or due process.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion provoked two dissents, both of which would have held Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements admissible because they were made in circumstances indicating that their \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d was to assist police in addressing an ongoing emergency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 157, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 79 (opinion of Weaver, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 157\xe2\x80\x93158, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 79 (opinion of Corrigan, J.).

Sylvia witnessed the stabbing, and later that night, after she and her husband were both arrested, police interrogated her about the incident.  At trial, Sylvia Crawford claimed spousal privilege and did not testify, but the State introduced a tape recording of Sylvia\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the police in an effort to prove that the stabbing was not in self-defense, as Michael Crawford claimed.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s conviction because it found Sylvia\xe2\x80\x99s statement to be reliable, as required under <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts.</em>  We reversed, overruling <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts</em>.  541 U.

We noted that in England, pretrial examinations of suspects and witnesses by government officials \xe2\x80\x9cwere sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43.  In light of this history, we emphasized the word \xe2\x80\x9cwitnesses\xe2\x80\x9d in the Sixth Amendment, defining it as \xe2\x80\x9cthose who \xe2\x80\x98bear testimony.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 51 (quoting 2 N.

The product of such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is testimonial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U.

In <em>Davis</em>, Michelle McCottry made the statements at issue to a 911 operator during a domestic disturbance with Adrian Davis, her former boyfriend.  McCottry told the operator, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s here jumpin\xe2\x80\x99 on me again,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s usin\xe2\x80\x99 his fists.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.

The operator then asked McCottry for Davis\xe2\x80\x99 first and last names and middle initial, and at that point in the conversation McCottry reported that Davis had fled in a car.  <em>Id.</em>, at 818. McCottry did not appear at Davis\xe2\x80\x99 trial, and the State introduced the recording of her conversation with the 911 operator.  <em>Id.</em>, at 819. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Hammon</em>, decided along with <em>Davis</em>, police responded to a domestic disturbance call at the home of Amy and Hershel Hammon, where they found Amy alone on the front porch.  <em>Ibid.</em>  She appeared \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98somewhat frightened,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but told them \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98nothing was the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>State</em>, 829 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 444, 446\xe2\x80\x93447 (Ind. 2005)).  She gave the police permission to enter the house, where they saw a gas heating unit with the glass front shattered on the floor.  One officer remained in the kitchen with Hershel, while another officer talked to Amy in the living room about what had happened.  Hershel tried several times to participate in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with the police and became angry when the police required him to stay separated from Amy.  547 U. S., at 819\xe2\x80\x93820.  The police asked Amy to fill out and sign a battery affidavit.  She wrote: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Broke our Furnace &amp; shoved me down on the floor into the broken glass.  Hit me in the chest and threw me down.  Broke our lamps &amp; phone.

Amy did not appear at Hershel\xe2\x80\x99s trial, so the police officers who spoke with her testified as to her statements and authenticated the affidavit.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The trial court admitted the affidavit as a present sense impression and admitted the oral statements as excited utterances under state hearsay rules.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed Hammon\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, holding that Amy\xe2\x80\x99s oral statements were not testimonial and that the admission of the affidavit, although erroneous because the affidavit was testimonial, was harmless.  <em>Hammon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 829 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To address the facts of both cases, we expanded upon the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d that we first employed in <em>Crawford</em> and discussed the concept of an ongoing emergency.  We explained: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S.,<em> </em>at 822<em>.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\nExamining the <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em> statements in light of those definitions, we held that the statements at issue\nin <em>Davis </em>were nontestimonial and the statements in <em>Hammon </em>were testimonial.  We distinguished the statements in <em>Davis</em> from the testimonial statements in <em>Crawford</em> on several grounds, including that the victim in <em>Davis</em> was \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking about events <em>as they were actually happening</em>, rather than \xe2\x80\x98describ[ing] past events,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that there was an ongoing emergency, that the \xe2\x80\x9celicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve</em> the present emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the statements were not formal.  547 U. S., at 827.  In <em>Hammon</em>, on the other hand, we held that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 829.  There was \xe2\x80\x9cno emergency in progress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> The officer questioning Amy \xe2\x80\x9cwas not seeking to determine . . . \xe2\x80\x98what is happening,\xe2\x80\x99 but rather \xe2\x80\x98what happened.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 830.  It was \xe2\x80\x9cformal enough\xe2\x80\x9d that the police interrogated Amy in a room separate from her husband where, \xe2\x80\x9csome time after the events described were over,\xe2\x80\x9d she \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Because her statements \xe2\x80\x9cwere neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 832, we held that they were testimonial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Davis</em> did not \xe2\x80\x9cattemp[t] to produce an exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements\xe2\x80\x94or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation\xe2\x80\x94as either testimonial or nontestimonial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 822.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The basic purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to \xe2\x80\x9ctarge[t]\xe2\x80\x9d the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cabuses\xe2\x80\x9d exemplified at the notorious treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh.  <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U. S., at 51.  Thus, the most important instances in which the Clause restricts the introduction of out-of-court statements are those in which state actors are involved in a formal, out-of-court interrogation of a witness to obtain evidence for trial.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>id.</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  Even where such an interrogation is conducted with all good faith, introduction of the resulting statements at trial can be unfair to the accused if they are untested by cross-examination.  Whether formal or informal, out-of-court statements can evade the basic objective of the Confrontation Clause, which is to prevent the accused from being deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant about statements taken for use at trial.  When, as in <em>Davis</em>, the primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the Clause.  But there may be <em>other</em> circumstances, aside from ongoing emergencies, when a statement is not procured with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.  In making the primary purpose determination, standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some statements as reliable, will be relevant.  Where no such primary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deciding this case also requires further explanation of the \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d circumstance addressed in <em>Davis</em>.  Because <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em> arose in the domestic violence context, that was the situation \xe2\x80\x9cwe had immediately in mind (for that was the case before us).\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U. S., at 826.  We now face a new context: a nondomestic dispute, involving a victim found in a public location, suffering from a fatal gunshot wound, and a perpetrator whose location was unknown at the time the police located the victim.  Thus, we confront for the first time circumstances in which the \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d discussed in <em>Davis</em> extends beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public at large.  This new context requires us to provide additional clarification with regard to what <em>Davis</em> meant<em> </em>by \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 822. </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To determine whether the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of an interrogation is \xe2\x80\x9cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis</em>, 547 U.

The statements and actions of the parties must also be objectively evaluated.  That is, the relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals\xe2\x80\x99 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As our recent Confrontation Clause cases have explained, the existence of an \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of an encounter between an individual and the police is among the most important circumstances informing the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of an interrogation.  See <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 828\xe2\x80\x93830; <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U. S., at 65.  The existence of an ongoing emergency is relevant to determining the primary purpose of the interrogation because an emergency focuses the participants on something other than \xe2\x80\x9cprov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U.

Implicit in <em>Davis </em>is the idea that because the prospect of fabrication in statements given for the primary purpose of resolving that emergency is presumably significantly diminished, the Confrontation Clause does not require such statements to be subject to the crucible of cross-examination.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This logic is not unlike that justifying the excited utterance exception in hearsay law.

Rule Evid. 803(2); see also Mich. Rule Evid. 803(2) (2010), are considered reliable because the declarant, in the excitement, presumably cannot form a falsehood.  See <em>Idaho</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/805/index.html">497 U.

An ongoing emergency has a similar effect of focusing an individual\xe2\x80\x99s attention on responding to the emergency.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following our precedents, the court below correctly began its analysis with the circumstances in which Covington interacted with the police.  483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71.  But in doing so, the court construed <em>Davis </em>to have decided more than it did and thus employed an unduly narrow understanding of \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Davis </em>does not require. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Michigan Supreme Court repeatedly and incorrectly asserted that <em>Davis</em> \xe2\x80\x9cdefined\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 73; see also <em>id.</em>, at 144, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71\xe2\x80\x9372.  In fact, <em>Davis </em>did not even define the extent of the emergency in that case.  The Michigan Supreme Court erroneously read <em>Davis</em> as deciding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statements made after the defendant stopped assaulting the victim and left the premises did <em>not </em>occur during an \xe2\x80\x98ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  483 Mich., at 150, n.\xc2\xa015, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n.\xc2\xa015.  We explicitly explained in <em>Davis</em>, however, that we were asked to review only the testimonial nature of Michelle McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s initial statements during the 911 call; we therefore merely <em>assumed</em> the correctness of the Washington Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that admission of her other statements was harmless, without deciding whether those subsequent statements were also made for the primary purpose of resolving an ongoing emergency.  547 U. S., at 829. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, by assuming that <em>Davis</em> defined the outer bounds of \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d the Michigan Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20. <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em> involved domestic violence, a known and identified perpetrator, and, in <em>Hammon</em>, a neutralized threat.  Because <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>were domestic violence cases, we focused only on the threat to the victims and assessed the ongoing emergency from the perspective of whether there was a continuing threat <em>to them</em>.  547    U. S., at 827, 829\xe2\x80\x93830.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Domestic violence cases like <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em> often have a narrower zone of potential victims than cases involving threats to public safety.  An assessment of whether an emergency that threatens the police and public is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat solely to the first victim has been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public may continue.  See 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 82 (Corrigan, J., dissenting) (examining the threat to the victim, police, and the public); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn emergency posed by an unknown shooter who remains at large does not automatically abate just because the police can provide security to his first victim\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court also did not appreciate that the duration and scope of an emergency may depend in part on the type of weapon employed.  The court relied on <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em>, in which the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of the emergency here, which involved the use of a gun.  The problem with that reasoning is clear when considered in light of the assault on Amy Hammon.  Hershel Hammon was armed only with his fists when he attacked his wife, so removing Amy to a separate room was sufficient to end the emergency.  547 U. S., at 830\xe2\x80\x93832.  If Hershel had been reported to be armed with a gun, however, separation by a single household wall might not have been sufficient to end the emergency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 819. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to focus on the context-dependent nature of our <em>Davis </em>decision also led it to conclude that the medical condition of a declarant is irrelevant.  483 Mich., at 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court said nothing at all that would remotely suggest that whether the victim was in need of medical attention was in any way relevant to whether there was an \xe2\x80\x98ongoing emergency\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon</em> did not present medical emergencies, despite some injuries to the victims.  547 U. S., at 818, 820.  Thus, we have not previously considered, much less ruled out, the relevance of a victim\xe2\x80\x99s severe injuries to the primary purpose inquiry.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking into account the victim\xe2\x80\x99s medical state does not, as the Michigan Supreme Court below thought, \xe2\x80\x9crende[r] non-testimonial\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9call statements made while the police are questioning a seriously injured complainant.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 Mich., at 149, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 74.  The medical condition of the victim is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the ability of the victim to have any purpose at all in responding to police questions and on the likelihood that any purpose formed would necessarily be a testimonial one.  The victim\xe2\x80\x99s medical state also provides important context for first responders to judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the victim, themselves, and the public. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s brief observes, Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20, and contrary to the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s claims, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 73, none of this suggests that an emergency is ongoing in every place or even just surrounding the victim for the entire time that the perpetrator of a violent crime is on the loose.  As we recognized in <em>Davis</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ca conversation which begins as an interrogation to determine the need for emergency assistance\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9cevolve into testimonial statements.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This evolution may occur if, for example, a declarant provides police with information that makes clear that what appeared to be an emergency is not or is no longer an emergency or that what appeared to be a public threat is actually a private dispute.  It could also occur if a perpetrator is disarmed, surrenders, is apprehended, or, as in <em>Davis</em>, flees with little prospect of posing a threat to the public.  Trial courts can determine in the first instance when any transition from nontestimonial to testimonial occurs,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and exclude \xe2\x80\x9cthe portions of any statement that have become testimonial, as they do, for example, with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 829.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, our discussion of the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s misunderstanding of what <em>Davis </em>meant by \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d should not be taken to imply that the existence <em>vel non</em> of an ongoing emergency is dispositive of the testimonial inquiry.  As <em>Davis </em>made clear, whether an ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor\xe2\x80\x94albeit an important factor\xe2\x80\x94that informs the ultimate inquiry regarding the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of an interrogation.  Another factor the Michigan Supreme Court did not sufficiently account for is the importance of <em>informality</em> in an encounter between a victim and police.  Formality is not the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry because, although formality suggests the absence of an emergency and therefore an increased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation is to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 822, informality does not necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 826 (explaining that Confrontation Clause requirements cannot \xe2\x80\x9creadily be evaded\xe2\x80\x9d by the parties deliberately keeping the written product of an interrogation informal \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of having the declarant sign a deposition\xe2\x80\x9d). The court below, however, too readily dismissed the informality of the circumstances in this case in a single brief footnote and in fact seems to have suggested that the encounter in this case was formal.  483 Mich., at 150, n.\xc2\xa016, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 75, n.\xc2\xa016.  As we explain further below, the questioning in this case occurred in an exposed, public area, prior to the arrival of emergency medical services, and in a disorganized fashion.  All of those facts make this case distinguishable from\nthe formal station-house interrogation in <em>Crawford.</em>  See<em> Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 827. </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the circumstances in which an encounter occurs, the statements and actions of both the declarant and interrogators provide objective evidence of the primary purpose of the interrogation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em>, 547  U. S., at 827 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he nature of what was <em>asked and answered</em> in <em>Davis</em>,<em> </em>again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford</em>) what had happened in the past\xe2\x80\x9d (first emphasis added)).  The Michigan Supreme Court did, at least briefly, conduct this inquiry.  483 Mich., at 144\xe2\x80\x93147, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71\xe2\x80\x9373.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly recognized, <em>id.</em>, at 140, n.\xc2\xa05, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 69, n.\xc2\xa05, <em>Davis </em>requires a combined inquiry that accounts for both the declarant and the interrogator.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  In many instances, the primary purpose of the interrogation will be most accurately ascertained by looking to the contents of both the questions and the answers.  To give an extreme example, if the police say to a victim, \xe2\x80\x9cTell us who did this to you so that we can arrest and prosecute them,\xe2\x80\x9d the victim\xe2\x80\x99s response that \xe2\x80\x9cRick did it,\xe2\x80\x9d appears purely accusatory because by virtue of the phrasing of the question, the victim necessarily has prosecution in mind when she answers.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The combined approach also ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to one participant.  Predominant among these is the problem of mixed motives\non the part of both interrogators and declarants.  Police officers in our society function as both first responders and criminal investigators.  Their dual responsibilities may mean that they act with different motives simultaneously or in quick succession.  See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a>, 656 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly most police officers [deciding whether to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a possible emergency situation] would act out of a host of different, instinctive, and largely unverifiable motives\xe2\x80\x94their own safety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire to obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 839 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn many, if not most, cases where police respond to a report of a crime, whether pursuant to a 911 call from the victim or otherwise, the purposes of an interrogation, viewed from the perspective of the police, are <em>both </em>to respond to the emergency situation <em>and </em>to gather evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Victims are also likely to have mixed motives when they make statements to the police.  During an ongoing emergency, a victim is most likely to want the threat to her and to other potential victims to end, but that does not necessarily mean that the victim wants or envisions prosecution of the assailant.  A victim may want the attacker to be incapacitated temporarily or rehabilitated.  Alternatively, a severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in answering questions posed; the answers may be simply reflexive.  The victim\xe2\x80\x99s injuries could be so debilitating\nas to prevent her from thinking sufficiently clearly to understand whether her statements are for the purpose of addressing an ongoing emergency or for the purpose of future prosecution.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Taking into account a victim\xe2\x80\x99s injuries does not transform this objective inquiry into a subjective one.  The inquiry is still objective because it focuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the circumstances of the actual victim\xe2\x80\x94circumstances that prominently include the victim\xe2\x80\x99s physical state.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent suggests, <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Scalia, J.), that we intend to give controlling weight to the \xe2\x80\x9cintentions of the police,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4.  That is a misreading of our opinion.  At trial, the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statements, not the interrogator\xe2\x80\x99s questions, will be introduced to \xe2\x80\x9cestablis[h] the truth of the matter asserted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U. S., at 60, n.\xc2\xa09, and must therefore pass the Sixth Amendment test.  See n.\xc2\xa011, <em>supra</em>.  In determining whether a declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statements are testimonial, courts should look to all of the relevant circumstances. Even Justice Scalia concedes that the interrogator is relevant to this evaluation, <em>post</em>,\nat 3, and we agree that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he identity of an interrogator, and the content and tenor of his questions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, can illuminate the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of the interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d   The dissent, see <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x935 (opinion of Scalia, J.), criticizes the complexity of our approach, but we, at least, are unwilling to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity.  Simpler is not always better, and courts making a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d assessment should not be unjustifiably restrained from consulting all relevant information, including the statements and actions of interrogators.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all participants is also the approach most consistent with our past holdings.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 822\xe2\x80\x93823, n.\xc2\xa01 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteered testimony\xe2\x80\x9d is still testimony and remains subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause). </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we suggested in <em>Davis</em>, when a court must determine whether the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a statement at trial, it should determine the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of the interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d by objectively evaluating the statements and actions of the parties to the encounter, in light of the circumstances in which the interrogation occurs.  The existence of an emergency or the parties\xe2\x80\x99 perception that an emergency is ongoing is among the most important circumstances that courts must take into account in determining whether an interrogation is testimonial because statements made to assist police in addressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the testimonial purpose that would subject them to the\nrequirement of confrontation.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  As the context of this case brings into sharp relief, the existence and duration of an emergency depend on the type and scope of danger posed to the victim, the police, and the public.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this analysis to the facts of this case is more difficult than in <em>Davis</em> because we do not have the luxury of reviewing a transcript of the conversation between the victim and the police officers.  Further complicating our task is the fact that the trial in this case occurred before our decisions in <em>Crawford</em> and <em>Davis</em>.  We therefore review a record that was not developed to ascertain the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of the interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first examine the circumstances in which the interrogation occurred.  The parties disagree over whether there was an emergency when the police arrived at the gas station.  Bryant argues, and the Michigan Supreme Court accepted, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 73, that there was no ongoing emergency because \xe2\x80\x9cthere . . . was no criminal conduct occurring.  No shots were being fired, no one was seen in possession of a firearm, nor were any witnesses seen cowering in fear or running from the scene.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 27.  Bryant, while conceding that \xe2\x80\x9ca serious or life-threatening injury creates a medical emergency for a victim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 30, further argues that a declarant\xe2\x80\x99s medical emergency is not relevant to the ongoing emergency determination. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, Michigan and the Solicitor General explain that when the police responded to the call that a man had been shot and found Covington bleeding on the gas station parking lot, \xe2\x80\x9cthey did not know who Covington was, whether the shooting had occurred at the gas station or at a different location, who the assailant was, or whether the assailant posed a continuing threat to Covington or others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15; Brief for Petitioner 16; see also <em>id.</em>, at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen an officer arrives on the scene and does not know where the perpetrator is, whether he is armed, whether he might have other targets, and whether the violence might continue\nat the scene or elsewhere, interrogation that has the primary purpose of establishing those facts to assess the situation is designed to meet the ongoing emergency and is nontestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court stated that the police asked Covington, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71.  The joint appendix contains the transcripts of the preliminary examination, suppression hearing, and trial testimony of five officers who responded to the scene and found Covington.  The officers\xe2\x80\x99 testimony is essentially consistent but, at the same time, not specific.  The officers basically agree on what information they learned from Covington, but not on the order in which they learned it or on whether Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements were in response to general or detailed questions.  They all agree that the first question was \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happened?\xe2\x80\x9d  The answer was either \xe2\x80\x9cI was shot\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cRick shot me.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained above, the scope of an emergency in terms of its threat to individuals other than the initial assailant and victim will often depend on the type of dispute involved.  Nothing Covington said to the police indicated that the cause of the shooting was a purely private dispute or that the threat from the shooter had ended.  The record reveals little about the motive for the shooting.  The police officers who spoke with Covington at the gas station testified that Covington did not tell them what words Covington and Rick had exchanged prior to the shooting.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  What Covington did tell the officers was that he fled Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s back porch, indicating that he perceived an ongoing threat.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The police did not know, and Covington did not tell them, whether the threat was limited to him.  The potential scope of the dispute and therefore the emergency in this case thus stretches more broadly than those at issue in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>and encompasses a threat potentially to the police and the public.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is also the first of our post-<em>Crawford</em> Confrontation Clause cases to involve a gun.  The physical separation that was sufficient to end the emergency in <em>Hammon</em> was not necessarily sufficient to end the threat in this case; Covington was shot through the back door of Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s house.  Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that there was no ongoing emergency because \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o shots were being fired,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 27, surely construes ongoing emergency too narrowly.  An emergency does not last only for the time between when the assailant pulls the trigger and the bullet hits the victim.  If an out-of-sight sniper pauses between shots, no one would say that the emergency ceases during the pause.  That is an extreme example and not the situation here, but it serves to highlight the implausibility, at least as to certain weapons, of construing the emergency to last only precisely as long as the violent act itself, as some have construed our opinion in <em>Davis</em>.  See Brief for Respondent 23\xe2\x80\x9325. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At no point during the questioning did either Covington or the police know the location of the shooter.  In fact, Bryant was not at home by the time the police searched his house at approximately 5:30 a.m.  483 Mich., at 136, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 67.  At some point between 3 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., Bryant left his house.  At bottom, there was an ongoing emergency here where an armed shooter, whose motive for and location after the shooting were unknown, had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks\nand a few minutes of the location where the police found Covington.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to suggest that the emergency continued until Bryant was arrested in California a year after the shooting.  <em>Id.</em>, at 137, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 67.  We need not decide precisely when the emergency ended because Covington\xe2\x80\x99s encounter with the police and all of the statements he made during that interaction occurred within the first few minutes of the police officers\xe2\x80\x99 arrival and\nwell before they secured the scene of the shooting\xe2\x80\x94the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s last known location.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reiterate, moreover, that the existence <em>vel non</em> of an ongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial inquiry; rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of the interrogation [was] to enable police assistance to meet [the] ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 822.  We turn now to that inquiry, as informed by the circumstances of the ongoing emergency just described. The circumstances of the encounter provide important context for understanding Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police.  When the police arrived at Covington\xe2\x80\x99s side, their first question to him was \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened?\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Covington\xe2\x80\x99s response was either \xe2\x80\x9cRick shot me\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI was shot,\xe2\x80\x9d followed very quickly by an identification of \xe2\x80\x9cRick\xe2\x80\x9d as the shooter.  App. 76.  In response to further questions, Covington explained that the shooting occurred through the back door of Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s house and provided a physical description of the shooter.  When he made the statements, Covington was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a mortal gunshot wound to his abdomen.  His answers to the police officers\xe2\x80\x99 questions were punctuated with questions about when emergency medical services would arrive.  <em>Id.</em>, at 56\xe2\x80\x9357 (suppression hearing testimony of Officer Brown).  He was obviously in considerable pain and had difficulty breathing and talking.  <em>Id.</em>, at 75, 83\xe2\x80\x9384 (testimony of Officer McCallister); <em>id.</em>, at 101, 110\xe2\x80\x93111 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine); <em>id.</em>, at 126, 137 (testimony of Officer Stuglin).  From this description of his condition and report of his statements, we cannot say that a person in Covington\xe2\x80\x99s situation would have had a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 822.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For their part, the police responded to a call that a man had been shot.  As discussed above, they did not know why, where, or when the shooting had occurred.  Nor did they know the location of the shooter or anything else about the circumstances in which the crime occurred.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The questions they asked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d 483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 71\xe2\x80\x94were the exact type of questions necessary to allow the police to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to the public, <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 832 (quoting <em>Hiibel</em> v. <em>Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/177/index.html">542 U. S. 177</a>, 186 (2004)), including to allow them to ascertain \xe2\x80\x9cwhether they would be encountering a violent felon,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 827.  In other words, they solicited the information necessary to enable them \xe2\x80\x9cto meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 822. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in Covington\xe2\x80\x99s responses indicated to the police that, contrary to their expectation upon responding to a call reporting a shooting, there was no emergency or that a prior emergency had ended.  Covington did indicate that he had been shot at another location about 25 minutes earlier, but he did not know the location of the shooter at the time the police arrived and, as far as we can tell from the record, he gave no indication that the shooter, having shot at him twice, would be satisfied that Covington was only wounded.  In fact, Covington did not indicate any possible motive for the shooting, and thereby gave no reason to think that the shooter would not shoot again if he arrived on the scene.  As we noted in <em>Davis</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cinitial inquiries\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9c<em>often</em> . . . produce nontestimonial statements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 832.  The initial inquiries in this case resulted in the type of nontestimonial statements we contemplated in <em>Davis</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we consider the informality of the situation and the interrogation.  This situation is more similar, though not identical, to the informal, harried 911 call in <em>Davis</em> than to the structured, station-house interview in <em>Crawford</em>.

The majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysiswhich relies on, <em>inter alia</em>, what the police knew when they arrived at the scene, the specific questions they asked, the particular information Covington conveyed, the weapon involved, and Covington\xe2\x80\x99s medical conditionillustrates the uncertainty that this test creates for law enforcement and the lower courts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9331.  I have criticized the\nprimary-purpose test as \xe2\x80\x9can exercise in fiction\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cdisconnected from history\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyields no predictable results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> id.</em>, at 835\xe2\x80\x93836 (describing \xe2\x80\x9cpractices that occurred under the English bail and committal statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the majority notes, Covington interacted with the police under highly informal circumstances, while he bled from a fatal gunshot wound.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 31.  The police questioning was not \xe2\x80\x9ca formalized dialogue,\xe2\x80\x9d did not result in \xe2\x80\x9cformalized testimonial ma-terials\xe2\x80\x9d such as a deposition or affidavit, and bore no \xe2\x80\x9cin- dicia of solemnity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 840, 837 (opinion of Thomas, J.); see also <em>Giles</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/353/index.html">554 U.

Nor is there any indication that the statements were offered at trial \xe2\x80\x9cin order to evade confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 840.  This interrogation bears little if any resemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.  Covington thus did not \xe2\x80\x9cbea[r] testimony\xe2\x80\x9d against Bryant,<em> Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 51, and the introduction of his statements at trial did not implicate the Confrontation Clause.

But reaching a patently incorrect conclusion on the facts is a relatively benign judicial mischief; it affects, after all, only the case at hand.  In its vain attempt to make the incredible plausible, however\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps as an intended second goal\xe2\x80\x94today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion distorts our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a shambles.  Instead of clarifying the law, the Court makes itself the obfuscator of last resort.  Because I continue to adhere to the Confrontation Clause that the People adopted, as described in <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U.

S. 400</a>, 403 (1965), provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right \xe2\x80\xa6 to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Crawford</em>, we held that this provision guarantees a defendant his common-law right to confront those \xe2\x80\x9cwho \xe2\x80\x98bear testimony\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d against him.  541 U. S., at 51.  A witness must deliver his testimony against the defendant in person, or the prosecution must prove that the witness is unavailable to appear at trial and that the defendant\nhas had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  <em>Id.,</em> at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not all hearsay falls within the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s grasp.  At trial a witness \xe2\x80\x9cbears testimony\xe2\x80\x9d by providing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] solemn declaration or affirmation . . . for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)).  The Confrontation Clause protects defendants only from hearsay statements that do the same.  <em>Davis </em>v.<em> Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html"></a><a href="/us/547/813/index.html">547 U. S. 813</a>, 823\xe2\x80\x93824 (2006).  In <em>Davis</em>, we explained how to identify testimonial hearsay prompted by police questioning in the field.  A statement is testimonial \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the circumstances objectively indicate \xe2\x80\xa6 that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 822<em>.</em>  When, however, the circumstances objectively indicate that the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statements were \xe2\x80\x9ca cry for help [o]r the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 832, they bear little resemblance to in-court testimony.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x98witness\xe2\x80\x99 goes into court to proclaim an emergency and seek help.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 828.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Crawford</em> and <em>Davis</em> did not address whose perspective matters\xe2\x80\x94the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s, the interrogator\xe2\x80\x99s, or both\xe2\x80\x94when assessing \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose of [an] interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In those cases the statements were testimonial from any perspective.  I think the same is true here, but because the Court picks a perspective so will I: The declarant\xe2\x80\x99s intent is what counts.  In-court testimony is more than a narrative of past events; it is a solemn declaration made in the course of a criminal trial.  For an out-of-court statement to qualify as testimonial, the declarant must intend the statement to be a solemn declaration rather than an unconsidered or offhand remark; and he must make the statement with the understanding that it may be used to invoke the coercive machinery of the State against the accused.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See Friedman, Grappling with the Meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cTestimonial,\xe2\x80\x9d 71 Brooklyn L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 241, 259 (2005).  That is what distinguishes a narrative told to a friend over dinner from a statement to the police.  See <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 51.  The hidden purpose of an interrogator cannot substitute for the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s intentional solemnity or his understanding of how his words may be used.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A declarant-focused inquiry is also the only inquiry that would work in every fact pattern implicating the Confrontation Clause.  The Clause applies to volunteered testimony as well as statements solicited through police interrogation.  See <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 822\xe2\x80\x93823, n.\xc2\xa01.  An inquiry into an officer\xe2\x80\x99s purposes would make no sense when a declarant blurts out \xe2\x80\x9cRick shot me\xe2\x80\x9d as soon as the officer arrives on the scene.  I see no reason to adopt a different test\xe2\x80\x94one that accounts for an officer\xe2\x80\x99s intent\xe2\x80\x94when the officer asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happened\xe2\x80\x9d before the declarant makes his accusation.  (This does not mean the interrogator is irrelevant.  The identity of an interrogator, and the content and tenor of his questions, can bear upon whether a declarant intends to make a solemn statement, and envisions its use at a criminal trial.  But none of this means that the interrogator\xe2\x80\x99s purpose matters.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an unsuccessful attempt to make its finding of emergency plausible, the Court instead adopts a test that looks to the purposes of both the police and the declarant.  It claims that this is demanded by necessity, fretting that a domestic-violence victim may want her abuser briefly arrested\xe2\x80\x94presumably to teach him a lesson\xe2\x80\x94but not desire prosecution.  See <em>ante,</em> at 22.  I do not need to probe the purposes of the police to solve that problem.  Even if a victim speaks to the police \xe2\x80\x9cto establish or prove past events\xe2\x80\x9d solely for the purpose of getting her abuser arrested, she surely knows her account is \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially rel-evant to later criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d should one ensue.  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 822.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also wrings its hands over the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9ca severely injured victim\xe2\x80\x9d may lack the capacity to form a purpose, and instead answer questions \xe2\x80\x9creflexive[ly].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  How to assess whether a declarant with diminished capacity bore testimony is a difficult question, and one I do not need to answer today.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s proposed answer\xe2\x80\x94to substitute the intentions of the police for the missing intentions of the declarant\xe2\x80\x94cannot be the correct one. When the declarant has diminished capacity, focusing on the interrogators make less sense, not more.  The inquiry under <em>Crawford</em> turns in part on the actions and statements of a declarant\xe2\x80\x99s audience only because they shape the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s perception of why his audience is listening and therefore influence <em>his purpose</em> in making the declaration.  See 541 U. S., at 51.  But a person who cannot perceive his own purposes certainly cannot perceive why a listener might be interested in what he has to say.  As far as I can tell, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s substituted-intent theory \xe2\x80\x9chas nothing to be said for it except that it can sometimes make our job easier,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jerman</em> v. <em>Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich, L.\xc2\xa0P.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court claims one affirmative virtue for its focus on the purposes of both the declarant and the police: It \xe2\x80\x9cameliorates problems that \xe2\x80\xa6 arise\xe2\x80\x9d when declarants have \xe2\x80\x9cmixed motives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  I am at a loss to know how.  Sorting out the primary purpose of a declarant with mixed motives is sometimes difficult. But adding in the mixed motives of the police only compounds the problem.  Now courts will have to sort through two sets of mixed motives to determine the primary purpose of an interrogation.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s solution creates a mixed-motive problem where (under the proper theory) it does not exist\xe2\x80\x94viz., where the police and the declarant each have one motive, but those motives conflict. The Court does not provide an answer to this glaringly obvious problem, probably because it does not have one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only virtue of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach (if it can be misnamned a virtue) is that it leaves judges free to reach the \xe2\x80\x9cfairest\xe2\x80\x9d result under the totality of the circumstances.  If the dastardly police trick a declarant into giving an incriminating statement against a sympathetic defendant, a court can focus on the police\xe2\x80\x99s intent and declare the statement testimonial.  If the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cdeserves\xe2\x80\x9d to go to jail, then a court can focus on whatever perspective is necessary to declare damning hearsay nontestimonial. And when all else fails, a court can mix-and-match perspectives to reach its desired outcome.  Unfortunately, under this malleable approach \xe2\x80\x9cthe guarantee of confrontation is no guarantee at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Giles</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/353/index.html">554 U. S. 353</a>, 375 (2008) (plurality).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking to the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose (as we should), this is an absurdly easy case.  Roughly 25 minutes after Anthony Covington had been shot, Detroit police responded to a 911 call reporting that a gunshot victim had appeared at a neighborhood gas station.  They quickly arrived at the scene, and in less than 10 minutes five different Detroit police officers questioned Covington about the shooting.  Each asked him a similar battery of questions: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happened\xe2\x80\x9d and when, App. 39, 126, \xe2\x80\x9cwho shot\xe2\x80\x9d the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 22, and \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x9d did the shooting take place, <em>id.,</em> at 132. See also <em>id.,</em> at 113.  After Covington would answer, they would ask follow-up questions, such as \xe2\x80\x9chow tall is\xe2\x80\x9d the shooter, <em>id.,</em> at 134, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ow much does he weigh,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> what is the exact address or physical description of the house where the shooting took place, and what chain \nof events led to the shooting.  The battery relented when the paramedics arrived and began tending to Covington\xe2\x80\x99s wounds.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From Covington\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, his statements had little value except to ensure the arrest and eventual prosecution of Richard Bryant.  He knew the \xe2\x80\x9cthreatening situation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis,</em> 547 U. S., at 832, had ended six blocks away and 25 minutes earlier when he fled from Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s back porch.  See 483 Mich. 132, 135\xe2\x80\x93136, 768 N.W. 2d 65, 67 (2009); App. 105.  Bryant had not confronted him face-to-face before he was mortally wounded, instead shooting him through a door.  See 483 Mich.<em>,</em> at 136\xe2\x80\x93137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.  Even if Bryant had pursued him (unlikely), and after seeing that Covington had ended up at the gas station was unable to confront him there before the police arrived (doubly unlikely), it was entirely beyond imagination that Bryant would again open fire while Covington was surrounded by five armed police officers.  And Covington knew the shooting was the work of a drug dealer, not a spree killer who might randomly threaten others.  <em>Id.,</em> at 135, 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Covington\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that he had nothing to fear differs significantly from Michelle McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind during her \xe2\x80\x9cfrantic\xe2\x80\x9d statements to a 911 operator at issue in <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 827.  Her \xe2\x80\x9ccall was plainly a call for help against a bona fide physical threat\xe2\x80\x9d describing \xe2\x80\x9cevents <em>as they were actually happening</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  She did not have the luxuries of police protection and of time and space separating her from immediate danger that Covington enjoyed when he made his statements.  See <em>id.,</em> at 831.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Covington\xe2\x80\x99s pressing medical needs do not suggest that he was responding to an emergency, but to the contrary reinforce the testimonial character of his statements.  He understood the police were focused on investigating a past crime, not his medical needs.  None of the officers asked Covington how he was doing, attempted more than superficially to assess the severity of his wounds, or attempted to administer first aid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  They instead primarily asked questions with little, if any, relevance to Covington\xe2\x80\x99s dire situation.  Police, paramedics, and doctors do not need to know the address where a shooting took place, the name of the shooter, or the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s height and weight to provide proper medical care.  Underscoring that Covington understood the officers\xe2\x80\x99 investigative role, he interrupted their interrogation to ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhen is EMS coming?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 57.  When, in other words, would the focus shift to his medical needs rather than Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s crime?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements nor the colloquy between him and the officers would have been out of place at a trial; it would have been a routine direct examination.  See <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 830.  Like a witness, Covington recounted in detail how a past criminal event began and progressed, and like a prosecutor, the police elicited that account through structured questioning.  Preventing the admission of \xe2\x80\x9cweaker substitute[s] for live testimony at trial\xe2\x80\x9d such as this, <em>id.,</em> at 828 (internal quotation marks omitted), is precisely what motivated the Framers to adopt the Confrontation Clause and what motivated our decisions in <em>Crawford</em> and in <em>Hammon</em> v. <em>Indiana</em>, decided with <em>Davis</em>.  <em>Ex parte</em> examinations raise the same constitutional concerns whether they take place in a gas-station parking lot or in a police interrogation room.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Worse still for the repute of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, this is an absurdly easy case even if one (erroneously) takes the interrogating officers\xe2\x80\x99 purpose into account.  The five officers interrogated Covington primarily to investigate past criminal events.  None\xe2\x80\x94absolutely none\xe2\x80\x94of their actions indicated that they perceived an imminent threat.  They did not draw their weapons, and indeed did not immediately search the gas station for potential shooters.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  To the contrary, all five testified that they questioned Covington <em>before conducting any investigation at the scene</em>.  Would this have made any sense if they feared the presence of a shooter?  Most tellingly, none of the officers started his interrogation by asking what would have been the obvious first question if any hint of such a fear existed: Where is the shooter?</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But do not rely solely on my word about the officers\xe2\x80\x99 primary purpose.  Listen to Sergeant Wenturine, who candidly admitted that he interrogated Covington because he \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] a man here that [he] believe[d] [was] dying [so he was] gonna find out who did this, period.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 112.  In short, he needed to interrogate Covington to solve a crime.  Wenturine never mentioned an interest in ending an ongoing emergency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the very least, the officers\xe2\x80\x99 intentions <em>turned</em> investigative during their 10-minute encounter with Covington, and the conversation \xe2\x80\x9cevolve[d] into testimonial statements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The fifth officer to arrive at the scene did not need to run straight to Covington and ask a battery of questions \xe2\x80\x9cto determine the need for emergency assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid</em>.  He could have asked his fellow officers, who presumably had a better sense of that than Covington\xe2\x80\x94and a better sense of what he could do to assist.  No, the value of asking the same battery of questions a fifth time was to ensure that Covington told a consistent story and to see if any new details helpful to the investigation and eventual prosecution would emerge.  Having the testimony of five officers to recount Covington\xe2\x80\x99s consistent story undoubtedly helped obtain Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  (Which came, I may note, after the first jury could not reach a verdict.  See 483 Mich., at 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.)</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A final word about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s active imagination.  The Court invents a world where an ongoing emergency exists whenever \xe2\x80\x9can armed shooter, whose motive for and lo-cation after the shooting [are] unknown, \xe2\x80\xa6 mortally wound[s]\xe2\x80\x9d one individual \xe2\x80\x9cwithin a few blocks and [25] minutes of the location where the police\xe2\x80\x9d ultimately find that victim.  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  Breathlessly, it worries that a shooter could leave the scene armed and ready to pull the trigger again.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 27, 30<em>.</em>  Nothing suggests the five officers in this case shared the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dystopian[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] view of Detroit, where drug dealers hunt their shooting victim down and fire into a crowd of police officers to finish him off, see <em>ante</em>, at 30, or where spree killers shoot through a door and then roam the streets leaving a trail of bodies behind.  Because almost 90 percent of murders involve a single victim,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] it is much more likely\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I think it certain\xe2\x80\x94that the officers viewed their encounter with Covington for what it was: an investi-gation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s distorted view creates an expansive exception to the Confrontation Clause for violent crimes.  Because Bryant posed a continuing threat to public safety in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, the emergency persisted for confrontation purposes at least until the police learned his \xe2\x80\x9cmotive for and location after the shooting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  It may have persisted in this case until the police \xe2\x80\x9csecured the scene of the shooting\xe2\x80\x9d two-and-a-half hours later.  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  (The relevance of securing the scene is unclear so long as the killer is still at large\xe2\x80\x94especially if, as the Court speculates, he may be a spree-killer.)  This is a dangerous definition of emergency.  Many individuals who testify against a defendant at trial first offer their accounts to police in the hours after a violent act.  If the police can plausibly claim that a \xe2\x80\x9cpotential threat to \xe2\x80\xa6 the public\xe2\x80\x9d persisted through those first few hours, <em>ante</em>, at 12 (and if the claim is plausible here it is always plausible) a defendant will have no constitutionally protected right to exclude the uncross-examined testimony of such witnesses.  His conviction could rest (as perhaps it did here) solely on the officers\xe2\x80\x99 recollection at trial of the witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 accusations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Framers could not have envisioned such a hollow constitutional guarantee.  No framing-era confrontation case that I know of, neither here nor in England, took such an enfeebled view of the right to confrontation.  For example, <em>King</em> v. <em>Brasier</em>, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202, 202\xe2\x80\x93203 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1779), held inadmissible a mother\xe2\x80\x99s account of her young daughter\xe2\x80\x99s statements \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately on her coming home\xe2\x80\x9d after being sexually assaulted.  The daughter needed to testify herself.  But today\xe2\x80\x99s majority presumably would hold the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s account to her mother a nontestimonial statement made during an ongoing emergency.  She could not have known whether her attacker might reappear to attack again or attempt to silence the lone witness against him.  Her mother likely listened to the account to assess the threat to her own safety and to decide whether the rapist posed a threat \nto the community that required the immediate intervention of the local authorities.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  Utter nonsense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials that helped inspire the Confrontation Clause show that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a mistake.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansive definition of an \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d and its willingness to consider the perspective of the interrogator and the declarant cast a more favorable light on those trials than history or our past decisions suggest they deserve.  Royal officials conducted many of the <em>ex parte</em> examinations introduced against Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir John Fenwick while investigating alleged treasonous conspiracies of unknown scope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the King.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21\xe2\x80\x9322, and n.\xc2\xa011.  Social stability in 16th- and 17th-century England depended mainly on the continuity of the ruling monarch, cf. 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 354 (1883), so such a conspiracy posed the most pressing emergency imaginable.  Presumably, the royal officials investigating it would have understood the gravity of the situation and would have focused their interrogations primarily on ending the threat, not on generating testimony for trial.  I therefore doubt that under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test English officials acted improperly by denying Raleigh and Fenwick the opportunity to confront their accusers \xe2\x80\x9cface to face,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under my approach, in contrast, those English trials remain unquestionably infamous.  Lord Cobham did not speak with royal officials to end an ongoing emergency.  He was a traitor!  He spoke, as Raleigh correctly observed, to establish Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s guilt and to save his own life.  See 1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832).  Cobham\xe2\x80\x99s statements, when assessed from his perspective, had only a testimonial purpose.  The same is true of Covington\xe2\x80\x99s statements here.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not only a gross distortion of the facts.  It is a gross distortion of the law\xe2\x80\x94a revisionist narrative in which reliability continues to guide our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, at least where emergencies and faux emergencies are concerned.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the <em>Davis </em>inquiry into whether a declarant spoke to end an ongoing emergency or rather to \xe2\x80\x9cprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d 547 U. S., at 822, is <em>not</em> aimed at answering whether the declarant acted as a witness.  Instead, the <em>Davis </em>inquiry probes the <em>reliability</em> of a declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statements, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mplicit[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d importing the excited-utterances hearsay exception into the Constitution.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  A statement during an ongoing emergency is sufficiently reliable, the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the prospect of fabrication \xe2\x80\xa6 is presumably significantly diminished,\xe2\x80\x9d so it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not [need] to be subject to the crucible of cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 14<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Compare that with the holding of <em>Crawford:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U. S., at 68\xe2\x80\x9369.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion adopts, for emergencies and faux emergencies at least, the discredited logic of <em>White</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/346/index.html">502 U. S. 346</a>, 355\xe2\x80\x93356, and n.\xc2\xa08 (1992), and <em>Idaho</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/805/index.html">497 U. S. 805</a>, 819\xe2\x80\x93820 (1990).  <em>White</em> is, of course, the decision that both <em>Crawford</em> and <em>Davis</em> found most incompatible with the text and history of the Confrontation Clause.  See <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 825; <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 58, n.\xc2\xa08.  (This is not to say that that \xe2\x80\x9creliability\xe2\x80\x9d logic can actually justify today\xe2\x80\x99s result: Twenty-five minutes is plenty of time for a shooting victim to reflect and fabricate a false story.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court announces that in future cases it will look to \xe2\x80\x9cstandard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some statements as reliable,\xe2\x80\x9d when deciding whether a statement is testimonial.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a> (1980) said something remarkably similar: An out-of-court statement is admissible if it \xe2\x80\x9cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cbears adequate \xe2\x80\x98indicia of reliability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 66.  We tried that approach to the Confrontation Clause for nearly 25 years before <em>Crawford rejected</em> it<em> </em>as an unworkable standard unmoored from the text and the historical roots of the Confrontation Clause.  See 541 U. S., at 54, 60, 63\xe2\x80\x9365, 67\xe2\x80\x9368.  The arguments in Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s infamous 17th-century treason trial contained full debate about the reliability of Lord Cobham\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ex parte</em> accusations, see <em>Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, \n2 How. St. Tr. 1, 14, 17, 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 22\xe2\x80\x9323, 29 (1603); that \ncase remains the canonical example of a Confrontation Clause violation, not because Raleigh should have won the debate but because he should have been allowed \ncross-examination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court attempts to fit its resurrected interest in reliability into the <em>Crawford</em> framework, but the result is incoherent.  Reliability, the Court tells us, is a good indicator of whether \xe2\x80\x9ca statement is \xe2\x80\xa6 an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  That is patently false.  Reliability tells us <em>nothing</em> about whether a statement is testimonial.  Testimonial and nontestimonial statements alike come in varying degrees of reliability.  An eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police after a fender-bender, for example, are both reliable and testimonial.  Statements to the police from one driver attempting to blame the other would be similarly testimonial but rarely reliable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests otherwise because it \xe2\x80\x9cmisunderstands the relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between qualification for one of the standard hearsay exceptions and exemption from the confrontation requirement.  <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18).  That relationship is not a causal one.  Hearsay law exempts business records, for example, because businesses have a financial incentive to keep reliable records.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6).  The Sixth Amendment also generally admits business records into evidence, but not because the records are reliable or because hearsay law says so.  It admits them \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x94having been created for the administration of an entity\xe2\x80\x99s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial\xe2\x80\x94they are not\xe2\x80\x9d weaker substitutes for live testimony.  <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  Moreover, the scope of the exemption from confrontation and that of the hearsay exceptions also are not always coextensive.  The reliability logic of the business-record exception would extend to records maintained by neutral parties providing litigation-support services, such as evidence testing.  The Confrontation Clause is not so forgiving.  Business records prepared specifically for use at a criminal trial are testimonial and require confrontation.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is it possible that the Court does not recognize the contradiction between its focus on reliable statements and <em>Crawford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s focus on testimonial ones?  Does it not realize that the two cannot coexist?  Or does it intend, by following today\xe2\x80\x99s illogical roadmap, to resurrect <em>Roberts</em> by a thousand unprincipled distinctions without ever explicitly overruling <em>Crawford?</em>  After all, honestly overruling <em>Crawford</em> would destroy the illusion of judicial minimalism and restraint.  And it would force the Court to explain how \nthe Justices\xe2\x80\x99 preference comports with the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that the People adopted\xe2\x80\x94or to confess that only the Justices\xe2\x80\x99 preference really matters.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court recedes from <em>Crawford</em> in a second significant way.  It requires judges to conduct \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended balancing tests\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9camorphous, if not entirely subjective,\xe2\x80\x9d inquiries into the totality of the circumstances bearing upon reliability.  541 U. S., at 63, 68.  Where the prosecution cries \xe2\x80\x9cemergency,\xe2\x80\x9d the admissibility of a statement now turns on \xe2\x80\x9ca highly context-dependent inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, into the type of weapon the defendant wielded, see <em>ante</em>, at 17<em>;</em> the type of crime the defendant committed, see <em>ante</em>, at 12, 16\xe2\x80\x9317; the medical condition of the declarant, see <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318; if the declarant is injured, whether paramedics have arrived on the scene, see <em>ante</em>, at 20; whether the encounter takes place in an \xe2\x80\x9cexposed public area,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.; whether the encounter appears disorganized, see <em>ibid</em>.; whether the declarant is capable of forming a purpose, see <em>ante</em>, at<em> </em>22; whether the police have secured the scene of the crime, see <em>ante</em>, at 28; the formality of the statement, see <em>ante</em>, at 19; and finally, whether the statement strikes us as reliable, see <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  This is no better than the nine-factor balancing test we rejected in <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U. S., at 63.  I do not look forward to resolving conflicts in the future over whether knives and poison are more like guns or fists for Confrontation Clause purposes, or whether rape and armed robbery are more like murder or domestic violence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It can be said, of course, that under <em>Crawford </em>analysis of whether a statement is testimonial requires consideration of all the circumstances, and so is also something of a multifactor balancing test.  But the \xe2\x80\x9creliability\xe2\x80\x9d test does not replace that analysis; it supplements it.  As I understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, even when it is determined that no emergency exists (or perhaps before that determination is made) the statement would be found admissible as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned if it is not \ntestimonial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any case, we did not disavow multifactor balancing for reliability in <em>Crawford </em>out of a preference for rules over standards.  We did so because it \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] violence to\xe2\x80\x9d the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 design.  <em>Id.,</em> at 68.  It was judges\xe2\x80\x99 open-ended determination of what was reliable that violated the trial rights of Englishmen in the political trials of the 16th and 17th centuries.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Throckmorton\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 1 How. St. Tr. 869, 875\xe2\x80\x93876 (1554); <em>Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 2 How. St. Tr., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, 24.  The Framers placed the Confrontation Clause in the Bill of Rights to ensure that those abuses (and the abuses by the Admiralty courts in colonial America) would not be repeated in this country.  Not even the least dangerous branch can be trusted to assess the reliability of uncross-examined testimony in politically charged trials or trials implicating threats to national security.  See <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 67\xe2\x80\x9368; cf. <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U.

S. 36</a>, 56, n. 6 (2004), this Court noted that, in the law we inherited from England, there was a well-established exception to the confrontation requirement: The cloak protecting the accused against admission of out-of-court testimonial statements was removed for dying declarations.  This historic exception, we recalled in <em>Giles</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/353/index.html">554 U.

Were the issue properly tendered here, I would take up the question whether the exception for dying declarations survives our recent Confrontation Clause decisions.  The Michigan Supreme Court, however, held, as a matter of state law, that the prosecutor had abandoned the issue.  See 483 Mich. 132, 156\xe2\x80\x93157, 768 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 65, 78 (2009).
