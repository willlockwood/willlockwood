The complaint, as finally amended, alleged that petitioners were taken to police headquarters in Agana, where officers assaulted them and forced them to write and sign statements confessing narcotics crimes.</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the claims against the Government of Guam and the Police Department on the ground that Guam was immune from suit under the Organic Act of Guam, 64 Stat. 384, \xc2\xa7 3, <em>as amended,</em> 48 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1421a, unless Congress or the Guam Legislature waived Guam\'s immunity.

"For the same reasons," the Police Department, also, is not a person under \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Id.</em> at 1372.  Finally, the Court of Appeals ruled that Guam officials may not be sued in their official capacities under \xc2\xa7 1983, because a judgment against those defendants in their official capacities would affect the public treasury, and the suit essentially would be one against the Government itself.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Accordingly, the court affirmed the District Court\'s dismissal of the claims against the Government of Guam, the Guam Police Department, and the individual defendants in their official capacities.

Except for the period from December, 1941, to July, 1944, when Japan invaded and occupied the island, the United States Navy administered Guam\'s affairs from 1898 to 1950, when the Organic Act was passed.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The 1874 recodification omitted those three words and substituted "partnerships and corporations."

Most significant is the asserted reason for doing so:</p>\n<p>"The reasons for the latter change [substituting \'partnerships and corporations\' for \'bodies politic and corporate\'] are that partnerships ought to be included; and that even if the phrase \'bodies politic\' is precisely equivalent to \'corporations,\' it is redundant; but if, on the contrary, \'body politic\' is somewhat broader, and should be understood to include a government, such as a State, while \'corporation\' should be confined to an association of natural persons on whom government has conferred continuous succession, then the provision goes further than is convenient.  It requires the draughtsman, in the majority of cases of employing the word \'person,\' to take care that States, Territories, foreign governments, &amp;c., appear to be excluded."</p>\n<p>1 Revision of the United States Statutes as Drafted 19 (1872).</p>\n<p>As these comments make clear, at the time Congress first made it possible for a person acting under color of territorial law to be held liable, the very same Congress pointedly redefined the word "person" to make it clear that a Territory would not be included.

Because the words "or Territory" were added in the very "revised statutes" to which the language in the Dictionary Act refers, we conclude that the amended definition of "person" is the definition to which we look in determining whether a Territory is included in that definition.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>This reasoning is fully consistent with the Court\'s decision in <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html">436 U. S. 658</a></span> (1978).  There the Court held that a municipality could be a "person [acting] under color of any law . . . of any State," Act of Apr. 20, 1871, \xc2\xa7 1, 17 Stat. 13, and thus was exposed to liability under the 1871 statute.  In concluding that the 1871 Congress specifically intended to subject municipalities to \xc2\xa7 1983 liability, we relied, among other things, on indications in the legislative history that municipal liability was contemplated, on the general treatment of corporations (including municipal corporations) as "persons," and on the 1871 version of the Dictionary Act.  436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#686">436 U. S. 686</a></span>-689.  As has been explained, the 1871 Congress had no similar intent with respect to Territories, and, when it did address Territories in 1874, Congress intended not to subject them to liability.  The 1874 revisions of the Dictionary Act, however, must be considered in light of the previously and more specifically expressed intent to subject municipalities to liability.</p>\n<p>More recently, there have been at least two attempts in Congress to amend \xc2\xa7 1983 to include States and Territories within the meaning of persons.  The bills did not leave Committee.   <em>See</em> Sagafi-Nejad, Proposed Amendments to Section 1983 Introduced in the Senate, 27 St. Louis U.L.J. 373, 374, 376, n. 21 (1983).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider Guam\'s claim of immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p>Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court holds that neither a Territory nor an officer of the Territory acting in his or her official capacity is a "person" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  I believe that the opposite conclusion is compelled by the history, legislative and otherwise, surrounding the passage of \xc2\xa7 1983, and by the absence of any immunity on the part of Territories from congressional enactments.

S. 192</a></span>, rests primarily on its conclusion that</p>\n<p>"review of \xc2\xa7 1983\'s history uncovers no sign that Congress was thinking of Territories when it enacted the statute over a century ago in 1871."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/182/case.html#187">495 U.

Carter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html">409 U. S. 418</a></span> (1973), set forth ample evidence that Congress had the Territories in mind when it enacted the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 1983, the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  <em>Carter</em> held that the District of Columbia is not a "State or Territory" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983:</p>\n<p>"[S]ince the District is itself the seat of the National Government, Congress was in a position to observe and, to a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="194">Page 495 U.

Thus, the rationale underlying Congress\' decision not to enact legislation similar to \xc2\xa7 1983 with respect to federal officials -- the assumption that the Federal Government could keep its own officers under control -- is equally applicable to the situation then existing in the District of Columbia."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html#429">409 U.

Rather, Congress left municipal law to be developed largely by the territorial legislatures, within the framework of organic acts, and subject to a retained power of veto.  The scope of self-government exercised under these delegations was nearly as broad as that enjoyed by the States.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html#430">409 U.

S. 195</a></p><p> that</p>\n<p>"although the Constitution vested control over the Territories in the Congress, its practical control was both \'confused and ineffective,\' making the problem of enforcement of civil rights in the Territories more similar to the problem as it existed in the States than in the District of Columbia."</p>\n<p><em>Carter, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html#431">409 U.

S. 596</a></span> (1976) ("Congress . . . lacked effective control over actions taken by territorial officials, although its authority to govern was plenary").</p>\n<p>Our recognition in <em>Carter</em> that Congress was concerned with the protection of civil rights in the Territories when it fashioned the scope of \xc2\xa7 1983 is fully supported by the historical events surrounding the statute\'s enactment.  In the years preceding the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, turmoil and racially motivated violence in the Territories focused Congress\' attention on the need for federal protection of basic civil rights there.  The Territories, of course, had been a principal source of friction between the North and the South before the Civil War. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The idea of "squatter sovereignty," advanced by Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, and enshrined in the Compromise of 1850, allowed citizens of each Territory to decide for themselves whether they would join the Union as citizens of a slave or free State.  The Compromise of 1850 provided that the admissions of Utah and New Mexico were to be governed by "squatter sovereignty," and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="196">Page 495 U. S. 196</a></p><p> the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 extended the principle to those Territories as well.  The resulting disputes within the Territories between abolitionist and pro-slavery groups gave rise to rampant acts of violence, the best illustration of which has come to be known as "bleeding Kansas."</p>\n<p>In the 1855 elections for the Kansas territorial legislature, several thousand "border ruffians" crossed over from Missouri to stuff ballot boxes and ensure the election of a legislature that would, and did, pass a drastic slave code.  <em>See</em> S. Morison, H. Commager, &amp; W. Leuchtenburg, A Concise History of the American Republic 260 (2d ed. 1983).  The free-state forces in Kansas responded by setting up their own rump government, and "by 1856, Kansas had two governments, both illegal."  <em>Ibid.</em>  What followed was a "savage conflict" between the two sides.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>"Into Kansas thronged Southern and Northern zealots, brawlers, adventurers, and land jobbers.  From New England, financed by Boston money, moved Abolitionist immigrants who were led by their ministers but who also brought their rifles with them."</p>\n<p>L. Hacker, The Shaping of the American Tradition 468 (1947).  Public buildings were burned, and supporters of each side were murdered.  In retaliation for the slaying of two Abolitionists, John Brown killed five proslavery men at Osawatomie Creek.  In sum, in what "might almost be regarded as the opening battle of the civil war," 1 J. Blaine, Twenty Years of Congress:  From Lincoln to Garfield 121 (1884), law and order broke down completely.</p>\n<p>This and other examples of turbulence in the Territories [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] were very much on Congress\' mind when it enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  Congress would not have discussed the Territories so often in its deliberations unless it intended the Act to apply there.  Proponents of the measure stressed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 495 U. S. 197</a></p><p> the important role the Federal Government had played in curbing the prewar spread of slavery in the Territories.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 335 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Hoar) ("the great Northwest was saved from slavery by the national power. . . .  If it had not been for the benignant interposition of the national authority against the local desire to establish despotism, those great States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin would have been today slaveholding States").  Some legislators drew an explicit linkage between the Civil Rights Act and violence in the Territories, characterizing opponents of the legislation as "[t]he same men [who] were wont to ridicule <em>bleeding Kansas.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 414 (remarks of Rep. Roberts).  Others emphasized the importance of extending to\n</em></p>\n<p>"every individual citizen of the Republic in every State <em>and Territory</em> of the Union . . . the extent of the rights guarantied to him by the Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>See id.</em> at App. 81 (remarks of Rep. Bingham) (emphasis added); <em>see also id.</em> at App. 86 (remarks of Rep. Bingham) (referring to "justice for all . . . on the frontiers of your widely extended domain"). [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The Civil Rights Act was intended "to protect and defend and give remedies for their wrongs to <em>all</em> the people" and thus to be "liberally and beneficently construed."  <em>Id.</em> at App. 68 (remarks of Rep. Shellabarger) (emphasis added).  In sum, Congress contemplated that the Civil Rights Act of 1871 would extend to the Territories. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 495 U. S. 198</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that, in 1867, Congress had extended suffrage to all adult males in the Territories, including Afro-Americans, at a time when the States were still permitted to deny the right to vote on account of race. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  See Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 2600-2602 (1866).  The organic acts establishing territorial governments were amended to provide that:</p>\n<p>"there shall be no denial of the elective franchise in any of the Territories of the United States, now or hereafter to be organized, to any citizen thereof, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and all acts or parts of acts, either of Congress or the legislative assemblies of said Territories, inconsistent with the provisions of this act, are hereby declared null and void."</p>\n<p>14 Stat. 379-380 (1867).  <em>See also</em> E. McPherson, The Political History of the United States of America During the Period of Reconstruction 184 (1871); E. Foner, Reconstruction:  America\'s Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877, p. 272 (1988).  In 1874, Congress passed legislation to ensure that every Territory\'s organic act included the protections of the Constitution and civil rights embodied in other federal laws.  <em>See</em> Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1891 (1874).</p>\n<p>The extension of these basic federal rights and the recognition of the concomitant need for federal enforcement [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] demonstrate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 495 U. S. 199</a></p><p> that Congress intended Territories to be considered "persons" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983.  Of course, the specific reference to "Territory" in \xc2\xa7 1983\'s predecessor was not added until 1874, some three years after the initial passage of the Civil Rights Act.  But this is of no moment.  Although there is no legislative history to explain the addition, [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] <em>see Carter</em>, 409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html#424">409 U.

Because few measures are more effective than suing the government directly for damages, <em>see Owen v.

I do not find this awkwardness determinative, however, because \xc2\xa7 1983 also extends to <em>natural persons</em> who act under color of Territorial law.  The under-color-of-law requirement serves to ensure that not every act of these natural persons in their private capacities gives rise to \xc2\xa7 1983 liability.  The only method of avoiding the redundancy of which the majority complains would have been to replace the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 495 U.

That approach would have been even more "awkward" than the one ultimately chosen by Congress.  In any event, I thought that we enforced the statutes drafted by Congress, whether or not they flowed "trippingly on the tongue."</p>\n<p>Neither is my conclusion that Territories are "persons" under \xc2\xa7 1983 undermined by the 1874 recodification of the Dictionary Act, which altered the definition of "person" by replacing the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" with "partnerships and corporations."  1 Revision of the United States Statutes as Drafted 19 (1872) (hereinafter Draft).  The Court suggests that Congress clarified the definition of "person" in the Dictionary Act to exclude Territories, even while, at the same time, making clear that \xc2\xa7 1983 covered civil rights abuses in the Territories.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/182/case.html#189">495 U.

At any rate, there is little authoritative support for the Court\'s view, since the recodification of the Dictionary Act was accompanied, not by legislative history from Congress itself, but only by comments from commissioners appointed to revise the United States Code.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/182/case.html#190">495 U.

In 1959, Congress amended the Organic Act to provide that the government,</p>\n<p>"with the consent of the legislature evidenced by enacted law, may be sued upon any contract entered into with respect to, or any tort committed incident to, the exercise by the government of Guam of any of its lawful powers."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Respondents contend that the 1959 amendment provides the only exceptions to an otherwise universally applicable sovereign immunity bestowed by the Organic Act itself.</p>\n<p>I disagree.  The limited authorization for legislative waiver of sovereign immunity refers solely to claims arising under territorial law.  The scheme is therefore fully consistent with the understanding that the 1950 Act granted Guam <em>only</em> immunity from suit in its own courts for violations of its own law.

No. 212, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (1951) (listing 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, then codified at 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 43 (1946), as among the statutes of the United States applicable to Guam).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>Cases cited by respondents as evidence of territorial immunity, such as <em>Wisconsin v. Doty,</em> 1 Wis. 396, 407 (1844); <em>Langford v. King,</em> 1 Mont. 33, 38 (1868); <em>Beachy v. Lamkin,</em> 1 Idaho 50, 52 (1866); <em>Fisk v. Cuttabert,</em> 2 Mont. 593, 598 (1877), are irrelevant, because they involve claims asserted under territorial, rather than federal, law.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
