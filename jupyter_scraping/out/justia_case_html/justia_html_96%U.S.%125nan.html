Was it dutiable as confectionery or as chocolate?</p>\n<p>The case differs from those already decided in this, that the last act expressing the legislative will is that which imposes the lower rate of duty.  It is like the others in this, that it presents the question whether the articles are dutiable under general </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 96 U. S. 127</a></p><p> terms which may embrace them, or under that specific language which can be applied to nothing else.  That the latter is the rule by which the duty is fixed is too well settled to require argument.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/162/case.html">Reiche v.

Rev.Stat. p. 478.</p>\n<p>Contemporaneously and side by side, all the way down, the statutes provide for different rates of duty on the varieties of sugar and on confectionery, as well as on chocolate.  Confectionery and chocolate are uniformly recognized as being different articles for the purpose of duties.</p>\n<p>In the first paragraph of sec. 8 of the Tariff Act of 1842, 5 Stat. 558, sugar of various kinds, comfits, sweetmeats, and confectionery are subject to a duty of twenty-five percent <em>ad valorem;</em> in the second paragraph of the same section, a duty four cents per pound is imposed upon "chocolate."</p>\n<p>In the Tariff Act of 1846, 9 <em>id.</em> 44, "comfits and sweetmeats" are dutiable at forty percent, "confectionery" of all kinds, at thirty percent, and "chocolate," at twenty percent.</p>\n<p>In the Act of 1861, "comfits and sweetmeats" are placed at thirty percent, "confectionery of all kinds not otherwise provided for," at thirty percent; "chocolate" at twenty percent.  12 <em>id.</em> 180, 189.</p>\n<p>By the Act of July, 1870, chocolate is again made dutiable by name, 16 <em>id.</em> 262, and again by the Act of June, 1872, 17 <em>id.</em> 231.</p>\n<p>In the Revised Statutes, "sugar candy and confectionery" are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 96 U. S. 128</a></p><p> provided for, as are "comfits, sweetmeats, and preserved fruits," and, separately, "chocolate," at a different rate of duty.  Rev.Stat. pp. 472, 478.</p>\n<p>It is quite evident that Congress has at all times intended to preserve the distinction between these articles, and that the circuit judge decided correctly when he held that chocolate, although in the form and of the character described, was not dutiable as "confectionery" under the Act of 1864.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
