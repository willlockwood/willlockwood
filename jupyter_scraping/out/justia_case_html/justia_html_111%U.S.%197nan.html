CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>As to the first of these defenses, it is sufficient to say that the plea of another action pending is a plea in abatement.  Bac.Abr. "Abatement," M; Comyn\'s Dig. "Abatement," H, 24; 1 Chitty\'s Pl., 10th Am. ed. 453; 3 <em>id.</em> 903, note <em>y</em>.  And by \xc2\xa7 1011 of the Revised Statutes, which is a reenactment of a similar provision in the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 22, 1 Stat. 84, 85, it is expressly provided that there shall be no reversal in this Court or the circuit court for error in ruling any plea in abatement other than a plea to the jurisdiction of the court.  Under this statute, it was held in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/104/case.html">Piquignot v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company,</a></span></em> 16 How. 104, which came from the same district as this case, that the judgment of the circuit court, on precisely such a plea as that contemplated by this affidavit of defense, was "not subject to our revision on a writ of error."  The defense is one which merely defeats the present proceeding, and does not conclude the plaintiff forever, either as to his right to sue in the circuit court of the United States or as to the merits of the matter in dispute.</p>\n<p>All the other defenses are covered by the decision of this Court in <em>Barnet v. National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/98/555/case.html">98 U. S. 555</a></span>.  The only </p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 111 U. S. 199</a></p><p> difference between that case and this is that there, the defendant was the maker of the note, who actually paid the usurious interest, and here the defendant is the surety of the maker.  It is difficult to see how the surety stands, as to the question now presented, in any better position than his principal.  The ground of that decision was that, as without the statute there could be no recovery from the bank for usurious interest actually paid, and as the statute which created the right to such a recovery also prescribed the remedy, that remedy was exclusive of all others for the enforcement of that right.  <em>Farmers\' &amp; Mechanics\' National Bank v. Dearing,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/91/29/case.html">91 U. S. 29</a></span>.  The surety has not, any more than his principal, the right to recover back the interest without the aid of a statute.  Consequently if his principal could not make this defense, he cannot.  The forfeiture and the remedy are creatures of the same statute, and must stand or fall together.</p>\n<p>The defense, as stated in the affidavit, is not that interest stipulated for has been included in the note, but that interest actually paid at the time of the discount and the several renewals should be applied to the discharge of the principal.  In this particular the case presents the same facts substantially as <em>Driesbach v. National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/52/case.html">104 U. S. 52</a></span>.  To entitle the defendant to such relief as was given in <em>Farmers\' &amp; Mechanics\' Bank v. Dearing, supra,</em> it should be made to appear by distinct averment that the note sued on includes interest stipulated for and not paid, as well as principal.  That has not been done in this case.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
