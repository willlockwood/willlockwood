They sued petitioner, who also markets cheerleading uniforms, for copyright infringement.  The District Court granted petitioner summary judgment, holding that the designs could not be conceptually or physically separated from the uniforms and were therefore ineligible for copyright protection.  In reversing, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the graphics could be \xe2\x80\x9cidentified separately\xe2\x80\x9d and were \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of existing independently\xe2\x80\x9d of the uniforms under \xc2\xa7101.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection only if the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article, and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work\xe2\x80\x94either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression\xe2\x80\x94if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated.

Respondents claim that two-dimensional surface decorations are always separable, even without resorting to a \xc2\xa7101 analysis, because they are \xe2\x80\x9c<i>on</i> a useful article\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9c<i>designs of </i>a useful article.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this argument is inconsistent with \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s text.  \xe2\x80\x9d[P]ictorial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgraphic\xe2\x80\x9d denote two-dimensional features such as pictures, paintings, or drawings.  Thus, by providing protection for \xe2\x80\x9cpictorial, graphical, and sculptural works\xe2\x80\x9d incorporated into the \xe2\x80\x9cdesign of a useful article,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101 necessarily contemplates that such a design can include two-dimensional features.  This Court will not adjudicate in the first instance the Government\xe2\x80\x99s distinct argument against applying separability analysis, which was neither raised below nor advanced here by any party.

Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Section 101\xe2\x80\x99s separate-identification requirement is met if the decisionmaker is able to look at the useful article and spot some two- or three-dimensional element that appears to have pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  To satisfy the independent-existence requirement, the feature must be able to exist as its own pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work once it is imagined apart from the useful article.  If the feature could not exist as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own, it is simply one of the article\xe2\x80\x99s utilitarian aspects.  And to qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own, the feature cannot be a useful article or \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n article that is normally a part of a useful article,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101.  Neither could one claim a copyright in a useful article by creating a replica of it in another medium.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The statute as a whole confirms this interpretation.  Section 101, which protects art first fixed in the medium of a useful article, is essentially the mirror image of \xc2\xa7113(a), which protects art first fixed in a medium other than a useful article and subsequently applied to a useful article.  Together, these provisions make clear that copyright protection extends to pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works regardless of whether they were created as freestanding art or as features of useful articles.  P.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0This interpretation is also consistent with the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s history.  In <i>Mazer</i>, a case decided under the 1909 Copyright Act, the Court held that respondents owned a copyright in a statuette created for use as a lamp base.  In so holding, the Court approved a Copyright Office regulation extending protection to works of art that might also serve a useful purpose and held that it was irrelevant to the copyright inquiry whether the statuette was initially created as a freestanding sculpture or as a lamp base.  Soon after, the Copyright Office enacted a regulation implementing <i>Mazer</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that anticipated the language of \xc2\xa7101, thereby introducing the modern separability test to copyright law.  Congress essentially lifted the language from those post-<i>Mazer</i> regulations and placed it in \xc2\xa7101 of the 1976 Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Applying the proper test here, the surface decorations on the cheerleading uniforms are separable and therefore eligible for copyright protection.  First, the decorations can be identified as features having pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  Second, if those decorations were separated from the uniforms and applied in another medium, they would qualify as two-dimensional works of art under \xc2\xa7101.  Imaginatively removing the decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium also would not replicate the uniform itself.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The dissent argues that the decorations are ineligible for copyright protection because, when imaginatively extracted, they form a picture of a cheerleading uniform.  Petitioner similarly claims that the decorations cannot be copyrighted because, even when extracted from the useful article, they retain the outline of a cheerleading uniform.  But this is not a bar to copyright.  Just as two-dimensional fine art correlates to the shape of the canvas on which it is painted, two-dimensional applied art correlates to the contours of the article on which it is applied.  The only feature of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 cheerleading uniform eligible for a copyright is the two-dimensional applied art on the surface of the uniforms.  Respondents may prohibit the reproduction only of the surface designs on a uniform or in any other medium of expression.  Respondents have no right to prevent anyone from manufacturing a cheerleading uniform that is identical in shape, cut, or dimensions to the uniforms at issue here.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0None of the objections raised by petitioner or the Government is meritorious.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Petitioner and the Government focus on the relative utility of the plain white uniform that would remain if the designs were physically removed from the uniform.  But the separability inquiry focuses on the extracted feature and not on any aspects of the useful article remaining after the imaginary extraction.  The statute does not require the imagined remainder to be a fully functioning useful article at all.  Nor can an artistic feature that would be eligible for copyright protection on its own lose that protection simply because it was first created as a feature of the design of a useful article, even if it makes that article more useful.  This has been the rule since <i>Mazer</i>, and it is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s explicit protection of \xe2\x80\x9capplied art.\xe2\x80\x9d  In rejecting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Court necessarily abandons the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconceptual\xe2\x80\x9d separability adopted by some courts and commentators.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Petitioner also suggests incorporating two \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d components into the test\xe2\x80\x94one requiring consideration of evidence of the creator\xe2\x80\x99s design methods, purposes, and reasons, and one looking to the feature\xe2\x80\x99s marketability.  The Court declines to incorporate these components because neither is grounded in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0Finally, petitioner claims that protecting surface decorations is inconsistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to entirely exclude industrial design from copyright.  But Congress has given limited copyright protection to certain features of industrial design.  Approaching the statute with presumptive hostility toward protection for industrial design would undermine that choice.  In any event, the test adopted here does not render the underlying uniform eligible for copyright protection.

Under this theory, two-dimensional artistic features on the surface of useful articles are \xe2\x80\x9cinherently separable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 26.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument is inconsistent with the text of \xc2\xa7101.  The statute requires separability analysis for any \xe2\x80\x9cpictorial, graphic, or sculptural features\xe2\x80\x9d incorporated into the \xe2\x80\x9cdesign of a useful article.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cDesign\xe2\x80\x9d refers here to \xe2\x80\x9cthe combination\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cdetails\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfeatures\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cgo to make up\xe2\x80\x9d the useful article.  3 Oxford English Dictionary 244 (def. 7, first listing) (1933) (OED).  Furthermore, the words \xe2\x80\x9cpictorial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgraphic\xe2\x80\x9d include, in this context, two-dimensional features such as pictures, paintings, or drawings.

As part of their copyright registrations for the designs in this case, respondents deposited with the Copyright Office drawings and photographs depicting the designs incorporated onto cheerleading uniforms.  App. 213\xe2\x80\x93219; Appendix, <i>infra</i>.  The Government argues that, assuming the other statutory requirements were met, respondents obtained a copyright in the deposited drawings and photographs and have simply reproduced those copyrighted works on the surface of a useful article, as they would have the exclusive right to do under the Copyright Act.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14\xe2\x80\x9315, 17\xe2\x80\x9322.  Accordingly, the Government urges, separability analysis is unnecessary on the record in this case.  We generally do not entertain arguments that were not raised below and that are not advanced in this Court by any party, <i>Burwell</i> v. <i>Hobby</i> <i>Lobby Stores, Inc.</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014), because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first instance,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>CRST Van Expedited, Inc.</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 16).

The first requirement\xe2\x80\x94separate identification\xe2\x80\x94is not onerous.  The decisionmaker need only be able to look at the useful article and spot some two- or three-dimensional element that appears to have pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  See 2 Patry \xc2\xa73:146, at 3\xe2\x80\x93474 to3\xe2\x80\x93475.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The independent-existence requirement is ordinarily more difficult to satisfy.  The decisionmaker must determine that the separately identified feature has the capacity to exist apart from the utilitarian aspects of the article.  See 2 OED 88 (def. 5) (defining \xe2\x80\x9c[c]apable\xe2\x80\x9d of as \xe2\x80\x9c[h]aving the needful capacity, power, or fitness for\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, the feature must be able to exist as its own pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work as defined in \xc2\xa7101 once it is imagined apart from the useful article.  If the feature is not capable of existing as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work once separated from the useful article, then it was not a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature of that article, but rather one of its utilitarian aspects.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, to qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own, the feature cannot itself be a useful article or \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n article that is normally a part of a useful article\xe2\x80\x9d (which is itself considered a useful article).  \xc2\xa7101.  Nor could someone claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium\xe2\x80\x94for example, a cardboard model of a car.  Al-though the replica could itself be copyrightable, it would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The statute as a whole confirms our interpretation.  The Copyright Act provides \xe2\x80\x9cthe owner of [a] copyright\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive righ[t] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7106(1).  The statute clarifies that this right \xe2\x80\x9cincludes the right to reproduce the [copyrighted] work in or on any kind of article, whether useful or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7113(a).  Section 101 is, in essence, the mirror image of \xc2\xa7113(a).  Whereas \xc2\xa7113(a) protects a work of authorship first fixed in some tangible medium other than a useful article and subsequently applied to a useful article, \xc2\xa7101 protects art first fixed in the medium of a useful article.  The two provisions make clear that copyright protection extends to pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works regardless of whether they were created as freestanding art or as features of useful articles.  The ultimate separability question, then, is whether the feature for which copyright protection is claimed would have been eligible for copyright protection as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work had it originally been fixed in some tangible medium other than a useful article before being applied to a useful article.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This interpretation is also consistent with the history of the Copyright Act.  In <i>Mazer</i>, a case decided under the 1909 Copyright Act, the respondents copyrighted a statuette depicting a dancer.  The statuette was intended for use as a lamp base, \xe2\x80\x9cwith electric wiring, sockets and lamp shades attached.\xe2\x80\x9d  347 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202.<i> </i> Copies of the statuette were sold both as lamp bases and separately as statuettes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 203.  The petitioners copied the statuette and sold lamps with the statuette as the base.  They defended against the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 infringement suit by arguing that the respondents did not have a copyright in a statuette intended for use as a lamp base.  <i>Id.,</i> at 204\xe2\x80\x93205.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two of <i>Mazer</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holdings are relevant here.  First, the Court held that the respondents owned a copyright in the statuette even though it was intended for use as a lamp base.  See <i>id.,</i> at 214.  In doing so, the Court approved the Copyright Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation extending copyright protection to works of art that might also serve a useful purpose.  See <i>ibid.</i> (approving<i> </i>37 CFR \xc2\xa7202.8(a) (1949) (protect-ing \xe2\x80\x9cworks of artistic craftsmanship, in so far as theirform but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned\xe2\x80\x9d)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Court held that it was irrelevant to the copyright inquiry whether the statuette was initially created as a freestanding sculpture or as a lamp base.  347 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218\xe2\x80\x93219 (\xe2\x80\x9cNor do we think the subsequent registration of a work of art published as an element in a manufactured article, is a misuse of copyright.  This is not different from the registration of a statuette and its later embodiment in an industrial article\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Mazer</i> thus interpreted the 1909 Act consistently with the rule discussed above: If a design would have been copyrightable as a standalone pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, it is copyrightable if created first as part of a useful article.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Shortly thereafter, the Copyright Office enacted a regulation implementing the holdings of <i>Mazer</i>.  See 1 Nimmer \xc2\xa72A.08[B][1][b] (2016).  As amended, the regulation introduced the modern separability test to copyright law:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the sole intrinsic function of an article is its utility, the fact that the article is unique and attractively shaped will not qualify it as a work of art.  However, if the shape of a utilitarian article incorporates features, such as artistic sculpture, carving, or pictorial representation, which can be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art, such features will be eligible for registration.\xe2\x80\x9d  37 CFR \xc2\xa7202.10(c) (1960) (punctuation altered).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress essentially lifted the language governing protection for the design of a useful article directly from the post-<i>Mazer</i> regulations and placed it into \xc2\xa7101 of the 1976 Act.  Consistent with <i>Mazer</i>, the approach we outline today interprets \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101 and 113 in a way that would afford copyright protection to the statuette in <i>Mazer</i> regardless of whether it was first created as a standalone sculptural work or as the base of the lamp.  See 347 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218\xe2\x80\x93219.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, a feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright if, when identified and imagined apart from the useful article, it would qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work either on its own or when fixed in some other tangible medium.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying this test to the surface decorations on the cheerleading uniforms is straightforward.  First, one can identify the decorations as features having pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  Second, if the arrangement of colors, shapes, stripes, and chevrons on the surface of the cheerleading uniforms were separated from the uniform and applied in another medium\xe2\x80\x94for example, on a painter\xe2\x80\x99s canvas\xe2\x80\x94they would qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-dimensional .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. works of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. art,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101.  And imaginatively removing the surface decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium would not replicate the uniform itself.  Indeed, respondents have applied the designs in this case to other media of expression\xe2\x80\x94different types of clothing\xe2\x80\x94without replicating the uniform.  See App. 273\xe2\x80\x93279.  The decorations are therefore separable from the uniforms and eligible for copyright protection.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent argues that the designs are not separable because imaginatively removing them from the uniforms and placing them in some other medium of expression\xe2\x80\x94a canvas, for example\xe2\x80\x94would create \xe2\x80\x9cpictures of cheerleader uniforms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 10 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  Petitioner similarly argues that the decorations cannot be copyrighted because, even when extracted from the useful article,they retain the outline of a cheerleading uniform.  Brief for Petitioner 48\xe2\x80\x9349.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is not a bar to copyright.  Just as two-dimensional fine art corresponds to the shape of the canvas on which it is painted, two-dimensional applied art correlates to the contours of the article on which it is applied.  A fresco painted on a wall, ceiling panel, or dome would not lose copyright protection, for example, simply because it was designed to track the dimensions of the surface on which it was painted.  Or consider, for example, a design etched or painted on the surface of a guitar.  If that entire design is imaginatively removed from the guitar\xe2\x80\x99s surface and placed on an album cover, it would still resemble the shape of a guitar.  But the image on the cover does not \xe2\x80\x9creplicate\xe2\x80\x9d the guitar as a useful article.  Rather, the design is a two-dimensional work of art that corresponds to the shape of the useful article to which it was applied.  The statute protects that work of art whether it is first drawn on the album cover and then applied to the guitar\xe2\x80\x99s surface, or vice versa.  Failing to protect that art would create an anomaly: It would extend protection to two-dimensional designs that cover a part of a useful article but would not protect the same design if it covered the entire article.  The statute does not support that distinction, nor can it be reconciled with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cartwork printed on a t-shirt\xe2\x80\x9d could be protected.  <i>Post, </i>at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be clear, the only feature of the cheerleading uniform eligible for a copyright in this case is the two-dimensional work of art fixed in the tangible medium of the uniform fabric.  Even if respondents ultimately succeed in establishing a valid copyright in the surface decorations at issue here, respondents have no right to prohibit any person from manufacturing a cheerleading uniform of identical shape, cut, and dimensions to the ones on which the decorations in this case appear.  They may prohibit only the reproduction of the surface designs in any tangible medium of expression\xe2\x80\x94a uniform or otherwise.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner and the Government raise several objections to the approach we announce today.  None is meritorious.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner first argues that our reading of the statute is missing an important step.  It contends that a feature may exist independently only if it can stand alone as a copyrightable work <i>and </i>if the useful article from which it was extracted would remain equally useful.  In other words, copyright extends only to \xe2\x80\x9csolely artistic\xe2\x80\x9d features of useful articles.  Brief for Petitioner 33.  According to petitioner, if a feature of a useful article \xe2\x80\x9cadvance[s] the utility of the article,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 38, then it is categorically beyond the scope of copyright, <i>id.</i>, at 33.  The designs here are not protected, it argues, because they are necessary to two of the uniforms\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinherent, essential, or natural functions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94identifying the wearer as a cheerleader and enhancing the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s physical appearance.  <i>Id.</i>, at 38, 48; Reply Brief 2, 16.  Because the uniforms would not be equally useful without the designs, petitioner contends that the designs are inseparable from the \xe2\x80\x9cutilitarian aspects\xe2\x80\x9d of the uniform.  Brief for Petitioner 50.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government raises a similar argument, although it reaches a different result.  It suggests that the appropriate test is whether the useful article with the artistic feature removed would \xe2\x80\x9cremai[n] <i>similarly </i>useful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29 (emphasis added).  In the view of the United States, however, a plain white cheerleading uniform is \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly useful\xe2\x80\x9d to uniforms with respondents\xe2\x80\x99 designs.  <i>Id.,</i> at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The debate over the relative utility of a plain white cheerleading uniform is unnecessary.  The focus of the separability inquiry is on the extracted feature and not on any aspects of the useful article that remain after the imaginary extraction.  The statute does not require the decisionmaker to imagine a fully functioning useful article without the artistic feature.  Instead, it requires that the separated feature qualify as a nonuseful pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, because the removed feature may not be a useful article\xe2\x80\x94as it would then not qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work\xe2\x80\x94there necessarily would be some aspects of the original useful article \xe2\x80\x9cleft behind\xe2\x80\x9d if the feature were conceptually removed.  But the statute does not require the imagined remainder to be a fully functioning useful article at all, much less an equally useful one.  Indeed, such a requirement would deprive the <i>Mazer</i> statuette of protection had it been created first as a lamp base rather than as a statuette.  Without the base, the \xe2\x80\x9clamp\xe2\x80\x9d would be just a shade, bulb, and wires.  The statute does not require that we imagine a nonartistic replacement for the removed feature to determine whether that <i>feature</i> is capable of an independent existence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument follows from its flawed view that the statute protects only \xe2\x80\x9csolely artistic\xe2\x80\x9d features that have no effect whatsoever on a useful article\xe2\x80\x99s utilitarian function.  This view is inconsistent with the statutory text.  The statute expressly protects two- and three-dimensional \xe2\x80\x9capplied art.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  \xe2\x80\x9cApplied art\xe2\x80\x9d is art \xe2\x80\x9cemployed in the decoration, design, or execution of useful objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 105 (1976) (emphasis added), or \xe2\x80\x9cthose arts or crafts that have a <i>primarily utilitarian function</i>, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the designs and decorations used in these arts,\xe2\x80\x9d Random House Dictionary 73 (1966) (emphasis added); see also 1 OED 576 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \xe2\x80\x9capplied\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ut to practical use\xe2\x80\x9d).  An artistic feature that would be eligible for copyright protection on its own cannot lose that protection simply because it was first created as a feature of the design of a useful article, even if it makes that article more useful.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, this has been the rule since <i>Mazer</i>.  In holding that the statuette was protected, the Court emphasized that the 1909 Act abandoned any \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctions between purely aesthetic articles and useful works of art.\xe2\x80\x9d  347 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211.  Congress did not enact such a distinction in the 1976 Act.  Were we to accept petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the only protectable features are those that play absolutely no role in an article\xe2\x80\x99s function, we would effectively abrogate the rule of <i>Mazer</i> and read \xe2\x80\x9capplied art\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because we reject the view that a useful article must remain after the artistic feature has been imaginatively separated from the article, we necessarily abandon the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconceptual\xe2\x80\x9d separability, which some courts and commentators have adopted based on the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x931476, p. 55 (1976).  According to this view, a feature is <i>physically</i> separable from the underlying useful article if it can \xe2\x80\x9cbe physically separated from the article by ordinary means while leaving the utilitarian aspects of the article completely intact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compendium \xc2\xa7924.2(A); see also <i>Chosun Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc. </i>v.<i> Chrisha Creations</i>, <i>Ltd.</i>, 413 F. 3d 324, 329 (CA2 2005).  <i>Conceptual</i> separability applies if the feature physically could not be removed from the useful article by ordinary means.  See Compendium \xc2\xa7924.2(B); but see 1 P. Goldstein, Copyright \xc2\xa72.5.3, p. 2:77 (3d ed. 2016) (explaining that the lower courts have been unable to agree on a single conceptual separability test); 2 Patry \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73:140\xe2\x80\x933:144.40 (surveying the various approaches in the lower courts).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory text indicates that separability is a conceptual undertaking.  Because separability does not require the underlying useful article to remain, the physical-conceptual distinction is unnecessary.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner next argues that we should incorporate two \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d components, Reply Brief 9, into our test to provide guidance to the lower courts: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer\xe2\x80\x99s artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influence,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted), and (2) whether \xe2\x80\x9cthere is [a] substantial likelihood that the pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature would still be marketable to some significant segment of the community without its utilitarian function,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 35 (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reject this argument because neither consideration is grounded in the text of the statute.  The first would require the decisionmaker to consider evidence of the creator\xe2\x80\x99s design methods, purposes, and reasons.  <i>Id.,</i> at 48.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text makes clear, however, that our inquiry is limited to how the article and feature are perceived, not how or why they were designed.  See <i>Brandir Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</i> v. <i>Cascade Pacific Lumber Co.</i>, 834 F.\xc2\xa02d 1142, 1152 (CA2 1987) (Winter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (The statute \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly states that the legal test is how the final article is perceived, not how it was developed through various stages\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same is true of marketability.  Nothing in the statute suggests that copyrightability depends on market surveys.  Moreover, asking whether some segment of the market would be interested in a given work threatens to prize popular art over other forms, or to substitute judicial aesthetic preferences for the policy choices embodied in the Copyright Act.  See<i> Bleistein </i>v.<i> Donaldson Lithographing Co.</i>,\n\n188 U.\xc2\xa0S. 239,\n251 (1903)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, petitioner argues that allowing the surface decorations to qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cwork of authorship\xe2\x80\x9d is inconsistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to entirely exclude industrial design from copyright.  Petitioner notes that Congress refused to pass a provision that would have provided limited copyright protection for industrial designs, including clothing, when it enacted the 1976 Act, see <i>id.,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9311 (citing S. 22, Tit. II, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 122 Cong. Rec. 3856\xe2\x80\x933859 (1976)), and that it has enacted laws protecting designs for specific useful articles\xe2\x80\x94semiconductor chips and boat hulls, see 17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7901\xe2\x80\x93914, 1301\xe2\x80\x931332\xe2\x80\x94while declining to enact other industrial design statutes, Brief for Petitioner 29, 43.  From this history of failed legislation petitioner reasons that Congress intends to channel intellectual property claims for industrial design into design patents.  It therefore urges us to approach this question with a presumption against copyrightability.  <i>Id.,</i> at 27.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not share petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concern.  As an initial matter, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significance\xe2\x80\x9d in most circumstances.  <i>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</i> v. <i>LTV Corp.</i>,\n\n496 U. S. 633,\n650 (1990)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, we have long held that design patent and copyright are not mutually exclusive.  See <i>Mazer</i>, 347 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 217.<i> </i>Congress has provided for limited copyright protection for certain features of industrial design, and approaching the statute with presumptive hostility toward protection for industrial design would undermine Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice.

But what, we must ask, do the words \xe2\x80\x9cidentified separately\xe2\x80\x9d mean?  Just when is a design separate from the \xe2\x80\x9cutilitarian aspect of the [useful] article?\xe2\x80\x9d  The most direct, helpful aspect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion answers this question by stating:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cNor could someone claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium\xe2\x80\x94for example, a cardboard model of a car.

These words help explain the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that a copyrightable work of art must be \xe2\x80\x9cperceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 1, 17.  They help clarify the concept of separateness.  Cf. 1 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright \xc2\xa72A.08[A][1] (2016) (Nimmer) (describing courts\xe2\x80\x99 difficulty in applying that concept).  They are consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 own expressed intent.\n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101; H. R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x931476, pp.\xc2\xa055, 105 (1976) (H. R. Rep.).  And they reflect long held views of the Copyright Office.  See Compendium of U. S. Copyright Office Practices \xc2\xa7924.2(B) (3d ed. 2014), online at http://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium.pdf (as last visited Mar. 7, 2017) (Compendium).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider, for example, the explanation that the House Report for the Copyright Act of 1976 provides.  It says:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cUnless the shape of an automobile, airplane, ladies\xe2\x80\x99 dress, food processor, television set, or any other industrial product contains some element that, <i>physically or conceptually</i>, can be identified as separable from the utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be copyrighted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  H. R. Rep., at 55 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These words suggest two exercises, one physical, one mental.  Can the design features (the picture, the graphic, the sculpture) be physically removed from the article (and considered separately), all the while leaving the fully functioning utilitarian object in place?  If not, can one nonetheless conceive of the design features separately without replicating a picture of the utilitarian object?  If the answer to either of these questions is \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d then the design is eligible for copyright protection.  Otherwise, it is not.  The abstract nature of these questions makes them sound difficult to apply.  But with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s words in mind, the difficulty tends to disappear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An example will help.  Imagine a lamp with a circular marble base, a vertical 10-inch tall brass rod (containing wires) inserted off center on the base, a light bulb fixture emerging from the top of the brass rod, and a lampshade sitting on top.  In front of the brass rod a porcelain Siamese cat sits on the base facing outward.  Obviously, the Siamese cat is <i>physically separate</i> from the lamp, as it could be easily removed while leaving both cat and lamp intact.  And, assuming it otherwise qualifies, the designed cat is eligible for copyright protection.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Now suppose there is no long brass rod; instead the cat sits in the middle of the base and the wires run up through the cat to the bulbs.  The cat is not physically separate from the lamp, as the reality of the lamp\xe2\x80\x99s construction is such that an effort to physically separate the cat and lamp will destroy both cat and lamp.  The two are integrated into a single functional object, like the similar configuration of the ballet dancer statuettes that formed the lamp bases at issue in <i>Mazer</i> v. <i>Stein</i>,\n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 201 (1954)\n.  But we can easily imagine the cat on its own, as did Congress when conceptualizing the ballet dancer.  See H. R. Rep., at 55 (the statuette in <i>Mazer</i> was \xe2\x80\x9cincorporated into a product without losing its ability to exist independently as a work of art\xe2\x80\x9d).  In doing so, we do not create a mental picture of a lamp (or, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s words, a \xe2\x80\x9creplica\xe2\x80\x9d of the lamp), which is a useful article.  We simply perceive the cat separately, as a small cat figurine that could be a copyrightable design work standing alone that does not replicate the lamp.  Hence the cat is <i>conceptually separate</i> from the utilitarian article that is the lamp.  The pair of lamps pictured at Figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix to this opinion illustrate this principle.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Case law, particularly case law that Congress and the Copyright Office have considered, reflects the same approach.  Congress cited examples of copyrightable design works, including \xe2\x80\x9ca carving on the back of a chair\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca floral relief design on silver flatware.\xe2\x80\x9d  H. R. Rep., at 55.  Copyright Office guidance on copyrightable designs in useful articles include \xe2\x80\x9can engraving on a vase,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]rtwork printed on a t-shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a] colorful pattern decorating the surface of a shopping bag,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a] drawing on the surface of wallpaper,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[a] floral relief decorating the handle of a spoon.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compendium \xc2\xa7924.2(B).  Courts have found copyrightable matter in a plaster ballet dancer statuette encasing the lamp\xe2\x80\x99s electric cords and forming its base, see <i>Mazer</i>, <i>supra</i>, as well as carvings engraved onto furniture, see <i>Universal Furniture Int\xe2\x80\x99l</i>,<i> Inc.</i> v. <i>Collezione Europa USA, Inc.</i>, 618 F. 3d 417, 431\xe2\x80\x93435 (CA4 2010) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>), and designs on laminated floor tiles, see <i>Home Leg-end, LLC</i> v. <i>Mannington Mills, Inc.</i>, 784 F. 3d 1404, 1412\xe2\x80\x931413 (CA11 2015).  See generally Brief for Intellectual Property Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By way of contrast, Van Gogh\xe2\x80\x99s painting of a pair of old shoes, though beautifully executed and copyrightable as a painting, would not qualify for a shoe design copyright.  See Appendix, fig. 3, <i>infra</i>; 17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Courts have similarly denied copyright protection to objects that begin as three-dimensional designs, such as measuring spoons shaped like heart-tipped arrows, <i>Bonazoli</i> v. <i>R. S. V. P. Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</i>, 353 F. Supp. 2d 218, 226\xe2\x80\x93227 (RI 2005); candleholders shaped like sailboats, <i>Design Ideas, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Yankee Candle Co.,</i> 889 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1128 (CD Ill. 2012); and wire spokes on a wheel cover, <i>Norris Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>International Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp.</i>, 696 F. 2d 918, 922\xe2\x80\x93924 (CA11 1983).  None of these designs could qualify for copyright protection that would prevent others from selling spoons, candleholders, or wheel covers with the same design.  Why not?  Because in each case the design is not separable from the utilitarian aspects of the object to which it relates.  The designs cannot be physically separated because they themselves make up the shape of the spoon, candleholders, or wheel covers of which they are a part.  And spoons, candleholders, and wheel covers are useful objects, as are the old shoes depicted in Van Gogh\xe2\x80\x99s painting.  More importantly, one cannot easily imagine or otherwise conceptualize the design of the spoons or the candleholders or the shoes <i>without that picture, or image, or replica being a picture of spoons, or candleholders, or wheel covers, or shoes</i>.  The designs necessarily bring along the underlying utilitarian object.  Hence each design is not conceptually separable from the physical useful object.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that one could copyright the floral design on a soupspoon but one could not copyright the shape of the spoon itself, no matter how beautiful, artistic, or esthetically pleasing that shape might be: A picture of the shape of the spoon is also a picture of a spoon; the picture of a floral design is not.  See Compendium \xc2\xa7924.2(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To repeat: A separable design feature must be \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of existing independently\xe2\x80\x9d of the useful article as a separate artistic work that is not itself the useful article.  If the claimed feature could be extracted without replicating the useful article of which it is a part, and the result would be a copyrightable artistic work standing alone, then there is a separable design.  But if extracting the claimed features would necessarily bring along the underlying useful article, the design is not separable from the useful article.  In many or most cases, to decide whether a design or artistic feature of a useful article is conceptually separate from the article itself, it is enough to imagine the feature on its own and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHave I created a picture of a (useful part of a) useful article?\xe2\x80\x9d  If so, the design is not separable from the useful article.  If not, it is.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In referring to imagined pictures and the like, I am not speaking technically.  I am simply trying to explain an intuitive idea of what separation is about, as well as how I understand the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  So understood, the opinion puts design copyrights in their rightful place.  The law has long recognized that drawings or photographs of real world objects are copyrightable as drawings or photographs, but the copyright does not give protection against others making the underlying useful objects.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co.</i> v. <i>Sarony</i>,\n\n111 U.\xc2\xa0S. 53 (1884)\n.  That is why a copyright on Van Gogh\xe2\x80\x99s painting would prevent others from reproducing that painting, but it would not prevent others from reproducing and selling the comfortable old shoes that the painting depicts.  Indeed, the purpose of \xc2\xa7113(b) was to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, portraying a useful article as such, does not extend to the manufacture of the useful article itself.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  H. R. Rep., at 105.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To ask this kind of simple question\xe2\x80\x94does the design picture the useful article?\xe2\x80\x94will not provide an answer in every case, for there will be cases where it is difficult to say whether a picture of the design is, or is not, also a picture of the useful article.  But the question will avoid courts focusing primarily upon what I believe is an unhelpful feature of the inquiry, namely, whether the design can be imagined as a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo- or three-dimensional work of art.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 1, 17.  That is because virtually any industrial design can be thought of separately as a \xe2\x80\x9cwork of art\xe2\x80\x9d: Just imagine a frame surrounding the design, or its being placed in a gallery.  Consider Marcel Duchamp\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creadymades\xe2\x80\x9d series, the functional mass-produced objects he designated as art.  See Appendix, fig. 4, <i>infra</i>.  What is there in the world that, viewed through an esthetic lens, cannot be seen as a good, bad, or indifferent work of art?  What design features could not be imaginatively reproduced on a painter\xe2\x80\x99s canvas?  Indeed, great industrial design may well include design that is inseparable from the useful article\xe2\x80\x94where, as Frank Lloyd Wright put it, \xe2\x80\x9cform and function are one.\xe2\x80\x9d  F. Wright, An Autobiography 146 (1943) (reprint 2005).  Where they are one, the designer may be able to obtain 15 years of protection through a design patent.  35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7171, 173; see also McKenna &amp; Strandburg, Progress and Competition in Design, 17 Stan. Tech. L. Rev. 1, 48\xe2\x80\x9351 (2013).  But, if they are one, Congress did not intend a century or more of copyright protection.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The conceptual approach that I have described reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 answer to a problem that is primarily practical and economic.  Years ago Lord Macaulay drew attention to the problem when he described copyright in books as a \xe2\x80\x9ctax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers.\xe2\x80\x9d  56 Parl. Deb. (3d Ser.) (1841) 341, 350.  He called attention to the main benefit of copyright protection, which is to provide an incentive to produce copyrightable works and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 8.  But Macaulay also made clear that copyright protection imposes costs.  Those costs include the higher prices that can accompany the grant of a copyright monopoly.  They also can include (for those wishing to display, sell, or perform a design, film, work of art, or piece of music, for example) the costs of discovering whether there are previous copyrights, of contacting copyright holders, and of securing permission to copy.  <i>Eldred</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186\n\xe2\x80\x93252 (2003) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Sometimes, as Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison, costs can outweigh \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit even of limited monopolies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956) (Jefferson Letter).  And that is particularly true in light of the fact that Congress has extended the \xe2\x80\x9climited Times\xe2\x80\x9d of protection, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 8, from the \xe2\x80\x9c14 years\xe2\x80\x9d of Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s day to potentially more than a century today.  Jefferson Letter 443; see also <i>Eldred</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 246\xe2\x80\x93252 (opinion of Breyer, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Constitution grants Congress primary responsibility for assessing comparative costs and benefits and drawing copyright\xe2\x80\x99s statutory lines. Courts must respect those lines and not grant copyright protection where Congress has decided not to do so.  And it is clear that Congress has not extended broad copyright protection to the fashion design industry.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, 1 Nimmer \xc2\xa72A.08[H][3][c] (describing how Congress rejected proposals for fashion design protection within the 1976 Act and has rejected every proposed bill to this effect since then); <i>Esquire, Inc. </i>v. <i>Ringer</i>, 591 F.\xc2\xa02d 796, 800, n. 12 (CADC 1978) (observing that at the time of the 1976 Copyright Act, Congress had rejected every one of the approximately 70 design protection bills that had been introduced since 1914); <i>e.g.,</i> H. R. 5055, 109th Cong., 2d Sess.: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Amend title 17, United States Code, to provide protection for fashion design\xe2\x80\x9d (introduced Mar. 30, 2006; unenacted).  Congress has left \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. protection .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. largely unavailable for dress designs.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Nimmer \xc2\xa72A.08[H][3][a]; Raustiala &amp; Sprigman, The Piracy Paradox: Innovation and Intellec-tual Property in Fashion Design, 92 Va. L. Rev. 1687, 1698\xe2\x80\x931705 (2006).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to grant full copyright protection to the fashion industry has not left the industry without protection.  Patent design protection is available.  35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7171, 173.  A maker of clothing can obtain trademark protection under the Lanham Act for signature features of the clothing.\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71051 <i>et seq.</i>  And a designer who creates an original textile design can receive copyright protection for that pattern as placed, for example, on a bolt of cloth, or anything made with that cloth.  <i>E.g.</i>, Compendium \xc2\xa7924.3(A)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his [type of] claim .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is generally made by the fabric producer rather than the garment or costume designer,\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily made when the two-dimensional design is applied to the textile fabric and before the garment is cut from the fabric.\xe2\x80\x9d  56 Fed. Reg. 56531 (1991).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The fashion industry has thrived against this backdrop, and designers have contributed immeasurably to artistic and personal self-expression through clothing.  But a decision by this Court to grant protection to the design of a garment would grant the designer protection that Congress refused to provide.  It would risk increased prices and unforeseeable disruption in the clothing industry, which in the United States alone encompasses nearly $370 billion in annual spending and 1.8 million jobs.  Brief for Council of Fashion Designers of America, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3\xe2\x80\x934 (citing U.\xc2\xa0S. Congress, Joint Economic Committee, The New Economy of Fashion 1 (2016)).  That is why I believe it important to emphasize those parts of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that limit the scope of its interpretation.  That language, as I have said, makes clear that one may not \xe2\x80\x9cclaim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cwould not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">If we ask the \xe2\x80\x9cseparateness\xe2\x80\x9d question correctly, the answer here is not difficult to find.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, in its appendix, depicts the cheerleader dress designs that Varsity submitted to the Copyright Office.  Can the design features in Varsity\xe2\x80\x99s pictures exist separately from the utilitarian aspects of a dress?  Can we extract those features as copyrightable design works standing alone, without bringing along, via picture or design, the dresses of which they constitute a part?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider designs 074, 078, and 0815.  They certainly look like cheerleader uniforms.  That is to say, they look like pictures of cheerleader uniforms, just like Van Gogh\xe2\x80\x99s old shoes look like shoes.  I do not see how one could see them otherwise.  Designs 299A and 2999B present slightly closer questions.  They omit some of the dresslike context that the other designs possess.  But the necklines, the sleeves, and the cut of the skirt suggest that they too are pictures of dresses.  Looking at all five of Varsity\xe2\x80\x99s pictures, I do not see how one could conceptualize the design features in a way that does not picture, not just artistic designs, but dresses as well.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Were I to accept the majority\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to \xe2\x80\x9cimaginatively remov[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the chevrons and stripes <i>as they are arranged</i> on the neckline, waistline, sleeves, and skirt of each uniform, and apply them on a \xe2\x80\x9cpainter\xe2\x80\x99s canvas,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 10, that painting would be of a cheerleader\xe2\x80\x99s dress.  The esthetic elements on which Varsity seeks protection exist only as part of the uniform design\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing to separate out but for dress-shaped lines that replicate the cut and style of the uniforms.  Hence, each design is not physically separate, nor is it conceptually separate, from the useful article it depicts, namely, a cheerleader\xe2\x80\x99s dress.  They cannot be copyrighted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Varsity, of course, could have sought a design patent for its designs.  Or, it could have sought a copyright on a textile design, even one with a similar theme of chevrons and lines.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that is not the nature of Varsity\xe2\x80\x99s copyright claim.  It has instead claimed ownership of the particular \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98treatment and arrangement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the chevrons and lines of the design as they appear at the neckline, waist, skirt, sleeves, and overall cut of each uniform.  Brief for Respondents 50.  The majority imagines that Varsity submitted something different\xe2\x80\x94that is, only the surface decorations of chevrons and stripes, as in a textile design.  As the majority sees it, Varsity\xe2\x80\x99s copyright claim would be the same had it submitted a plain rectangular space depicting chevrons and stripes, like swaths from a bolt of fabric.  But considered on their own, the simple stripes are plainly unoriginal.  Varsity, then, seeks to do indirectly what it cannot do directly: bring along the design and cut of the dresses by seeking to protect surface decorations whose \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment and arrangement\xe2\x80\x9d are <i>coextensive with that design and cut</i>.  As Varsity would have it, it would prevent its competitors from making useful three-dimensional cheerleader uniforms by submitting plainly unoriginal chevrons and stripes as cut and arranged on a useful article.  But with that cut and arrangement, the resulting pictures on which Varsity seeks protection do not simply depict designs.  They depict clothing.  They depict the useful articles of which the designs are inextricable parts.  And Varsity cannot obtain copyright protection that would give them the power to prevent others from making those useful uniforms, any more than Van Gogh can copyright comfortable old shoes by painting their likeness.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I fear that, in looking past the three-dimensional design inherent in Varsity\xe2\x80\x99s claim by treating it as if it were no more than a design for a bolt of cloth, the majority has lost sight of its own important limiting principle.  One may not \xe2\x80\x9cclaim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium,\xe2\x80\x9d such as in a picture.  <i>Ante, </i>at 7.  That is to say, one cannot obtain a copyright that would give its holder \xe2\x80\x9cany rights in the useful article that inspired it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
