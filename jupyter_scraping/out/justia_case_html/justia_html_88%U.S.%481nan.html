There was no specific evidence to that point.  However, there were several complainants, and it was, of course, necessary to prove their heirship to Mrs. Kirchberg at the time of her death.

S. 486</a></p><p></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The first objection alleged against the deed which the complainants ask to have cancelled is, that it was made for the purpose of conveying a part of the homestead of the Kirchbergs, and, as such, was void because the wife did not join with the husband in its execution.</p>\n<p>It is admitted that the deed was good, if the lots described in it were not in fact a part of the homestead at the time of its execution.  It rests upon the complainants, therefore, to prove that they were.  To do this it must be made to appear that they were actually used, or manifestly intended to be used as part of the home of the family.  This has not been done.  The lots were purchased in 1850, but not occupied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 88 U. S. 487</a></p><p> until 1852.  Then a small building was erected upon one of them, and it was thereafter occupied in connection with the family residence.  This was after the deed was made, and, of course, cannot control its operation.  Mrs. Kirchberg, in a letter written to her sister in Pennsylvania, in June, 1850, says, "we have a lot on Main Street, in Austin, and will buy the adjoining one as a garden," but there is no proof that the intention of connecting this adjoining lot with the home was in any manner manifested in Austin until long after the deed in question was executed and delivered.  A secret intention of the seller, not made known, cannot affect a purchaser.  Unless the purchaser knew, or from the circumstances ought to have known, that the lots were a part of the homestead, he had the right to treat with and purchase from the husband without the concurrence of his wife.</p>\n<p>It is next alleged that the Kirchbergs occupied the premises adversely to the grantee for more than ten years after the execution of the deed, and that therefore the title under it has failed.</p>\n<p>The burden of proving this allegation also rests upon the complainants. It is shown that the occupation of the Kirchbergs was continuous, and probably adverse, from the time of the building of the kitchen upon lot 7 until the death of Mrs. Kirchberg.  The kitchen was built in the summer of 1852, and so far as appears from the testimony, the adverse occupation did not commence until then.  To create the bar, it must have continued until the summer of 1862.  Mrs. Kirchberg died in that year, but there is nothing to show at what time in the year.  It is several times stated in the bill that she died "on the ___ day of _____, 1862," and the answer, as many times, admits the statement in the same language.  No witness gives the exact date, but as several were examined by the complainants to show what relatives Mrs. Kirchberg had living in the spring of 1862, it is fair to presume that was the time of her death.  But however this may be, as the complainants have failed to prove that she </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 88 U. S. 488</a></p><p> did not die before the summer of that year, this part of their case fails.</p>\n<p>It is next insisted in the bill, but not in the argument, that the defendants are estopped from setting up the deed in question by reason of the trust deeds to Costa, executed afterwards by the Kirchbergs at the request of Wahrenberger, to secure the debt due to him, and that therefore it should be cancelled.</p>\n<p>This is in direct conflict with the uniform current of decisions in this Court, commencing with <em>Blight\'s Lessee v. Rochester,</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and ending with <em>Merryman v. Bourne.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>It is next urged in the argument that the deed was given as a mortgage to secure a debt which has been paid.</p>\n<p>There is no allegation in the bill to support this claim.  The recovery must be had upon the case made by the pleadings or not at all.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to consider the effect, under the laws of Texas, of the judgment in the action of trespass instituted by the complainants to try their title to the property.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> the whole subject presented in Paschall\'s Digest of Decisions, vol. 2, title "Homestead," \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 14,537, 14,538, 14,589-14,591; also in <em>The Homestead Cases,</em> 31 Tex. 684.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/20/535/case.html">20 U.
