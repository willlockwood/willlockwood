LARA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">UNITED STATES <em>v.</em> LARA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93107. Argued January 21, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 19, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">After respondent Lara, an Indian who is not a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe (Tribe), ignored the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s order excluding him from its reservation, he struck one of the federal officers arresting him.  He pleaded guilty in Tribal Court to the crime of violence to a policeman.  The Federal Government then charged him with the federal crime of assaulting a federal officer.  Lara claimed that, because key elements of that crime mirrored elements of his tribal crime, he was protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The Government countered that the Clause does not bar successive prosecutions by <em>separate sovereigns</em>, and that this \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine determined the outcome.  The Government noted that this Court has held that a tribe acts as a separate sovereign in prosecuting its own members, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wheeler,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/313/index.html">435 U. S. 313</a>, 318, 322\xe2\x80\x93323; that, after this Court ruled that a tribe lacks sovereign authority to prosecute nonmember Indians, see <em>Duro</em> v. <em>Reina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/676/index.html">495 U. S. 676</a>, 679, Congress specifically authorized such prosecutions; and that, because this statute enlarges the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 self-government powers to include \xe2\x80\x9cthe inherent power of Indian tribes \xe2\x80\xa6 to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2), the Tribe here had exercised its own tribal authority, not delegated federal authority.  Accepting this argument, the Magistrate Judge rejected Lara\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim.  The en banc Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine did not apply because the Tribal Court was exercising a federal prosecutorial power, and, thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second prosecution.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the Tribe acted in its capacity as a sovereign authority, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Federal Government from proceeding with the present prosecution for a discrete federal offense.

Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Section 1301(2) \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[s] and affirm[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in each tribe the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power\xe2\x80\x9d to prosecute nonmember Indians, and its legislative history confirms that such was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Thus, it seeks to adjust the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 status, relaxing restrictions, recognized in <em>Duro</em>, that the political branches had imposed on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of inherent prosecutorial power.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Several considerations lead to the conclusion that Congress has the constitutional power to lift these restrictions.  First, the Constitution, through the Indian Commerce and Treaty Clauses, grants Congress \xe2\x80\x9cplenary and exclusive\xe2\x80\x9d powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/index.html">439 U. S. 463</a>, 470\xe2\x80\x93471.  Second, Congress, with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval, has interpreted these plenary grants of power as authorizing it to enact legislation that both restricts tribal powers and, in turn, relaxes those restrictions.  Third, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 statutory goal\xe2\x80\x94to modify the degree of autonomy enjoyed by a dependent sovereign that is not a State\xe2\x80\x94is not an unusual legislative objective.  Fourth, Lara points to no explicit language in the Constitution suggesting a limitation on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 institutional authority to relax tribal sovereignty restrictions previously imposed by the political branches.  Fifth, the change at issue is limited, concerning a power similar to the power to prosecute a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s own members, which this Court has called inherent.  Sixth, concluding that Congress has the power to relax the restrictions imposed by the political branches on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inherent prosecutorial authority is consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier cases.  The holdings in <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>at 326; <em>Oliphant</em> v. <em>Suquamish Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/191/index.html">435 U. S. 191</a>, 209\xe2\x80\x93210; and <em>Duro, supra, </em>at 686, that the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 power to prosecute nonmembers was divested by treaties and Congress, reflected the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 retained sovereign status at the time of those decisions; but they did not set forth constitutional limits prohibiting Congress from taking actions to modify or adjust that status.  The Court there based its descriptions of inherent tribal authority on the sources as they existed at the time.  Congressional legislation was one such important source, but it is a source subject to change.  When <em>Duro, supra, </em>at 686, like other cases, referred to a statute that \xe2\x80\x9cdelegated\xe2\x80\x9d power to the tribes, it simply did not consider whether a statute could constitutionally achieve the same end by removing restrictions on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inherent authority.  Thus, none of those cases can be read to hold that the Constitution forbids Congress to change judicially made federal Indian law through an amendment to \xc2\xa71301(2).  <em>Wheeler, Oliphant, </em>and<em> Duro,</em> then, are not determinative because Congress has enacted a new statute, relaxing restrictions on the bounds of the inherent tribal authority the United States recognizes.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Lara\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments cannot help him win his double jeopardy claim.  This Court will not consider the merits of his due process claim that his prosecution was invalid because the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 does not guarantee counsel to an indigent criminal defendant.  Proving that claim does not show that the source of the tribal prosecution was federal power, something Lara must do to win his double jeopardy claim.  Like the due process claim, Lara\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9call Indians\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power \xe2\x80\xa6 to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians\xe2\x80\x9d violates the Equal Protection Clause is beside the point.  And Lara simply repeats these due process and equal protection arguments in a different form when he argues that the <em>Duro</em> Court found the absence of certain constitutional safeguards, such as an indigent defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel, an important reason for concluding that tribes lacked the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power\xe2\x80\x9d to try nonmember Indians.

Compare 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2) with <em>Duro</em> v. <em>Reina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/676/index.html">495 U. S. 676</a> (1990).  We must decide whether Congress has the constitutional power to relax restrictions that the political branches have, over time, placed on the exercise of a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s inherent legal authority.  We conclude that Congress does possess this power.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Billy Jo Lara is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in north-central North Dakota.  He married a member of a different tribe, the Spirit Lake Tribe, and lived with his wife and children on the Spirit Lake Reservation, also located in North Dakota.  See Brief for Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota et\xc2\xa0al. as  <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x935.  After several incidents of serious misconduct, the Spirit Lake Tribe issued an order excluding him from the reservation.  Lara ignored the order; federal officers stopped him; and he struck one of the arresting officers.  324 F.\xc2\xa03d 635, 636 (CA8 2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Spirit Lake Tribe subsequently prosecuted Lara in the Spirit Lake Tribal Court for \xe2\x80\x9cviolence to a policeman.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Lara pleaded guilty and, in respect to that crime, served 90 days in jail.  See <em>ibid.;</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Lara\xe2\x80\x99s tribal conviction, the Federal Government charged Lara in the Federal District Court for the District of North Dakota with the federal crime of assaulting a federal officer.  324 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 636; 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7111(a)(1).  Key elements of this federal crime mirror elements of the tribal crime of \xe2\x80\x9cviolence to a policeman.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for United States 7.  And this similarity between the two crimes would <em>ordinarily</em> have brought Lara within the protective reach of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (the Government may not \xe2\x80\x9csubject\xe2\x80\x9d any person \xe2\x80\x9cfor the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\xe2\x80\x9d); 324 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 636.  But the Government, responding to Lara\xe2\x80\x99s claim of double jeopardy, pointed out that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar successive prosecutions brought by <em>separate sovereigns</em>, and it argued that this \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine determined the outcome here.  See <em>Heath</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/82/index.html">474 U. S. 82</a>, 88 (1985) (the Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law conception of crime as an offense against the sovereignty of the government\xe2\x80\x9d; when \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant in a single act violates the \xe2\x80\x98peace and dignity\xe2\x80\x99 of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct \xe2\x80\x98offenses\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government noted that this Court has held that an Indian tribe acts as a separate sovereign when it prosecutes its <em>own members</em>.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wheeler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/313/index.html">435 U. S. 313</a>, 318, 322\xe2\x80\x93323 (1978) (a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<em>sovereign</em> power to punish <em>tribal</em> offenders,\xe2\x80\x9d while subject to congressional \xe2\x80\x9cdefeasance,\xe2\x80\x9d remains among those \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inherent powers of a limited sovereignty which has never been extinguished\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added and deleted)).  The Government recognized, of course, that Lara is not one of the Spirit Lake Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s <em>own</em> members; it also recognized that, in <em>Duro</em> v. <em>Reina</em>, <em>supra</em>, this Court had held that a tribe no longer possessed<em> inherent or sovereign authority </em>to prosecute a \xe2\x80\x9cnonmember Indian.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 679.  But it pointed out that, soon after this Court decided <em>Duro</em>, Congress enacted new legislation specifically authorizing a tribe to prosecute Indian members of a different tribe.  See Act of Nov. 5, 1990, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78077(b)\xe2\x80\x93(d), 104 Stat. 1892\xe2\x80\x931893 (temporary legislation until September 30, 1991); Act of Oct. 28, 1991, 105 Stat. 646 (permanent legislation).  That new statute, in permitting a tribe to bring certain tribal prosecutions against nonmember Indians, does not purport to delegate the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s own<em> federal</em> power.\xc2\xa0  Rather, it enlarges the <em>tribes\xe2\x80\x99 </em>own \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98powers of self-government\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cthe inherent power of Indian tribes, hereby recognized and affirmed, to exercise criminal jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d including nonmembers.  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, given this statute, the Tribe, in prosecuting Lara, had exercised its own inherent <em>tribal </em>authority, not delegated <em>federal</em> authority; hence the \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine applies, <em>Heath, supra</em>, at 88; and since the two prosecutions were brought by two different sovereigns, the second, federal, prosecution does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Magistrate Judge accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument and rejected Lara\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim.  324 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 636\xe2\x80\x93637.  An Eighth Circuit panel agreed with the Magistrate Judge.  294 F.\xc2\xa03d 1004 (2002).  But the en banc Court of Appeals, by a vote of 7 to 4, reached a different conclusion.  324 F.\xc2\xa03d 635 (2003).  It held the Tribal Court, in prosecuting Lara, was exercising a <em>federal</em> prosecutorial power; hence the \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine does not apply; and the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the second prosecution.  <em>Id.</em>, at 640.  The four dissenting judges, agreeing with the Federal Government, concluded that the Tribal Court had exercised <em>inherent tribal</em> power in prosecuting Lara; hence the \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine applies and allows the second, federal, prosecution.  <em>Id.</em>, at 641 (opinion of Arnold, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Eighth Circuit and Ninth Circuit have reached different conclusions about the new statute, we granted certiorari.   Compare <em>United States</em> v. <em>Enas</em>, 255 F.\xc2\xa03d 662 (CA9 2001) (en banc), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/1115/index.html">534 U. S. 1115</a> (2002).  We now reverse the Eighth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We assume, as do the parties, that Lara\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim turns on the answer to the \xe2\x80\x9cdual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d question.  What is \xe2\x80\x9cthe source of [the] power to punish\xe2\x80\x9d nonmember Indian offenders, \xe2\x80\x9cinherent <em>tribal</em> sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d or delegated <em>federal</em> authority?  See <em>Wheeler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 322 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also believe that Congress intended the former answer.  The statute says that it \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[s] and affirm[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in each tribe the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>inherent\xe2\x80\x9d tribal</em> power (not delegated federal power) to prosecute nonmember Indians for misdemeanors.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3; Appendix, <em>infra</em> (emphasis added).<font b="1">  And the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history confirms that such was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x93261, pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Committee of the Conference notes that . . . this legislation is not a delegation of this jurisdiction but a clarification of the status of tribes as domestic dependent nations\xe2\x80\x9d); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9361, p. 7 (1991); see also S. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x93168, p.\xc2\xa04 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[ing] and reaffirm[ing] the inherent authority of tribal governments to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians\xe2\x80\x9d); 137 Cong. Rec. 9446 (1991) (statement of Sen. Inouye) (the \xe2\x80\x9cpremise [of the legislation] is that the Congress affirms the <em>inherent</em> jurisdiction of tribal governments over nonmember Indians\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>id.</em>, at 10712\xe2\x80\x9310714 (statement of Rep. Miller, House manager of the bill) (the statute \xe2\x80\x9cis not a delegation of authority but an affirmation that tribes retain all rights not expressly taken away\xe2\x80\x9d and the bill \xe2\x80\x9crecognizes an inherent tribal right which always existed\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 10713 (statement of Rep.

It relaxes the restrictions, recognized in <em>Duro</em>, that the political branches had imposed on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of inherent prosecutorial power.  The question before us is whether the Constitution authorizes Congress to do so.   Several considerations lead us to the conclusion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to lift the restrictions on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians as the statute seeks to do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Constitution grants Congress broad general powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes, powers that we have consistently described as \xe2\x80\x9cplenary and exclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/index.html">439 U.

From the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s beginning Congress\xe2\x80\x99 need for such legislative power would have seemed obvious.  After all, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Indian policies, applicable to numerous tribes with diverse cultures, affecting billions of acres of land, of necessity would fluctuate dramatically as the needs of the Nation and those of the tribes changed over time.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Cohen 48.  And Congress has in fact authorized at different times very different Indian policies (some with beneficial results but many with tragic consequences).  Congressional policy, for example, initially favored \xe2\x80\x9cIndian removal,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cassimilation\xe2\x80\x9d and the break-up of tribal lands, then protection of the tribal land base (interrupted by a movement toward greater state involvement and \xe2\x80\x9ctermination\xe2\x80\x9d of recognized tribes); and it now seeks greater tribal autonomy within the framework of a \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment-to-government relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with federal agencies.  59 Fed. Reg. 22951 (1994); see also 19 Weekly Comp. of Pres.

See generally, Cohen 78\xe2\x80\x93202 (describing this history); Canby 13\xe2\x80\x9332 (same).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such major policy changes inevitably involve major changes in the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty.  The 1871 statute, for example, changed the status of an Indian tribe from a \xe2\x80\x9cpowe[r] . . . capable of making treaties\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cpower with whom the United States may [not] contract by treaty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare <em>Worcester</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 559, with 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa771.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can readily find examples in congressional decisions to recognize, or to terminate, the existence of individual tribes.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Holliday</em>, 3 Wall. 407, 419 (1866) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf by [the political branches] those Indians are recognized as a tribe, this court must do the same\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Menominee Tribe</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/404/index.html">391 U. S. 404</a> (1968) (examining the rights of Menominee Indians following the termination of their Tribe).  Indeed, Congress has restored previously extinguished tribal status\xe2\x80\x94by re-recognizing  a Tribe whose tribal existence it previously had terminated.  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7903\xe2\x80\x93903f (restoring the Menominee Tribe); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Long</em>, 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 475 (CA7) (upholding against double jeopardy challenge successive prosecutions by the restored Menominee Tribe and the Federal Government), cert. denied, 540 U.

Congress has also granted tribes greater autonomy in their inherent law enforcement authority (in respect to tribal members) by increasing the maximum criminal penalties tribal courts may impose.  \xc2\xa74217, 100 Stat. 3207\xe2\x80\x93146, codified at 25 U.

The political branches, drawing upon analogous constitutional authority, have made adjustments to the autonomous status of other such dependent entities\xe2\x80\x94sometimes making far more radical adjustments than those at issue here. See, <em>e.g.</em>, Hawaii\xe2\x80\x94<em>Hawaii</em> v. <em>Mankichi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/190/197/index.html">190 U.

But cf. Part III, <em>infra.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the change at issue here is a limited one. It concerns a power similar in some respects<font b="1"> to the power to prosecute a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s own members\xe2\x80\x94a power that this Court has called \xe2\x80\x9cinherent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wheeler</em>, 435 U. S., at 322\xe2\x80\x93323.  In large part it concerns a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s authority to control events that occur upon the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s own land.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mazurie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/544/index.html">419 U. S. 544</a>, 557 (1975) (\xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and <em>their territory</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x93168, at 21.  And the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 possession of this additional criminal jurisdiction is consistent with our traditional understanding of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 status as \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic dependent nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Cherokee Nation</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831); see also <em>id.</em>, at 16 (describing tribe as \xe2\x80\x9ca distinct political society, separated from others, capable of managing its own affairs and governing itself\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consequently, we are not now faced with a question dealing with potential constitutional limits on congressional efforts to legislate far more radical changes in tribal status.  In particular, this case involves no interference with the power or authority of any State.  Nor do we now consider the question whether the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses prohibit tribes from prosecuting a nonmember citizen of the United States.  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sixth, our conclusion that Congress has the power to relax the restrictions imposed by the political branches on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inherent prosecutorial authority is consistent with our earlier cases.  True, the Court held in those cases that the power to prosecute nonmembers was an aspect of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 external relations and hence<em> </em>part of the tribal sovereignty that was divested by treaties and by Congress.  <em>Wheeler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 326; <em>Oliphant</em> v. <em>Suquamish Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/191/index.html">435 U. S. 191</a>, 209\xe2\x80\x93210 (1978); <em>Duro</em>, 495 U. S., at 686.  But these holdings reflect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 retained sovereign status <em>as of the time</em> the Court made them.  They did not set forth constitutional limits that prohibit Congress from changing the relevant legal circumstances, <em>i.e.</em>, from taking actions that modify or adjust the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 status.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the contrary, <em>Oliphant </em>and <em>Duro </em>make clear that the Constitution does not dictate the metes and bounds of tribal autonomy, nor do they suggest that the Court should second-guess the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 own determinations.  In <em>Oliphant</em>, the Court rested its conclusion about inherent tribal authority to prosecute tribe members in large part upon \xe2\x80\x9cthe commonly shared presumption of Congress, the Executive Branch, and lower federal courts,\xe2\x80\x9d a presumption which, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile not conclusive \xe2\x80\xa6 [,] carries considerable weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U. S., at 206.  The Court pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Indian law\xe2\x80\x99 draws principally upon the treaties drawn and executed by the Executive Branch and <em>legislation passed by Congress.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  It added that those \xe2\x80\x9cinstruments, . . . form the backdrop for the intricate web of <em>judicially made</em> Indian law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in <em>Duro</em>, the Court drew upon a host of different sources in order to reach its conclusion that a tribe does not possess the inherent power to prosecute a nonmember.  The Court referred to historic practices, the views of experts, the experience of forerunners of modern tribal courts, and the published opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior.  495 U. S., at 689\xe2\x80\x93692.  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/353/index.html">533 U. S. 353</a>, 361, n.\xc2\xa04 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur holding in <em>Worcester</em> must be considered in light of \xe2\x80\xa6 the 1828 treaty\xe2\x80\x9d (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted)); <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Bourland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/679/index.html">508 U. S. 679</a>, 695 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cHaving concluded that Congress clearly abrogated the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing regulatory control over non-Indian hunting and fishing, we find no evidence <em>in the relevant treaties or statutes</em> that Congress intended to allow the Tribes to assert regulatory jurisdiction over these lands pursuant to <em>inherent sovereignty</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>National Farmers Union Ins. Cos.</em> v. <em>Crow Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/index.html">471 U. S. 845</a>, 855\xe2\x80\x93856 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he existence and extent of a tribal court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction will require <em>[inter alia]</em> a detailed study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kagama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/118/375/index.html">118 U. S. 375</a>, 383 (1886) (characterizing<em> Ex parte Crow Dog</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/109/556/index.html">109 U. S. 556</a>, 570 (1883) as resting on extant treaties and statutes and recognizing congressional overruling of <em>Crow Dog</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the Court in these cases based its descriptions of inherent tribal authority upon the sources as they existed at the time the Court issued its decisions.  Congressional legislation constituted one such important source.  And that source was subject to change.  Indeed <em>Duro</em> itself anticipated change by inviting interested parties to \xe2\x80\x9caddress the problem [to] Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U. S., at 698.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We concede that <em>Duro</em>,<em> </em>like several other cases,<em> </em>referred only to the need to obtain a congressional statute that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cdelegated\xe2\x80\x9d</em> power to the tribes.  See <em>id.,</em> at 686; <em>Bourland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 695, n.\xc2\xa015; <em>Montana</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/index.html">450 U. S. 544</a>, 564 (1981); <em>Mazurie</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 556\xe2\x80\x93557.  But in so stating, <em>Duro</em> (like the other cases) simply did not consider whether a statute, like the present one, could constitutionally achieve the same end by removing restrictions on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inherent authority.  Consequently we do not read any of these cases as holding that the Constitution forbids Congress to change \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially made\xe2\x80\x9d federal Indian law through this kind of legislation.  <em>Oliphant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 206; cf. <em>County of Oneida</em> v. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/226/index.html">470 U.

And that fact makes all the difference.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lara makes several additional arguments.  First, he points out that the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 77, lacks certain constitutional protections for criminal defendants, in particular the right of an indigent defendant to counsel.  See 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71302.  And he argues that the Due Process Clause forbids Congress to permit a tribe to prosecute a nonmember Indian citizen of the United States in a forum that lacks this protection.  See <em>Argersinger</em> v. <em>Hamlin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/index.html">407 U. S. 25</a> (1972) (Constitution guarantees indigents counsel where imprisonment possible).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lara\xe2\x80\x99s due process argument, however, suffers from a critical structural defect.  To explain the defect, we contrast this argument with Lara\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clack of constitutional power\xe2\x80\x9d argument discussed in Part II, <em>supra</em>.  Insofar as that \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional power\xe2\x80\x9d argument might help Lara win his double jeopardy claim, it must proceed in four steps:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Step One:</em> Congress does not possess the constitutional power to enact a statute that modifies tribal power by \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[ing] and affirm[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinherent\xe2\x80\x9d authority to prosecute nonmember Indians.  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Step Two: </em>Consequently, the word \xe2\x80\x9cinherent\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power\xe2\x80\x9d is void.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Step Three: </em>The word \xe2\x80\x9cinherent\xe2\x80\x9d is severable from the rest of the statute (as are related words).  The remainder of the statute is valid without those words, but it then delegates <em>federal </em>power to the tribe to conduct the prosecution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Step Four: </em>Consequently, the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution of Lara was federal.  The current, second, prosecution is also federal.  Hence Lara wins his Double Jeopardy Clause claim, the subject of the present proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Eighth Circuit accepted this argument, 324 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 640, we reject Step One of the argument, Part II, <em>supra</em>.  That rejection, without more, invalidates the argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lara\xe2\x80\x99s due process argument, however, is significantly different.  That argument (if valid) would show that <em>any</em> prosecution of a nonmember Indian under the statute is invalid; so Lara\xe2\x80\x99s tribal prosecution would be invalid, too.  Showing Lara\xe2\x80\x99s tribal prosecution was invalid, however, does not show that the <em>source</em> of that tribal prosecution was <em>federal power</em> (showing that a state prosecution  violated the Due Process Clause does not make that prosecution <em>federal</em>).  But without that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal power\xe2\x80\x9d showing, Lara cannot win his double jeopardy claim here.  Hence, we need not, and we shall not, consider the merits of Lara\xe2\x80\x99s due process claim.  Other defendants in tribal proceedings remain free to raise that claim should they wish to do so.  See 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71303 (vesting district courts with jurisdiction over habeas writs from tribal courts).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Lara argues that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the words \xe2\x80\x9call Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power . . . to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d violates the Equal Protection Clause.  He says that insofar as the words include nonmember Indians within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope (while excluding all non-Indians) the statute is race-based and without justification.  Like the due process argument, however, this equal protection argument is simply beside the point, therefore we do not address it.  At best for Lara, the argument (if valid) would show, not that Lara\xe2\x80\x99s first conviction was federal, but that it was constitutionally defective.  And that showing cannot help Lara win his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, Lara points out that the <em>Duro</em> Court found the absence of certain constitutional safeguards, for example, the guarantee of an indigent\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel, as an important reason for concluding that tribes lacked the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power\xe2\x80\x9d to try a \xe2\x80\x9cgroup of citizens\xe2\x80\x9d (namely nonmember Indians) who were not \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[d]\xe2\x80\x9d in those \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U. S., at 693\xe2\x80\x93694.  In fact, <em>Duro</em> says the following: \xe2\x80\x9cWe hesitate<em> </em>to adopt a view of tribal sovereignty that would single out another group of citizens, nonmember Indians, for trial by political bodies that do not include them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 693.  But this argument simply repeats the due process and equal protection arguments rejected above in a somewhat different form.  Since precisely the same problem would exist were we to treat the congressional statute as delegating <em>federal </em>power, this argument helps Lara no more than the others.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we hold, with the reservations set forth in Part III, <em>supra</em>, that the Constitution authorizes Congress to permit tribes, as an exercise of their inherent tribal authority, to prosecute nonmember Indians.  We hold that Congress exercised that authority in writing this statute.  That being so, the Spirit Lake Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution of Lara did not amount to an exercise of federal power, and the Tribe acted in its capacity of a separate sovereign.  Consequently, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Federal Government from proceeding with the present prosecution for a discrete <em>federal</em> offense.  <em>Heath</em>, 474 U.

The inherent sovereignty of the Indian tribes has a historical basis that merits special mention.  They governed territory on this continent long before Columbus arrived.  In contrast, most of the States were never actually independent sovereigns, and those that were enjoyed that independent status for only a few years.  Given the fact that Congress can authorize the States to exercise\xe2\x80\x94as <em>their own</em>\xe2\x80\x94inherent powers that the Constitution has otherwise placed off limits, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Prudential Ins.

It seems to me that much of the confusion reflected in our precedent arises from two largely incompatible and doubtful assumptions.  First, Congress (rather than some other part of the Federal Government) can regulate virtually every aspect of the tribes without rendering tribal sovereignty a nullity.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wheeler,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/313/index.html">435 U. S. 313</a>, 319 (1978).  Second, the Indian tribes retain inherent sovereignty to enforce their criminal laws against their own members.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 326.  These assumptions, which I must accept as the case comes to us, dictate the outcome in this case, and I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I write separately principally because the Court fails to confront these tensions, a result that flows from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate constitutional analysis.  I cannot agree with the Court, for instance, that the Constitution grants to Congress plenary power to calibrate the \xe2\x80\x9cmetes and bounds of tribal sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8; see also <em>ante, </em>at 15 (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution authorizes Congress\xe2\x80\x9d to regulate tribal sovereignty).  Unlike the Court, <em>ante, </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x93\n6, I cannot locate such congressional authority in the Treaty Clause, U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02, or the Indian Commerce Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.  Additionally, I would ascribe much more significance to legislation such as the Act of Mar. 3, 1871, Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa72079, 16 Stat. 566, codified at 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa771, that purports to terminate the practice of dealing with Indian tribes by treaty.  The making of treaties, after all, is the one mechanism that the Constitution clearly provides for the Federal Government to interact with sovereigns other than the States.  Yet, if I accept that Congress does have this authority, I believe that\nthe result in <em>Wheeler</em> is questionable.  In my view, the tribes either are or are not separate sovereigns, and our federal Indian law cases untenably hold both positions simultaneously.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Duro</em> v. <em>Reina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/676/index.html"></a><a href="/us/495/676/index.html">495 U. S. 676</a> (1990) (holding that the tribes lack inherent authority to prosecute nonmember Indians), Congress amended the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA).  Specifically, through this \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Duro</em> fix,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress amended ICRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpowers of self-government\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[e] and affir[m]\xe2\x80\x9d the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power \xe2\x80\xa6 to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2).  There is quite simply no way to interpret a recognition and affirmation of inherent power as a delegation of federal power, as the Court explains.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Delegated power is the very antithesis of inherent power.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if the statute were less clear, I would not interpret it as a delegation of federal power.  The power to bring federal prosecutions, which is part of the putative delegated power, is manifestly and quintessentially executive power.  <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>Olson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/654/index.html">487 U. S. 654</a>, 691 (1988); <em>id.,</em> at 705 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Congress cannot transfer federal executive power to individuals who are beyond \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful Presidential control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a>, 922\xe2\x80\x93923 (1997).  And this means that, at a minimum, the President must have some measure of \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to appoint and remove\xe2\x80\x9d those exercising that power.  <em>Id.,</em> at 922; see also <em>Morrison</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 706\xe2\x80\x93715 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not appear that the President has any control over tribal officials, let alone a substantial measure of the appointment and removal power.  Cf. Brief for National Congress of American Indians as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>27\xe2\x80\x9329.  Thus, at least until we are prepared to recognize absolutely independent agencies entirely outside of the Executive Branch with the power to bind the Executive Branch (for a tribal prosecution would then bar a subsequent federal prosecution), the tribes cannot be analogized to administrative agencies, as the dissent suggests, <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Souter, J.).  That is, reading the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Duro</em> fix\xe2\x80\x9d as a delegation of federal power (without also divining some adequate method of Presidential control) would create grave constitutional difficulties.  Cf. <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 299\xe2\x80\x93300 (2001); <em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html">531 U. S. 159</a>, 173 (2001).  Accordingly, the Court has only two options: Either the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Duro</em> fix\xe2\x80\x9d changed the result in <em>Duro</em> or it did nothing at all.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Wheeler,</em> 435 U. S., at 322\xe2\x80\x93323, the Court explained that, prior to colonization, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tribes were self-governing sovereign political communities.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court acknowledged, however, that, after \xe2\x80\x9c[t]heir incorporation within the territory of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the tribes could exercise their inherent sovereignty only as consistent with federal policy embodied in treaties, statutes, and Executive Orders.  <em>Id.,</em> at 323; see also <em>id.,</em> at 327\xe2\x80\x93328.  Examining these sources for potential conflict, the Court concluded that the tribes retained the ability to exercise their inherent sovereignty to punish their own members.  <em>Id.,</em> at 323\xe2\x80\x93330.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Wheeler</em> seems to be a sensible example of federal common lawmaking, I am not convinced that it was correctly decided.  To be sure, it makes sense to conceptualize the tribes as sovereigns that, due to their unique situation, cannot exercise the full measure of their sovereign powers.  <em>Wheeler</em>, at times, seems to analyze the problem in just this way.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 323\xe2\x80\x93326; <em>id.,</em> at 323 (relying on <em>Oliphant</em> v. <em>Suquamish Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/191/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/191/index.html">435 U. S. 191</a> (1978), discussed <em>infra</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I do not see how this is consistent with the apparently \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed fact that Congress has plenary authority to legislate for the Indian tribes in all matters, including their form of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U. S., at 319.  The sovereign is, by definition, the entity \xe2\x80\x9cin which independent and supreme authority is vested.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1395 (6th ed. 1990).  It is quite arguably the essence of sovereignty not to exist merely at the whim of an external government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, federal policy itself could be thought to be inconsistent with this residual-sovereignty theory.  In 1871, Congress enacted a statute that purported to prohibit entering into treaties with the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian nation[s] or tribe[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  16 Stat. 566, codified at 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa771.  Although this Act is constitutionally suspect (the Constitution vests in the President both the power to make treaties, Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02, and to recognize foreign governments, Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73; see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Pink,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/203/index.html">315 U. S. 203</a>, 228\xe2\x80\x93230 (1942)), it nevertheless reflects the view of the political branches that the tribes had become a purely domestic matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, this does not quite suffice to demonstrate that the tribes had lost their sovereignty.  After all, States retain sovereignty despite the fact that Congress can regulate States <em>qua</em> States in certain limited circumstances.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Katzenbach</em> v. <em>Morgan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/641/index.html">384 U. S. 641</a> (1966); cf. <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a>, 160\xe2\x80\x93\n161 (1992); <em>Garcia</em> v. <em>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/index.html">469 U. S. 528</a> (1985).  But the States (unlike the tribes) are part of a constitutional framework that allocates sovereignty between the State and Federal Governments and specifically grants Congress authority to legislate with respect to them, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa75.  And even so, we have explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New York</em>, 505 U. S., at 166; <em>id.,</em> at 162\xe2\x80\x93166; see also <em>Printz,</em> 521 U. S., at 910\xe2\x80\x93915.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The tribes, by contrast, are not part of this constitutional order, and their sovereignty is not guaranteed by it.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Y]et it may well be doubted whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States can, with strict accuracy, be denominated foreign nations.  They may, more correctly, perhaps, be denominated domestic dependent nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cherokee Nation</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> 5 Pet. 1, 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (1831).</p>\n<p align="left">\nChief Justice Marshall further described the tribes as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent political communities, retaining their original natural rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and specifically noted that the tribes possessed the power to \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] treaties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Worcester</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> 6 Pet. 515, 559 (1832).  Although the tribes never fit comfortably within the category of foreign nations, the 1871 Act tends to show that the political branches no longer considered the tribes to be anything like foreign nations.  And it is at least arguable that the United States no longer considered the tribes to be sovereigns.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Federal Indian policy is, to say the least, schizophrenic.  And this confusion continues to infuse federal Indian law and our cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, if I accept <em>Wheeler</em>, I also must accept that the tribes do retain inherent sovereignty (at least to enforce their criminal laws against their own members) and the logical consequences of this fact.  In <em>Heath</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/82/index.html">474 U. S. 82</a>, 88 (1985), the Court elaborated the dual sovereignty doctrine and explained that a single act that violates the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98peace and dignity\xe2\x80\x99 of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each,\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes two separate offenses.  This, of course, is the reason that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns.  But whether an act violates the \xe2\x80\x9cpeace and dignity\xe2\x80\x9d of a sovereign depends not in the least on whether the perpetrator is a member (in the case of the tribes) or a citizen (in the case of the States and the Nation) of the sovereign.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Heath</em> also instructs, relying on <em>Wheeler</em>, that the separate-sovereign inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cturns on whether the two entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heath</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 88.  But <em>Wheeler</em> makes clear that the tribes and the Federal Government do draw their authority to punish from distinct sources and that they are separate sovereigns.  Otherwise, the subsequent federal prosecution in <em>Wheeler</em> would have violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  It follows from our case law that Indian tribes possess inherent sovereignty to punish <em>anyone</em> who violates their laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Duro</em> v. <em>Reina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/676/index.html"></a><a href="/us/495/676/index.html">495 U. S. 676</a> (1990), the Court held that the Indian tribes could no longer enforce their criminal laws against nonmember Indians.  Despite the obvious tension, <em>Duro</em> and <em>Wheeler</em> are not necessarily inconsistent.  Although <em>Wheeler</em> and <em>Heath</em>, taken together, necessarily imply that the tribes retain inherent sovereignty to try anyone who violates their criminal laws, <em>Wheeler</em> and <em>Duro</em> make clear that conflict with federal policy can operate to prohibit the exercise of this sovereignty.  <em>Duro</em>, then, is not a case about \xe2\x80\x9cinherent sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d (a term that we have used too imprecisely); rather, it is a case about whether a specific exercise of tribal sovereignty conflicts with federal policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Court in <em>Duro</em> relied primarily on <em>Oliphant</em> v. <em>Suquamish Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/191/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/191/index.html">435 U. S. 191</a> (1978), which held that tribes could not enforce their criminal laws against non-Indians.  In reaching that conclusion, the Court in <em>Oliphant</em> carefully examined the views of Congress and the Executive Branch.  <em>Id.,</em> at 197\xe2\x80\x93206 (discussing treaties, statutes, and views of the Executive Branch); <em>id.,</em> at 199 (discussing Attorney General opinions, including 2 Op. Atty. Gen. 693 (1834) (concluding that tribal exercise of criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians was inconsistent with various treaties)).  <em>Duro</em> at least rehearsed the same analysis.  495 U. S., at 688\xe2\x80\x93692.  Thus, although <em>Duro</em> is sprinkled with references to various constitutional concerns, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 693\xe2\x80\x93694, <em>Duro</em>, <em>Oliphant</em>, and <em>Wheeler</em> are classic federal-common-law decisions.  See also <em>County of Oneida</em> v. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/226/index.html">470 U. S. 226</a>, 233\xe2\x80\x93236 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I acknowledge that our cases have distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9ctribal power [that] is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations\xe2\x80\x9d and tribal power as it relates to the external world.  <em>Montana</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/index.html">450 U. S. 544</a>, 564 (1981); see also <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>Hicks, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/353/index.html">533 U. S. 353</a>, 358\xe2\x80\x93359 (2001); <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Bourland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/679/index.html">508 U. S. 679</a>, 695, n.\xc2\xa015 (1993); <em>Duro</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 685\xe2\x80\x93686; <em>Wheeler</em>, 435 U. S., at 322\xe2\x80\x93325.  This distinction makes perfect sense as a matter of federal common law: Purely \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d matters are by definition unlikely to implicate any federal policy.  But, critically, our cases have never drawn this line as a constitutional matter.  That is why we have analyzed extant federal law (embodied in treaties, statutes, and Executive Orders) before concluding that particular tribal assertions of power were incompatible with the position of the tribes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>National Farmers Union Ins. Cos.</em> v. <em>Crow Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/index.html">471 U. S. 845</a>, 853\xe2\x80\x93854 (1985); <em>Oliphant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 204 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile Congress never expressly forbade Indian tribes to impose criminal penalties on non-Indians, we now make express our implicit conclusion of nearly a century ago [referring to <em>In re Mayfield,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/141/107/index.html">141 U. S. 107</a> (1891)] that Congress consistently believed this to be the necessary result of its repeated legislative actions\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, in response to <em>Duro</em>, Congress amended ICRA.  Specifically, Congress \xe2\x80\x9crecognized and affirmed\xe2\x80\x9d the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cinherent power \xe2\x80\xa6 to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2).  President Bush signed this legislation into law.  See 27 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1573 (1991).  Further, as this litigation demonstrates, it is the position of the Executive Branch that the tribes possess inherent authority to prosecute nonmember Indians.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, these authoritative pronouncements of the political branches make clear that the exercise of this aspect of sovereignty is not inconsistent with federal policy and therefore with the position of the tribes.  Thus, while <em>Duro</em> may have been a correct federal-common-law decision at the time, the political branches have subsequently made clear that the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of criminal jurisdiction against nonmember Indians is consistent with federal policy.  The potential conflicts on which <em>Duro</em> must have been premised, according to the political branches, do not exist.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  I therefore agree that, as the case comes to us, the tribe acted as a separate sovereign when it prosecuted respondent.  Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the subsequent federal prosecution.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I believe that we must examine more critically our tribal sovereignty case law.  Both the Court and the dissent, however, compound the confusion by failing to undertake the necessary rigorous constitutional analysis.  I would begin by carefully following our assumptions to their logical conclusions and by identifying the potential sources of federal power to modify tribal sovereignty.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent admits that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]reaties and statutes delineating the tribal-federal relationship are properly viewed as an independent elaboration by the political branches of the fine details of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 dependent position, which strips the tribes of any power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over those outside their own membership.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>,<em> </em>at 3.  To the extent that this is a description of the federal-common-law process, I agree.  But I do not understand how the dissent can then conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdictional implications [arising from this analysis are] constitutional in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  By this I understand the dissent to mean that Congress cannot alter the result, though the dissent never quite says so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The analysis obviously has constitutional implications.  It is, for example, dispositive of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim.  But it does not follow that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s federal-common-law decisions limiting tribes\xe2\x80\x99 authority to exercise their inherent sovereignty somehow become enshrined as constitutional holdings that the political branches cannot alter.  When the political branches demonstrate that a particular exercise of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power is in fact consistent with federal policy, the underpinnings of a federal-common-law decision disabling the exercise of that tribal power disappear.  Although I do not necessarily agree that the tribes have any residual inherent sovereignty or that Congress is the constitutionally appropriate branch to make adjustments to sovereignty, see Part II, <em>supra, </em>it is important to recognize the logical implications of these assumptions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly unavailing is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s observation that when we perform the separate-sovereign analysis \xe2\x80\x9cwe are undertaking a constitutional analysis based on legal categories of constitutional dimension.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  The dissent concludes from this that our double jeopardy analysis in this context \xe2\x80\x9cmust itself have had constitutional status.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This <em>ipse dixet</em> does not transform our common-law decisions into constitutional holdings.  Cf. <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 459\xe2\x80\x93461 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do, however, agree that this case raises important constitutional questions that the Court does not begin to answer.  The Court utterly fails to find any provision of the Constitution that gives Congress enumerated power to alter tribal sovereignty.  The Court cites the Indian Commerce Clause and the treaty power.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  I cannot agree that the Indian Commerce Clause \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provide[s] Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 6 (quoting <em>Cotton Petroleum Corp.</em> v. <em>New Mexico,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/163/index.html">490 U. S. 163</a>, 192 (1989)).  At one time, the implausibility of this assertion at least troubled the Court, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kagama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/118/375/index.html">118 U. S. 375</a>, 378\xe2\x80\x93379 (1886) (considering such a construction of the Indian Commerce Clause to be \xe2\x80\x9cvery strained\xe2\x80\x9d), and I would be willing to revisit the question.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a> (2000); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lopez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html">514 U. S. 549</a> (1995); <em>id.,</em> at 584\xe2\x80\x93593 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he treaty power does not literally authorize Congress to act legislatively, for it is an Article II power authorizing the President, not Congress, \xe2\x80\x98to make Treaties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02).  This, of course, suffices to show that it provides <em>no</em> power to <em>Congress</em>, at least in the absence of a specific treaty.  Cf. <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Holland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/252/416/index.html">252 U. S. 416</a> (1920).  The treaty power does not, as the Court seems to believe, provide Congress with free-floating power to legislate as it sees fit on topics that could potentially implicate some unspecified treaty.  Such an assertion is especially ironic in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enacted prohibition on Indian treaties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, the Court resorts to citing past examples of congressional assertions of this or similar power.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  At times, such history might suffice.  Cf. <em>Dames &amp; Moore</em> v. <em>Regan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/654/index.html">453 U. S. 654</a>, 686 (1981); <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/index.html">343 U. S. 579</a>, 610\xe2\x80\x93611 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  But it does not suffice here for at least two reasons.  First, federal Indian law is at odds with itself.  I find it difficult to reconcile the result in <em>Wheeler</em> with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1871 prospective prohibition on the making of treaties with the Indian tribes.  The Federal Government cannot simultaneously claim power to regulate virtually every aspect of the tribes through ordinary domestic legislation and also maintain that the tribes possess anything resembling \xe2\x80\x9csovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  In short, the history points in both directions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, much of the practice that the Court cites does not actually help its argument.  The \xe2\x80\x9cInsular Cases,\xe2\x80\x9d which include the Hawaii and Puerto Rico examples, <em>ante</em>, at 9, involved Territories of the United States, over which Congress has plenary power to govern and regulate.  See <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/1/index.html">354 U. S. 1</a>, 13 (1957); U. S. Const., Art. IV, \xc2\xa73, cl. 2.  The existence of a textual source for congressional power distinguishes these cases.  And, incidentally, although one might think that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority over the tribes could be found in Article IV, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa02, the Court has held that the territories are the United States for double-jeopardy purposes, see, <em>e.g., Wheeler</em>, 435 U. S., at 321\xe2\x80\x93322; <em>Puerto Rico</em> v. <em>Shell Co. (P.\xc2\xa0R.), Ltd.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/253/index.html">302 U. S. 253</a>, 264\xe2\x80\x93266 (1937), which would preclude the result in <em>Wheeler</em>.  It is for this reason as well that the degree of autonomy of Puerto Rico is beside the point.  See <em>Wheeler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 321; <em>post</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court should admit that it has failed in its quest to find a source of congressional power to adjust tribal sovereignty.  Such an acknowledgement might allow the Court to ask the logically antecedent question <em>whether</em> Congress (as opposed to the President) has this power.  A cogent answer would serve as the foundation for the analysis of the sovereignty issues posed by this case.  We might find that the Federal Government cannot regulate the tribes through ordinary domestic legislation and simultaneously maintain that the tribes are sovereigns in any meaningful sense.  But until we begin to analyze these questions honestly and rigorously, the confusion that I have identified will continue to haunt our cases.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I am sympathetic to Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s position that we need not resolve the question presented.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).  If Congress has power to restore tribal authority to prosecute nonmember Indians, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s tribal prosecution was the legitimate exercise of a separate sovereign.  As such, under the dual sovereignty doctrine, it does not bar his subsequent federal prosecution.  On the other hand, if the amendment to ICRA had no effect (the only other possibility), jeopardy did not attach in the tribal prosecution.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Serfass</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/377/index.html">420 U. S. 377</a>, 391 (1975); <em>Grafton</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/333/index.html">206 U. S. 333</a>, 345 (1907) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthat before a person can be said to have been put in jeopardy of life or limb the court in which he was acquitted or convicted must have had jurisdiction to try him for the offense charged\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, 168 F.\xc2\xa03d 1048, 1053\xe2\x80\x931054 (CA8 1999) (holding tribal court prosecution without jurisdiction did not bar subsequent federal prosecution).  Jeopardy could have attached in the tribal prosecution for federal purposes only if the Federal Government had authorized the prosecution.  But Congress did not authorize tribal prosecutions, and nothing suggests that the Executive Branch prompted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s tribal prosecution.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Additionally, the very enactment of ICRA through normal legislation conflicts with the notion that tribes possess inherent sovereignty.  Title 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71302, for example, requires tribes \xe2\x80\x9cin exercising powers of self-government\xe2\x80\x9d to accord individuals most of the protections in the Bill of Rights.  I doubt whether Congress could, through ordinary legislation, require States (let alone foreign nations) to use grand juries.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I acknowledge that <em>Wheeler</em> focused specifically on the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 authority to try their own members.  See 435 U. S., at 323\xe2\x80\x93330.  But, as I discuss below, the distinction between the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 external and internal powers is not constitutionally required.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Souter believes that I have overlooked <em>Oliphant</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on sources other than \xe2\x80\x9ctreaties, statutes, and the views of the Executive Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5 n.\xc2\xa02.  Justice Souter quotes the following passage from <em>Oliphant</em>: \xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven ignoring treaty provisions and congressional policy, Indians do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians absent affirmative delegation of such power by Congress. \xe2\x80\xa6  Indian tribes are prohibited from exercising both those powers of autonomous states that are expressly terminated by Congress <em>and</em> those powers <em>inconsistent with their status</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oliphant</em>, 435 U. S., at 208 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The second quoted sentence is entirely consistent with federal common lawmaking and is difficult to understand as anything else.  I admit that the first sentence, which removes from consideration most of the sources of federal common law, makes the second sentence puzzling.  But this is precisely the confusion that I have identified and that I hope the Court begins to resolve.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961566">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nUNITED STATES V.

S. 676</a> (1990), demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear intention to restore to the tribes an inherent sovereign power to prosecute nonmember Indians. Congress was careful to rely on the theory of inherent sovereignty, and not on a delegation.  Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s position that it was a delegation nonetheless, <em>post, </em>at 5 (dissenting opinion), is by no means without support, but I would take Congress at its word.  Under that view, the first prosecution of Lara was not a delegated federal prosecution, and his double jeopardy argument must fail.  That is all we need say to resolve this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis goes beyond this narrower rationale and culminates in a surprising holding: \xe2\x80\x9cFor these reasons, we hold . . . that the Constitution authorizes Congress to permit tribes, as an exercise of their inherent tribal authority, to prosecute nonmember Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is on a point of major sig-\nnificance to our understanding and interpretation of\nthe Constitution; and, in my respectful view, it is most doubtful.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were we called upon to decide whether Congress has this power, it would be a difficult question.  Our decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wheeler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/313/index.html">435 U. S. 313</a> (1978), which the Court cites today but discusses very little, is replete with references to the inherent authority of the tribe over its own members.  As I read that case, it is the historic possession of inherent power over \xe2\x80\x9cthe relations among members of a tribe\xe2\x80\x9d that is the whole justification for the limited tribal sovereignty the Court there recognized.  <em>Id.</em>, at 326.  It is a most troubling proposition to say that Congress can relax the restrictions on inherent tribal sovereignty in a way that extends that sovereignty beyond those historical limits.  Cf<em>., e.g.</em>,<em> Strate </em>v.<em> A\xe2\x80\x931 Contractors</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/438/index.html">520 U. S. 438</a>, 445\xe2\x80\x93446 (1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the main . . . \xe2\x80\x98the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94those powers a tribe enjoys apart from express provision by treaty or statute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Montana </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/index.html">450 U. S. 544</a>, 565 (1981))).  To conclude that a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s inherent sovereignty allows it to exercise jurisdiction over a nonmember in a criminal case is to enlarge the \xe2\x80\x9cunique and limited character\xe2\x80\x9d of the inherent sovereignty that <em>Wheeler </em>recognized.  435 U. S., at 323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lara, after all, is a citizen of the United States.  To hold that Congress can subject him, within our domestic borders, to a sovereignty outside the basic structure of the Constitution is a serious step.  The Constitution is based on a theory of original, and continuing, consent of the governed.  Their consent depends on the understanding that the Constitution has established the federal structure, which grants the citizen the protection of two governments, the Nation and the State.  Each sovereign must respect the proper sphere of the other, for the citizen has rights and duties as to both.  See<em> U. S. Term Limits, Inc. </em>v.<em> Thornton</em>, 514 U. S.779, 838\xe2\x80\x93839 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Here, contrary to this design, the National Government seeks to subject a citizen to the criminal jurisdiction of a third entity to be tried for conduct occurring wholly within the territorial borders of the Nation and one of the States.  This is unprecedented.  There is a historical exception for Indian tribes, but only to the limited extent that a member of a tribe consents to be subjected to the jurisdiction of his own tribe. See<em> Duro</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 693.  The majority today reaches beyond that limited exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court resolves, or perhaps avoids, the basic question of the power of the Government to yield authority inside the domestic borders over citizens to a third sovereign by using the euphemistic formulation that in amending the ICRA Congress merely relaxed restrictions on the tribes.  <em>See ante</em>, at 1, 5, 7, 10, and 13.  There is no language in the statute, or the legislative history, that justifies this unusual phrase, compare 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(2) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe inherent power of Indian tribes, hereby recognized and affirmed, to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians\xe2\x80\x9d); and, in my respectful view, it obscures what is actually at stake in this case.  The terms of the statute are best understood as a grant or cession from Congress to the tribes, and it should not be doubted that what Congress has attempted to do is subject American citizens to the authority of an extraconstitutional sovereign to which they had not previously been subject. The relaxing-restrictions formulation is further belied by the involvement of the United States in all aspects of the tribal prosecution of a nonmember Indian.  Federal law defines the separate tribes, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301, the broader class of \xe2\x80\x9cIndians,\xe2\x80\x9d the maximum penalty which the tribes may impose for crimes, and the procedural protections to which defendants are entitled in the trials, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71302.  This does not indicate the sort of detachment from the exercise of prosecutorial authority implicit in the description of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 act as having relaxed restrictions. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to trying to evade the important structural question by relying on the verbal formula of relaxation, the Court also tries to bolster its position by noting that due process and equal protection claims are still reserved.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  That is true, but it ignores the elementary principle that the Constitutional structure was in place before the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were adopted.  To demean the constitutional structure and the consent upon which it rests by implying they are wholly dependent for their vindication on the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses is a further, unreasoned holding of serious import.  The political freedom guaranteed to citizens by the federal structure is a liberty both distinct from and every bit as important as those freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.  Cf. <em>Clinton </em>v<em>. City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/417/index.html">524 U. S. 417</a>, 449\xe2\x80\x93453 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The individual citizen has an enforceable right to those structural guarantees of liberty, a right which the majority ignores.  Perhaps the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding could be justified by an argument that by enrolling in one tribe Lara consented to the criminal jurisdiction of other tribes, but the Court does not mention the point.  And, in all events, we should be cautious about adopting that fiction. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case, however, does not require us to address these difficult questions of constitutional dimension. Congress made it clear that its intent was to recognize and affirm tribal authority to try Indian nonmembers as inherent in tribal status.  The proper occasion to test the legitimacy of the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s authority, that is, whether Congress had the power to do what it sought to do, was in the first, tribal proceeding.  There, however, Lara made no objection to the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s authority to try him.  In the second, federal proceeding, because the express rationale for the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s authority to try Lara\xe2\x80\x94whether legitimate or not\xe2\x80\x94was inherent sovereignty, not delegated federal power, there can be no double jeopardy violation.  Cf.<em> Grafton </em>v<em>. United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/333/index.html">206 U. S. 333</a>, 345 (1907) (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]efore a person can be said to have been put in jeopardy of life or limb the court in which he was acquitted or convicted must have had jurisdiction to try him for the offense charged\xe2\x80\x9d).

Three years later, in <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Bourland, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/508/679/index.html">508 U. S. 679</a> (1993), we reiterated this understanding that any such \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation\xe2\x80\x9d would not be a restoration of prior inherent sovereignty; we specifically explained that \xe2\x80\x9ctribal sovereignty over nonmembers cannot survive without express congressional delegation, and is therefore <em>not</em> inherent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 695, n.\xc2\xa015 (emphasis in original, citation and internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Our precedent, then, is that any tribal exercise of criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers necessarily rests on a \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation\xe2\x80\x9d of federal power and is not akin to a State\xe2\x80\x99s congressionally permitted exercise of some authority that would otherwise be barred by the dormant Commerce Clause, see <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 505 U. S.144, 171 (1992).  It is more like the delegation of lawmaking power to an administrative agency, whose jurisdiction would not even exist absent congressional authorization.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is of no moment that we have given ostensibly alternating explanations for this conclusion.  We have sometimes indicated that the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 lack of inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers is a necessary legal consequence of the basic fact that the tribes are dependent on the Federal Government.  <em>Wheeler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 326 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inability to] try nonmembers in tribal courts\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. rest[s] on the fact that the dependent status of Indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently to determine their external relations\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Oliphant</em>, 435 U. S., at 210 (\xe2\x80\x9cBy submitting to the overriding sovereignty of the United States, Indian tribes therefore necessarily give up their power to try non-Indian citizens of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  At other times, our language has suggested that the jurisdictional limit stems from congressional and treaty limitations on tribal powers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 204 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 various actions and inactions in regulating criminal jurisdiction on Indian reservations demonstrated an intent to reserve jurisdiction over non-Indians for the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>National Farmers Union Ins. Cos.</em> v. <em>Crow Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/index.html">471 U. S. 845</a>, 853\xe2\x80\x93854 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn <em>Oliphant</em> we\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 concluded that federal legislation conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts to try non-Indians for offenses committed in Indian Country had implicitly pre-empted tribal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  What has never been explicitly stated, but should come as no surprise, is that these two accounts are not inconsistent.  Treaties and statutes delineating the tribal-federal relationship are properly viewed as an independent elaboration by the political branches of the fine details of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 dependent position, which strips the tribes of any power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over those outside their own memberships.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What should also be clear, and what I would hold today, is that our previous understanding of the jurisdictional implications of dependent sovereignty was constitutional in nature, certainly so far as its significance under the Double Jeopardy Clause is concerned.  Our discussions of Indian sovereignty have naturally focused on the scope of tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inherent legislative or judicial jurisdiction.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/353/index.html">533 U. S. 353</a> (2001) (jurisdiction of tribal courts over civil suit against state official); <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Bourland, supra</em> (tribal regulations governing hunting and fishing).  And application of the double jeopardy doctrine of dual sovereignty, under which one independent sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of criminal jurisdiction does not bar another sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent prosecution of the same defendant, turns on just this question of how far a prosecuting entity\xe2\x80\x99s inherent jurisdiction extends.  <em>Grafton</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/333/index.html">206 U. S. 333</a>, 354\xe2\x80\x93355 (1907).  When we enquire \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the two [prosecuting] entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Heath</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/82/index.html"></a><a href="/us/474/82/index.html">474 U. S. 82</a>, 88 (1985), in other words, we are undertaking a constitutional analysis based on legal categories of constitutional dimension (<em>i.e.</em>, is this entity an independent or dependent sovereign?).  Thus, our application of the doctrines of independent and dependent sovereignty to Indian tribes in response to a double jeopardy claim must itself have had constitutional status.  See <em>Wheeler</em>, 435 U. S., at 326 (holding that tribes\xe2\x80\x99 inability to prosecute nonmembers \xe2\x80\x9crest[s] on the fact that the dependent status of Indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently to determine their external relations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That means that there are only two ways that a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s inherent sovereignty could be restored so as to alter application of the dual sovereignty rule: either Congress could grant the same independence to the tribes that it did to the Philippines, see <em>ante</em>, at 9, or this Court could repudiate its existing doctrine of dependent sovereignty.  The first alternative has obviously not been attempted, and I see no reason for us to venture down a path toward the second.  To begin with, the theory we followed before today has the virtue of fitting the facts: no one could possibly deny that the tribes are subordinate to the National Government.  Furthermore, while this is not the place to reexamine the concept of dual sovereignty itself, there is certainly no reason to adopt a canon of broad construction calling for maximum application of the doctrine.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, principles of <em>stare decisis</em> are particularly compelling in the law of tribal jurisdiction, an area peculiarly susceptible to confusion.  And confusion, I fear, will be the legacy of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, for our failure to stand by what we have previously said reveals that our conceptualizations of sovereignty and dependent sovereignty are largely rhetorical.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore stand by our explanations in <em>Oliphant</em> and <em>Duro</em> and hold that Congress cannot reinvest tribal courts with inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians.<font b="1">  It is not that I fail to appreciate Congress\xe2\x80\x99s express wish that the jurisdiction conveyed by statute be treated as inherent, but Congress cannot control the interpretation of the statute in a way that is at odds with the constitutional consequences of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 continuing dependent status.  What may be given controlling effect, however, is the principal object of the 1990 amendments to the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301 <em>et seq.</em>, which was to close \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdictional void\xe2\x80\x9d created by <em>Duro</em> by recognizing (and empowering) the tribal court as \xe2\x80\x9cthe best forum to handle misdemeanor cases over non-member Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9361, p. 7 (1991).  I would therefore honor the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 substantive intent by reading the Act as a delegation of federal prosecutorial power that eliminates the jurisdictional gap.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Finally, I would hold that a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of this delegated power bars subsequent federal prosecution for the same offense.

He notes, for example, <em>ante,</em> at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment) that the Court in <em>Heath</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/82/index.html"></a><a href="/us/474/82/index.html">474 U. S. 82</a>, 88 (1985), explained that one act that violates the peace and dignity of two sovereigns constitutes two separate offenses for purposes of double jeopardy.  Justice Thomas then concludes that whether an act violates a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s peace and dignity does not depend (when the sovereign is an Indian tribe) on whether the perpetrator is a member of the tribe.  Justice Thomas therefore assumes that tribes \xe2\x80\x9cretain inherent sovereignty to try anyone who violates their criminal laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  This Court, however, has held exactly to the contrary: a tribe has no inherent jurisdiction to prosecute a non member.  In rejecting this precedent, Justice Thomas implicitly rejects the concept of dependent sovereignty, upon which our holdings in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wheeler</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/313/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/313/index.html">435 U.

Reciting <em>Oliphant</em>\xe2\x80\x99s examination of treaties, statutes, and views of the Executive Branch, Justice Thomas attempts to suggest that these opinions were only momentary expressions of malleable federal policy.  But he somehow ignores <em>Oliphant</em>\xe2\x80\x99s own emphasis that its analysis did not rest on historical expressions of federal policy; rather, \xe2\x80\x9ceven ignoring treaty provisions and congressional policy, Indians do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians absent affirmative delegation of such power by Congress. . . .
