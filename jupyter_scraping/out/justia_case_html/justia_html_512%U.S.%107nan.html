Mter petitioner Livadas\'s employer refused to pay her the wages owed upon her discharge, but paid them a few days later, she filed a penalty claim. The Commissioner replied with a form letter construing Labor Code \xc2\xa7 229 as barring him from enforcing such claims on behalf of individuals like Livadas, whose employment terms and conditions are governed by a collectivebargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause. Livadas brought this action under 42 U. S.

The District Court granted her summary judgment, rejecting the Commissioner\'s defense that the claim was pre-empted by \xc2\xa7 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA). Although acknowledging that the NLRA gives Livadas a right to bargain collectively and that \xc2\xa7 1983 would supply a remedy for official deprivation of that right, the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that no federal right had been infringed because Livadas\'s case reduced to an assertion that the Commissioner had misinterpreted state law, namely \xc2\xa7 229.</p><p>Held:</p><p>1.

Even at face value, however, the "hands off" label poses special dangers that advantages conferred by federal law will be canceled out and its objectives undermined, and those dangers are not laid to rest by professions of the need for governmental neutrality in labor disputes. Similarly, the vague assertions that the policy advances federal interests are not persuasive, since this Court has never suggested that the federal bias toward bargaining is to be served by forcing employees and employers to bargain for what they would otherwise be entitled to under state law. <i>Fort Halifax Packing Co. </i>v. <i>Coyne, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html">482 U.

California law requires employers to pay all wages due immediately upon an employee\'s discharge, imposes a penalty for refusal to pay promptly, precludes any private contractual waiver of these minimum labor standards, and places responsibility for enforcing these provisions on the State Commissioner of Labor (Commissioner or Labor Commissioner), ostensibly for the benefit of all employees. Respondent, the Labor Commissioner,l has construed a further provision of state law as barring enforcement of these wage and penalty claims on behalf of individuals like petitioner, whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective-bargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause. We hold that federal law pre-empts this policy, as abridging the exercise of such employees\' rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 151 <i>et seq., </i>and that redress for this unlawful refusal to enforce may be had under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Until her discharge on January 2, 1990, petitioner Karen Livadas worked as a grocery clerk in a Vallejo, California, Safeway supermarket. The terms and conditions of her employment were subject to a collective-bargaining agreement between Safeway and Livadas\'s union, Local 373 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, AFL-CIO. Unexceptionally, the agreement provided that "[d]isputes as to the interpretation or application of the agreement," including grievances arising from allegedly unjust discharge or suspension, would be subject to binding arbitration.

Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 201 (West 1989),3 but her store manager refused, referring to the company practice of making such payments by check mailed from a central corporate payroll office. On January 5, 1990, Livadas received a check from Safeway, in the full amount owed for her work through January 2.</p><p>On January 9, 1990, Livadas filed a claim against Safeway with the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE or Division), asserting that under \xc2\xa7 203 of the Labor Code the company was liable to her for a sum equal to three days\' wages, as a penalty for the delay between discharge and the date when payment was in fact re-</p><p>2 Section 18.1 of the collective-bargaining agreement defines a "grievance" as a "dispute ... involving or arising out of the meaning, interpretation, application or alleged violation" of the agreement.</p><p>Section 18.8 provides that "[i]n the case of a direct wage claim ... which does not involve an interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement, either party may submit such claim for settlement to either the grievance procedure provided for herein or to any other tribunal or agency which is authorized and empowered to effect such a settlement."</p><p>3 California Labor Code \xc2\xa7 201 provides in pertinent part: "If an employer discharges an employee, the wages earned and unpaid at the time of discharge are due and payable immediately." It draws no distinction between union-represented employees and others.</p><p>Under another provision of California law, Labor Code \xc2\xa7 219, the protections of \xc2\xa7 201 (and of other rules governing the frequency and form of wage payments) "can [not] in any way be contravened or set aside by private agreement, whether written, oral, or implied," although employers are free to pay wages more frequently, in greater amounts, or at an earlier date than ordained by these state rules; cf. \xc2\xa7 204.2 (executive, administrative, and professional employees may negotiate through collective bargaining for pay periods different from those required by state law).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="112">112</a></p><p>ceived.4 Livadas requested the Commissioner to enforce the claim.5</p><p>By an apparently standard form letter dated February 7, 1990, the Division notified Livadas that it would take no action on her complaint:</p><blockquote><p>\n"It is our understanding that the employees working for Safeway are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which contains an arbitration clause. The provisions of Labor Code Section 229 preclude this Division from adjudicating any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of any collective bargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"Labor Code Section 203 requires that the wages continue at the \'same rate\' until paid. In order to establish what the \'same rate\' was, it is necessary to look to the</p></blockquote><p>4 That section provides that when an employer "willfully fails" to comply with the strictures of \xc2\xa7 201 and fails to pay "any wages" owed discharged employees, "the wages of such employees shall continue as a penalty from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced; but such wages shall not continue for more than 30 days." Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 203 (West 1989).</p><p>In her DLSE claim form, Livadas made plain that she did not dispute Safeway\'s calculation of the wages owed, but sought only the penalty for the employer\'s late tender. App. 18.</p><p>5 Under state law, the Commissioner of Labor is the Division Chief of the DLSE, see Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 79, 82(b) (West 1989), and is authorized either directly to prosecute a wage or penalty claim on an employee\'s behalf in state court, \xc2\xa7 98.3(a), or, in the alternative, to initiate informal hearings under DLSE auspices, see \xc2\xa7 98(a), in which full relief may be awarded, \xc2\xa7 98.1. The Commissioner\'s policy with respect to claims by employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements appears not to distinguish between these two modes of proceeding, and, accordingly, we will refer, as the parties largely do, to her policy as a categorical refusal to "enforce" such claims. Although Labor Code \xc2\xa7 218 states that "[n]othing in this article shall limit the right of any wage claimant to sue ... for any wages or penalty due him," another provision, \xc2\xa7 218.5, authorizes attorney\'s fee awards to prevailing parties in wage and penalty disputes, making individual litigation a somewhat risky prospect, and DLSE enforcement remains in any event the more realistic avenue for modest claims.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="113">113</a></p><blockquote><p>\ncollective bargaining agreement and \'apply\' that agreement. The courts have pointed out that such an application is exactly what the provisions of Labor Code \xc2\xa7 229 prohibit." 6 App. 16.</p></blockquote><p>The letter made no reference to any particular aspect of Livadas\'s claim making it unfit for enforcement, and the Commissioner\'s position is fairly taken to be that DLSE enforcement of \xc2\xa7 203 claims, as well as other claims for which relief is pegged to an employee\'s wage rate, is generally unavailable to employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements.7</p><p>Livadas brought this action in the United States District Court under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983, alleging that the nonenforcement policy, reflecting the Commissioner\'s reading of Labor Code \xc2\xa7 229, was pre-empted as conflicting with Livadas\'s rights under \xc2\xa7 7 of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.

This section shall not apply to claims involving any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of any collective bargaining agreement containing such an arbitration agreement." Cf. <i>Perry </i>v. <i>Thomas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/483/case.html">482 U. S. 483</a> (1987) (\xc2\xa7 229 bar to waiver defeated by Federal Arbitration Act policy).</p><p>All concerned identify the allusion to what "courts" have said to be a reference to a 1975 decision of the California Court of Appeal, <i>Plumbing, Heating and Piping Employers Council </i>v. <i>Howard, </i>53 Cal. App. 3d 828, 126 Cal. Rptr. 406, where the Commissioner was held barred by the statute from enforcing an "unpaid" wage claim arising from an employee\'s assertion that he was entitled, under collective-bargaining agreements then in force, to receive a foreman\'s rate of pay and not a journeyman\'s.</p><p>7The Commissioner notes that a small minority of collective-bargaining agreements lack provisions either setting wage rates or mandating arbitration (and therefore might potentially be enforced under the challenged policy). But see n. 13, <i>infra; Lingle </i>v. <i>Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/399/case.html">486 U.

She stressed that there was no dispute about the amount owed and that neither she nor Safeway had begun any grievance proceeding over the penalty.8 Livadas sought a declaration that the Commissioner\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 229 was pre-empted, an injunction against adherence to the allegedly impermissible policy, and an order requiring the Commissioner either to process her penalty claim or (if it would be time barred under state law) pay her damages in the amount the Commissioner would have obtained if the Commissioner had moved against the employer in time.</p><p>The District Court granted summary judgment for Livadas, holding the labor pre-emption claim cognizable under \xc2\xa7 1983, see <i>Golden State Transit Corp. </i>v. <i>Los Angeles, 493 </i>U. S. 103 (1989) <i>(Golden State II), </i>and the Commissioner\'s policy pre-empted as interfering with her \xc2\xa7 7 right, see, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Golden State Transit Corp. </i>v. <i>Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/608/case.html">475 U. S. 608</a> (1986) <i>(Golden State I), </i>by denying her the benefit of a minimum labor standard, namely, the right to timely payment of final wages secured by Labor Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 203. 749 F. Supp. 1526 (ND Cal. 1990). The District Court treated as irrelevant the Commissioner\'s assertion that the policy was consistent with state law (e. g., Labor Code \xc2\xa7 229) and rejected the defense that it was required by federal law, namely, \xc2\xa7301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.

While the parties dispute what effect, as a matter of state law, that recovery would have on Livadas\'s right under \xc2\xa7 203, neither the pertinent California statutes nor the Commissioner\'s policy at issue here depend on whether a claimant\'s termination was for just cause.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="115">115</a></p><p>ments. The District Court explained that resolution of the claim under \xc2\xa7 203 "requires reference only to a calendar, not to the [collective-bargaining agreement]," 749 F. Supp., at 1536, and granted petitioner all requested relief. <i>Id., </i>at 1540.9</p><p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/987/552/">987 F.2d 552</a> (1993). The court acknowledged that federal law gives Livadas a right to engage in collective bargaining and that \xc2\xa7 1983 would supply a remedy for official deprivation of that right, but the panel majority concluded that no federal right had been infringed. The court reasoned that the policy was based on the Commissioner\'s reading of Labor Code \xc2\xa7 229, whose function of keeping state tribunals from adjudicating claims in a way that would interfere with the operation of federal labor policy is, by definition, consistent with the dictates of federal law. Noting that Livadas did not assert pre-emption of \xc2\xa7 229 itself or object to the California courts\' interpretation of it, the majority concluded that her case reduced to an assertion that the Commissioner had misinterpreted state law, an error for which relief could be obtained in California courts.</p><p>Livadas could not claim to be "penalized," the Appeals panel then observed, for she stood "in the same position as every other employee in the state when it comes to seeking the Commissioner\'s enforcement.

The proper enquiry, the dissent maintained, was not whether the Commissioner has discretion under state law not to enforce wage and penalty claims (which she plainly does) or whether she need enforce claims if doing so would actually be pre-empted by federal law (she plainly need not), but whether she may draw the line for enforcement purposes between individuals covered by collectivebargaining agreements containing arbitration clauses (whose claims will sometimes but not always be pre-empted under \xc2\xa7 301) and those not so covered. Underscoring that Livadas\'s claim would not, in fact, have been pre-empted had the federal rule been given its proper scope, the dissent found wanting the majority\'s "quasi-pre-emption" rationale, 987 F. 2d, at 562. Judge Kozinski concluded that the Commissioner\'s policy, based on an "honest (though flagrant) mistake of law," id., at 563, could not be squared with the requirements of federal labor law, because the burdened class was defined by the exercise of federal rights and because the burden on collective-bargaining rights, justified only by a mistaken understanding of what \xc2\xa7 301 requires, served no "legitimate state purpose" at all. <i>Ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="117">117</a></p><p>and encouraged by the NLRA. <i>Id., </i>at 239; see also <i>Golden </i>State I, supra, at 618 (city may not condition franchise renewal on settlement of labor dispute).

Thus, while the "misinterpretation of a perfectly valid state statute ... does not [in itself] provide grounds for federal relief," 987 F. 2d, at 559, it does not follow that no federal relief may be had when such misinterpretation results in conflict with federal law.

The nonenforcement policy, she suggests, is a necessary emanation from this Court\'s \xc2\xa7 301 pre-emption jurisprudence, marked as it has been by repeated admonitions that courts should steer clear of collective-bargaining disputes between parties who have provided for arbitration.

Indeed, largely putting aside that position, she has sought here to cast the policy in different terms, as expressing a "conscious decision," see Brief for Respondent 14, to keep the State\'s "hands off" the claims of employees protected by collective-bargaining agreements, either because the Division\'s efforts and resources are more urgently needed by others or because official restraint will actually encourage the collectivebargaining and arbitral processes favored by federal law. The latter, more ambitious defense has been vigorously taken up by the Commissioner\'s <i>amici, </i>who warn that invalidation of the disputed policy would sound the death knell for other, more common governmental measures that take account of collective-bargaining processes or treat workers represented by unions differently from others in any respect.</p><p>Although there surely is no bar to our considering these alternative explanations, cf. <i>Dandridge </i>v. <i>Williams, 397 </i>U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970) (party may defend judgment on basis not relied upon below), we note, as is often the case with such late-blooming rationales, that the overlap between what the Commissioner now claims to be state policy and what the state legislature has enacted into law is awkwardly inexact. First, if the Commissioner\'s policy (or California</p><p>concerning the interpretation or application of any collective-bargaining agreement," in which event an "agreement to arbitrate" such disputes is to be given effect. Nor does the <i>Howard </i>decision, the apparent font of the Commissioner\'s policy, appear untrue to \xc2\xa7 301 teachings: there, an employee sought to have an "unpaid wage" claim do the office of a claim that a collective-bargaining agreement entitled him to a higher wage; that sort of claim, however, derives its existence from the collective-bargaining agreement and, accordingly, falls within any customary understanding of arbitral jurisdiction. See 53 Cal. App. 3d, at 836, 126 Cal. Rptr., at 411.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="127">127</a></p><p>law) were animated simply by the frugal desire to conserve the State\'s money for the protection of employees not covered by collective-bargaining agreements, the Commissioner\'s emphasis, in the letter to Livadas and in this litigation, on the need to "interpret" or "apply" terms of a collectivebargaining agreement would be entirely misplaced.</p><p>Nor is the nonenforcement policy convincingly defended as giving parties to a collective-bargaining agreement the "benefit of their bargain," see Brief for Respondent 18, n. 13, by assuring them that their promise to arbitrate is kept and not circumvented. Under the Commissioner\'s policy, enforcement does not turn on what disputes the parties agreed would be resolved by arbitration (the bargain struck), see <i>Gilmer, </i>500 U. S., at 26, or on whether the contractual wage rate is even subject to (arbitrable) dispute. Rather, enforcement turns exclusively on the fact that the contracting parties consented to any arbitration at all. Even if the Commissioner could permissibly presume that state-law claims are generally intended to be arbitrated, but cf. id., at 35 (employees in prior cases "had not agreed to arbitrate their statutory claims, and the labor arbitrators were not authorized to resolve such claims"),21 her policy goes still further. Even in cases when it could be said with "positive assurance,"</p><p>21 In holding that an agreement to arbitrate an Age Discrimination in Employment Act claim is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, <i>Gilmer </i>emphasized its basic consistency with our unanimous decision in <i>Alexander </i>v. <i>Gardner-Denver Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html">415 U. S. 36</a> (1974), permitting a discharged employee to bring a Title VII claim, notwithstanding his having already grieved the dismissal under a collective-bargaining agreement. <i>Gilmer </i>distinguished <i>Gardner-Denver </i>as relying, <i>inter alia, </i>on: the "distinctly separate nature of ... contractual and statutory rights" (even when both were "violated as a result of the same factual occurrence"), 415 U. S., at 50; the fact that a labor "arbitrator has authority to resolve only questions of contractual rights," id., at 53-54; and the concern that in collective-bargaining arbitration, "the interests of the individual employee may be subordinated to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit," id., at 58, n. 19.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="128">128</a></p><p><i>Warrior </i>&amp; <i>Gulf, </i>363 U.

Food Store Contract \xc2\xa7 18.8 (direct wage claim not involving interpretation of agreement may be submitted "to any other tribunal or agency which is authorized and empowered" to enforce it), the Commissioner would still deny enforcement, on the stated basis that the collective-bargaining agreement nonetheless contained "an arbitration clause" and because the claim would, on her view, entail "interpretation," of the agreement\'s terms. Such an irrebuttable presumption is not easily described as the benefit of the parties\' "bargain."</p><p>The Commissioner and <i>amici </i>finally suggest that denying enforcement to union-represented employees\' claims under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 201 and 203 (and other Labor Code provisions) is meant to encourage parties to bargain collectively for their own rules about the payment of wages to discharged workers. But with this suggestion, the State\'s position simply slips any tether to California law. If California\'s goal really were to stimulate such freewheeling bargaining on these subjects, the enactment of Labor Code \xc2\xa7 219, expressly and categorically prohibiting the modification of these Labor Code rules by "private agreement," would be a very odd way to pursue it.22 Cf. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 227.3 (West 1989) (allowing parties to collective-bargaining agreement to arrive at different rule for vacation pay). In short, the policy, the rationales, and the state law are not coherent.</p><p align="center">\n2</p><p>Even at face value, however, neither the "hands off" labels nor the vague assertions that general labor law policies are thereby advanced much support the Commissioner\'s defense here.

While we hardly suggest here that every distinction between unionrepresented employees and others is invalid under the NLRA, see <i>infra, </i>at 131-132, the assertion that represented employees are less "in need" precisely because they have exercised federal rights poses special dangers that advantages conferred by federal law will be canceled out and its objectives undermined. Cf. <i>Metropolitan Life, </i>471 U. S., at 756 ("It would turn the policy that animated the Wagner Act on its head to understand it to have penalized workers who have chosen to join a union by preventing them from benefiting from state labor regulations imposing minimal standards on nonunion employers"). Accordingly, as we observed in <i>Metropolitan Life, </i>the widespread practice in Congress and in state legislatures has assumed the contrary, bestowing basic employment guarantees and protections on individual employees without singling out members of labor unions (or those represented by them) for disability; see id., at 755; 23 accord, <i>Lingle, </i>486 U.

Nor need we pause long over the assertion that nonenforcement of valid state-law claims is consistent with federal labor law by "encouraging" the operation of collective bargaining and arbitration process. Denying represented employees basic safety protections might "encourage" collective bargaining over that subject, and denying union employers the protection of generally applicable state trespass law might lead to increased bargaining over the rights of labor pickets, cf. <i>Rum Creek, supra, </i>but we have never suggested that labor law\'s bias toward bargaining is to be served by forcing employees or employers to bargain for what they would otherwise be entitled to as a matter of course.

In that case we held that there was no federal pre-emption of a Maine statute that allowed employees and employers to contract for plant-closing severance payments different from those otherwise mandated by state law.

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted), defended in those terms in our earlier case. Most fundamentally, the Maine law treated all employees equally, whether or not represented by a labor organization. All were entitled to the statutory severance payment, and all were allowed to negotiate agreements providing for different benefits. See id., at 4, n. 1. Second, the minimum protections of Maine\'s plant-closing law were relinquished not by the mere act of signing an employment contract (or collective-bargaining agreement), but only by the parties\' express agreement on different terms, see id., at 21.25</p><p>While the Commissioner and her <i>amici </i>call our attention to a number of state and federal laws that draw distinctions between union and nonunion represented employees, see, <i>e. </i>g., D.

C. \xc2\xa7 203(0) ("Hours [w]orked" for Fair Labor Standards Act measured according to "express terms of ... or practice under bona fide collective-bargaining agreement"), virtually all share the important second feature observed in <i>Coyne, </i>that unionrepresented employees have the full protection of the minimum standard, absent any agreement for something different. These "opt out" statutes are thus manifestly different in their operation (and their effect on federal rights)</p><p>25 It bears mention that the law in <i>Fort Halifax </i>pegged the benefit payment to an employee\'s wages, meaning that the State Labor Commissioner would "look to" the collective-bargaining agreement in enforcing claims in precisely the same manner that respondent would here.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="132">132</a></p><p>from the Commissioner\'s rule that an employee forfeits his state-law rights the moment a collective-bargaining agreement with an arbitration clause is entered into.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983 for the Commissioner\'s abridgment of her NLRA rights. Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action for the deprivation, under color of law, of a citizen\'s "rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United States, and we have given that provision the effect its terms require, as affording redress for violations of federal statutes, as well as of constitutional norms. <i>Maine </i>v. <i>Thiboutot, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1980). We have, it is true, recognized that even the broad statutory text does not authorize a suit for every alleged violation of federal law. A particular statutory provision, for example, may be so manifestly precatory that it could not fairly be read to impose a "binding obligatio[n]" on a governmental unit, <i>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </i>v. <i>Halderman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html">451 U.

See <i>Wright </i>v. <i>Roanoke Redevelop-</i></p><p>26 Nor does it seem plausible to suggest that Congress meant to preempt such opt-out laws, as "burdening" the statutory right of employees not to join unions by denying nonrepresented employees the "benefit" of being able to "contract out" of such standards.

And Congress itself might make it clear that violation of a statute will not give rise to liability under \xc2\xa7 1983, either by express words or by providing a comprehensive alternative enforcement scheme. See <i>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority </i>v. <i>National Sea Clammers Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html">453 U. S. 1</a> (1981). But apart from these exceptional cases, \xc2\xa7 1983 remains a generally and presumptively available remedy for claimed violations of federal law. See also <i>Dennis </i>v. <i>Higgins, 498 </i>U. S. 439, 443 (1991).</p><p>Our conclusion that Livadas is entitled to seek redress under \xc2\xa7 1983 is, if not controlled outright, at least heavily foreshadowed by our decision in <i>Golden State II. </i>We began there with the recognition that not every instance of federal pre-emption gives rise to a \xc2\xa7 1983 cause of action, see 493 U. S., at 108, and we explained that to decide the availability of \xc2\xa7 1983 relief a court must look to the nature of the federal law accorded pre-emptive effect and the character of the interest claimed under it, <i>ibid.</i>27 We had no difficulty concluding, however, as we had often before, see, <i>e. g., Hill </i>v. <i>Florida ex rel. Watson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/538/case.html">325 U.

In so concluding, we contrasted the intricate scheme provided to remedy violations by private actors to the complete absence of provision for relief from governmen-</p><p>27 Thus, <i>Golden State II </i>observed that an NLRA pre-emption claim grounded in the need to vindicate the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, see <i>San Diego Building Trades Council </i>v. <i>Garmon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U.

Indeed, the only issue seriously in dispute in <i>Golden State II </i>was whether the freedom to resort to "peaceful methods of ... economic pressure," id., at 112 (internal quotation marks omitted), which we had recognized as implicit in the structure of the Act, could support \xc2\xa7 1983 liability in the same manner as official abridgment of those rights enumerated in the text would do. <i>Ibid. </i>The Court majority said yes, explaining that "[a] rule of law that is the product of judicial interpretation of a vague, ambiguous, or incomplete statutory provision is no less binding than a rule that is based on the plain meaning of a statute." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The right Livadas asserts, to complete the collectivebargaining process and agree to an arbitration clause, is, if not provided in so many words in the NLRA, see n. 10, <i>supra, </i>at least as immanent in its structure as the right of the cab company in <i>Golden State II. </i>And the obligation to respect it on the part of the Commissioner and others acting under color of law is no more "vague and amorphous" than the obligation in <i>Golden State. </i>Congress, of course, has given no more indication of any intent to foreclose actions like Livadas\'s than the sort brought by the cab company.
