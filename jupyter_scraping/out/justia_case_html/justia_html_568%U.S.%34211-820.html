To avoid removal, she sought to overturn that conviction by filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis, contending that her former attorney\xe2\x80\x99s failure to advise her of the guilty plea\xe2\x80\x99s immigration consequences constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the \n \nSixth Amendment.  While her petition was pending, this Court held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, that the \n \nSixth Amendment requires defense attorneys to inform non-citizen clients of the deportation risks of guilty pleas.  The District Court vacated Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, determining that Padilla did not announce a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d under Teague v. Lane, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288\n, and thus applied to Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Padilla had declared a new rule and should not apply in a challenge to a final conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Padilla does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.

A \xe2\x80\x9ccase announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final.\xe2\x80\x9d  Teague, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301.  And a holding is not so dictated unless it would have been \xe2\x80\x9capparent to all reasonable jurists.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lambrix v. Singletary, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518\n\xe2\x88\x92528.  At the same time, a case does not \xe2\x80\x9cannounce a new rule, [when] it [is] merely an application of the principle that governed\xe2\x80\x9d a prior decision to a different set of facts.  Teague, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 307.  Thus, garden-variety applications of the test in Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668\n, for assessing ineffective assistance claims do not produce new rules, id., at 687\xe2\x88\x92688.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Padilla did more than just apply Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s general standard to yet another factual situation.  Before deciding if failing to inform a client about the risk of deportation \xe2\x80\x9cfell below [Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s] objective standard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 688, Padilla first considered the threshold question whether advice about deportation was \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically removed\xe2\x80\x9d from the scope of the \n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel because it involved only a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral consequence\xe2\x80\x9d of a conviction, rather than a component of a criminal sentence, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  That is, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied, Padilla asked whether that test applied at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat preliminary question came to the Court unsettled.  Hill v. Lockhart, \n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52\n, had explicitly left open whether the \n \nSixth Amendment right extends to collateral consequences.  That left the issue to the state and lower federal courts, and they almost unanimously concluded that the \n \nSixth Amendment does not require attorneys to inform their clients of a conviction\xe2\x80\x99s collateral consequences, including deportation.  Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s contrary ruling thus answered an open question about the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reach, in a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions.  In so doing, Padilla broke new ground and imposed a new obligation.

But she ignores that Padilla had to develop new law to determine that Strickland applied at all.  The few lower court decisions she cites held only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepresent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client as to any important matter.  Those rulings do not apply to her case, and they do not show that all reasonable judges thought that lawyers had to advise their clients about deportation risks.  Neither does INS v. St. Cyr, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289\n, have any relevance here.  In saying that a reasonably competent lawyer would tell a non-citizen client about a guilty plea\xe2\x80\x99s deportation consequences, St. Cyr did not determine that the \n \nSixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide such information.  It took Padilla to decide that question.

After federal agents uncovered the scheme, Chaidez pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud, in violation of \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.  The District Court sentenced her to four years of probation and ordered her to pay restitution.

Our ruling vindicated Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s view of the \n \nSixth Amendment: We held that criminal defense attorneys must inform non-citizen clients of the risks of deportation arising from guilty pleas.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  But the Government argued that Chaidez could not benefit from Padilla because it announced a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d and, under Teague, such rules do not apply in collateral challenges to already-final convictions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court determined that Padilla \xe2\x80\x9cdid not announce a new rule for Teague purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore should apply to Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s case.  730 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 896, 904 (ND Ill. 2010).  It then found that Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had performed deficiently under Padilla and that Chaidez suffered prejudice as a result.  Accordingly, the court vacated Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.

And state and lower federal courts had uniformly concluded that an attorney need not give \xe2\x80\x9cadvice concerning [such a] collateral (as opposed to direct) consequenc[e] of a guilty plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 690.  According to the Seventh Circuit, Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s holding was new because it ran counter to that widely accepted \xe2\x80\x9cdistinction between direct and collateral consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 691.  Judge Williams dissented.  Agreeing with the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, she argued that Padilla \xe2\x80\x9cbroke no new ground\xe2\x80\x9d because it merely applied established law about a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cduty to consult\xe2\x80\x9d with a client.  655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 695 (quoting United States v.

And a holding is not so dictated, we later stated, unless it would have been \xe2\x80\x9capparent to all reasonable jurists.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lambrix v.

Aiken, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211, \n217 (1988)\n).  As Justice Kennedy has explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the beginning point\xe2\x80\x9d of our analysis is a rule of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one not dictated by precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wright v. West, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 277, \n309 (1992)\n (concurring in judgment); see also Williams v. Taylor, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362, \n391 (2000)\n.  Otherwise said, when all we do is apply a general standard to the kind of factual circumstances it was meant to address, we will rarely state a new rule for Teague purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause that is so, garden-variety applications of the test in Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984)\n, for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do not produce new rules.  In Strickland, we held that legal representation violates the \n \nSixth Amendment if it falls \xe2\x80\x9cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d as indicated by \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing professional norms,\xe2\x80\x9d and the defendant suffers prejudice as a result.  Id., at 687\xe2\x80\x93688.  That standard, we later concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cprovides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all\xe2\x80\x9d claims of ineffective assistance, even though their particular circumstances will differ.  Williams, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 391.  And so we have granted relief under Strickland in diverse contexts without ever suggesting that doing so required a new rule.  See, e.g., ibid.; Rompilla v. Beard, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374 (2005)\n; Wiggins v.

Before deciding if failing to provide such advice \xe2\x80\x9cfell below an objective stan-dard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d Padilla considered a threshold question: Was advice about deportation \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically removed\xe2\x80\x9d from the scope of the \n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel because it involved only a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral consequence\xe2\x80\x9d of a conviction, rather than a component of the criminal sentence?  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x939).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In other words, prior to asking how the Strickland test applied (\xe2\x80\x9cDid this attorney act unreasonably?\xe2\x80\x9d), Padilla asked whether the Strickland test applied (\xe2\x80\x9cShould we even evaluate if this attorney acted unreasonably?\xe2\x80\x9d).  And as we will describe, that preliminary question about Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s ambit came to the Padilla Court unsettled\xe2\x80\x94so that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer (\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Strickland governs here\xe2\x80\x9d) required a new rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe relevant background begins with our decision in Hill v. Lockhart, \n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52 (1985)\n, which explicitly left open whether advice concerning a collateral consequence must satisfy \n \nSixth Amendment requirements.  Hill pleaded guilty to first-degree murder after his attorney misinformed him about his parole eligibility.  In addressing his claim of ineffective assistance, we first held that the Strickland standard extends generally to the plea process.  See Hill, 474 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 57.  We then determined, however, that Hill had failed to allege prejudice from the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s error and so could not prevail under that standard.  See id., at 60.  That conclusion allowed us to avoid another, more categorical question: whether advice about parole (however inadequate and prejudicial) could possibly violate the \n \nSixth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals, we noted, had held \xe2\x80\x9cthat parole eligibility is a collateral rather than a direct consequence of a guilty plea, of which a defendant need not be informed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 55.  But our ruling on prejudice made \xe2\x80\x9cit unnecessary to determine whether there may be circumstances under which\xe2\x80\x9d ad- vice about a matter deemed collateral violates the \n \nSixth Amendment.

All 10 federal appellate courts to consider the question decided, in the words of one, that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to inform a defendant of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea is never\xe2\x80\x9d a violation of the \n \nSixth Amendment.

Rev. 697, 706 (2002).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo when we decided Padilla, we answered a question about the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reach that we had left open, in a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94and our reasoning reflected that we were doing as much.  In the normal Strickland case, a court begins by evaluating the reasonableness of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in light of professional norms, and then assesses prejudice.  But as earlier indicated, see supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, Padilla had a different starting point.  Before asking whether the performance of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s attorney was deficient under Strickland, we considered (in a separately numbered part of the opinion) whether Strickland applied at all.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x939).  Many courts, we acknowledged, had excluded advice about collateral matters from the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ambit; and deportation, because the consequence of a distinct civil proceeding, could well be viewed as such a matter.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  But, we continued, no decision of our own committed us to \xe2\x80\x9cappl[y] a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope\xe2\x80\x9d of the right to counsel.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  And however apt that distinction might be in other contexts, it should not exempt from \n \nSixth Amendment scrutiny a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice (or non-advice) about a plea\xe2\x80\x99s deportation risk.  Deportation, we stated, is \xe2\x80\x9cunique.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  It is a \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly severe\xe2\x80\x9d penalty, and one \xe2\x80\x9cintimately related to the criminal process\xe2\x80\x9d; indeed, immigration statutes make it \xe2\x80\x9cnearly an automatic result\xe2\x80\x9d of some convictions.  Ibid.  We thus resolved the threshold question before us by breaching the previously chink-free wall between direct and collateral consequences:  Notwithstanding the then-dominant view, \xe2\x80\x9cStrickland applies to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf that does not count as \xe2\x80\x9cbreak[ing] new ground\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] a new obligation,\xe2\x80\x9d we are hard pressed to know what would.  Teague, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301.  Before Padilla, we had declined to decide whether the \n \nSixth Amendment had any relevance to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice about matters not part of a criminal proceeding.  Perhaps some advice of that kind would have to meet Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness standard\xe2\x80\x94but then again, perhaps not: No precedent of our own \xe2\x80\x9cdictated\xe2\x80\x9d the answer.  Teague, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301.  And as the lower courts filled the vacuum, they almost uniformly insisted on what Padilla called the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorica[l] remov[al]\xe2\x80\x9d of advice about a conviction\xe2\x80\x99s non-criminal consequences\xe2\x80\x94including deportation\xe2\x80\x94from the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  It was Padilla that first rejected that categorical approach\xe2\x80\x94and so made the Strickland test operative\xe2\x80\x94when a criminal lawyer gives (or fails to give) advice about immigration consequences.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In acknowledging that fact, we do not cast doubt on, or at all denigrate, Padilla.  Courts often need to, and do, break new ground; it is the very premise of Teague that a decision can be right and also be novel.  All we say here is that Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the failure to advise about a non-criminal consequence could violate the \n \nSixth Amendment would not have been\xe2\x80\x94in fact, was not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9capparent to all reasonable jurists\xe2\x80\x9d prior to our decision.  Lambrix, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 527\xe2\x80\x93528.  Padilla thus announced a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tChaidez offers, and the dissent largely adopts, a different account of Padilla, in which we did no more than apply Strickland to a new set of facts.  On Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s view, Strickland insisted \xe2\x80\x9c[f]rom its inception\xe2\x80\x9d that all aspects of a criminal lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s performance pass a test of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonableness under prevailing professional norms\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d: The decision thus foreclosed any \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical distinction between direct and collateral consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 688).  Indeed, Chaidez contends, courts prior to Padilla recognized Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s all-encompassing scope and so applied its reasonableness standard to advice concerning deportation.  See Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9326; Reply Brief 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  She here points to caselaw in three federal appeals courts allowing ineffective assistance claims when attorneys affirmatively misled their clients about the deportation consequences of guilty pleas.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The only question left for Padilla to resolve, Chaidez claims, was whether professional norms also require criminal lawyers to volunteer advice about the risk of deportation.  In addressing that issue, she continues, Padilla did a run-of-the-mill Strickland analysis.  And more: It did an especially easy Strickland analysis.  We had earlier noted in INS v. St. Cyr, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289 (2001)\n\xe2\x80\x94a case raising an issue of immigration law unrelated to the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94that a \xe2\x80\x9ccompetent defense counsel\xe2\x80\x9d would inform his client about a guilty plea\xe2\x80\x99s deportation consequences.  Id., at 323, n. 50.  All Padilla had to do, Chaidez concludes, was recite that prior finding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s (and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s) story line is wrong, for reasons we have mostly already noted: Padilla had to develop new law, establishing that the \n \nSixth Amendment applied at all, before it could assess the performance of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer under Strickland.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 9.  Our first order of business was thus to consider whether the widely accepted distinction between direct and collateral consequences categorically foreclosed Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim, whatever the level of his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance.  We did not think, as Chaidez argues, that Strickland barred resort to that distinction.  Far from it: Even in Padilla we did not eschew the direct-collateral divide across the board.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether that distinction is [generally] appropriate is a question we need not consider in this case\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, we relied on the special \xe2\x80\x9cnature of deportation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the severity of the penalty and the \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d way it follows from conviction\xe2\x80\x94to show that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he collateral versus direct distinction [was] ill-suited\xe2\x80\x9d to dispose of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  All that reasoning came before we conducted a Strickland analysis (by examining professional norms and so forth), and none of it followed ineluctably from prior law.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPredictably, then, the caselaw Chaidez and the dissent cite fails to support their claim that lower courts \xe2\x80\x9caccepted that Strickland applied to deportation advice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 25; see post, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  True enough, three fed- eral circuits (and a handful of state courts) held before Pa-dilla that misstatements about deportation could support an ineffective assistance claim.  But those decisions reasoned only that a lawyer may not affirmatively misrepresent his expertise or otherwise actively mislead his client on any important matter, however related to a criminal prosecution.  See, e.g., United States v. Kwan, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d 1005, 1015\xe2\x80\x931017 (CA9 2005).  They co-existed happily with precedent, from the same jurisdictions (and almost all others), holding that deportation is not \xe2\x80\x9cso unique as to warrant an exception to the general rule that a defendant need not be advised of the [collateral] consequences of a guilty plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Campbell, 778 F.\xc2\xa02d 764, 769 (CA11 1985).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F14" name="T14">\n\t\t\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  So at most, Chaidez has shown that a minority of courts recognized a separate rule for material misrepresentations, regardless whether they concerned deportation or another collateral matter.  That limited rule does not apply to Chaidez\xe2\x80\x99s case.  And because it lived in harmony with the exclusion of claims like hers from the \n \nSixth Amendment, it does not establish what she needs to\xe2\x80\x94that all reasonable judges, prior to Padilla, thought they were living in a Padilla-like world.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor, finally, does St. Cyr have any relevance here.  That decision stated what is common sense (and what we again recognized in Padilla): A reasonably competent lawyer will tell a non-citizen client about a guilty plea\xe2\x80\x99s deportation consequences because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]reserving the client\xe2\x80\x99s right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Padilla, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 322).  But in saying that much, St. Cyr did not determine that the \n \nSixth Amendment requires a lawyer to provide such information.  Courts had held to the contrary not because advice about deportation was insignificant to a client\xe2\x80\x94really, who could think that, whether before or after St. Cyr?\xe2\x80\x94but because it concerned a matter collateral to the criminal prosecution.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F15" name="T15">\n\t\t\t\t\t15\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  On those courts\xe2\x80\x99 view, the \n \nSixth Amendment no more demanded competent advice about a plea\xe2\x80\x99s deportation consequences than it demanded competent representation in the deportation process itself.  Padilla decided that view was wrong.  But to repeat: It was Padilla that did so.  In the years following St. Cyr, not a single state or lower federal court considering a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide deportation advice abandoned the distinction between direct and collateral consequences, and several courts reaffirmed that divide.  See, e.g., Santos-Sanchez, 548 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 335\xe2\x80\x93336; Broomes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.\xc2\xa03d 1251, 1256\xe2\x80\x931257 (CA10 2004); United States v. Fry, 322 F.\xc2\xa03d 1198, 1200\xe2\x80\x931201 (CA9 2003).  It took Padilla to decide that in assessing such a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s performance, the \n \nSixth Amendment sets the standard.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F16" name="T16">\n\t\t\t\t\t16\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court announced a new rule in Padilla.

Had courts in fact considered professional standards in the slew of cases before Padilla that presented Padilla-like claims, they would have discovered as early as 1968 that the American Bar Association instructed criminal lawyers to advise their non-citizen clients about the risks of deportation.

Ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The Teague inquiry turns centrally on the \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the rule\xe2\x80\x9d in question, and for that reason, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the beginning point is a rule of . .\xc2\xa0. general application, . . . it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wright v. West, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 277\n\xe2\x80\x93309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); see ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The majority makes the important observation that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen all we do is apply a general standard to the kind of factual circumstances it was meant to address, we will rarely state a new rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  It makes sense, then, that \xe2\x80\x9cgarden-variety applications of . . . Strickland . . . do not produce new rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 5.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Strickland, we did not provide a comprehensive def- inition of deficient performance, and instead held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 688.  Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness prong therefore takes its content from the standards by which lawyers judge their professional obligations, ibid., and those standards are subject to change.  That is why, despite the many different settings in which it has been applied, we have never found that an application of Strickland resulted in a new rule.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSignificantly, we have previously found that applications of Strickland to new factual scenarios are not barred under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).  Section 2254(d)(1) precludes habeas relief unless a state court decision violates \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d which, as relevant here, largely overlaps with the inquiry under Teague of whether a decision was \xe2\x80\x9cdictated by precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301 (plurality opinion).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In Wiggins v.

Pursuant to the Immigration Act of 1917, \n\n39Stat.\n889\xe2\x80\x93890, a judge could recommend that a defendant who had committed a deportable offense not be removed from the country.

In St. Cyr, we had explained that the availability of discretionary relief from removal was critical to a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s decision to accept a plea offer, and expected counsel to follow the instructions of \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous practice guides,\xe2\x80\x9d such as the ABA\xe2\x80\x99s Standards for Criminal Justice, to inform themselves of the possible immigration consequences of a plea.

And we there found that many States already required that a trial judge advise defendants of the same.  Ibid.  St. Cyr thus \xe2\x80\x9crecognized that \xe2\x80\x98preserving the client\xe2\x80\x99s right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Padilla, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 322).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur application of Strickland in Padilla followed naturally from these earlier observations about changes in immigration law and the accompanying evolution of professional norms.  When we decided St. Cyr and Padilla, nothing about Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s substance or applicability had changed.  The only difference from prior law was that the underlying professional norms had changed such that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give this advice now amounted to constitutionally deficient performance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Both before Padilla and after, counsel was obligated to follow the relevant professional norms.

Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But that is wrong, because Padilla declined to embrace the very distinction between collateral and direct consequences of a criminal conviction that the majority says it did.  In fact, the Court stated very clearly that it found the distinction irrelevant for the purposes of determining a defense lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide advice about the immigration consequences of a plea.  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8).  We asserted that we had \xe2\x80\x9cnever applied a dis- tinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \xe2\x80\x98reasonable professional assistance\xe2\x80\x99 required under Strickland,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether that distinction is appropriate is a question we need not consider in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (emphasis added).  The distinction was \xe2\x80\x9cill suited\xe2\x80\x9d to the task at hand, we explained, because deportation has a \xe2\x80\x9cclose connection to the criminal process,\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur law ha[d] enmeshed criminal convictions and the penalty of de- portation for nearly a century,\xe2\x80\x9d and we had \xe2\x80\x9clong recognized\xe2\x80\x9d that deportation is \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly severe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt bottom, then, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument hinges upon a distinction the Court has never embraced and that Padilla found irrelevant to the issue it ultimately decided.  Without this revision to our recent decisional history, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis unravels.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority finds that the \xe2\x80\x9clegal landscape,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham v. Collins, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461, \n468 (1993)\n, before Padilla was nearly uniform in its rejection of Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s application to the deportation consequences of a plea.  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310.  It concludes that the lower courts were generally in agreement that the \n \nSixth Amendment did not require attorneys to inform clients of the collateral consequences of a plea, and that this weighs heavily in favor of finding that Padilla announced a new rule.  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, nn. 7, 8.  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of these precedents operates at too high a level of generality and fails to account for the development of professional standards over time.  St. Cyr noted the importance of advising clients about immigration consequences was of recent vintage, indeed more re- cent than some of the cases the majority cites.  See 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 322\xe2\x80\x93323.  The Court relies upon decisions issued over a period that spans more than 30 years.  See ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, nn. 7, 8.  Nearly half of them (17) were decided before the enactment of IIRIRA.  See ibid.  And all but two of the Federal Court of Appeals cases were decided before St. Cyr.  See ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, nn. 7, 8.  These earlier decisions show nothing more than that the underlying professional norms had not yet evolved to require attorneys to provide advice about deportation consequences.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCases from the period following IIRIRA and St. Cyr undermine the majority\xe2\x80\x99s generalizations about the state of the law before Padilla.  Deportation had long been un- derstood by lower courts to present \xe2\x80\x9cthe most difficult\xe2\x80\x9d penalty to classify as either a collateral or direct consequence.  United States v. Russell, 686 F.\xc2\xa02d 35, 38 (CADC 1982); cf. Janvier v. United States, 793 F.\xc2\xa02d 449, 455 (CA2 1986) (holding that Strickland applied to advice about a judicial recommendation against deportation). Eventually, and in parallel with changes in federal immigration law and the corresponding professional norms, the lower courts had acknowledged an important qualification to the collateral consequences rule.  After the passage of IIRIRA and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in St. Cyr, many courts concluded that a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative misstatements about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea can constitute deficient performance under Strickland.  Indeed, each Federal Court of Appeals to address the question after St. Cyr so held.  See United States v. Couto, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d 1005, 1015 (CA9 2005); cf. Downs-Morgan v. United States, 765 F.\xc2\xa02d 1534, 1540\xe2\x80\x931541 (CA11 1985).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  State-court decisions from this period were in accord and relied upon similar reasoning.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese decisions created an important exception to the collateral/direct consequences distinction.  They also foreshadowed the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in Padilla by basing their analysis of the relevant professional norms on the special nature of deportation, the ABA standards governing immigration practice, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of those standards in St Cyr.  See Kwan, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1016 (\xe2\x80\x9cThat counsel may have misled [the defendant] out of ignorance is no excuse.  It is a basic rule of professional conduct that a lawyer must .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [remain] abreast of changes in the law and its practice.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The Supreme Court noted this standard in [St. Cyr]\xe2\x80\x9d); Couto, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 187\xe2\x80\x93191 (citing St. Cyr and the relevant ABA standards, and concluding that \xe2\x80\x9crecent Supreme Court authority supports [a] broader view of attorney responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d that encompasses affirmative misrepresentations about deportation consequences); see also Downs-Morgan, 765 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1541 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]eportation and exclusion [are] harsh consequences\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority believes that these decisions did not meaningfully alter the state of the law in the lower courts before Padilla, because they merely applied the age-old principle that a lawyer may not affirmatively mislead a client.  Ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But, as explained, the reasoning of these cases renders that characterization at best incomplete.  See, e.g., Kwan, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1016.  While these lower court precedents are consistent with the general principle that attorneys should not mislead clients by providing incorrect advice, they did not rest primarily on that rule.  Rather, they recognized the significant changes in professional norms that predated Padilla and that we had noted in St. Cyr.  As a consequence, the \xe2\x80\x9cwall between direct and collateral consequences\xe2\x80\x9d that the lower courts had erected, ante, at 9, had already been dealt a serious blow by the time the Court decided Padilla.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the majority points out, these misrepresentation cases stopped short of imposing an affirmative obligation on lawyers to consult with clients about the consequences of deportation.  Ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But the majority places too much emphasis on the absence of lower court authority finding that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s omissions with respect to deportation resulted in ineffective assistance.  The distinction between omissions and affirmative misrepresentations on which these lower court cases depended cannot be reconciled with Strickland.  In Padilla itself, we rejected the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Strickland should apply to advice about the immigration consequences of a plea only in cases where defense counsel makes an affirmative misstatement.  Padilla, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  We did so because we found that Strickland was incompatible with the distinction between an obligation to give advice and a prohibition on affirmative misstatements.  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313) (citing Strickland, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 690).  Strickland made clear that its standard of attorney performance applied to both \xe2\x80\x9cacts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9comissions,\xe2\x80\x9d and that a rule limiting the performance inquiry to one or the other was too narrow.  466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 690.  Thus, the distinction between misrepresentations and omissions, on which the majority relies in classifying lower court precedent, implies a categorical rule that is inconsistent with Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of a case-by-case assessment of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Id., at 688\xe2\x80\x93689; see, e.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 470, \n479 (2000)\n.  In short, that some courts have differentiated between misleading by silence and affirmative misrep- resentation hardly establishes the rationality of the distinction.  Notably, the Court offers no reasoned basis for believing that such a distinction can be extracted from Strickland.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, lower courts did continue to apply the distinction between collateral and direct consequences after St. Cyr.  See ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314; see, e.g., Broomes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.\xc2\xa03d 1251, 1256\xe2\x80\x931257 (CA10 2004).  Even so, and even assuming the misrepresentation cases did not call the distinction into question, the existence of these lower court decisions is not dispositive.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he standard for determining when a case establishes a new rule is \xe2\x80\x98objective,\xe2\x80\x99 and the mere existence of conflicting authority does not necessarily mean a rule is new.\xe2\x80\x9d Wright, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 304 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (citing Stringer v.

Nevertheless, the majority reaches the paradoxical conclusion that by declining to apply a collateral-consequence doctrine the Court had never adopted, Padilla announced a new rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat truly appears to drive the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is its sense that Padilla occasioned a serious disruption in lower court decisional reasoning.  See, e.g., ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf that does not count as \xe2\x80\x98break[ing] new ground\xe2\x80\x99 . . . we are hard pressed to know what would\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Teague, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301)).  The concurring and dissenting opinions in Padilla similarly reflected the impression that it was a significant and destabilizing decision.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3); id., at ___  (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (describing the majority opinion as a \xe2\x80\x9csledge hammer\xe2\x80\x9d); ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n. 10.  But the fact that a decision was perceived as momentous or consequential, particularly by those who disagreed with it, does not control in the Teague analysis.  Faithfully applying the Teague rule depends instead on an examination of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning and an objective assessment of the precedent at issue.  Stringer, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 237.  In Padilla, we did nothing more than apply Strickland.  By holding to the contrary, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision deprives defendants of the fundamental protection of Strickland, which requires that lawyers comply with professional norms with respect to any advice they provide to clients.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit and hold that Padilla applies retroactively on collateral review to convictions that became final before its announcement.
