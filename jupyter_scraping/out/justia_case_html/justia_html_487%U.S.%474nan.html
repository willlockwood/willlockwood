S. 476</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Brookfield, Wisconsin, has adopted an ordinance that completely bans picketing "before or about" any residence.  This case presents a facial First Amendment challenge to that ordinance.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Brookfield, Wisconsin, is a residential suburb of Milwaukee with a population of approximately 4,300.  The appellees, Sandra C. Schultz and Robert C. Braun, are individuals strongly opposed to abortion, and wish to express their views on the subject by picketing on a public street outside the Brookfield residence of a doctor who apparently performs abortions at two clinics in neighboring towns.  Appellees and others engaged in precisely that activity, assembling outside the doctor\'s home on at least six occasions between April 20, 1985, and May 20, 1985, for periods ranging from one to one and a half hours.  The size of the group varied from 11 to more than 40.  The picketing was generally orderly and peaceful; the town never had occasion to invoke any of its various ordinances prohibiting obstruction of the streets, loud and unnecessary noises, or disorderly conduct.  Nonetheless, the picketing generated substantial controversy and numerous complaints.</p>\n<p>The Town Board therefore resolved to enact an ordinance to restrict the picketing.  On May 7, 1985, the town passed an ordinance that prohibited all picketing in residential neighborhoods except for labor picketing.  But after reviewing this Court\'s decision in <em>Carey v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html">447 U. S. 455</a></span> (1980), which invalidated a similar ordinance as a violation of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 487 U. S. 477</a></p><p> Equal Protection Clause, the town attorney instructed the police not to enforce the new ordinance and advised the town Board that the ordinance\'s labor picketing exception likely rendered it unconstitutional.  This ordinance was repealed on May 15, 1985, and replaced with the following flat ban on all residential picketing:</p>\n<p>"It is unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual in the Town of Brookfield."</p>\n<p>App. to Juris. Statement A-28.</p>\n<p>The ordinance itself recites the primary purpose of this ban:  "the protection and preservation of the home" through assurance "that members of the community enjoy in their homes and dwellings a feeling of wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy."  <em>Id.</em> at A-26.  The Town Board believed that a ban was necessary because it determined that</p>\n<p>"the practice of picketing before or about residences and dwellings causes emotional disturbance and distress to the occupants . . . [and] has as its object the harassing of such occupants."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at A-26 - A-27.  The ordinance also evinces a concern for public safety, noting that picketing obstructs and interferes with "the free use of public sidewalks and public ways of travel."  <em>Id.</em> at A-27.</p>\n<p>On May 18, 1985, appellees were informed by the town attorney that enforcement of the new, revised ordinance would begin on May 21, 1985.  Faced with this threat of arrest and prosecution, appellees ceased picketing in Brookfield and filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  The complaint was brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, and sought declaratory as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief on the grounds that the ordinance violated the First Amendment.  Appellees named appellants -- the three members of the Town Board, the Chief of Police, the town attorney, and the town itself -- as defendants. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 487 U. S. 478</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court granted appellees\' motion for a preliminary injunction.  The court concluded that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored enough to restrict protected speech in a public forum.  619 F.Supp. 792, 797 (1985).  The District Court\'s order specified that unless the appellants requested a trial on the merits within 60 days or appealed, the preliminary injunction would become permanent.  Appellants requested a trial and also appealed the District Court\'s entry of a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  807 F.2d 1339 (1986).  The Court of Appeals subsequently vacated this decision, however, and ordered a rehearing en banc.  818 F.2d 1284 (1987).  After rehearing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court by an equally divided vote.  822 F.2d 642 (1987).  Contending that the Court of Appeals had rendered a final judgment holding the ordinance "to be invalid as repugnant to the Constitution," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(2), appellants attempted to invoke our mandatory appellate jurisdiction.   App. to Juris. Statement A-25 (citing \xc2\xa7 1254(2)).  We postponed further consideration of our appellate jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits.  484 U.S. 1003 (1988).</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that there is no jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1254(2) due to the lack of finality.  They point out that the District Court entered only a preliminary injunction, and that appellants requested a trial on the merits, which has yet to be conducted.  These considerations certainly suggest a lack of finality.  Yet despite the formally tentative nature of its order, the District Court appeared ready to enter a final judgment, since it indicated that, unless a trial was requested, a permanent injunction would issue.  In addition, while appellants initially requested a trial, they no longer adhere to this position, and now say that they would have no additional arguments to offer at such a trial.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.  In the context of this case, however, there is no need to decide </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 487 U. S. 479</a></p><p> whether jurisdiction is proper under \xc2\xa7 1254(2).  Because the question presented is of substantial importance, and because further proceedings below would not likely aid our consideration of it, we choose to avoid the finality issue simply by granting certiorari.  Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and, treating the jurisdictional statement as a petition for certiorari, now grant the petition.  <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2103.  <em>Cf. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/354/case.html#369">487 U. S. 369</a></span>, n. 10 (1988).  For convenience, however, we shall continue to refer to the parties as appellants and appellees, as we have in previous cases.  <em>See ibid.; Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/80/case.html">485 U.

S. 84</a></span>, n. 4 (1988).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The antipicketing ordinance operates at the core of the First Amendment by prohibiting appellees from engaging in picketing on an issue of public concern.  Because of the importance of "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" debate on public issues, <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#270">376 U. S. 270</a></span> (1964), we have traditionally subjected restrictions on public issue picketing to careful scrutiny.  <em>See, e.g., Boos v. Barry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html">485 U. S. 312</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html#318">485 U. S. 318</a></span> (1988); <em>United States v. Grace,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/171/case.html">461 U. S. 171</a></span> (1983); <em>Carey v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html">447 U. S. 455</a></span> (1980).  Of course, "[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times." <em> Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html">473 U. S. 788</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#799">473 U. S. 799</a></span> (1985).</p>\n<p>To ascertain what limits, if any, may be placed on protected speech, we have often focused on the "place" of that speech, considering the nature of the forum the speaker seeks to employ.  Our cases have recognized that the standards by which limitations on speech must be evaluated "differ depending on the character of the property at issue."  <em>Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\' Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html">460 U. S. 37</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#44">460 U. S. 44</a></span> (1983).  Specifically, we have identified three types of fora:  "the traditional public forum, the public forum created </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 487 U. S. 480</a></p><p> by government designation, and the nonpublic forum."  <em>Cornelius, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#802">473 U. S. 802</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The relevant forum here may be easily identified:  appellees wish to picket on the public streets of Brookfield.  Ordinarily, a determination of the nature of the forum would follow automatically from this identification; we have repeatedly referred to public streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum.  <em>See, e.g., Boos v. Barry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html#318">485 U. S. 318</a></span>; <em>Cornelius, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#802">473 U. S. 802</a></span>; <em>Perry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#45">460 U. S. 45</a></span>.  "[T]ime out of mind," public streets and sidewalks have been used for public assembly and debate, the hallmarks of a traditional public forum.  <em>See ibid.; Hague v. CIO,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html">307 U. S. 496</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html#515">307 U. S. 515</a></span> (1939) (Roberts, J.).  Appellants, however, urge us to disregard these "cliches."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  They argue that the streets of Brookfield should be considered a nonpublic forum.  Pointing to the physical narrowness of Brookfield\'s streets as well as to their residential character, appellants contend that such streets have not by tradition or designation been held open for public communication.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellants 23 (citing <em>Perry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#46">460 U. S. 46</a></span>).</p>\n<p>We reject this suggestion.  Our prior holdings make clear that a public street does not lose its status as a traditional public forum simply because it runs through a residential neighborhood.  In <em>Carey v. Brown</em> -- which considered a statute similar to the one at issue here, ultimately striking it down as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because it included an exception for labor picketing -- we expressly recognized that "public streets and sidewalks in residential neighborhoods," were "public for[a]."  447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/426/case.html#460">337 U. S. 460</a></span>-461.  This rather ready identification virtually forecloses appellants\' argument.  <em>See also Perry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/42/case.html#54">487 U. S. 54</a></span>-55 (noting that the "key" to Carey "was the presence of a public forum").</p>\n<p>In short, our decisions identifying public streets and sidewalks as traditional public fora are not accidental invocations of a "cliche," but recognition that "[w]herever the title of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 487 U. S. 481</a></p><p> streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public."  <em>Hague v. CIO, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html#515">307 U. S. 515</a></span> (Roberts, J.).  No particularized inquiry into the precise nature of a specific street is necessary; all public streets are held in the public trust, and are properly considered traditional public fora.  Accordingly, the streets of Brookfield are traditional public fora.  The residential character of those streets may well inform the application of the relevant test, but it does not lead to a different test; the antipicketing ordinance must be judged against the stringent standards we have established for restrictions on speech in traditional public fora:</p>\n<p>"In these quintessential public for[a], the government may not prohibit all communicative activity.  For the State to enforce a content-based exclusion, it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. . . .  The State may also enforce regulations of the time, place, and manner of expression which are content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication."</p>\n<p><em>Perry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#45">460 U. S. 45</a></span> (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>As <em>Perry</em> makes clear, the appropriate level of scrutiny is initially tied to whether the statute distinguishes between prohibited and permitted speech on the basis of content.  Appellees argue that, despite its facial content-neutrality, the Brookfield ordinance must be read as containing an implied exception for labor picketing.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellees 20-26.  The basis for appellees\' argument is their belief that an express protection of peaceful labor picketing in state law, <em>see</em> Wis.Stat. \xc2\xa7 103.53(1) (1985-1986), must take precedence over Brookfield\'s contrary efforts.  The District Court, however, rejected this suggested interpretation of state law, 619 F.Supp. at 796, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, albeit ultimately by an equally divided court.  822 F.2d 642 (1987). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 487 U.

Thus, we accept the lower courts\' conclusion that the Brookfield ordinance is content-neutral.  Accordingly, we turn to consider whether the ordinance is "narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest," and whether it "leave[s] open ample alternative channels of communication."  <em>Perry,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#45">460 U. S. 45</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Because the last question is so easily answered, we address it first.  Of course, before we are able to assess the available alternatives, we must consider more carefully the reach of the ordinance.  The precise scope of the ban is not further described within the text of the ordinance, but, in our view, the ordinance is readily subject to a narrowing construction that avoids constitutional difficulties.  Specifically, the use of the singular form of the words "residence" and "dwelling" suggests that the ordinance is intended to prohibit only picketing focused on, and taking place in front of, a particular residence.  As JUSTICE WHITE\'s concurrence recounts, the lower courts described the ordinance as banning "all picketing in residential areas."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#490">487 U. S. 490</a></span>.  But these general descriptions do not address the exact scope of the ordinance, and are in no way inconsistent with our reading of its text.  "Picketing," after all, is defined as posting at a particular place, <em>see</em> Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 1710 (1981), a characterization in line with viewing the ordinance as limited to activity focused on a single residence. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 487 U. S. 483</a></p><p>  Moreover, while we ordinarily defer to lower court constructions of state statutes, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#482">487 U. S. 482</a></span>, we do not invariably do so, <em>see Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/383/case.html#395">484 U. S. 395</a></span>.  We are particularly reluctant to defer when the lower courts have fallen into plain error, <em>see Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/case.html#500">472 U. S. 500</a></span>, n. 9, which is precisely the situation presented here.  To the extent they endorsed a broad reading of the ordinance, the lower courts ran afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.  <em>See, e.g., Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/case.html">422 U.

Thus, unlike the lower courts\' judgment that the ordinance does not contain an implied exception for labor picketing, we are unable to accept their potentially broader view of the ordinance\'s scope.  We instead construe the ordinance more narrowly.  This narrow reading is supported by the representations of counsel for the town at oral argument, which indicate that the town takes, and will enforce, a limited view of the "picketing" proscribed by the ordinance.  Thus, generally speaking, "picketing would be having the picket proceed on a definite course or route in front of a home."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  The picket need not be carrying a sign, <em>id.</em> at 14, but, in order to fall within the scope of the ordinance, the picketing must be directed at a single residence, <em>id.</em> at 9.  General marching through residential neighborhoods, or even walking a route in front of an entire block of houses, is not prohibited by this ordinance.  <em>Id.</em> at 15.  Accordingly, we construe the ban to be a limited one; only focused picketing taking place solely in front of a particular residence is prohibited.</p>\n<p>So narrowed, the ordinance permits the more general dissemination of a message.  As appellants explain, the limited nature of the prohibition makes it virtually self-evident that ample alternatives remain: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 487 U. S. 484</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"Protestors have not been barred from the residential neighborhoods.  They may enter such neighborhoods, alone or in groups, even marching. . . .  They may go door-to-door to proselytize their views.  They may distribute literature in this manner . . . or through the mails.  They may contact residents by telephone, short of harassment."</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellants 41-42 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>We readily agree that the ordinance preserves ample alternative channels of communication, and thus move on to inquire whether the ordinance serves a significant government interest.  We find that such an interest is identified within the text of the ordinance itself:  the protection of residential privacy.  <em>See</em> App. to Juris. Statement A-26.</p>\n<p>"The State\'s interest in protecting the wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy of the home is certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society."</p>\n<p><em>Carey v.

Although, in many locations, we expect individuals simply to avoid speech they do not want to hear, <em>cf. Erznoznik v.

Instead, a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own walls, which the State may legislate to protect, is an ability </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 487 U. S. 485</a></p><p> to avoid intrusions.  Thus, we have repeatedly held that individuals are not required to welcome unwanted speech into their own homes, and that the government may protect this freedom.  <em>See, e.g., FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/case.html">438 U.

S. 86</a></span>-87 (1949) (sound trucks).</p>\n<p>This principle is reflected even in prior decisions in which we have invalidated complete bans on expressive activity, including bans operating in residential areas.  <em>See, e.g., Schneider v. State,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/147/case.html">308 U. S. 147</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/147/case.html#162">308 U.

S. 141</a></span> (1943) (door-to-door solicitation).  In all such cases, we have been careful to acknowledge that unwilling listeners may be protected when within their own homes.  In <em>Schneider,</em> for example, in striking down a complete ban on handbilling, we spoke of a right to distribute literature only "to one willing to receive it."  Similarly, when we invalidated a ban on door-to-door solicitation in <em>Martin,</em> we did so on the basis that the "home owner could protect himself from such intrusion by an appropriate sign <em>that he is unwilling to be disturbed.\'"  <em>Kovacs,</em> 336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#86">336 U. S. 86</a></span>.  We have "never intimated that the visitor could insert a foot in the door and insist on a hearing."  <em>Ibid.</em>  There simply is no right to force speech into the home of an unwilling listener.\n</em></p>\n<p>It remains to be considered, however, whether the Brookfield ordinance is narrowly tailored to protect only unwilling recipients of the communications.  A statute is narrowly tailored if it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the "evil" it seeks to remedy.  <em>City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html">466 U. S. 789</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html#808">466 U. S. 808</a></span>-810 (1984).  A complete ban can be narrowly tailored, but only if each activity within the proscription\'s scope is an appropriately targeted evil.  For example, in <em>Taxpayers for Vincent,</em> we upheld an ordinance that banned all signs on public property </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 487 U. S. 486</a></p><p> because the interest supporting the regulation, an esthetic interest in avoiding visual clutter and blight, rendered each sign an evil.  Complete prohibition was necessary because</p>\n<p>"the substantive evil -- visual blight -- [was] not merely a possible byproduct of the activity, but [was] created by the medium of expression itself."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html#810">466 U. S. 810</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The same is true here.  The type of focused picketing prohibited by the Brookfield ordinance is fundamentally different from more generally directed means of communication that may not be completely banned in residential areas.  <em>See, e.g., Schneider, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/157/case.html#162">380 U. S. 162</a></span>-163 (handbilling); <em>Martin, supra,</em> (solicitation); <em>Murdock v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/105/case.html">319 U. S. 105</a></span> (1943) (solicitation).  <em>See also Gregory v. Chicago, supra,</em> (marching).  <em>Cf. Perry,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#45">460 U. S. 45</a></span> (in traditional public forum, "the government may not prohibit all communicative activity").  In such cases "the flow of information [is not] into . . . household[s], but to the public."  <em>Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html">402 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html#420">402 U. S. 420</a></span> (1971).  Here, in contrast, the picketing is narrowly directed at the household, not the public.  The type of picketers banned by the Brookfield ordinance generally do not seek to disseminate a message to the general public, but to intrude upon the targeted resident, and to do so in an especially offensive way.  Moreover, even if some such picketers have a broader communicative purpose, their activity nonetheless inherently and offensively intrudes on residential privacy.  The devastating effect of targeted picketing on the quiet enjoyment of the home is beyond doubt:</p>\n<p>"\'To those inside, . . . the home becomes something less than a home when and while the picketing . . . continue[s]. . . .  [The] tensions and pressures may be psychological, not physical, but they are not, for that reason, less inimical to family privacy and truly domestic tranquility.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Carey,</em> 447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html#478">447 U.

S. 487</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In this case, for example, appellees subjected the doctor and his family to the presence of a relatively large group of protestors on their doorstep in an attempt to force the doctor to cease performing abortions.  But the actual size of the group is irrelevant; even a solitary picket can invade residential privacy.  <em>See Carey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html#478">447 U. S. 478</a></span>-479 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) ("Whether . . . alone or accompanied by others . . . there are few of us that would feel comfortable knowing that a stranger lurks outside our home").  The offensive and disturbing nature of the form of the communication banned by the Brookfield ordinance thus can scarcely be questioned.  <em>Cf. Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/60/case.html">463 U.

Youngs Drug Products Corp., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/60/case.html#72">463 U. S. 72</a></span>.  The target of the focused picketing banned by the Brookfield ordinance is just such a "captive."  The resident is figuratively, and perhaps literally, trapped within the home, and, because of the unique and subtle impact of such picketing, is left with no ready means of avoiding the unwanted speech.  <em>Cf. Cohen v. California,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/case.html#21">403 U. S. 21</a></span>-22 (noting ease of avoiding unwanted speech in other circumstances).  Thus, the "evil" of targeted residential picketing, "the very presence of an unwelcome visitor at the home," <em>Carey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html#478">447 U. S. 478</a></span> (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting), is "created by the medium of expression itself."  <em>See Taxpayers for Vincent, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html#810">466 U. S. 810</a></span>.  Accordingly, the Brookfield ordinance\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 487 U. S. 488</a></p><p> complete ban of that particular medium of expression is narrowly tailored.</p>\n<p>Of course, this case presents only a facial challenge to the ordinance.  Particular hypothetical applications of the ordinance -- to, for example, a particular resident\'s use of his or her home as a place of business or public meeting, or to picketers present at a particular home by invitation of the resident -- may present somewhat different questions.  Initially, the ordinance by its own terms may not apply in such circumstances, since the ordinance\'s goal is the protection of residential privacy, App. to Juris. Statement A-26, and since it speaks only of a "residence or dwelling," not a place of business, <em>id.</em> at A-28.  <em>Cf. Carey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html#457">447 U. S. 457</a></span> (quoting an antipicketing ordinance expressly rendered inapplicable by use of home as a place of business or to hold a public meeting).  Moreover, since our First Amendment analysis is grounded in protection of the unwilling residential listener, the constitutionality of applying the ordinance to such hypotheticals remains open to question.  These are, however, questions we need not address today in order to dispose of appellees\' facial challenge.</p>\n<p>Because the picketing prohibited by the Brookfield ordinance is speech directed primarily at those who are presumptively unwilling to receive it, the State has a substantial and justifiable interest in banning it.  The nature and scope of this interest make the ban narrowly tailored.  The ordinance also leaves open ample alternative channels of communication and is content-neutral.  Thus, largely because of its narrow scope, the facial challenge to the ordinance must fail.  The contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that an ordinance which only forbade picketing before a single residence would not be unconstitutional on its face.  If such an ordinance were applied to the kind of picketing that appellees carried out here, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 487 U. S. 489</a></p><p> clearly would not be invalid under the First Amendment, for the picketing in this case involved large groups of people, ranging at various times from 11 individuals to more than 40.  I am convinced, absent more than this record indicates, that, if some single-residence picketing by smaller groups could not be forbidden, the range of possibly unconstitutional application of such an ordinance would not render it substantially overbroad, and thus unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>This leaves the question, however, of whether the ordinance at issue in this case forbids only single-residence picketing.  The Court says that the language of the ordinance suggests that it is so limited.  But the ordinance forbids "any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual in the Town of Brookfield."  Brookfield, Wis., Gen.Code \xc2\xa7 9.17(2), App. to Juris. Statement A-28.  That language could easily be construed to reach not only picketing before a single residence, but also picketing that would deliver the desired message about a particular residence to the neighbors and to other passersby.  Arguably, it would also reach picketing that is directed at the residences which are located in entire blocks or in larger residential areas.  Indeed, the latter is the more natural reading of the ordinance, which seems to prohibit picketing in any area that is located "before or about" any residence or dwelling in the town, <em>i.e.,</em> any picketing that occurs either in front of or anywhere around the residences that are located within the town.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is no authoritative construction of this ordinance by the Wisconsin state courts that limits the scope of the proscription.  There is, however, the interpretation that has been rendered in this case by both the lower federal courts with jurisdiction over the town whose law is at issue, which we rarely overturn and to which we routinely defer unless there is some fairly compelling argument for not doing so -- an established practice that the Court relies on to resolve another aspect of this case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#482">487 U. S. 482</a></span>.  As I understand </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 487 U. S. 490</a></p><p> the District Court, it did not accept the construction of the ordinance which is urged here, holding instead that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to meet the town\'s stated objectives, but "completely bans all picketing in residential neighborhoods," 619 F.Supp. 792, 797 (ED Wis.1985), and is not "a constitutional time, place, and manner regulation of speech in a public forum," <em>id.</em> at 798.  The panel that heard this case in the Court of Appeals, the opinion of which was of course vacated below, also thought that the question raised by the ordinance concerned the general validity of picketing "<em>in a residential neighborhood,</em>" 807 F.2d 1339, 1348 (CA7 1986) (emphasis in original), and observed that the ordinance "restricts picketing" in the town "to the commercial strip along West Bluemound Road," <em>ibid.</em>  The dissenting judge also understood the ordinance to have confined the ambit of lawful picketing to "any non-residential area."  <em>Id.</em> at 1356 (Coffey, J., dissenting).  Finally, I do not read the briefs filed by appellants in this Court to have argued that the ordinance should be narrowly construed to apply only to single-residence picketing.  To the contrary, appellants\' briefs in this Court repeatedly refer to the ordinance as banning all picketing in residential areas.  Brief for Appellants 12-13, 13, 41, 42, 43; Reply Brief for Appellants 2, 8.</p>\n<p>The Court endorses a narrow construction of the ordinance by relying on the town counsel\'s representations, made at oral argument, that the ordinance forbids only single-residence picketing.  In light of the view taken by the lower federal courts and the apparent failure of counsel below to press on those courts the narrowing construction that has been suggested here, I have reservations about relying on counsel\'s statements as an authoritative statement of the law.  It is true that, several times in the past, the Court, in reaching its decision on the validity of a statute, has relied on what it considered to be reliable and perhaps binding representations made by state and federal officials as to how a particular statute will be enforced.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/312/case.html">DeFunis v.

But in none of these cases did the Court accept a suggested limiting construction of a state law that appears to be contrary to the views of the lower federal courts.</p>\n<p>There is nevertheless sufficient force in the town counsel\'s representations about the reach of the ordinance to avoid application of the overbreadth doctrine in this case, which as we have frequently emphasized is such "strong medicine" that it "has been employed by the Court sparingly, and only as a last resort."  <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html">413 U.

In my view, if the ordinance were construed to forbid all picketing in residential neighborhoods, the overbreadth doctrine would render it unconstitutional on its face, and hence prohibit its enforcement against those, like appellees, who engage in single-residence picketing.  At least this would be the case until the ordinance is limited in some authoritative manner.  Because the representations made in this Court by the town\'s legal officer create sufficient doubts in my mind, however, as to how the ordinance will be enforced by the town or construed by the state courts, I would put aside the overbreadth approach here, sustain the ordinance as applied in this case, which the Court at least does, and await further developments.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court today sets out the appropriate legal tests and standards governing the question presented, and proceeds to apply most of them correctly.  Regrettably, though, the Court errs in the final step of its analysis, and approves an ordinance banning significantly more speech than is necessary to achieve the government\'s substantial and legitimate goal.  Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>\n<p>The ordinance before us absolutely prohibits picketing "before or about" any residence in the town of Brookfield, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 487 U. S. 492</a></p><p> thereby restricting a manner of speech in a traditional public forum. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Consequently, as the Court correctly states, the ordinance is subject to the well-settled time, place, and manner test:  the restriction must be content- and viewpoint-neutral, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] leave open ample alternative channels of communication, and be narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#482">487 U.

I also agree with the Court that the town has a substantial interest in protecting its residents\' right to be left alone in their homes.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#484">487 U. S. 484</a></span>-485; <em>Carey v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html">447 U.

It is, however, critical to specify the precise scope of this interest.  The mere fact that speech takes place in a residential neighborhood does not automatically implicate a residential privacy interest.  It is the intrusion of speech into the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 487 U. S. 493</a></p><p> home or the unduly coercive nature of a particular manner of speech around the home that is subject to more exacting regulation.  Thus, the intrusion into the home of an unwelcome solicitor, <em>Martin v. Struthers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/141/case.html">319 U. S. 141</a></span> (1943), or unwanted mail, <em>Rowan v. Post Office Dept.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/728/case.html">397 U. S. 728</a></span> (1970), may be forbidden.  Similarly, the government may forbid the intrusion of excessive noise into the home, <em>Kovacs v. Cooper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html">336 U. S. 77</a></span> (1949), or, in appropriate circumstances, perhaps even radio waves, <em>FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/case.html">438 U. S. 726</a></span> (1978).  Similarly, the government may prohibit unduly coercive conduct around the home, even though it involves expressive elements.  A crowd of protestors need not be permitted virtually to imprison a person in his or her own house merely because they shout slogans or carry signs.  But so long as the speech remains outside the home and does not unduly coerce the occupant, the government\'s heightened interest in protecting residential privacy is not implicated.  <em>See Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html">402 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html#420">402 U. S. 420</a></span> (1971).</p>\n<p>The foregoing distinction is crucial here, because it directly affects the last prong of the time, place, and manner test:  whether the ordinance is narrowly tailored to achieve the governmental interest.  I do not quarrel with the Court\'s reliance on <em>City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html">466 U. S. 789</a></span> (1984), for the proposition that a blanket prohibition of a manner of speech in particular public fora may nonetheless be "narrowly tailored" if in each case the manner of speech forbidden necessarily produces the very "evil" the government seeks to eradicate.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#485">487 U. S. 485</a></span>-486; <em>Vincent,</em> 466 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html#808">466 U.

However, the application of this test requires that the government demonstrate that the offending aspects of the prohibited manner of speech cannot be separately, and less intrusively, controlled.  Thus here, if the intrusive and unduly coercive elements of residential picketing can be eliminated without simultaneously eliminating residential picketing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 487 U. S. 494</a></p><p> completely, the Brookfield ordinance fails the <em>Vincent</em> test.</p>\n<p>Without question, there are many aspects of residential picketing that, if unregulated, might easily become intrusive or unduly coercive.  Indeed, some of these aspects are illustrated by this very case.  As the District Court found, before the ordinance took effect, up to 40 sign-carrying, slogan-shouting protestors regularly converged on Dr. Victoria\'s home, and, in addition to protesting, warned young children not to go near the house because Dr. Victoria was a "baby killer."  Further, the throng repeatedly trespassed onto the Victorias\' property, and at least once blocked the exits to their home.  619 F.Supp. 792, 795 (ED Wis.1985).  Surely it is within the government\'s power to enact regulations as necessary to prevent such intrusive and coercive abuses.  Thus, for example, the government could constitutionally regulate the number of residential picketers, the hours during which a residential picket may take place, or the noise level of such a picket.  In short, substantial regulation is permitted to neutralize the intrusive or unduly coercive aspects of picketing around the home.  But to say that picketing may be substantially regulated is not to say that it may be prohibited in its entirety.  Once size, time, volume, and the like have been controlled to ensure that the picket is no longer intrusive or coercive, only the speech itself remains, conveyed perhaps by a lone, silent individual, walking back and forth with a sign.  <em>Cf. NLRB v. Retail Store Employees,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/607/case.html">447 U. S. 607</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/607/case.html#618">447 U. S. 618</a></span> (1980) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).  Such speech, which no longer implicates the heightened governmental interest in residential privacy, is nevertheless banned by the Brookfield law.  Therefore, the ordinance is not narrowly tailored.</p>\n<p>The Court nonetheless attempts to justify the town\'s sweeping prohibition.  Central to the Court\'s analysis is the determination that: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 487 U. S. 495</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[I]n contrast [to other forms of communication], the picketing [here] is narrowly directed at the household, not the public.  The type of picketers banned by the Brookfield ordinance generally do not seek to disseminate a message to the general public, but to intrude upon the targeted resident, and to do so in an especially offensive way.  Moreover, even if some such picketers have a broader communicative purpose, their activity nonetheless inherently and offensively intrudes on residential privacy."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#486">487 U. S. 486</a></span>.</p>\n<p>That reasoning is flawed.  First, the ordinance applies to all picketers, not just those engaged in the protest giving rise to this challenge.  Yet the Court cites no evidence to support its assertion that picketers generally, or even appellees specifically, desire to communicate only with the "targeted resident."  (In fact, the District Court, on the basis of an uncontradicted affidavit, found that appellees sought to communicate with both Dr. Victoria and with the public.  619 F.Supp. at 795.)  While picketers\' signs might be seen from the resident\'s house, they are also visible to passersby.  To be sure, the audience is limited to those within sight of the picket, but focusing speech does not strip it of constitutional protection.  Even the site-specific aspect of the picket identifies to the public the object of the picketers\' attention.  <em>Cf. Boos v. Barry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html">485 U. S. 312</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html#331">485 U. S. 331</a></span> (1988).  Nor does the picketers\' ultimate goal -- to influence the resident\'s conduct -- change the analysis; as the Court held in <em>Keefe, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html#419">402 U. S. 419</a></span>, such a goal does not defeat First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p>A second flaw in the Court\'s reasoning is that it assumes that the intrusive elements of a residential picket are "inherent."  However, in support of this crucial conclusion, the Court only briefly examines the effect of a narrowly tailored ordinance:</p>\n<p>"[E]ven a solitary picket can invade residential privacy.  <em>See Carey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/447/455/case.html#478">447 U. S. 478</a></span>-479 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (\'Whether . . . alone or accompanied by others . . . there are few of us that would feel comfortable knowing that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 487 U.

S. 487</a></span> (ellipses in Court\'s opinion).  The Court\'s reference to the <em>Carey</em> dissent, its sole support for this assertion, conjures up images of a "lurking" stranger, secreting himself or herself outside a residence like a thief in the night, threatening physical harm.  This hardly seems an apt depiction of a solitary picket, especially at mid-afternoon, whose presence is objectionable because it is notorious.  Contrary to the Court\'s declaration in this regard, it seems far more likely that a picketer who truly desires only to harass those inside a particular residence will find that goal unachievable in the face of a narrowly tailored ordinance substantially limiting, for example, the size, time, and volume of the protest.  If, on the other hand, the picketer intends to communicate generally, a carefully crafted ordinance will allow him or her to do so without intruding upon or unduly harassing the resident.  Consequently, the discomfort to which the Court must refer is merely that of knowing there is a person outside who disagrees with someone inside.  This may indeed be uncomfortable, but it does not implicate the town\'s interest in residential privacy, and therefore does not warrant silencing speech.</p>\n<p>A valid time, place, or manner law neutrally regulates speech only to the extent necessary to achieve a substantial governmental interest, and no further.  Because the Court is unwilling to examine the Brookfield ordinance in light of the precise governmental interest at issue, it condones a law that suppresses substantially more speech than is necessary.  I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court today soundly rejects the town\'s rogue argument that residential streets are something less than public fora.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#479">487 U.

I wholeheartedly agree with this portion of the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court relies on our "two-court rule" to avoid appellees\' argument that state law creates a labor picketing exception to the Brookfield ordinance, and thus that the law is not content-neutral.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#481">487 U.

The District Court\'s opinion focuses solely on the language and history of the town ordinance, and does not refer to state law, 619 F.Supp. 792, 796 (ED Wis.1985); the panel simply deferred to the District Court, and the en banc court issued no opinion.  I cannot find even <em>one</em> court, let alone two, that has clearly passed on appellees\' argument.  <em>Cf. Virginia v.

S. 497</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s analysis of the question whether Brookfield\'s ban on picketing is constitutional begins with an acknowledgment that the ordinance "operates at the core of the First Amendment," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#479">487 U.

It concludes, however, that the total ban on residential picketing is "narrowly tailored" to protect "only unwilling recipients of the communications."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#485">487 U. S. 485</a></span>.  The plain language of the ordinance, however, applies to communications to willing and indifferent recipients as well as to the unwilling.</p>\n<p>I do not believe we advance the inquiry by rejecting what JUSTICE BRENNAN calls the "rogue argument that residential streets are something less than public fora," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/case.html#492">487 U. S. 492</a></span>, n. 1.  <em>See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html">473 U.

The streets in a residential neighborhood that has no sidewalks are quite obviously a different type of forum than a stadium or a public park.  Attaching the label "public forum" to the area in front of a single family dwelling does not help us decide whether the town\'s interest in the safe and efficient flow of traffic or its interest in protecting the privacy of its citizens justifies denying picketers the right to march up and down the streets at will.</p>\n<p>Two characteristics of picketing -- and of speech more generally -- make this a difficult case.  First, it is important to recognize that, "[l]ike so many other kinds of expression, picketing is a mixture of conduct and communication."  <em>NLRB v. Retail Store Employees,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/607/case.html">447 U. S. 607</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/607/case.html#618">447 U. S. 618</a></span>-619 (1980) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).  If we put the speech element to one side, I should think it perfectly clear that the town could prohibit pedestrians from loitering in front of a residence.  On the other hand, it seems equally clear that a sign carrier has a right to march past a residence -- and presumably pause long enough to give the occupants an opportunity to read his or her message -- regardless of whether the reader agrees, disagrees, or is simply </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 487 U. S. 498</a></p><p> indifferent to the point of view being expressed.  Second, it bears emphasis that:</p>\n<p>"[A] communication may be offensive in two different ways.  Independently of the message the speaker intends to convey, the form of his communication may be offensive -- perhaps because it is too loud or too ugly in a particular setting.  Other speeches, even though elegantly phrased in dulcet tones, are offensive simply because the listener disagrees with the speaker\'s message."</p>\n<p><em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm\'n of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/530/case.html">447 U. S. 530</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/530/case.html#546">447 U. S. 546</a></span>-547 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (footnotes omitted).  Picketing is a form of speech that, by virtue of its repetition of message and often hostile presentation, may be disruptive of an environment irrespective of the substantive message conveyed.</p>\n<p>The picketing that gave rise to the ordinance enacted in this case was obviously intended to do more than convey a message of opposition to the character of the doctor\'s practice; it was intended to cause him and his family substantial psychological distress.  As the record reveals, the picketers\' message was repeatedly redelivered by a relatively large group -- in essence, increasing the volume and intrusiveness of the same message with each repeated assertion, <em>cf. Kovacs v. Cooper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html">336 U. S. 77</a></span> (1949).  As is often the function of picketing, during the periods of protest, the doctor\'s home was held under a virtual siege.  I do not believe that picketing for the sole purpose of imposing psychological harm on a family in the shelter of their home is constitutionally protected.  I do believe, however, that the picketers have a right to communicate their strong opposition to abortion to the doctor, but after they have had a fair opportunity to communicate that message, I see little justification for allowing them to remain in front of his home and repeat it over and over again simply to harm the doctor and his family.  Thus, I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 487 U. S. 499</a></p><p> agree that the ordinance may be constitutionally applied to the kind of picketing that gave rise to its enactment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the ordinance is unquestionably "overbroad" in that it prohibits some communication that is protected by the First Amendment.  The question, then, is whether to apply the overbreadth doctrine\'s "strong medicine," <em>see Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html">413 U. S. 601</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html#613">413 U. S. 613</a></span> (1973), or to put that approach aside "and await further developments," <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">487 U. S. 491</span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).  In <em>Broadrick,</em> the Court framed the inquiry thusly:</p>\n<p>"To put the matter another way, particularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\'s plainly legitimate sweep."</p>\n<p>413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html#615">413 U. S. 615</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In this case, the overbreadth is unquestionably "real."  Whether or not it is "substantial" in relation to the "plainly legitimate sweep" of the ordinance is a more difficult question.  My hunch is that the town will probably not enforce its ban against friendly, innocuous, or even brief unfriendly picketing, and that the Court may be right in concluding that its legitimate sweep makes its overbreadth insubstantial.  But there are two countervailing considerations that are persuasive to me.  The scope of the ordinance gives the town officials far too much discretion in making enforcement decisions; while we sit by and await further developments, potential picketers must act at their peril.  Second, it is a simple matter for the town to amend its ordinance and to limit the ban to conduct that unreasonably interferes with the privacy of the home and does not serve a reasonable communicative purpose.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
