S. 170</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The principal question for decision in this case is whether the <em>bona fide</em> purchaser of a business, who acquires and continues the business with knowledge that his predecessor has committed an unfair labor practice in the discharge of an employee, may be ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to reinstate the employee with backpay.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are Golden State Bottling Co., Inc. (Golden State), and All American Beverages, Inc. (All American).  All American bought Golden State\'s soft drink bottling and distribution business after the National Labor Relations Board had ordered Golden State, "its officers, agents, successors, and assigns" to reinstate with back pay a driver-salesman, Kenneth L. Baker, whose discharge by Golden State was found by the Board to have been an unfair labor practice. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In a subsequent backpay </p><p><a class="page-number" name="171">Page 414 U. S. 171</a></p><p> specification proceeding to which both Golden State and All American were parties, <em>see</em> 29 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102.52-102.59, the Board found that All American continued after the acquisition to carry on the business without interruption or substantial changes in method of operation, employee complement, or supervisory personnel.  In that circumstance, although All American was a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser of the business, unconnected with Golden State, the Board found that All American, having acquired the business with knowledge of the outstanding Board order, was a "successor" for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act and liable for the reinstatement of Baker with backpay under the principles announced in <em>Perma Vinyl Corp.,</em> 164 N.L.R.B. 968 (1967), <em>enforced sub nom. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v. NLRB,</em> 398 F.2d 544 (CA5 1968). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Board therefore ordered that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 414 U. S. 172</a></p><p> All American reinstate Baker and that Golden State and All American jointly or severally pay Baker a specified sum of net backpay.  187 N.L.R.B. 1017 (1971).  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, one judge dissenting, enforced the order, 467 F.2d 164 (1972).  We granted certiorari, 410 U.S. 953 (1973).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>There is a threshold question of whether the Court of Appeals erred in determining that the evidence</p>\n<p>"offered substantial support for the Board\'s finding that All American purchased [the bottling business] with knowledge of the unfair labor practice litigation."</p>\n<p>467 F.2d at 165.  We address that question mindful of the congressionally imposed limitation on this Court\'s review of the Court of Appeals\' determination:</p>\n<p>"Whether on the record as a whole there is substantial evidence to support agency findings is a question which Congress has placed in the keeping of the Courts of Appeals.  This Court will intervene only in what ought to be the rare instance <em>when the standard appears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied.   <span class="l-normal"><a href="/us/340/474/case.html">340 U. S. </a></span> v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 414 U. S. 173</a></p><p> <em>NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/340/474/case.html">340 U.

(Emphasis added.)"</p>\n<p>Thus limited, we cannot find fault with the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that, on the record as a whole, substantial evidence supported the Board\'s finding that All American purchased the business with knowledge of the unfair labor practice litigation.  Eugene Schilling, Golden State\'s secretary and manager of the bottling business, who had discharged Baker and then closely followed the progress of the litigation, continued with the enterprise under All American\'s ownership with the title of general manager and "president."  Indeed, All American\'s purchase of the business was conditioned on Schilling\'s staying on in a managerial capacity; the sales contract expressly stipulated that Schilling "shall have agreed to be employed by [All American] for a period of one year after the Closing Date as General Manager. . . ."  Schilling participated on at least one occasion with Golden State\'s president, Edwin J. Crofoot, in the sale negotiations.  Even if strict agency principles would not impute Schilling\'s knowledge to All American until Schilling actually entered its employ, <em>see</em> Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7 9(3) (1958); <em>Thomas Engine Corp.,</em> 179 N.L.R.B. 1029, 1042 (1970), <em>enforced sub nom. UAW v. NLRB,</em> 442 F.2d 1180 (CA9 1971), the Court of Appeals cannot be said to have "misapprehended or grossly misapplied" the governing standard in appraising this evidence as sufficiently substantial to support an inference that Schilling informed his prospective employer of the litigation before completion of the sale.  It is true that both Schilling and Crofoot testified at the hearing in the specification proceeding that they had not informed All American of the litigation before the sale was completed.  But the trial examiner refused to credit their testimony in light of documentary evidence from which he inferred that the Golden State officials had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 414 U. S. 174</a></p><p> attempted to conceal the sale from the Board, 187 N.L.R.B. at 1021.  The examiner also refused to credit Crofoot\'s testimony that, while All American expressly asked him whether any litigation was pending, he did not mention the unfair labor practice case because he had forgotten it, although admitting that he had authorized payment of substantial fees in connection with it.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Finally, the examiner inferred from the unexplained failure of All American to produce its negotiators as witnesses that their testimony would not have supported All American\'s disclaimer of knowledge. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>On this state of the record, there is no justification for this Court\'s intervention, since <em>Universal Camera</em> precludes us from substituting our judgment for that of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>"This is not the place . . . to reverse a Court of Appeals because, were we in its place, we would find the record tilting one way, rather than the other. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>NLRB v.

In 1944, the Board determined that liability would not be imposed on a <em>bona fide</em> successor, <em>South Carolina Granite Co.,</em> 58 N.L.R.B. 1448, <em>enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Blair Quarries, Inc.,</em> 152 F.2d 25 (CA4 1945).  In 1947, the Board abandoned that view and determined that joint and several remedial responsibility would be imposed upon a <em>bona fide</em> successor who had knowledge of the seller\'s unfair labor practice at the time of the purchase, <em>Alexander</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 414 U. S. 175</a></p><p> <em>Milburn Co.,</em> 78 N.L.R.B. 747.  When, however, two Courts of Appeals refused to enforce remedial orders against <em>bona fide</em> successors, <em>NLRB v. Birdsall-Stockdale Motor Co.,</em> 208 F.2d 234 (CA10 1953), and <em>NLRB v. Lunder Shoe Corp.,</em> 211 F.2d 284 (CA1 1954), the Board, in 1954, reexamined and overruled <em>Alexander Milburn Co.,</em> declaring, in <em>Symns Grocery Co.,</em> 109 N.L.R.B. 346, that</p>\n<p>"[n]o provision of the [National Labor Relations] Act authorizes the Board to impose the responsibility for remedying unfair labor practices on persons who did not engage therein."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 348.  Finally, in 1967, in yet another turnabout, the Board overruled <em>Symns Grocery Co.</em> in <em>Perma Vinyl, supra,</em> and announced that, in circumstances there defined, <em>see</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra,</em> remedial orders would be imposed upon <em>bona fide</em> successors for the unfair labor practices of their predecessors.</p>\n<p>We must consider at the outset whether the issuance of a reinstatement and backpay order against a <em>bona fide</em> successor exceeds the Board\'s remedial powers under \xc2\xa7 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(c).  Section 10(c), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<p>"If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken, the Board shall be of the opinion that <em>any person named in the complaint has engaged in . . . any such unfair labor practice,</em> then the Board . . . shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, <em>as will effectuate the policies of this Act.</em> . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The Board\'s restrictive view in <em>Symns Grocery Co.</em> of its remedial powers derived from a limitation perceived to inhere in the words "any person named in the complaint has engaged in . . . any such unfair labor practice" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="176">Page 414 U. S. 176</a></p><p></p>\n<p>(emphasis added).  These words were regarded as precluding authority to issue remedial orders against persons, like <em>bona fide</em> successors, who had not perpetrated the unfair labor practice.  In <em>Perma Vinyl,</em> however, the Board found a broader authority in the words of the section authorizing the Board "to take such affirmative action . . . as will effectuate the policies of this Act."  These words were construed as granting</p>\n<p>"broad administrative power . . . to frame such remedial orders . . . not, of course, restricted to requiring remedial action by the offending employer alone,"</p>\n<p>164 N.L.R.B. at 969, as were necessary to further the public interest subserved by the Act.  <em>See NLRB v. Colten,</em> 105 F.2d 179 (CA6 1939).</p>\n<p>We agree that the Board\'s remedial powers under \xc2\xa7 10(c) include broad discretion to fashion and issue the order before us as relief adequate to achieve the ends, and effectuate the policies, of the Act.  Early on, this Court recognized that \xc2\xa7 10(c) does not limit the Board\'s remedial powers to the actual perpetrator of an unfair labor practice, and thereby prevent the Board from issuing orders binding a successor who did not himself commit the unlawful act.  We have said that a Board order that, as in this case, runs to the "officers, agents, successors, and assigns" of an offending employer may be applied not only to a new employer who is "merely a disguised continuance of the old employer," <em>Southport Petroleum Co. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/100/case.html">315 U. S. 100</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/100/case.html#106">315 U. S. 106</a></span> (1942), but also,</p>\n<p>"\'in appropriate circumstances . . . , [to] those to whom the business may have been transferred, whether as a means of evading the judgment <em>or for other reasons.</em>\'"</p>\n<p><em>Regal Knitwear Co. v.

S. 14</a></span> (1945) (emphasis added); <em>see also NLRB v. Ozark Hardwood Co.,</em> 282 F.2d 1, 5 (CA8 1960).  If the words "person named in the complaint has engaged in . . . any . . . unfair labor practice" in \xc2\xa7 10(c) do not restrict Board authority to prevent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 414 U. S. 177</a></p><p> orders running to the offending employer\'s successors and assigns who have acquired the business as a means of evading the Board order, we do not see how those words may be read to bar the Board from issuing reinstatement and backpay orders against <em>bona fide</em> successors when the Board has properly found such orders to be necessary to protect the public interest in effectuating the policies of the Act.  The Board\'s orders run to the evader and the <em>bona fide</em> purchaser, not because the act of evasion or the <em>bona fide</em> purchase is an unfair labor practice, but because the Board is obligated to effectuate the policies of the Act.  Construing \xc2\xa7 10(c) thus to grant the Board remedial power to issue such orders results in a reading of the section, as it should be read, in the light of "<em>the provisions of the whole law, and . . . its object and policy.\'"  <em>Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/270/case.html">350 U. S. 270</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/270/case.html#285">350 U.

We disagree. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Rule 65(d) provides that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 414 U.

Fiss, Injunctions 691-700 (1972).  We reject petitioners\' contention that <em>Real Knitwear Co. v. NLRB, supra,</em> at 14, supports the argument that this Rule is a bar to judicial authority to enforce Board orders against <em>bona fide</em> successors.

The Board\'s decisional process in the <em>Perma Vinyl</em> line of cases has involved striking a balance between the conflicting legitimate interests of the <em>bona fide</em> successor, the public, and the affected employee.  What we said of the Board\'s decisional process in another context is pertinent here:</p>\n<p>"The ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests.

The agreement originally had been entered into with another corporation which had subsequently merged with Wiley for genuine business reasons.  We held that the disappearance of the contracting corporation by merger did not necessarily terminate the rights of employees guaranteed by the agreement, and that the successor employer could be compelled to arbitrate so long as there was a "substantial continuity of identity in the business enterprise," evidenced there by the wholesale transfer of the predecessor\'s employees to the successor.  376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/543/case.html#551">376 U.

The new company hired a majority of the employees of the old company.  The Court held that the new company had been properly ordered to bargain with the bargaining representative which had been certified to the old company, since the bargaining unit remained essentially unchanged.  It was also held, however, that the new employer was not bound by the collective bargaining agreement agreed to by the union and the predecessor employer, inasmuch as \xc2\xa7 8(d) of the Act, as well as the legislative history of the labor laws, reflected a policy against compelling a party to agree to substantive contractual obligations.  406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/272/case.html#281">406 U.

S. 288</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We in no way qualify the <em>Burns</em> holdings in concluding that the Board\'s order against All American strikes an equitable balance. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  When a new employer, such as All American, has acquired substantial assets of its predecessor and continued, without interruption or substantial change, the predecessor\'s business operations, those employees who have been retained will understandably view their job situations as essentially unaltered.  Under these circumstances, the employees may well perceive the successor\'s failure to remedy the predecessor employer\'s unfair labor practices arising out of an unlawful discharge as a continuation of the predecessor\'s labor policies.  To the extent that the employees\' legitimate expectation is that the unfair labor practices will be remedied, a successor\'s failure to do so may result in labor unrest as the employees engage in collective activity to force remedial action.  Similarly, if the employees identify the new employer\'s labor policies with those of the predecessor but do not take collective action, the successor may benefit from the unfair labor practices due to a continuing deterrent effect on union activities.  Moreover, the Board\'s experience may reasonably lead it to believe that employers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 414 U. S. 185</a></p><p> intent on suppressing union activity may select for discharge those employees most actively engaged in union affairs, so that a failure to reinstate may result in a leadership vacuum in the bargaining unit.  <em>Cf. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/177/case.html">313 U. S. 177</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/177/case.html#193">313 U. S. 193</a></span> (1941).  Further, unlike <em>Burns,</em> where an important labor policy opposed saddling the successor employer with the obligations of the collective bargaining agreement, there is no underlying congressional policy here militating against the imposition of liability.</p>\n<p>Avoidance of labor strife, prevention of a deterrent effect on the exercise of rights guaranteed employees by \xc2\xa7 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 157, and protection for the victimized employee -- all important policies subserved by the National Labor Relations Act, <em>see</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 141 -- are achieved at a relatively minimal cost to the <em>bona fide</em> successor.  Since the successor must have notice before liability can be imposed,</p>\n<p>"his potential liability for remedying the unfair labor practices is a matter which can be reflected in the price he pays for the business, or he may secure an indemnity clause in the sales contract which will indemnify him for liability arising from the seller\'s unfair labor practices."</p>\n<p><em>Perma Vinyl Corp.,</em> 164 N.L.R.B. at 969.  If the reinstated employee does not effectively perform, he may, of course, be discharged for cause.  <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(C). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 414 U. S. 186</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Golden State attacked in the Court of Appeals the provision of the Board\'s order directing that it and All American jointly or severally pay Baker a specified sum of net backpay.  Golden State contends that, at most, it</p>\n<p>"should be ordered to pay to Baker back pay he would have earned as a driver-salesman in Golden State\'s employ from the date of this wrongful termination until the date of sale of the bottling company by Golden State, January 31, 1968."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners 60. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Court of Appeals declined to consider this argument because Golden State had agreed orally and in the contract of sale to indemnify All American for any backpay paid Baker by All American, and therefore was "liable for such wages by virtue of its agreement, whether or not it would also be liable absent that agreement."  467 F.2d at 166.  But Golden State\'s contractual obligation may be subject to contractual defenses, and, for that reason, may not, in fact, be the equivalent of the liability imposed upon Golden State by the order.  We shall therefore decide Golden State\'s challenge to the validity of the imposition of joint and several liability upon Golden State.  We find no merit in the challenge.</p>\n<p>The Board justified such provisions in <em>Perma Vinyl</em> in these words:</p>\n<p>"With respect to the offending employer himself, it must be obvious that it cannot be in the public interest to permit the violator of the Act to shed all </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 414 U. S. 187</a></p><p> responsibility for remedying his own unfair labor practices by simply disposing of the business.  If he has unlawfully discharged employees before transferring ownership to another, he should at least be required to make whole the dischargees for any loss of pay suffered by reason of the discharges until such time as they secure substantially equivalent employment with another employer."</p>\n<p>164 N.L.R.B. at 970.  In addition, joint and several liability will more fully insure that the employee is fully recompensed by protecting him, <em>e.g.,</em> against the insolvency of the successor.  The possibility that the successor will unjustifiably delay reinstatement to the predecessor\'s prejudice can be met by a protective provision in the contract of sale.  We cannot say that the Board has erred in thus "striking [the] balance to effectuate national labor policy. . . ."  <em>NLRB v. Teamsters Local 449,</em> 353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/87/case.html#96">353 U. S. 96</a></span>. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>When Baker was discharged on August 16, 1963, he was Golden State\'s leading driver-salesman.  On October 1, 1964, Golden State began converting its top driver-salesmen to distributors, or independent contractors, who realized net profits, after the deduction of their operating expenses, from the purchase of products from Golden State and the resale to customers.  The Board found that Baker would have become a distributor on October 1, 1964, but for his discharge on August 16, 1963.  The Board therefore computed Baker\'s gross backpay </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 414 U. S. 188</a></p><p> subsequent to October 1, 1964, on the basis of what he would have earned as a distributor after that date.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that the change on October 1, 1964, from driver-salesman to distributor ended their liability to Baker on that date, because distributors are "independent contractors" excluded from coverage of the Act by 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152(3).  The Court of Appeals rejected that contention, stating:</p>\n<p>"However, it is undisputed that, when Baker was discriminatorily discharged he was an ordinary employee.  The Act\'s remedies are not thwarted by the fact that an employee who is within the Act\'s protections when the discrimination occurs would have been promoted or transferred to a position not covered by the Act if he had not been discriminated against.  <em>NLRB v. Bell Aircraft Corp.,</em> 206 F.2d 235, 236-237 (2d Cir.1953)."</p>\n<p>467 F.2d at 166.  We agree with the Court of Appeals, and add only the observation that its conclusion is buttressed by the consideration that an order requiring reinstatement and backpay is aimed at "restoring the economic <em>status quo</em> that would have obtained but for the company\'s wrongful refusal to reinstate. . . ."  <em>NLRB v.

O n December 2, 1965, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit enforced the Board\'s order with respect to Baker.  353 F.2d 667.  Due to a delay in the Court of Appeals\' disposition of the Board\'s petition for rehearing on a portion of the court\'s decision unrelated to Baker, a final decree was not entered until November 27, 1968, <em>see</em> 401 F.2d 454.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Perma Vinyl</em> states the principles and their rationale as follows:</p>\n<p>"To further the public interest involved in effectuating the policies of the Act and achieve the \'objectives of national labor policy, reflected in established principles of federal law,\' we are persuaded that one who acquires and operates a business of an employer found guilty of unfair labor practices in basically unchanged form under circumstances which charge him with notice of unfair labor practice charges against his predecessor should be held responsible for remedying his predecessor\'s unlawful conduct."</p>\n<p>"In imposing this responsibility upon a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser, we are not unmindful of the fact that he was not a party to the unfair labor practices, and continues to operate the business without any connection with his predecessor.  However, in balancing the equities involved, there are other significant factors which must be taken into account.  Thus,"</p>\n<p>"It is the employing industry that is sought to be regulated and brought within the corrective and remedial provisions of the Act in the interest of industrial peace."</p>\n<p>"When a new employer is substituted in the employing industry, there has been no real change in the employing industry insofar as the victims of past unfair labor practices are concerned, or the need for remedying those unfair labor practices.  Appropriate steps must still be taken if the effects of the unfair labor practices are to be erased and all employees reassured of their statutory rights.  And it is the successor who has taken over control of the business who is generally in the best position to remedy such unfair labor practices most effectively.  The imposition of this responsibility upon even the <em>bona fide</em> purchaser does not work an unfair hardship upon him.  When he substituted himself in place of the perpetrator of the unfair labor practices, he became the beneficiary of the unremedied unfair labor practices.  Also, his potential liability for remedying the unfair labor practices is a matter which can be reflected in the price he pays for the business, or he may secure an indemnity clause in the sales contract which will indemnify him for liability arising from the seller\'s unfair labor practices."</p>\n<p>164 N.L.R.B. 968, 969 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v.

But we have previously found Rule 65(d) applicable to mandatory injunctions, and have noted that the courts of appeals have applied it "not only to prohibitory injunctions, but to enforcement orders and affirmative decrees as well."  <em>International Longshoremen\'s Assn. v.

The Board\'s practice after its earlier decision in <em>Alexander Milburn Co.,</em> 78 N.L.R.B. 747 (1947), had been to order the <em>bona fide</em> purchaser to cease and desist.

The refusal to adopt a mode of analysis requiring the Board to distinguish among mergers, consolidations, and purchases of assets is attributable to the fact that, so long as there is a continuity in the "employing industry," the public policies underlying the doctrine will be served by its broad application.  <em>Cf. NLRB v. Colten,</em> 105 F.2d 179, 183 (CA6 1939).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>A purchasing company cannot be obligated to carry out under \xc2\xa7 10(c) every outstanding and unsatisfied order of the Board.

In <em>Darlington,</em> it was held that an employer\'s liquidation of its entire business, even if motivated by anti-union animus, would not be an unfair labor practice.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/263/case.html#273">380 U.
