It is therefore ordered, adjudged, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="220">Page 37 U.

And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this Court that the cause be remanded to the said court of appeals, with directions to allow the pleadings in the said cause to be amended by the parties; the documents aforesaid, or the contents thereof, to be duly authenticated and proved, and such other proceedings in the cause to be had as to justice and equity shall appertain.  And the said court of appeals is either to cause such further proceedings aforesaid to be had before itself, or the cause remanded to the said superior court for the same purposes, as the one or the other course may be proper, or may be required by the constitution of the said courts, and the laws and practice appertaining thereto.
