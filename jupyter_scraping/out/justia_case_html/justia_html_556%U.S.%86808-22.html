MASSEY COAL CO., INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x9322.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 3, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 8, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">After a West Virginia jury found respondents, a coal company and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey), liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations and awarded petitioners (hereinafter Caperton) $50 million in damages, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections.  Knowing the State Supreme Court of Appeals would consider the appeal, Don Blankenship, Massey\xe2\x80\x99s chairman and principal officer, supported Brent Benjamin rather than the incumbent justice seeking reelection.  His $3 million in contributions exceeded the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and by Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s own committee.  Benjamin won by fewer than 50,000 votes.  Before Massey filed its appeal, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and the State\xe2\x80\x99s Code of Judicial Conduct, based on the conflict caused by Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign involvement.  Justice Benjamin denied the motion, indicating that he found nothing showing bias for or against any litigant.  The court then reversed the $50 million verdict.  During the rehearing process, Justice Benjamin refused twice more to recuse himself, and the court once again reversed the jury verdict.  Four months later, Justice Benjamin filed a concurring opinion, defending the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and his recusal decision.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0In all the circumstances of this case, due process requires recusal.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule requiring recusal when a judge has \xe2\x80\x9ca direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest\xe2\x80\x9d in a case, <em>Tumey</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/273/510/index.html">273 U. S. 510</a>, 523, but this Court has also identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal where \xe2\x80\x9cthe probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Larkin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/35/index.html">421 U. S. 35</a>, 47.  Two such instances place the present case in proper context.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The first involved local tribunals in which a judge had a financial interest in a case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome that was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common law.  In <em>Tumey,</em> a village mayor with authority to try those accused of violating a law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages faced two potential conflicts: Because he received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties that was funded from the fines assessed, he received a supplement only upon a conviction; and sums from the fines were deposited to the village\xe2\x80\x99s general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.  Disqualification was required under the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  273 U. S.em&gt;., at 532.  In <em>Ward</em> v. <em>Monroeville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/57/index.html">409 U. S. 57</a>, a conviction in another mayor\xe2\x80\x99s court was invalidated even though the fines assessed went only to the town\xe2\x80\x99s general fisc, because the mayor faced a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0possible temptation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d created by his \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive responsibilities for village finances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 60<em>.</em>  Recusal was also required where an Alabama Supreme Court justice cast the deciding vote upholding a punitive damages award while he was the lead plaintiff in a nearly identical suit pending in Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s lower courts.  <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Lavoie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/813/index.html">475 U. S. 813</a>.  The proper constitutional inquiry was not \xe2\x80\x9cwhether in fact [the justice] was influenced,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 825, but \xe2\x80\x9cwhether sitting on [that] case \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cwould offer a possible temptation to the average \xe2\x80\xa6 judge to \xe2\x80\xa6 lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  While the \xe2\x80\x9cdegree or kind of interest \xe2\x80\xa6 sufficient to disqualify a judge \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98[could not] be defined with precision, \xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 822, the test did have an objective component.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The second instance emerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but had determined in an earlier proceeding whether criminal charges should be brought and then proceeded to try and convict the petitioners.  <em>In re Murchison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/133/index.html">349 U. S. 133</a>.  Finding that \xe2\x80\x9cno man can be a judge in his own case,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cno man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 136, the Court noted that the circumstances of the case and the prior relationship required recusal.  The judge\xe2\x80\x99s prior relationship with the defendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior proceeding, was critical.  In reiterating that the rule that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be [tried] before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mayberry</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/455/index.html">400 U. S. 455</a>, 466, rests on the relationship between the judge and the defendant, <em>id.</em>, at 465, the Court noted that the objective inquiry is not whether the judge is actually biased, but whether the average judge in his position is likely to be neutral or there is an unconstitutional \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98potential for bias,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 466.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because the objective standards implementing the Due Process Clause do not require proof of actual bias, this Court does not question Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s subjective findings of impartiality and propriety and need not determine whether there was actual bias.  Rather, the question is whether, \xe2\x80\x9cunder a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,\xe2\x80\x9d the interest \xe2\x80\x9cposes such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em>, 421 U. S.<em>,</em> at 47.  There is a serious risk of actual bias when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge\xe2\x80\x99s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.  The proper inquiry centers on the contribution\xe2\x80\x99s relative size in comparison to the total amount contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect of the contribution on the outcome.  It is not whether the contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s victory.  In an election decided by fewer than 50,000 votes, Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign contributions\xe2\x80\x94compared to the total amount contributed to the campaign, as well as the total amount spent in the election\xe2\x80\x94had a significant and disproportionate influence on the outcome.  And the risk that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s influence engendered actual bias is sufficiently substantial that it \xe2\x80\x9cmust be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The temporal relationship between the campaign contributions, the justice\xe2\x80\x99s election, and the pendency of the case is also critical, for it was reasonably foreseeable that the pending case would be before the newly elected justice.  There is no allegation of a <em>quid pro quo </em>agreement, but the extraordinary contributions were made at a time when Blankenship had a vested stake in the outcome.  Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise when\xe2\x80\x94without the other parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent\xe2\x80\x94a man chooses the judge in his own cause.  Applying this principle to the judicial election process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that required Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s recusal.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Massey and its <em>amici</em> err in predicting that this decision will lead to adverse consequences ranging from a flood of recusal motions to unnecessary interference with judicial elections.  They point to no other instance involving judicial campaign contributions that presents a potential for bias comparable to the circumstances in this case, which are extreme by any measure.  And because the States may have codes of conduct with more rigorous recusal standards than due process requires, most recusal disputes will be resolved without resort to the Constitution, making the constitutional standard\xe2\x80\x99s application rare.

Five justices heard the case, and the vote to reverse was 3 to 2.  The question presented is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated when one of the justices in the majority denied a recusal motion.  The basis for the motion was that the justice had received campaign contributions in an extraordinary amount from, and through the efforts of, the board chairman and principal officer of the corporation found liable for the damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under our precedents there are objective standards that require recusal when \xe2\x80\x9cthe probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Larkin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/35/index.html">421 U. S. 35</a>, 47 (1975).  Applying those precedents, we find that, in all the circumstances of this case, due process requires recusal.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2002 a West Virginia jury returned a verdict that found respondents A. T. Massey Coal Co. and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey) liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations.  The jury awarded petitioners Hugh Caperton, Harman Development Corp., Harman Mining Corp., and Sovereign Coal Sales (hereinafter Caperton) the sum of $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In June 2004 the state trial court denied Massey\xe2\x80\x99s post-trial motions challenging the verdict and the damages award, finding that Massey \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally acted in utter disregard of [Caperton\xe2\x80\x99s] rights and ultimately destroyed [Caperton\xe2\x80\x99s] businesses because, after conducting cost-benefit analyses, [Massey] concluded it was in its financial interest to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 32a, \xc2\xb610(p).  In March 2005 the trial court denied Massey\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Don Blankenship is Massey\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, chief executive officer, and president.  After the verdict but before the appeal, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections.  Knowing the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the appeal in the case, Blankenship decided to support an attorney who sought to replace Justice McGraw.  Justice McGraw was a candidate for reelection to that court.  The attorney who sought to replace him was Brent Benjamin.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to \xe2\x80\x9cAnd For The Sake Of The Kids,\xe2\x80\x9d a political organization formed under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7527.  The \xc2\xa7527 organization opposed McGraw and supported Benjamin.  App. 672a\xe2\x80\x93673a.  Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s donations accounted for more than two-thirds of the total funds it raised.  <em>Id.,</em> at 150a.  This was not all.  Blankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures\xe2\x80\x94for direct mailings and letters soliciting donations as well as television and newspaper advertisements\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to support \xe2\x80\xa6 Brent Benjamin.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 184a, 186a, 200a (bold typeface omitted) (quoting Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s state campaign financial disclosure filings).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To provide some perspective, Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s $3 million in contributions were more than the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and three times the amount spent by Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s own committee.  <em>Id.,</em> at 288a.  Caperton contends that Blankenship spent $1 million more than the total amount spent by the campaign committees of both candidates combined.  Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Benjamin won.  He received 382,036 votes (53.3%), and McGraw received 334,301 votes (46.7%).  App. 677a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In October 2005, before Massey filed its petition for appeal in West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and the West Virginia Code of Judicial Conduct, based on the conflict caused by Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign involvement.  Justice Benjamin denied the motion in April 2006.  He indicated that he \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully considered the bases and accompanying exhibits proffered by the movants.\xe2\x80\x9d  But he found \xe2\x80\x9cno objective information \xe2\x80\xa6 to show that this Justice has a bias for or against any litigant, that this Justice has prejudged the matters which comprise this litigation, or that this Justice will be anything but fair and impartial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 336a\xe2\x80\x93337a.  In December 2006 Massey filed its petition for appeal to challenge the adverse jury verdict.  The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals granted review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2007 that court reversed the $50 million verdict against Massey.  The majority opinion, authored by then-Chief Justice Davis and joined by Justices Benjamin and Maynard, found that \xe2\x80\x9cMassey\xe2\x80\x99s conduct warranted the type of judgment rendered in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 357a.  It reversed, nevertheless, based on two independent grounds\xe2\x80\x94first, that a forum-selection clause contained in a contract to which Massey was not a party barred the suit in West Virginia, and, second, that res judicata barred the suit due to an out-of-state judgment to which Massey was not a party.  <em>Id.,</em> at 345a.  Justice Starcher dissented, stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cmajority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is morally and legally wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 420a\xe2\x80\x93422a.  Justice Albright also dissented, accusing the majority of \xe2\x80\x9cmisapplying the law and introducing sweeping \xe2\x80\x98new law\xe2\x80\x99 into our jurisprudence that may well come back to haunt us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 430a\xe2\x80\x93431a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Caperton sought rehearing, and the parties moved for disqualification of three of the five justices who decided the appeal.  Photos had surfaced of Justice Maynard vacationing with Blankenship in the French Riviera while the case was pending.  <em>Id.,</em> at 440a\xe2\x80\x93441a, 456a.  Justice Maynard granted Caperton\xe2\x80\x99s recusal motion.  On the other side Justice Starcher granted Massey\xe2\x80\x99s recusal motion, apparently based on his public criticism of Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s role in the 2004 elections.  In his recusal memorandum Justice Starcher urged Justice Benjamin to recuse himself as well.  He noted that \xe2\x80\x9cBlankenship\xe2\x80\x99s bestowal of his personal wealth, political tactics, and \xe2\x80\x98friendship\xe2\x80\x99 have created a cancer in the affairs of this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 459a\xe2\x80\x93460a.  Justice Benjamin declined Justice Starcher\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion and denied Caperton\xe2\x80\x99s recusal motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court granted rehearing.  Justice Benjamin, now in the capacity of acting chief justice, selected Judges Cookman and Fox to replace the recused justices.  Caperton moved a third time for disqualification, arguing that Justice Benjamin had failed to apply the correct standard under West Virginia law\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable and prudent person, knowing these objective facts, would harbor doubts about Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s ability to be fair and impartial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 466a, \xc2\xb68.  Caperton also included the results of a public opinion poll, which indicated that over 67% of West Virginians doubted Justice Benjamin would be fair and impartial.  Justice Benjamin again refused to withdraw, noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cpush poll\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cneither credible nor sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for an elected judge\xe2\x80\x99s disqualification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 483a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2008 a divided court again reversed the jury verdict, and again it was a 3-to-2 decision.  Justice Davis filed a modified version of his prior opinion, repeating the two earlier holdings.  She was joined by Justice Benjamin and Judge Fox.  Justice Albright, joined by Judge Cookman, dissented: \xe2\x80\x9cNot only is the majority opinion unsupported by the facts and existing case law, but it is also fundamentally unfair.  Sadly, justice was neither honored nor served by the majority.\xe2\x80\x9d  ___ W.\xc2\xa0Va. ___, ___, ___ S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d ___, ___; App. 633a.

He rejected Caperton\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to his participation in the case under both the Due Process Clause and West Virginia law.

As the Court has recognized, however, \xe2\x80\x9cmost matters relating to judicial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FTC</em> v. <em>Cement Institute</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/683/index.html">333 U. S. 683</a>, 702 (1948).  The early and leading case on the subject is <em>Tumey</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/273/510/index.html">273 U. S. 510</a> (1927).  There, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cmatters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 523.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Tumey</em> Court concluded that the Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule that a judge must recuse himself when he has \xe2\x80\x9ca direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest\xe2\x80\x9d in a case.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This rule reflects the maxim that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause; because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 10, p. 59 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); see Frank, Disqualification of Judges, 56 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 605, 611\xe2\x80\x93612 (1947) (same).  Under this rule, \xe2\x80\x9cdisqualification for bias or prejudice was not permitted\xe2\x80\x9d; those matters were left to statutes and judicial codes.  <em>Lavoie</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 820; see also Part IV, <em>infra</em> (discussing judicial codes).  Personal bias or prejudice \xe2\x80\x9calone would not be sufficient basis for imposing a constitutional requirement under the Due Process Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lavoie</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 820.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As new problems have emerged that were not discussed at common law, however, the Court has identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal.  These are circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cin which experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em>, 421 U. S., at 47.  To place the present case in proper context, two instances where the Court has required recusal merit further discussion.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first involved the emergence of local tribunals where a judge had a financial interest in the outcome of a case, although the interest was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was the problem addressed in <em>Tumey</em>.  There, the mayor of a village had the authority to sit as a judge (with no jury) to try those accused of violating a state law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages.  Inherent in this structure were two potential conflicts.  First, the mayor received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties, and the funds for that compensation derived from the fines assessed in a case.  No fines were assessed upon acquittal.  The mayor-judge thus received a salary supplement only if he convicted the defendant.  273 U. S., at 520.  Second, sums from the criminal fines were deposited to the village\xe2\x80\x99s general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.  <em>Id.</em>, at 522.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held that the Due Process Clause required disqualification \xe2\x80\x9cboth because of [the mayor-judge\xe2\x80\x99s] direct pecuniary interest in the outcome, and because of his official motive to convict and to graduate the fine to help the financial needs of the village.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 535.  It so held despite observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are doubtless mayors who would not allow such a consideration as $12 costs in each case to affect their judgment in it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 532.  The Court articulated the controlling principle:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cEvery procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court was thus concerned with more than the traditional common-law prohibition on direct pecuniary interest.  It was also concerned with a more general concept of interests that tempt adjudicators to disregard neutrality.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This concern with conflicts resulting from financial incentives was elaborated in Ward</em> v. <em>Monroeville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/57/index.html">409 U. S. 57</a> (1972), which invalidated a conviction in another mayor\xe2\x80\x99s court.  In <em>Monroeville</em>, unlike in <em>Tumey</em>, the mayor received no money; instead, the fines the mayor assessed went to the town\xe2\x80\x99s general fisc.  The Court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that the mayor [in <em>Tumey</em>] shared directly in the fees and costs did not define the limits of the principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U. S., at 60.  The principle, instead, turned on the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possible temptation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor might face; the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive responsibilities for village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high level of contribution [to those finances] from the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As the Court reiterated in another case that Term, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [judge\xe2\x80\x99s] financial stake need not be as direct or positive as it appeared to be in <em>Tumey</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gibson</em> v. <em>Berryhill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/564/index.html">411 U. S. 564</a>, 579 (1973) (an administrative board composed of optometrists had a pecuniary interest of \xe2\x80\x9csufficient substance\xe2\x80\x9d so that it could not preside over a hearing against competing optometrists).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court in <em>Lavoie</em> further clarified the reach of the Due Process Clause regarding a judge\xe2\x80\x99s financial interest in a case.  There, a justice had cast the deciding vote on the Alabama Supreme Court to uphold a punitive damages award against an insurance company for bad-faith refusal to pay a claim.  At the time of his vote, the justice was the lead plaintiff in a nearly identical lawsuit pending in Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s lower courts.  His deciding vote, this Court surmised, \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly \xe2\x80\x98raised the stakes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for the insurance defendant in the justice\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  475 U. S., at 823\xe2\x80\x93824.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court stressed that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot required to decide whether in fact [the justice] was influenced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 825.  The proper constitutional inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether sitting on the case then before the Supreme Court of Alabama \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cwould offer a possible temptation to the average \xe2\x80\xa6 judge to \xe2\x80\xa6 lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Monroeville</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 60, in turn quoting <em>Tumey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 532).  The Court underscored that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat degree or kind of interest is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting \xe2\x80\x98cannot be defined with precision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U. S., at 822 (quoting <em>Murchison</em>, 349 U. S., at 136).  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, however, it was important that the test have an objective component.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Lavoie</em> Court proceeded to distinguish the state court justice\xe2\x80\x99s particular interest in the case, which required recusal, from interests that were not a constitutional concern.  For instance, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile [the other] justices might conceivably have had a slight pecuniary interest\xe2\x80\x9d due to their potential membership in a class-action suit against their own insurance companies, that interest is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98too remote and insubstantial to violate the constitutional constraints.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U. S., at 825\xe2\x80\x93826 (quoting <em>Marshall</em> v. <em>Jerrico, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/238/index.html">446 U. S. 238</a>, 243 (1980)).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second instance requiring recusal that was not discussed at common law emerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but was challenged because of a conflict arising from his participation in an earlier proceeding.  This Court characterized that first proceeding (perhaps pejoratively) as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one-man grand jury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murchison</em>, 349 U. S., at 133.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In that first proceeding, and as provided by state law, a judge examined witnesses to determine whether criminal charges should be brought.  The judge called the two petitioners before him.  One petitioner answered questions, but the judge found him untruthful and charged him with perjury.  The second declined to answer on the ground that he did not have counsel with him, as state law seemed to permit.  The judge charged him with contempt.  The judge proceeded to try and convict both petitioners.  <em>Id.</em>, at 134\xe2\x80\x93135.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court set aside the convictions on grounds that the judge had a conflict of interest at the trial stage because of his earlier participation followed by his decision to charge them.  The Due Process Clause required disqualification. The Court recited the general rule that \xe2\x80\x9cno man can be a judge in his own case,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9cno man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 136.  It noted that the disqualifying criteria \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be defined with precision.  Circumstances and relationships must be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  These circumstances and the prior relationship required recusal: \xe2\x80\x9cHaving been a part of [the one-man grand jury] process a judge cannot be, in the very nature of things, wholly disinterested in the conviction or acquittal of those accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 137.  That is because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a practical matter it is difficult if not impossible for a judge to free himself from the influence of what took place in his \xe2\x80\x98grand-jury\xe2\x80\x99 secret session.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 138.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Murchison</em> Court was careful to distinguish the circumstances and the relationship from those where the Constitution would not require recusal.  It noted that the single-judge grand jury is \xe2\x80\x9cmore a part of the accusatory process than an ordinary lay grand juror,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication by a trial judge of a contempt committed in [a judge\xe2\x80\x99s] presence in open court cannot be likened to the proceedings here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 137.  The judge\xe2\x80\x99s prior relationship with the defendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior proceeding, was of critical import.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following <em>Murchison</em> the Court held in <em>Mayberry</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/455/index.html">400 U. S. 455</a>, 466 (1971), \xe2\x80\x9cthat by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be given a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court reiterated that this rule rests on the relationship between the judge and the defendant: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] judge, vilified as was this Pennsylvania judge, necessarily becomes embroiled in a running, bitter controversy.  No one so cruelly slandered is likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 465.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, the Court considered the specific circumstances presented by the case.  It noted that \xe2\x80\x9cnot every attack on a judge \xe2\x80\xa6 disqualifies him from sitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court distinguished the case from <em>Ungar</em> v. <em>Sarafite</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/575/index.html">376 U. S. 575</a> (1964), in which the Court had \xe2\x80\x9cruled that a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s challenge, though \xe2\x80\x98disruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable commentary,\xe2\x80\x99 was still not \xe2\x80\x98an insulting attack upon the integrity of the judge carrying such potential for bias as to require disqualification.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mayberry</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 465\xe2\x80\x93466 (quoting <em>Ungar</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 584).  The inquiry is an objective one.  The Court asks not whether the judge is actually, subjectively biased, but whether the average judge in his position is \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional \xe2\x80\x9cpotential for bias.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the principles described in these cases we turn to the issue before us.  This problem arises in the context of judicial elections, a framework not presented in the precedents we have reviewed and discussed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Caperton contends that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias.  Though not a bribe or criminal influence, Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected.  That temptation, Caperton claims, is as strong and inherent in human nature as was the conflict the Court confronted in <em>Tumey</em> and <em>Monroeville</em> when a mayor-judge (or the city) benefited financially from a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, as well as the conflict identified in <em>Murchison</em> and <em>Mayberry</em> when a judge was the object of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contempt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Benjamin was careful to address the recusal motions and explain his reasons why, on his view of the controlling standard, disqualification was not in order.  In four separate opinions issued during the course of the appeal, he explained why no actual bias had been established.  He found no basis for recusal because Caperton failed to provide \xe2\x80\x9cobjective evidence\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cobjective information,\xe2\x80\x9d but merely \xe2\x80\x9csubjective belief\xe2\x80\x9d of bias.  ___ W.\xc2\xa0Va., at ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___ S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___; App. 336a, 337a\xe2\x80\x93338a, 444a\xe2\x80\x93445a.  Nor could anyone \xe2\x80\x9cpoint to any actual conduct or activity on [his] part which could be termed \xe2\x80\x98improper.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  ___ W.\xc2\xa0Va., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___ S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___; App. 655a\xe2\x80\x93656a.  In other words, based on the facts presented by Caperton, Justice Benjamin conducted a probing search into his actual motives and inclinations; and he found none to be improper.  We do not question his subjective findings of impartiality and propriety.  Nor do we determine whether there was actual bias.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following accepted principles of our legal tradition respecting the proper performance of judicial functions, judges often inquire into their subjective motives and purposes in the ordinary course of deciding a case.  This does not mean the inquiry is a simple one.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe work of deciding cases goes on every day in hundreds of courts throughout the land.  Any judge, one might suppose, would find it easy to describe the process which he had followed a thousand times and more.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 9 (1921).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge inquires into reasons that seem to be leading to a particular result.  Precedent and <em>stare decisis</em> and the text and purpose of the law and the Constitution; logic and scholarship and experience and common sense; and fairness and disinterest and neutrality are among the factors at work.  To bring coherence to the process, and to seek respect for the resulting judgment, judges often explain the reasons for their conclusions and rulings. There are instances when the introspection that often attends this process may reveal that what the judge had assumed to be a proper, controlling factor is not the real one at work.  If the judge discovers that some personal bias or improper consideration seems to be the actuating cause of the decision or to be an influence so difficult to dispel that there is a real possibility of undermining neutrality, the judge may think it necessary to consider withdrawing from the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias, and the fact that the inquiry is often a private one, simply underscore the need for objective rules.  Otherwise there may be no adequate protection against a judge who simply misreads or misapprehends the real motives at work in deciding the case.  The judge\xe2\x80\x99s own inquiry into actual bias, then, is not one that the law can easily superintend or review, though actual bias, if disclosed, no doubt would be grounds for appropriate relief.  In lieu of exclusive reliance on that personal inquiry, or on appellate review of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination respecting actual bias, the Due Process Clause has been implemented by objective standards that do not require proof of actual bias.  See <em>Tumey</em>, 273 U. S., at 532; <em>Mayberry</em>, 400 U. S., at 465\xe2\x80\x93466; <em>Lavoie</em>, 475 U. S.em&gt;., at 825.  In defining these standards the Court has asked whether, \xe2\x80\x9cunder a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,\xe2\x80\x9d the interest \xe2\x80\x9cposes such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em>, 421 U. S., at 47.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the influence at issue in this case.  Not every campaign contribution by a litigant or attorney creates a probability of bias that requires a judge\xe2\x80\x99s recusal, but this is an exceptional case.  Cf. <em>Mayberry</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 465 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, of course, not every attack on a judge that disqualifies him from sitting\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lavoie</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 825\xe2\x80\x93826 (some pecuniary interests are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98too remote and insubstantial\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias\xe2\x80\x94based on objective and reasonable perceptions\xe2\x80\x94when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge\xe2\x80\x99s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.  The inquiry centers on the contribution\xe2\x80\x99s relative size in comparison to the total amount of money contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect such contribution had on the outcome of the election.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this principle, we conclude that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign efforts had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing Justice Benjamin on the case.  Blankenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace him with Benjamin.  His contributions eclipsed the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and exceeded by 300% the amount spent by Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s campaign committee.  App. 288a.  Caperton claims Blankenship spent $1 million more than the total amount spent by the campaign committees of both candidates combined.  Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Massey responds that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s support, while significant, did not cause Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s victory.  In the end the people of West Virginia elected him, and they did so based on many reasons other than Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s efforts.  Massey points out that every major state newspaper, but one, endorsed Benjamin.  Brief for Respondents 54.  It also contends that then-Justice McGraw cost himself the election by giving a speech during the campaign, a speech the opposition seized upon for its own advantage.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Benjamin raised similar arguments.  He asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe outcome of the 2004 election was due primarily to [his own] campaign\xe2\x80\x99s message,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as McGraw\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdevastat[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d speech in which he \xe2\x80\x9cmade a number of controversial claims which became a matter of statewide discussion in the media, on the internet, and elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  ___ W.\xc2\xa0Va., at ___, and n. 29, ___ S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at ___, and n. 29; App. 673a, 674a, and n. 29; see also ___ W.\xc2\xa0Va., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, and nn. 35\xe2\x80\x9339, ___ S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, and nn. 35\xe2\x80\x9339; App. 677a\xe2\x80\x93680a, and nn. 35\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s victory is not the proper inquiry.  Much like determining whether a judge is actually biased, proving what ultimately drives the electorate to choose a particular candidate is a difficult endeavor, not likely to lend itself to a certain conclusion.  This is particularly true where, as here, there is no procedure for judicial factfinding and the sole trier of fact is the one accused of bias.  Due process requires an objective inquiry into whether the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s influence on the election under all the circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cwould offer a possible temptation to the average . . . judge to \xe2\x80\xa6 lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tumey</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 532.  In an election decided by fewer than 50,000 votes (382,036 to 334,301), see ___ W.\xc2\xa0Va., at ___, ___ S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at ___; App. 677a, Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign contributions\xe2\x80\x94in comparison to the total amount contributed to the campaign, as well as the total amount spent in the election\xe2\x80\x94had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome.  And the risk that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s influence engendered actual bias is sufficiently substantial that it \xe2\x80\x9cmust be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 47.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The temporal relationship between the campaign contributions, the justice\xe2\x80\x99s election, and the pendency of the case is also critical.  It was reasonably foreseeable, when the campaign contributions were made, that the pending case would be before the newly elected justice.  The $50 million adverse jury verdict had been entered before the election, and the Supreme Court of Appeals was the next step once the state trial court dealt with post-trial motions.  So it became at once apparent that, absent recusal, Justice Benjamin would review a judgment that cost his biggest donor\xe2\x80\x99s company $50 million.  Although there is no allegation of a <em>quid pro quo </em>agreement, the fact remains that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary contributions were made at a time when he had a vested stake in the outcome.  Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise when\xe2\x80\x94without the consent of the other parties\xe2\x80\x94a man chooses the judge in his own cause.  And applying this principle to the judicial election process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that required Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s recusal. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Benjamin did undertake an extensive search for actual bias.  But, as we have indicated, that is just one step in the judicial process; objective standards may also require recusal whether or not actual bias exists or can be proved.  Due process \xe2\x80\x9cmay sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murchison</em>, 349 U. S., at 136.  The failure to consider objective standards requiring recusal is not consistent with the imperatives of due process.  We find that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s significant and disproportionate influence\xe2\x80\x94coupled with the temporal relationship between the election and the pending case\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9coffer a possible temptation to the average \xe2\x80\xa6 judge to \xe2\x80\xa6 lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lavoie</em>, 475 U. S.em&gt;., at 825 (quoting <em>Monroeville</em>, 409 U. S., at 60, in turn quoting <em>Tumey</em>, 273 U. S., at 532).  On these extreme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision today addresses an extraordinary situation where the Constitution requires recusal.  Massey and its <em>amici</em> predict that various adverse consequences will follow from recognizing a constitutional violation here\xe2\x80\x94ranging from a flood of recusal motions to unnecessary interference with judicial elections.  We disagree.  The facts now before us are extreme by any measure.  The parties point to no other instance involving judicial campaign contributions that presents a potential for bias comparable to the circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that extreme cases often test the bounds of established legal principles, and sometimes no administrable standard may be available to address the perceived wrong.  But it is also true that extreme cases are more likely to cross constitutional limits, requiring this Court\xe2\x80\x99s intervention and formulation of objective standards.  This is particularly true when due process is violated.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>County of Sacramento</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/index.html">523 U. S. 833</a>, 846\xe2\x80\x93847 (1998) (reiterating the due-process prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive abuse of power . . . which shocks the conscience\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 858 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cobjective considerations, including history and precedent, are the controlling principle\xe2\x80\x9d of this due process standard).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s recusal cases are illustrative.  In each case the Court dealt with extreme facts that created an unconstitutional probability of bias that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cannot be defined with precision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lavoie</em>, 475 U. S., at 822 (quoting <em>Murchison</em>, 349 U. S., at 136).  Yet the Court articulated an objective standard to protect the parties\xe2\x80\x99 basic right to a fair trial in a fair tribunal.  The Court was careful to distinguish the extreme facts of the cases before it from those interests that would not rise to a constitutional level.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lavoie</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 825\xe2\x80\x93826; <em>Mayberry</em>, 400 U. S., at 465\xe2\x80\x93466; <em>Murchison</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 137; see also Part II, <em>supra</em>.  In this case we do nothing more than what the Court has done before.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As such, it is worth noting the effects, or lack thereof, of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions.  Even though the standards announced in those cases raised questions similar to those that might be asked after our decision today, the Court was not flooded with <em>Monroeville</em> or <em>Murchison</em> motions.  That is perhaps due in part to the extreme facts those standards sought to address.  Courts proved quite capable of applying the standards to less extreme situations. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One must also take into account the judicial reforms the States have implemented to eliminate even the appearance of partiality.  Almost every State\xe2\x80\x94West Virginia included\xe2\x80\x94has adopted the American Bar Association\xe2\x80\x99s objective standard: \xe2\x80\x9cA judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\xe2\x80\x9d  ABA Annotated Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2 (2004); see Brief for American Bar Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14, and n. 29.  The ABA Model Code\xe2\x80\x99s test for appearance of impropriety is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired.\xe2\x80\x9d  Canon 2A, Commentary; see also W.\xc2\xa0Va. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A, and Commentary (2009) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The West Virginia Code of Judicial Conduct also requires a judge to \xe2\x80\x9cdisqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\xe2\x80\x99s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Canon 3E(1); see also 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7455(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under Canon 3E(1), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he question of disqualification focuses on whether an objective assessment of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s conduct produces a reasonable question about impartiality, not on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s subjective perception of the ability to act fairly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State ex rel. Brown</em> v. <em>Dietrick</em>, 191 W.\xc2\xa0Va. 169, 174, n.\xc2\xa09, 444 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 47, 52, n. 9 (1994); see also <em>Liteky</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/540/index.html">510 U.

Indeed, some States require recusal based on campaign contributions similar to those in this case.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ala. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x9324\xe2\x80\x931, 12\xe2\x80\x9324\xe2\x80\x932 (2006); Miss.

The Conference of the Chief Justices has underscored that the codes are \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he principal safeguard against judicial campaign abuses\xe2\x80\x9d that threaten to imperil \xe2\x80\x9cpublic confidence in the fairness and integrity of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s elected judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Conference of Chief Justices as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4, 11.  This is a vital state interest:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCourts, in our system, elaborate principles of law in the course of resolving disputes.  The power and the prerogative of a court to perform this function rest, in the end, upon the respect accorded to its judgments.  The citizen\xe2\x80\x99s respect for judgments depends in turn upon the issuing court\xe2\x80\x99s absolute probity.  Judicial integrity is, in consequence, a state interest of the highest order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Republican Party of Minn.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/765/index.html">536 U.

But I fear that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision will undermine rather than promote these values.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, we have recognized exactly two situations in which the Federal Due Process Clause requires disqualification of a judge: when the judge has a financial interest in the outcome of the case, and when the judge is trying a defendant for certain criminal contempts.  Vaguer notions of bias or the appearance of bias were never a basis for disqualification, either at common law or under our constitutional precedents.  Those issues were instead addressed by legislation or court rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, however, the Court enlists the Due Process Clause to overturn a judge\xe2\x80\x99s failure to recuse because of a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability of bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike the established grounds for disqualification, a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability of bias\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be defined in any limited way.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s new \xe2\x80\x9crule\xe2\x80\x9d provides no guidance to judges and litigants about when recusal will be constitutionally required.  This will inevitably lead to an increase in allegations that judges are biased, however groundless those charges may be.  The end result will do far more to erode public confidence in judicial impartiality than an isolated failure to recuse in a particular case.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Larkin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/35/index.html">421 U. S. 35</a>, 47 (1975).  All judges take an oath to uphold the Constitution and apply the law impartially, and we trust that they will live up to this promise.  See <em>Republican Party of Minn.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/765/index.html">536 U. S. 765</a>, 796 (2002) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe should not, even by inadvertence, \xe2\x80\x98impute to judges a lack of firmness, wisdom, or honor\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Bridges</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/314/252/index.html">314 U. S. 252</a>, 273 (1941))).  We have thus identified only <em>two</em> situations in which the Due Process Clause requires disqualification of a judge: when the judge has a financial interest in the outcome of the case, and when the judge is presiding over certain types of criminal contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is well established that a judge may not preside over a case in which he has a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect, personal, substantial pecuniary interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tumey</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/273/510/index.html">273 U. S. 510</a>, 523 (1927).  This principle is relatively straightforward, and largely tracks the longstanding common-law rule regarding judicial recusal.  See Frank, Disqualification of Judges, 56 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 605, 609 (1947) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe common law of disqualification \xe2\x80\xa6 was clear and simple: a judge was disqualified for direct pecuniary interest and for nothing else\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights are violated when he is tried before a judge who is \xe2\x80\x9cpaid for his service only when he convicts the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tumey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 531; see also <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Lavoie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/813/index.html">475 U.

In <em>Mayberry</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/455/index.html">400 U. S. 455</a> (1971), the defendant directed a steady stream of expletives and <em>ad hominem</em> attacks at the judge throughout the trial.  When that defendant was subsequently charged with criminal contempt, we concluded that he \xe2\x80\x9cshould be given a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 466; see also <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Hayes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/488/index.html">418 U.

Thus matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tumey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 523; see also <em>Lavoie</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 820.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSubject to the two well-established exceptions described above, questions of judicial recusal are regulated by \xe2\x80\x9ccommon law, statute, or the professional standards of the bench and bar.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bracy</em> v. <em>Gramley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/899/index.html">520 U. S. 899</a>, 904 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any given case, there are a number of factors that could give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cappearance\xe2\x80\x9d of bias:  friendship with a party or lawyer, prior employment experience, membership in clubs or associations, prior speeches and writings, religious affiliation, and countless other considerations.  We have never held that the Due Process Clause requires recusal for any of these reasons, even though they could be viewed as presenting a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability of bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  Many state <em>statutes</em> require recusal based on a probability or appearance of bias, but \xe2\x80\x9cthat alone would not be sufficient basis for imposing a <em>constitutional </em>requirement under the Due Process Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lavoie</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 820 (emphasis added).  States are, of course, free to adopt broader recusal rules than the Constitution requires\xe2\x80\x94and every State has\xe2\x80\x94but these developments are not continuously incorporated into the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In departing from this clear line between when recusal is constitutionally required and when it is not, the majority repeatedly emphasizes the need for an \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1, 6, 9, 11\xe2\x80\x9318.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d in that it does not inquire into Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s motives or decisionmaking process.  But the standard the majority articulates\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cprobability of bias\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94fails to provide clear, workable guidance for future cases.  At the most basic level, it is unclear whether the new probability of bias standard is somehow limited to financial support in judicial elections, or applies to judicial recusal questions more generally.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there are other fundamental questions as well.  With little help from the majority, courts will now have to determine:</p>\n<p>\n<left>1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  How much money is too much money?

What if the plaintiffs only sought non-monetary relief such as an injunction or declaratory judgment?</left></p>\n<p>\n<left>6.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Does the analysis change depending on whether the judge whose disqualification is sought sits on a trial court, appeals court, or state supreme court?</left></p>\n<p>\n<left>7.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  How long does the probability of bias last?

Must the judge recuse in all cases that affect the association\xe2\x80\x99s interests?  Must the judge recuse in all cases in which a party or lawyer is a member of that group?

But elsewhere in the opinion, the majority considers \xe2\x80\x9cthe apparent effect such contribution had on the outcome of the election,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, and whether the litigant has been able to \xe2\x80\x9cchoos[e] the judge in his own cause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16.  If causation is a pertinent factor, how do we know whether the contribution or expenditure had any effect on the outcome of the election?  What if the judge won in a landslide?

Judges and litigants will surely encounter others when they are forced to, or wish to, apply the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision in different circumstances.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion requires state and federal judges simultaneously to act as political scientists (why did candidate X win the election?), economists (was the financial support disproportionate?), and psychologists (is there likely to be a debt of gratitude?).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s inability to formulate a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially discernible and manageable standard\xe2\x80\x9d strongly counsels against the recognition of a novel constitutional right.  See <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html">541 U. S. 267</a>, 306 (2004) (plurality opinion) (holding political gerrymandering claims nonjusticiable based on the lack of workable standards); <em>id.</em>, at 317 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe failings of the many proposed standards for measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes \xe2\x80\xa6 make our intervention improper\xe2\x80\x9d).  The need to consider these and countless other questions helps explain why the common law and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional jurisprudence have never required disqualification on such vague grounds as \xe2\x80\x9cprobability\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cappearance\xe2\x80\x9d of bias.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To its credit, the Court seems to recognize that the inherently boundless nature of its new rule poses a problem.  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s only answer is that the present case is an \xe2\x80\x9cextreme\xe2\x80\x9d one, so there is no need to worry about other cases.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  The Court repeats this point over and over.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cthis is an exceptional case\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at<em> </em>16 (\xe2\x80\x9cOn these extreme facts\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid. </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cOur decision today addresses an extraordinary situation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 17 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe facts now before us are extreme by any measure\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 20 (Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule will \xe2\x80\x9cbe confined to rare instances\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this is just so much whistling past the graveyard.  Claims that have little chance of success are nonetheless frequently filed.  The success rate for certiorari petitions before this Court is approximately 1.1%, and yet the previous Term some 8,241 were filed.  Every one of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Caperton </em>motions\xe2\x80\x9d or appeals or \xc2\xa71983 actions will claim that the judge is biased, or probably biased, bringing the judge and the judicial system into disrepute.  And all future litigants will assert that their case is <em>really </em>the most extreme thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Extreme cases often test the bounds of established legal principles.  There is a cost to yielding to the desire to correct the extreme case, rather than adhering to the legal principle.  That cost has been demonstrated so often that it is captured in a legal aphorism: \xe2\x80\x9cHard cases make bad law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the cautionary tale of our decisions in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Halper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/435/index.html">490 U. S. 435</a> (1989), and <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/93/index.html">522 U. S. 93</a> (1997).  Historically, we have held that the Double Jeopardy Clause only applies to criminal penalties, not civil ones.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Helvering</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/303/391/index.html">303 U. S. 391</a>, 398\xe2\x80\x93400 (1938).  But in <em>Halper</em>, the Court held that a civil penalty could violate the Clause if it were \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages [the defendant] has caused\xe2\x80\x9d and resulted in a \xe2\x80\x9cclear injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U. S., at 446, 449.  We acknowledged that this inquiry would not be an \xe2\x80\x9cexact pursuit,\xe2\x80\x9d but the Court assured litigants that it was only announcing \xe2\x80\x9ca rule for the rare case, the case such as the one before us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 449; see also <em>id.</em>, at 453 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s holding, I would stress, constitutes an objective rule that is grounded in the nature of the sanction and the facts of the particular case\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just eight years later, we granted certiorari in <em>Hudson</em> \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of concerns about the wide variety of novel double jeopardy claims spawned in the wake of <em>Halper</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  522 U. S., at 98; see also <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa04.  The novel claim that we had recognized in <em>Halper </em>turned out not to be so \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d after all, and the test we adopted in that case\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94had \xe2\x80\x9cproved unworkable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 101\xe2\x80\x93102 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We thus abandoned the <em>Halper </em>rule, ruing our \xe2\x80\x9cill considered\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdeviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 101.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\x80 vu is enough to make one swoon.  Today, the majority again departs from a clear, longstanding constitutional rule to accommodate an \xe2\x80\x9cextreme\xe2\x80\x9d case involving \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d amounts of money.  I believe we will come to regret this decision as well, when courts are forced to deal with a wide variety of <em>Caperton </em>motions, each claiming the title of \xe2\x80\x9cmost extreme\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmost disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And why is the Court so convinced that this is an extreme case?  It is true that Don Blankenship spent a large amount of money in connection with this election.  But this point cannot be emphasized strongly enough: Other than a $1,000 direct contribution from Blankenship, <em>Justice Benjamin and his campaign had no control over how this money was spent</em>.  Campaigns go to great lengths to develop precise messages and strategies.  An insensitive or ham-handed ad campaign by an independent third party might distort the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s message or cause a backlash against the candidate, even though the candidate was not responsible for the ads.  See <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 47 (1976) (<em>per curiam</em>) (\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike contributions, such independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for Conference of Chief Justices as Amicus Curiae 27, n. 50 (citing examples of judicial elections in which independent expenditures backfired and hurt the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign).  The majority repeatedly characterizes Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s spending as \xe2\x80\x9ccontributions\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign contributions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1, 3, 14\xe2\x80\x9317, 19, but it is more accurate to refer to them as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blankenship only \xe2\x80\x9ccontributed\xe2\x80\x9d $1,000 to the Benjamin campaign.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s independent expenditures do not appear \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d compared to other such expenditures in this very election.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for the Sake of the Kids\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an independent group that received approximately two-thirds of its funding from Blankenship\xe2\x80\x94spent $3,623,500 in connection with the election.  App. 684a.  But large independent expenditures were also made in support of Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s opponent.  \xe2\x80\x9cConsumers for Justice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an independent group that received large contributions from the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 bar\xe2\x80\x94spent approximately $2 million in this race.  <em>Id.</em>, at<em> </em>682a\xe2\x80\x93683a, n. 41.  And Blankenship has made large expenditures in connection with several previous West Virginia elections, which undercuts any notion that his involvement in this election was \xe2\x80\x9cintended to influence the outcome\xe2\x80\x9d of particular pending litigation.  Brief for Petitioners 29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also far from clear that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures affected the outcome of this election.  Justice Benjamin won by a comfortable 7-point margin (53.3% to 46.7%).  Many observers believed that Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s opponent doomed his candidacy by giving a well-publicized speech that made several curious allegations; this speech was described in the local media as \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply disturbing\xe2\x80\x9d and worse.  App. 679a, n. 38.  Justice Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s opponent also refused to give interviews or participate in debates.  All but one of the major West Virginia newspapers endorsed Justice Benjamin.  Justice Benjamin just might have won because the voters of West Virginia thought he would be a better judge than his opponent.  Unlike the majority, I cannot say with any degree of certainty that Blankenship \xe2\x80\x9ccho[se] the judge in his own cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  I would give the voters of West Virginia more credit than that.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is an old clich\xc3\xa9, but sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.  I am sure there are cases where a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability of bias\xe2\x80\x9d should lead the prudent judge to step aside, but the judge fails to do so.  Maybe this is one of them.  But I believe that opening the door to recusal claims under the Due Process Clause, for an amorphous \xe2\x80\x9cprobability of bias,\xe2\x80\x9d will itself bring our judicial system into undeserved disrepute, and diminish the confidence of the American people in the fairness and integrity of their courts.

See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 10.  As The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent makes painfully clear, the principal consequence of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is to create vast uncertainty with respect to a point of law that can be raised in all litigated cases in (at least) those 39 States that elect their judges.  This course was urged upon us on grounds that it would preserve the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in the judicial system.  Brief for Petitioners 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision will have the opposite effect.  What above all else is eroding public confidence in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s judicial system is the perception that litigation is just a game, that the party with the most resourceful lawyer can play it to win, that our seemingly interminable legal proceedings are wonderfully self-perpetuating but incapable of delivering real-world justice.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will reinforce that perception, adding to the vast arsenal of lawyerly gambits what will come to be known as the <em>Caperton </em>claim.  The facts relevant to adjudicating it will have to be litigated\xe2\x80\x94and likewise the law governing it, which will be indeterminate for years to come, if not forever.  Many billable hours will be spent in poring through volumes of campaign finance reports, and many more in contesting nonrecusal decisions through every available means.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Talmudic maxim instructs with respect to the Scripture: \xe2\x80\x9cTurn it over, and turn it over, for all is therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Aboth, Ch. V, Mishnah 22 (I. Epstein ed. 1935).  Divinely inspired text may contain the answers to all earthly questions, but the Due Process Clause most assuredly does not.  The Court today continues its quixotic quest to right all wrongs and repair all imperfections through the Constitution.  Alas, the quest cannot succeed\xe2\x80\x94which is why some wrongs and imperfections have been called nonjusticiable.  In the best of all possible worlds, should judges sometimes recuse even where the clear commands of our prior due process law do not require it?  Undoubtedly.  The relevant question, however, is whether we do more good than harm by seeking to correct this imperfection through expansion of our constitutional mandate in a manner ungoverned by any discernable rule.  The answer is obvious.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
