Like them, it is a proceeding to compel appellant to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 245 U. S. 49</a></p><p> answer certain questions asked him by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  It was based on a petition like the petitions in those cases, to which there was a like reply.</p>\n<p>The court entered an order requiring appellant to answer the following questions asked by counsel for the Commission:</p>\n<p>"I will ask you if you distributed in the State of Alabama on behalf of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad campaign funds favoring the election of a certain candidate?"</p>\n<p>"I show you Ledger H, folio 454, from the records of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, showing certain vouchers sent you in Alabama for various amounts, and will ask you how you expended the money represented by these vouchers, taking the first voucher as a beginning."</p>\n<p>"I will ask you whether or not you have personal knowledge of funds of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad and of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway used to the extent of thousands of dollars for political campaign purposes in the State of Alabama. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="50">Page 245 U.
