Appellees sought to vindicate their constitutional rights and to represent a class consisting of all persons under 18 "who have been, are, or, may be admitted or committed" to state mental health facilities.  The statute provided, <em>inter alia,</em> that a juvenile might be admitted upon a parent\'s application, and that, unlike an adult, the admitted person was free to withdraw only with the consent of the parent admitting him.  After the commencement of the action, regulations were promulgated substantially increasing the procedural safeguards afforded minors aged 13 or older.  After those regulations had become effective, and notwithstanding the differentiation therein between juveniles of less than 13 and those 13 to 18, the District Court certified the class to be represented by the plaintiffs as consisting of all persons 18 or younger who have been or may be admitted or committed to Pennsylvania mental health facilities pursuant to the challenged provisions.  The District Court later issued a decision holding those provisions violative of due process.  In July, 1976, after that decision, and after this Court had noted probable jurisdiction, a new statute was enacted, repealing the provisions held to be unconstitutional except insofar as they relate to the mentally retarded.  Under the 1976 Act, a person 14 or over may voluntarily admit himself, but his parents may not do so; thus, those 14 to 18 who were subject to commitment by their parents under the 1966 Act are treated as adults by the 1976 Act.  Children 13 and younger may still be admitted for treatment by a parent.  Those f4 and over may withdraw from voluntary treatment by giving written notice.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellees Bartley, Gentile, Levine, Mathews, and Weand were the named plaintiffs in a complaint challenging the constitutionality of Pennsylvania statutes governing the voluntary admission and voluntary commitment to Pennsylvania mental health institutions of persons 18 years of age or younger.  The named plaintiffs alleged that they were then being held at Haverford State Hospital, a Pennsylvania mental health facility, and that they had been admitted or committed pursuant to the challenged provisions of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 431 U. S. 122</a></p><p> Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 50, \xc2\xa7 4101 <em>et seq.</em> (1969).  Various state and hospital officials were named as defendants. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs sought to vindicate not only their own constitutional rights, but also sought to represent a class consisting of</p>\n<p>"all persons under eighteen years of age who have been, are, or, may be admitted or committed to Haverford State Hospital and all other state mental health facilities under the challenged provisions of the state statute."</p>\n<p>App. 10a-11a (complaint 117)</p>\n<p>A three-judge United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania struck down the statutes as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  402 F.Supp. 1039 (1975).  The court also entered a broad order requiring the implementation of detailed procedural protections for those admitted under the Pennsylvania statutes.  On December 15, 1975, this Court granted appellants\' application for a stay of the judgment of the District Court.  On March 22, 1976, we noted probable jurisdiction.  424 U.S. 964.</p>\n<p>In general, the 1966 Act, which has been superseded to a significant degree, provides for three types of admission to a mental health facility for examination, treatment, and care:  voluntary admission or commitment (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 402 and 403), emergency commitment (\xc2\xa7 405), and civil court commitment (\xc2\xa7 406).  At issue here was the constitutionality of the voluntary admission and commitment statutes, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 402 and 403, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 431 U. S. 123</a></p><p> as those statutes reglate the admission of persons 18 years of age or younger.  The statutes [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] provide that juveniles may be admitted upon the application of a parent, guardian, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 431 U. S. 124</a></p><p> or individual standing <em>in loco parentis</em> and that, unlike adults, the admitted person is free to withdraw only with the consent of the parent or guardian admitting him. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>There have been two major changes in the Pennsylvania statutory scheme that have materially affected the rights of juveniles:  the promulgation of regulations under the 1966 Act, and the enactment of the Mental Health Procedures Act in 1976.  At the time the complaint was filed, the 1966 Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 431 U. S. 125</a></p><p> made little or no distinction between older and younger juveniles.  Each of the named plaintiffs was at that time between 15 and 18 years of age.  After the commencement of his action, but before class certification or decision on the merits by the District Court, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare promulgated regulations which substantially increased the procedural safeguards afforded to minors 13 years of age or older.  The regulations, promulgated pursuant to statutory authority, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] became effective September 1, 1973.  The major impact of the regulations [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] upon this litigation stems from the fact that the regulations accord significant procedural protections to those 13 and older, but not to those less than 13.  The older juveniles are given notification of their rights, the telephone number of counsel, and the right to institute a \xc2\xa7 406 involuntary commitment proceeding in court within two business days.  Under \xc2\xa7 406, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] a judicial hearing is held after notice to the parties.  The younger juveniles are not given the right to a hearing and, are still remitted to relying upon the admitting parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>Although the regulations sharply differentiate between juveniles of less than 13 years of age and those 13 to 18, on April 29, 1974, the District Court nonetheless certified the following class to be represented by the plaintiffs:</p>\n<p>"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1) and (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the class comprised of all persons eighteen years of age or younger who have been, are or may be admitted or committed to mental health facilities in Pennsylvania pursuant to the challenged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 431 U. S. 126</a></p><p> provisions of the state mental health law (<em>i.e.,</em> 50 P.S. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4402 and 4403).  This definition of the class is without prejudice to the possibility that it may be amended or altered before the decision on the merits herein."</p>\n<p>App. 270a.</p>\n<p>On July 9, 1976, after the decision below and after this Court had noted probable jurisdiction, Pennsylvania enacted a new statute substantially altering its voluntary admission procedures.  Mental Health Procedures Act, Pa.Act No. 143.  The new Act completely repeals the provisions declared unconstitutional below except insofar as they relate to mentally retarded persons.  \xc2\xa7 502.  Under the new Act, any person 14 years of age or over may voluntarily admit himself, but his parents may not do so; those 14 to 18 who were subject to commitment by their parents under the 1966 Act are treated essentially as adults under the new Act. \xc2\xa7 201. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Under the new Act, children 13 and younger may still be admitted for treatment by a parent, guardian, or person standing <em>in loco parentis.</em> <em>Ibid.</em>  Those 14 and over may withdraw from voluntary treatment "at any time by giving written notice."  \xc2\xa7 206(a). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Those under 14 may be released by request of the parent; in addition, "any responsible party" may petition the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 431 U. S. 127</a></p><p> Pleas to request withdrawal of the child or modification of his treatment.  \xc2\xa7 206(b).</p>\n<p>Because we have concluded that the claims of the named appellees are mooted by the new Act, and that the claims of the unnamed members of the class are not properly presented for review, we do not dwell at any length upon the statutory scheme for voluntary commitment in Pennsylvania or upon the rationale of the District Court\'s holding that the 1966 Act and regulations did not satisfy due process.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case presents important constitutional issues -- issues that were briefed and argued before this Court.  However, for reasons hereafter discussed, we conclude that the claims of the named appellees are mooted by the new Act and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 431 U. S. 128</a></p><p> decline to adjudicate the claims of the class certified by the District Court.  That class has been fragmented by the enactment of the new Act and the promulgation of the regulations.</p>\n<p>Constitutional adjudication being a matter of "great gravity and delicacy," <em>see Ashwander v.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The essence of their position was that, as matters stood at that time, a juvenile 18 or younger could be "voluntarily" admitted upon application of his parent, over the objection of the juvenile himself.  Thus, appellees urged in their complaint that the Due Process Clause required that they be accorded the right to a hearing, as well as other procedural protections, to ensure the validity of the commitment.  App. 21a-22a (complaint \xef\xbf\xbd 46).</p>\n<p>The fact that the Act was passed after the decision below does not save the named appellees\' claims from mootness.  There must be a live case or controversy before this Court, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 431 U. S. 129</a></p><p> <em>Sosna v.

The Act, in essence, treats mentally ill juveniles 14 and older as adults.  They may voluntarily commit themselves, but their parents may not do so, \xc2\xa7 201, and one receiving voluntary treatment may withdraw at any time by giving written notice.  \xc2\xa7 206.  With respect to the named appellees, the Act completely repealed and replaced the statutes challenged below, and obviated their demand for a hearing, and other procedural protections, since the named appellees had total freedom to leave the hospital, and could not be forced to return absent their consent.  After the passage of the Act, in no sense were the named appellees "detained and incarcerated involuntarily in mental hospitals," as they had alleged in the complaint, App. 21a.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>If the only appellees before us were the named appellees, the mootness of the case with respect to them would require that we vacate the judgment of the District Court with instructions to dismiss their complaint.  <em>United States v.

But we have never adopted a flat rule that the mere fact of certification of a class by a district court was sufficient to require us to decide the merits of the claims of unnamed class members when those of the named parties had become moot.  <em>Cf. Sosna, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/393/case.html#402">419 U. S. 402</a></span>.  Here, the promulgation of the regulations materially changed, prior to class certification, the controverted issues with respect to a large number of unnamed plaintiffs; prior to decision by this Court, the controverted issues pertaining to even more unnamed plaintiffs have been affected by the passage of the 1976 Act.  We do not think that the fragmented residual of the class originally certified by the District Court may be treated as were the classes in <em>Sosna</em> and <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p>There is an obvious lack of homogeneity among those unnamed members of the class originally certified by the District Court.  Analysis of the current status of the various subgroups reveals a bewildering lineup of permutations and combinations.  As we parse it, the claims of those 14 and older and mentally ill are moot.  They have received by statute all that they claimed under the Constitution.  Those 14 and older and mentally retarded are subject to the 1966 Act, struck down by the District Court, but are afforded the protections of the regulations.  Their claims are not wholly mooted, but are satisfied in many respects by the regulations.  Those 13 and mentally ill are subject to the admissions procedures of the new Act, arguably supplemented by the procedural protection of the regulations.  The status of their claims is unclear.  Those 13 and mentally retarded are subject to the 1966 Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  Their claims are satisfied in many respects.  Those younger than 13 and mentally ill are unaided by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 431 U. S. 131</a></p><p> regulations, and are subject to the admissions procedures of the 1976 Act, the constitutional effect of which has not been reviewed by the District Court.  Those younger than 13 and mentally retarded are subject to the 1966 Act, unaffected by the regulations.  This latter group is thus the <em>only</em> group whose status has not changed materially since the outset of the litigation.  These fragmented subclasses are represented by named plaintiffs whose constitutional claims are moot, and it is the attorneys for these named plaintiffs who have conducted the litigation in the District Court and in this Court. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The factors which we have just described make the class aspect of this litigation a far cry indeed from that aspect of the litigation in <em>Sosna</em> and in <em>Franks,</em> where we adjudicated the merits of the class claims notwithstanding the mootness of the claims of the named parties.  In <em>Sosna,</em> the named plaintiff had, by the time the litigation reached this Court, fulfilled the residency requirement which she was challenging, but the class described in the District Court\'s certification remained exactly the same.  In that case, mootness was due to the inexorable passage of time, rather than to any change in the law.  In <em>Franks,</em> a Title VII discrimination lawsuit, the named plaintiff had been subsequently discharged for a nondiscriminatory reason, and therefore before this Court that plaintiff no longer had a controversy with his employer similar to those of the unnamed members of the class.  But </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 431 U. S. 132</a></p><p> the metes and bounds of each of those classes remained the same; the named plaintiff was simply no longer within them.</p>\n<p>Here, by contrast, the metes and bounds of the class certified by the District Court have been carved up by two changes in the law.  In <em>Sosna</em> and <em>Franks,</em> the named plaintiffs had simply "left" the class, but the class remained substantially unaltered.  In both of those cases, the named plaintiff\'s mootness was not related to any factor also affecting the unnamed members of the class.  In this case, however, the class has been both truncated and compartmentalized by legislative action; this intervening legislation has rendered moot not only the claims of the named plaintiffs, but also the claims of a large number of unnamed plaintiffs. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The legislation, coupled with the regulations, has, in a word, materially changed the status of those included within the class description.</p>\n<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, we have the gravest doubts whether the class, as presently constituted, comports with the requirements of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(a). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  And it is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 431 U. S. 133</a></p><p> only a "properly certified" class that may succeed to the adversary position of a named representative whose claim becomes moot.  <em>Indianapolis School Comm\'rs v. Jacobs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/128/case.html">420 U. S. 128</a></span> (1975).</p>\n<p>In addition to the differences to which we have already adverted, the issues presented by these appellees, unlike that presented by the appellant in <em>Sosna, supra,</em> are not "capable of repetition, yet evading review."  In the latter case, there is a significant benefit in according the class representative the opportunity to litigate on behalf of the class, since otherwise there may well never be a definitive resolution of the constitutional claim on the merits by this Court.  We stated in <em>Franks</em> that,</p>\n<p>"[g]iven a properly certified class action, . . . mootness turns on whether, in the specific circumstances of the given case at the time it is before this Court, an adversary relationship sufficient to fulfill this function exists."</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#755">424 U. S. 755</a></span>-756.  We noted that the "evading review" element was one factor to be considered in evaluating the adequacy of the adversary relationship in this Court.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#756">424 U. S. 756</a></span> n. 8.  In this case, not only is the issue one that will not evade review, but the existence of a "properly certified class action" is dubious, and the initial shortcomings in the certification have multiplied.  <em>See Indianapolis School Comm\'rs v. Jacobs, supra.</em></p>\n<p>In sum, none of the critical factors that might require us to adjudicate the claims of a class after mootness of the named plaintiff\'s claims are present here.  We are dealing with important constitutional issues on the merits, issues which are not apt to evade review, in the context of mooted claims on the part of all of the named parties and a certified class which, whatever the merits of its original </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 431 U. S. 134</a></p><p> certification by the District Court, has been fragmented by the enactment of legislation since that certification.  While there are "live" disputes between unnamed members of portions of the class certified by the District Court, on the one hand, and appellants, on the other, these disputes are so unfocused as to make informed resolution of them almost impossible.  <em>Cf. Fusari v. Steinberg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/379/case.html">419 U. S. 379</a></span> (1976).  We accordingly decline to pass on the merits of appellees\' constitutional claims. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We conclude that, before the "live" claims of the fragmented subclasses remaining in this litigation can be decided on the merits, the case must be remanded to the District Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 431 U. S. 135</a></p><p> for reconsideration of the class definition, exclusion of those whose claims are moot, and substitution of class representatives with live claims</p>\n<p>Because the District Court will confront this task on remand, we think it not amiss to remind that court that it is under the same obligation as we are to "stop, look, and listen" before certifying a class in order to adjudicate constitutional claims.  That court, in its original certification, ignored the effect of the regulations promulgated by appellants which made a dramatic distinction between older and younger juveniles, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and, according to the District Court, 402 F.Supp. at 1042, accorded the named appellees all of the protections which they sought, save two:  the right to a precommitment hearing, and the specification of the time for the postcommitment hearing.</p>\n<p>This distinction between older and younger juveniles, recognized by state administrative authorities (and later by the Pennsylvania Legislature in its enactment of the 1976 Act), emphasizes the very possible differences in the interests of the older juveniles and the younger juveniles.  Separate counsel for the younger juveniles might well have concluded that it would not have been in the best interest of their clients to press for the requirement of an automatic precommitment hearing, because of the possibility that such a hearing, with its propensity to pit parent against child, might actually be antithetical to the best interest of the younger juveniles.  In the event that these issues are again litigated before the District Court, careful attention must be paid to the differences between mentally ill and mentally retarded, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 431 U. S. 136</a></p><p> and between the young and the very young.  It may be that Pennsylvania\'s experience in implementing the new Act will shed light on these issues.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This disposition is made with full recognition of the importance of the issues, and of our assumption that all parties earnestly seek a decision on the merits.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his famous concurrence in <em>Ashwander v. TVA,</em> 297 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html#345">297 U.

However, because issues of ripeness involve, at least in part, the existence of a live \'Case or Controversy,\' we cannot rely upon concessions of the parties and must determine whether the issues are ripe for decision in the \'Case or Controversy\' sense.  Further, to the extent that questions of ripeness involve the exercise of judicial restraint from unnecessary decision of constitutional issues, the Court must determine whether to exercise that restraint and cannot be bound by the wishes of the parties."</p>\n<p><em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html">419 U.

This approach disregards the prerequisites to class actions contained in Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(a), <em>see</em> <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>infra,</em> and, pushed to its logical conclusions, would do away with the standing requirement of Art.

S. 142</a></span>, seeks to minimize the extent of the changes in the law by asserting that only 20% of the plaintiff class is affected by the new Act.  Even if this assertion were undisputed, it would not affect our disposition of the case.  But we have no way to test the reliability of that figure.  Before the new Act was passed, the distinction between mentally ill and mentally retarded was largely irrelevant for admissions purposes; hence, the District Court made no findings with respect to the proportion of the class in each category, and the dissent does not indicate any support in the record for this figure, which first appears in the Reply Brief for Appellants 1 n. 2.  Since this information was supplied by a party seeking a determination on the merits, it cannot be treated as a form of "admission against interest" by a litigant on appeal.  In addition, the suggestion that 80% of the class remains <em>in statu quo ante</em> completely overlooks the substantial changes wrought by the regulations, which classified on the basis of age, rather than on the basis of mental illness or mental retardation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Rule 23(a) provides:</p>\n<p>"(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action.

JUSTICE BRENNAN suggests that our refusal to review the merits of these claims, and our vacation of the District Court\'s judgment, are simply a confusing and unnecessary exaltation of form over substance.  While our refusal to pass on the merits rests on discretionary considerations, we have long heeded such discretionary coused in constitutional litigation.  <em>See Ashwander v. TVA,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html">297 U. S. 288</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html#341">297 U. S. 341</a></span> (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  The dissent\'s startling statement that our insistence on plaintiffs with live claims is "purely a matter of form," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#142">431 U. S. 142</a></span>, would read into the Constitution a vastly expanded version of Rule 23 while reading Art. III out of the Constitution.  The availability of thoroughly prepared attorneys to argue both sides of a constitutional question, and of numerous <em>amici curiae</em> ready to assist in the decisional process, even though all of them "stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start," does not dispense with the requirement that there be a live dispute between "live" parties before we decide such a question.</p>\n<p>The dissent, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">431 U. S. 137</span>, attaches great weight to the fact that the State argues that the case is not moot.  As we have pointed out in the text, <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#136">431 U. S. 136</a></span>, the fact that the parties desire a decision on the merits does not automatically entitle them to receive such a decision.  It is not at all unusual for all parties in a case to desire an adjudication on the merits when the alternative is additional litigation; but their desires can be scarcely thought to dictate the result of our inquiry into whether the merits should be reached.  The dissent\'s additional reliance on the "numerous <em>amici</em> [who have requested] an authoritative constitutional ruling . . . ," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#140">431 U.

After several pages in which the Court parses decisions like <em>Sosna v. Iowa,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/393/case.html">419 U. S. 393</a></span> (1975), and <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html">424 U. S. 747</a></span> (1976), for selected clauses and phrases, thereby attempting to distinguish the present case from those earlier decisions where class claims were allowed to reach decision, the opinion ultimately concludes that, in their present posture, the legal claims of the class members "are so unfocused as to make informed resolution of them almost impossible," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#134">431 U. S. 134</a></span>, citing <em>Fusari v. Steinberg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/379/case.html">419 U. S. 379</a></span> (1975).  Accordingly, the Court "decline[s] to pass on the merits of appellees\' constitutional claims," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#134">431 U. S. 134</a></span>, and remands to the District Court for clarification of the class certification.</p>\n<p>What does all this mean?  Most importantly, the Court\'s class action analysis must be placed in proper perspective, for it is obvious that the Court\'s extended discussion of <em>Sosna, Franks,</em> and like cases is a mere camouflage of dicta bearing no relationship to the disposition of this case.  Those earlier cases merely recognized the continued existence of Art. III jurisdiction notwithstanding the subsequent mootness of the claims of the named parties to a class action.  They said nothing about this Court\'s discretionary authority to remand a class claim or any other claim to the lower courts for needed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 431 U. S. 139</a></p><p> clarification.  Thus, in the present case, the fact that the claims of the named plaintiffs may or may not be mooted, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#128">431 U. S. 128</a></span>-129, is irrelevant, for, if the condition of the record so requires, a remand to clarify matters necessary to permit proper consideration of the issues in this appeal would be warranted regardless of whether the named parties remained in the case.  Similarly, the Court\'s various suggestions that these named plaintiffs "left" the class in a manner distinguishable from those in <em>Sosna</em> and <em>Franks, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#132">431 U. S. 132</a></span>, and that the issues presented herein are "not capable of repetition, yet evading review," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#133">431 U. S. 133</a></span>, are without meaning.  This Court\'s power to remand cases as in <em>Fusari v. Steinberg</em> is in no way dependent on these factors, and is not foreclosed by the existence of Art. III jurisdiction as found in <em>Franks, Sosna,</em> and their progeny.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it is clear that for all the extraneous discussion of <em>Sosna</em> and <em>Franks,</em> the decision today follows those cases, for it recognizes that an Art. III "case or controversy" persists in this instance notwithstanding the apparent mootness of the claims of named plaintiffs, and, therefore, confirms that our jurisdiction is constitutionally viable.  Otherwise, of course, the Court could not, as it does today, voluntarily "decline" to pass on the merits of the suit <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#134">431 U. S. 134</a></span>, but rather would be <em>compelled</em> to avoid any such decision.  While, as shall be seen, I disagree that the modification of Pennsylvania law warrants even a clarifying remand in this instance, I think it particularly unwise to hide a purely discretionary decision behind the language of Art. III jurisdiction.  After all, the action actually taken today by the Court -- a remand for consideration in light of intervening law -- is regularly ordered in one or two short paragraphs without such fanfare or gratuitous discussion.  <em>See, e.g., Philadelphia v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/141/case.html">430 U. S. 141</a></span> (1977); <em>cf. Cook v. Hudson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/165/case.html">429 U. S. 165</a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p>I do not express this objection to the Court\'s opinion due to a concern for craft alone.  Jurisdictional and procedural matters </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 431 U. S. 140</a></p><p> regularly dealt with by the Court often involve complex and esoteric concepts.  An opinion that is likely to lead to misapplication of these principles will cost litigants dearly and will needlessly consume the time of lower courts in attempting to decipher and construe our commands.  Consequently, I have frequently voiced my concern that the recent Art. III jurisprudence of this Court in such areas as mootness and standing is creating an obstacle course of confusing standardless rules to be fathomed by courts and litigants, <em>see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U. S. 490</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#519">422 U. S. 519</a></span>-530 (1975) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); <em>DeFunis v. Odegaard,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/312/case.html#348">416 U. S. 348</a></span>-350 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), without functionally aiding in the clear, adverse presentation of the constitutional questions presented.  As written, today\'s opinion can only further stir up the jurisdictional stew and frustrate the efforts of litigants who legitimately seek access to the courts for guidance on the content of fundamental constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>In this very case, for example, we deny to the parties and to numerous <em>amici</em> intervenors an authoritative constitutional ruling for a reason that, at best, has only surface plausibility.  In truth, the Court\'s purported concern for the "lack of homogeneity" among the children in the class is meaningless in the context of this appeal.  The District Court\'s judgment established and applied a minimum threshold of due process rights available across the board to all chillren who are committed to mental facilities by their parents pursuant to Pennsylvania law.  The core of the mandated rights, essentially the nonwaivable appointment of counsel for every child and the convening of commitment hearings within specified time periods, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] applies equally to all Pennsylvania children who are subject to parental commitment.  In reviewing the propriety of these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 431 U. S. 141</a></p><p> threshold constitutional requirements, our inquiry is not to any meaningful extent affected by the intervening change in Pennsylvania law. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Indeed, we are informed by Pennsylvania officials that the 1976 amendment, by abolishing parental commitment of mentally ill children over 14, merely serves to eliminate 20% of the members of the certified class from the lawsuit.  Reply Brief for Appellants 1.  The amendment, however, bears no relationship whatever to the District Court\'s judgment insofar as it pertains to the remaining 80% of the class -- that is, to those children who can still be committed by their parents. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania itself </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 431 U. S. 142</a></p><p> acknowledges that</p>\n<p>"[o]ver three-fourths of the plaintiff class . . . are subject to the very statutes which the lower court examined, declared unconstitutional, and enjoined."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 3.  The Court\'s disposition of this case, therefore, ensures nothing but an opportunity for the waste of valuable time and energy.  At most, the District Court on remand realistically can be expected to confirm that 20% of the children no longer are members of the class, while reaffirming its carefully considered judgment as to the remaining 80%.  I do not understand why we do not spare the District Court this purely mechanical task of paring down the class, for nothing would now prevent us from excluding 20% of the children from our consideration of the merits and evaluating the District Court\'s judgment as it affects the remaining 80%.  <em>See, e.g., Franks v. Bowman Transportaton Co.,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#755">424 U. S. 755</a></span>-757.</p>\n<p>Nor can the Court\'s action be justified by its order to the District Court that new class representatives with live claims be substituted to press forward with the suit.  For, again, in the posture of this case, this is purely a matter of form.  <em>Franks, Sosna,</em> and <em>Gerstein v. Pugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/103/case.html">420 U. S. 103</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/103/case.html#110">420 U. S. 110</a></span>-111, n. 11 (1975), plainly recognize and act upon the premise that, given the representative nature of class actions, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] the elimination of named plaintiffs ordinarily will have no effect on the</p>\n<p>"concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the Court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 431 U. S. 143</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U. S. 204</a></span> (1962).  Certainly, in this appeal, there can be no question of adequate adversity and cogency of argument.  Attorneys for the class\' continue diligently to defend their judgment in behalf of the children who are still within the purview of Pennsylvania\'s parental commitment law.  Pennsylvania equally diligently resists the District Court\'s judgment and pressures for a controlling constitutional decision.  And a vast assortment of <em>amici curiae,</em> ranging from sister States to virtually all relevant professional organizations, have submitted briefs informing our deliberations from every perspective and orientation plausibly relevant to the case.  In brief, the Court\'s assertion of its inability "to make informed resolution of" the issues is, in this instance, pure fancy.</p>\n<p>I do not believe that we discharge our institutional duty fairly, or properly service the constituencies who depend on our guidance, by issuing meaningless remands that play wasteful games with litigants and lower courts. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Therefore, I respectfully </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 431 U. S. 144</a></p><p> dissent from the Court\'s disposition of this case.  Because the Court does not address the important constitutional questions presented, I too shall defer the expression of my views, pending the Court\'s inevitable review of those questions in a later case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The statutory modification upon which the Court principally relies for mootness pertains solely to mentally ill children 14 or older, whereas the class consists of all children who are mentally ill and retarded.  Since this distinction was irrelevant when the action commenced, the complaint does not inform us whether the named class members, while older than 14, are mentally ill or mentally retarded.  Thus, it is accurate for the Court to state that. "insofar as the record indicates," all the named children are mentally ill and consequently fall within the purview of the 1976 statutory amendment.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#128">431 U. S. 128</a></span>.  But, since the record barely scratches the surface in this regard, it is possible that some of the children have been committed because of retardation.  If so, the Court\'s supposition that the claims of the named parties are mooted is inaccurate, and presumably can be corrected by the District Court on remand.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In brief, the District Court mandated a probable cause hearing within 72 hours of the initial detention, followed by a complete post-commitment hearing within two weeks thereafter.  402 F.Supp. 1039, 1049 (ED Pa.1975).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The September 1, 1973, regulations, on which the Court additionally places some reliance, are even less relevant to the proper disposition of this case.  Under these regulations, the procedural rights of juveniles 13 or older underwent change following commencement of this suit.  These older juveniles now must be informed of their rights within 24 hours of commitment, and must be given the telephone number of an attorney.  Should the retarded or mentally ill child be capable and willing to take the initiative, he may object to this commitment, contact his lawyer, and request a hearing.  The hospital then can file an involuntary commitment petition, whereby the child remains in the institution pending the hearing on his commitment; the regulations fix no time period in which this hearing must be held.  In its consideration of this case, the District Court was fully aware of these regulations, but concluded that they do not resolve the constitutional infirmities that it found to inhere in Pennsylvania\'s statutory scheme.  <em>Id.</em> at 1042-1043, n. 5.  In particular, the regulations fall far short of satisfying the lower court\'s judgment in its failure to guarantee to every child the nonwaivable guidance of an attorney and a prompt commitment hearing within a specified time period.  For this reason, the Court\'s concern that the class is subdivided into "a bewildering lineup of permutations and combinations," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#130">431 U. S. 130</a></span>, actually is of no constitutional significance to the decision of this suit.  For even taking the regulations into account, all the children who can be committed by their parents continue to be held pursuant to procedures as to which plaintiffs complain, and as to which the District Court concluded, constitutional standards are not satisfied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1976 Act does provide that, with respect to all children, a "responsible party" may step forward and challenge a child\'s commitment by filing a petition in the juvenile court requesting the appointment of an attorney and the convening of a hearing. Mental Health Procedures Act \xc2\xa7 206(b) (1976).  Given that the most likely "responsible party," the child\'s parents, are the persons seeking his institutionalization, Pennsylvania itself recognizes that this amounts to "no real change in the law," and to no "additional procedural protections. "  Reply Brief for Appellants l-2, n. 3.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Craig v. Boren,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html">429 U. S. 190</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html#194">429 U.

III and Rule 23.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#131">431 U. S. 131</a></span> n. 12,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/119/case.html#134">431 U. S. 134</a></span> n. 15.  This contention is seriously misleading.  When the class was duly certified in 1974, both Rule 23 and Art. III were properly complied with -- as I agree they must be.  The Rule 23 issue is no longer before us, for we cannot, some three years later, <em>sua sponte</em> and over the objection of all parties, challenge compliance with a Rule of Civil Procedure, unless, of course, noncompliance or some intervening circumstance serves to undercut our jurisdiction.  That is not the case here, however, for both the majority and I are in agreement that no jurisdictional defect is to be found.  In sum, therefore, the inquiry applicable to this case is the following:  does this Court properly exercise its discretion through its remand to the District Court when (1) our Art. III jurisdiction is sound, and (2) the class plaintiff was properly certified pursuant to Federal Rule, and (3) no party objected or today objects to the certification, and (4) the class continues to possess live claims and a District Court judgment that are unaffected by any constitutionally relevant changes in state law, and (5) the substance of the constitutional contentions continue to be litigated cogently by both partes?  When these factors are fairly taken into account, the conclusion is plain that today\'s action can be justified neither by the quasi-jurisdictional language which the Court needlessly includes in its opinion nor by sound, practical considerations of discretion.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
