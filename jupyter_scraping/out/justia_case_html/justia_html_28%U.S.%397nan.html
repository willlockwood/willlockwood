CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL said that the Reporter of the Court is the proper person to give copies of the opinions delivered by the Court.  The opinions were delivered to him after they were read, and not to the Clerk, and they were not, therefore, in his office to be copied.  Not being filed in the clerk\'s office, he could not certify copies of the opinions under the seal of<em> the Court.\n</em></p>\n<p>If an authenticated copy of the opinion of the Court is desired, the Reporter only could furnish it, certified, and the Clerk of the Court may certify, under the seal of the Court that he is the Reporter if this should also be required.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
