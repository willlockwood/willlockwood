" <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Where the Senate and House Committee Reports differ is in their description of the "representative" who, once designated, would require that compensatory time be provided only pursuant to an agreement between that representative and the employer.

The court went on to clarify that "Texas law prohibits any bilateral agreement between a city and a bargaining agent, whether the agreement is labeled a collective bargaining agreement or something else.

The court assumed that designation of a union representative normally would establish that employees are "covered" by subclause (i), and hence render subclause (ii) inapplicable, but went on to hold that subclause (i) cannot apply in States, like Texas, that prohibit collective bargaining in the public sector. <i>Merritt </i>v. <i>Klevenhagen, </i>Civ.

Reaching the same result by an alternative route, the court also reasoned that petitioners were not "covered" by subclause (i) because their union was not" \'recognized\'" by the county, a requirement it grounded in the legislative history of the 1985 Amendments. <i>Id., </i>at 6, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a.</p><p>The Court of Appeals affirmed, but relied on slightly different reasoning.

Instead, it describes only a category of agreements-those that (a) are bargained with an employee representative, and (b) authorize the use of comp time.</p><p>Respondents read this shift in subject from "employees" in subclause (ii) to "agreement" in subclause (i) as susceptible of just one meaning: Employees are covered by subclause (i) only if they are bound by applicable provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement. Under this narrow construction, subclause (i) would not cover employees who designate a representative if that representative is unable to reach agreement with the employer, for whatever reason; such employees would remain "uncovered" and available for individual comp time agreements under subclause (ii).</p><p>We find this reading unsatisfactory. First, while the language of subclauses (i) and (ii) will bear the interpretation advanced by respondents, we cannot say that it will bear no other. Purely as a matter of grammar, subclause (ii)\'s reference to "employees" remains unmodified by subclause (i)\'s focus on "agreement," and "employees ... covered" might as easily comprehend employees with representatives as employees with agreements. See <i>International Assn. of Fire Fighters, Local 2203 </i>v. <i>West Adams County Fire Dist., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/877/814/">877 F.2d 814</a>, 816-817, and n. 1 (CAlO 1989).</p><p>Second, respondents\' reading is difficult to reconcile with the general structure of subsection 7(0). Assuming designation of an employee representative, respondents\' theory leaves it to the employer to choose whether it will proceed under subclause (i), and negotiate the terms of a collective comp time agreement with the representative, or instead proceed under subclause (ii), and deal directly with its employees on an individual basis. If the employer is free to choose the latter course (as most employers likely would), then it need only decline to negotiate with the employee representative to render subclause (i) inapplicable and authorize</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="33">33</a></p><p>individual comp time agreements under subclause (ii).15 This permissive interpretation of subsection 7(0), however, is at odds with the limiting phrase of subclause (ii) at issue here. See <i>supra, </i>at 31. Had Congress intended such an open-ended authorization of the use of comp time, it surely would have said so more simply, forgoing the elaborate subclause structure that purports to restrict use of individual agreements to a limited class of employees. Respondents\' broad interpretation of the subsection 7(0) exception is also in some tension with the well-established rule that "exemptions from the [FLSA] are to be narrowly construed." See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Mitchell </i>v. <i>Kentucky Finance Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/290/case.html">359 U. S. 290</a>, 295296 (1959).</p><p>At the same time, however, we find equally implausible a reading of the statutory text that would deem employees "covered" by subclause (i) whenever they select a representative, whether or not the representative has the ability to enter into the kind of agreement described in that subclause. If there is no possibility of reaching an agreement under subclause (i), then that subclause cannot logically be read as applicable. In other words, "employees ... covered by subclause (i)" must, at a minimum, be employees who conceivably could receive comp time pursuant to the agreement contemplated by that subclause.</p><p>The most plausible reading of the phrase "employees ... covered by subclause (i)" is, in our view, neither of the extreme alternatives described above. Rather, the phrase is</p><p>15 Indeed, even an employer who is party to a collective-bargaining agreement with its employees may be permitted to take advantage of subclause (ii) under respondents\' construction. Because subclause (i) describes only those agreements that authorize the use of comp time, see supra, at 31-32, a collective-bargaining agreement silent on the subject, or even one prohibiting use of comp time altogether, would not constitute a subclause (i) agreement. Accordingly, employees bound by such an agreement would not be "covered by subclause (i)" under respondents\' theory, and their employer would be free to provide comp time instead of overtime pay pursuant to individual employee agreements.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="34">34</a></p><p>most sensibly read as referring to employees who have designated a representative with the authority to negotiate and agree with their employer on "applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement" authorizing the use of comp time. This reading accords significance to both the focus on the word "agreement" in subclause (i) and the focus on "employees" in subclause (ii). It is also true to the hierarchy embodied in subsection 7(0), which favors subclause (i) agreements over individual agreements by limiting use of the latter to cases in which the former are unavailable.16</p><p>This intermediate reading of the statutory text is consistent also with the DOL regulations, interpreted most reasonably. It is true that 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 553.23(b), read in isolation, would support petitioners\' view that selection of a representative by employees-even a representative without lawful authority to bargain with the employer-is sufficient to bring the employees within the scope of subclause (i) and preclude use of subclause (ii) individual agreements. See <i>supra, </i>at 27, and n. 9. So interpreted, however, the regulation would prohibit entirely the use of comp time in a substantial portion of the public sector. It would also be inconsistent with the Secretary\'s statement that "the question ... whether employees have a representative for purposes of FLSA section 7(0) shall be determined in accordance with State or local law and practices." See <i>supra, </i>at 28. This</p><p>16 So read, we do not understand subsection 7(0) to impose any new burden upon a public employer to bargain collectively with its employees. Subsection 7(0) is, after all, an exception to the general FLSA rule mandating overtime pay for overtime work, and employers may take advantage of the benefits it offers "only" pursuant to certain conditions set forth by Congress. 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7207(0)(2); see n. 2, supra. Once its employees designate a representative authorized to engage in collective bargaining, an employer is entitled to take advantage of those benefits if it reaches a comp time agreement with the representative. It is also free, of course, to forgo collective bargaining altogether; if it so chooses, it remains in precisely the same position as any other employer subject to the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="35">35</a></p><p>clarification by the Secretary convinces us that when the regulations identify selection of a representative as the condition necessary for coverage under subclause (i), they refer only to those representatives with lawful authority to negotiate agreementsP</p><p>Thus, under both the statute and the DOL regulations, employees are "covered" by subclause (i) when they designate a representative who lawfully may bargain collectively on their behalf-under the statute, because such authority is necessary to reach the kind of "agreement" described in subclause (i), and under the regulation, because such authority is a condition of "representative" status for subclause (i) purposes. Because we construe the statute and regulation in harmony, we need not comment further on petitioners\' argument that the Secretary\'s interpretation of the 1985 Amendments is entitled to special deference.</p><p>Petitioners in this case did not have a representative authorized by law to enter into an agreement with their employer providing for use of comp time under subclause (i). Accordingly, they were "not covered by subclause (i)," and subclause (ii) authorized the individual agreements challenged in this litigation.</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p><p>So ordered.</p><p>17 Accordingly, public employers need not fear that they will find themselves dealing with a different representative for each employee, should each of their employees choose to select his or her own representative. See Brief for the National Association of Counties et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>17. Unless such individual designations were "in accordance with State or local law and practices," the designees would not be "representatives" for purposes of subclause (i).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
