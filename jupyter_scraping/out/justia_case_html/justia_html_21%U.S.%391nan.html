CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court, and, after stating the case, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p>By the act constituting the judicial system of the United States, the district courts are courts both of common law and admiralty jurisdiction.  In the trial of all cases of seizure on land, the court sits as a court of common law.  In cases of seizure made on waters navigable by vessels of ten tons burden and upwards, the court sits as a court of admiralty.  In all cases at common law, the trial must be by jury.  In cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, it has been settled in the cases of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/297/case.html">The Vengeance,</a></span></em> 3 Dall. 297, <em>The Sally,</em> 2 Cranch 406, and <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/443/case.html">The Betsy and Charlotte,</a></span></em> 4 Cranch 443, that the trial is to be by the court.</p>\n<p>Although the two jurisdictions are vested in the same tribunal, they are as distinct from each other as if they were vested in different tribunals, and can no more be blended than a court of chancery with a court of common law.</p>\n<p>The Court for the Louisiana District, was sitting as a court of admiralty, and when it was shown that the seizure was made on land, its jurisdiction ceased.  The libel ought to have been dismissed or amended by charging that the seizure was made on land.</p>\n<p>The direction of a jury, in a case where the libel charged a seizure on water, was irregular, and any proceeding of the court, as a court of admiralty after the fact that the seizure was made on land </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 21 U. S. 395</a></p><p> appeared, would have been a proceeding without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court felt some disposition to consider this empanelling of a jury, at the instance of the claimants, as amounting to a consent that the libel should stand amended, but on reflection that idea was rejected.</p>\n<p>If this is considered as a case at common law, it would be necessary to dismiss this appeal, because the judgment could not be brought before this Court but by writ of error.  If it be considered as a case of admiralty jurisdiction, the sentence ought to be reversed because it could not be pronounced by a court of admiralty on a seizure made on land.</p>\n<p>As the libel charges a seizure on water, it is thought most advisable to</p>\n<p><em>Reverse all the proceedings to the libel and to remand the cause to the district court for further proceedings, with directions to permit the libel to be amended.</em></p>\n<p>DECREE.  This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the District Court of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is DECREED and ORDERED that the sentence of the District Court for the District of Louisiana condemning the said 422 casks of wine as forfeited to the United States be and the same hereby is reversed and annulled.  And it is further DECREED and ORDERED that the cause be remanded to the said District Court of Louisiana with directions to allow the libel in this case to be amended and to take such further proceedings </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 21 U.
