After refusing the tender of respondent, which concededly overbooked the flight, of denied boarding compensation, petitioner brought a common law action against respondent based on an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation arising from respondent\'s failure to apprise petitioner of its deliberate overbooking practices, and a statutory action under \xc2\xa7 404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, arising from respondent\'s failure to afford petitioner the boarding priority specified in its rules filed with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).  The District Court entered judgment and awarded compensatory and punitive damages on both claims.  The Court of Appeals remanded petitioner\'s statutory claim for further findings and reversed the award of punitive damages on that claim.  The question of punitive damages for the common law claim was remanded for further findings on respondent\'s good faith.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In this case, we address the question whether a common law tort action based on alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by an air carrier subject to regulation by the Civil Aeronautics Board (Board) must be stayed pending reference to the Board for determination whether the practice is "deceptive" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 411 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 769, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1381.  We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, a stay pending reference is inappropriate.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The facts are not contested.  Petitioner agreed to make several appearances in Connecticut on April 28, 1972, in support of the fund-raising efforts of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group (CCAG), a nonprofit public interest organization.  His two principal appearances were to be a a noon rally in Hartford and a later address at the Storrs campus of the University of Connecticut.  On April 25, petitioner reserved a seat on respondent\'s flight 864 for April 28.  The flight was scheduled to leave Washington, D.C. at 10:15 a.m. and to arrive in Hartford at 11:15 a.m.  Petitioner\'s ticket was purchased from a travel agency on the morning of the flight.  It indicated, by the standard "OK" notation, that the reservation was confirmed.</p>\n<p>Petitioner arrived at the boarding and check-in area approximately five minutes before the scheduled departure </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 426 U. S. 293</a></p><p> time.  He was informed that all seats on the flight were occupied, and that he, like several other passengers who had arrived shortly before him, could not be accommodated.  Explaining that he had to arrive in Hartford in time for the noon rally, petitioner asked respondent\'s agent to determine whether any standby passengers had been allowed to board by mistake, or whether anyone already on board would voluntarily give up his or her seat.  Both requests were refused.  In accordance with respondent\'s practice, petitioner was offered alternative transportation by air taxi to Philadelphia, where connections could be made with an Allegheny flight scheduled to arrive in Hartford at 12:15 p.m.  Fearing that the Philadelphia connection, which allowed only 10 minutes between planes, was too close, petitioner rejected this offer and elected to fly to Boston, where he was met by a CCAG staff member who drove him to Storrs.</p>\n<p>Both parties agree that petitioner\'s reservation was not honored because respondent had accepted more reservations for flight 864 than it could, in fact, accommodate.  One hour prior to the flight, 107 reservations had been confirmed for the 100 seats actually available.  Such overbooking is a common industry practice, designed to ensure that each flight leaves with as few empty seats as possible despite the large number of "no-shows" -- reservation-holding passengers who do not appear at flight time.  By the use of statistical studies of no-show patterns on specific flights, the airlines attempt to predict the appropriate number of reservations necessary to fill each flight.  In this way, they attempt to ensure the most efficient use of aircraft while preserving a flexible booking system that permits passengers to cancel and change reservations without notice or penalty.  At times, the practice of overbooking results </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 426 U. S. 294</a></p><p> in oversales, which occur when more reservation-holding passengers than can be accommodated actually appear to board the flight.  When this occurs, some passengers must be denied boarding ("bumped").  The chance that any particular passenger will be bumped is so negligible that few prospective passengers aware of the possibility would give it a second thought.  In April, 1972, the month in which petitioner\'s reservation was dishonored, 6.7 confirmed passengers per 10,000 enplanements were denied boarding on domestic flights. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  For all domestic airlines, oversales resulted in bumping an average of 5.4 passengers per 10,000 enplanements in 1972, and 4.6 per 10,000 enplanements in 1973. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In domestic operations, respondent oversold 6.3 seats per 10,000 enplanements in 1972 and 4.5 seats per 10,000 enplanements in 1973. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Thus, based on the 1972 experience of all domestic airlines, there was only slightly more than one chance in 2,000 that any particular passenger would be bumped on a given flight. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Nevertheless, the total number of confirmed ticket holders denied seats is quite substantial, numbering over 82,000 passengers in 1972 and about 76,000 in 1973. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Board regulations require each airline to establish priority rules for boarding passengers and to offer "denied boarding compensation" to bumped passengers.  These "liquidated damages" are equal to the value of the passenger\'s ticket with a \xc2\xa7 25 minimum and a \xc2\xa7 200 maximum.  14 CFR \xc2\xa7 250.5 (1975).  Passengers are free to reject the compensation offered in favor of a common </p><p><a class="page-number" name="295">Page 426 U. S. 295</a></p><p> law suit for damages suffered as a result of the bumping.  Petitioner refused the tender of denied boarding compensation (\xc2\xa7 32.41 in his case) and, with CCAG, filed this suit for compensatory and punitive damages.  His suit did not seek compensation for the bumping <em>per se,</em> but asserted two other bases of liability:  a common law action based on fraudulent misrepresentation arising from respondent\'s alleged failure to inform petitioner in advance of its deliberate overbooking practices, and a statutory action under \xc2\xa7 404(b) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1374(b), [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] arising from respondent\'s alleged failure to afford petitioner the boarding priority specified in its rules filed with the Board under 14 CFR \xc2\xa7 250.3 (1975).</p>\n<p>The District Court entered a judgment for petitioner on both claims, awarding him a total of $10 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages.  Judgment also was entered for CCAG on its misrepresentation claim, with an award of $51 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  167 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 512 F.2d 527 (1975).  A number of its rulings were not presented to this Court in the petition for certiorari.  The award of damages to CCAG was reversed on the ground that the organization was too "remote from the transaction" to fall "within the class of persons who may recover."  <em>Id.</em> at 372, 512 F.2d at 549.  The merits of petitioner\'s statutory claim were remanded for further </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 426 U. S. 296</a></p><p> findings.  The award of punitive damages to petitioner on the statutory claim was reversed on the ground that respondent\'s conduct contained no "elements of intentional wrongdoing or conscious disregard for" petitioner\'s rights.  <em>Id.</em> at 373, 512 F.2d at 550.  The question of punitive damages for the common law claim was remanded for further findings on respondent\'s good faith.  In particular, the trial court was to consider "whether Allegheny reasonably believed that its policies were completely lawful and in fact carried the approval of the Board."  <em>Id.</em> at 374, 512 F.2d at 551.  None of these rulings was presented to this Court in the petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>The only issue before us concerns the Court of Appeals\' disposition on the merits of petitioner\'s claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.  Although the court rejected respondent\'s argument that the existence of the Board\'s cease and desist power under \xc2\xa7 411 of the Act eliminates all private remedies for common law torts arising from unfair or deceptive practices by regulated carriers, it held that a determination by the Board that a practice is not deceptive within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 411 would, as a matter of law, preclude a common law tort action seeking damages for injuries caused by that practice. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Therefore, the court held that the Board must be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 426 U. S. 297</a></p><p> allowed to determine in the first instance whether the challenged practice (in this case, the alleged failure to disclose the practice of overbooking) falls within the ambit of \xc2\xa7 411.  The court took judicial notice that a rulemaking proceeding concerning possible changes in reservation practices in response to the 1973-1974 fuel crisis was already underway, and that a challenge to the carriers\' overbooking practices had been raised by an intervenor in that proceeding. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The District Court was instructed to stay further action on petitioner\'s misrepresentation claim pending the outcome of the rulemaking proceeding.  The Court of Appeals characterized its holding as</p>\n<p>"but another application of the principles of primary jurisdiction, a doctrine whose purpose is the coordination of the workings of agency and court."</p>\n<p>167 U.S.App.D.C. at 367, 512 F.2d at 544. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 426 U. S. 298</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The question before us, then, is whether the Board must be given an opportunity to determine whether respondent\'s alleged failure to disclose its practice of deliberate overbooking is a deceptive practice under \xc2\xa7 411 before petitioner\'s common law action is allowed to proceed.  The decision of the Court of Appeals requires the District Court to stay the action brought by petitioner in order to give the Board an opportunity to resolve the question.  If the Board were to find that there had been no violation of \xc2\xa7 411, respondent would be immunized from common law liability.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 1106 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1506, provides that</p>\n<p>"[n]othing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies."</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals found that, "although the saving clause of section 1106 purports to speak in absolute terms, it cannot be read so literally."  167 U.S.App.D.C. at 367, 512 F.2d at 544.  In reaching this conclusion, it relied on <em>Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/204/426/case.html">204 U. S. 426</a></span> (1907).  In that case, the Court, despite the existence of a saving clause virtually identical to \xc2\xa7 1106, refused to permit a state court common law action challenging a published carrier rate as "unjust and unreasonable."  The Court conceded that a common law right, even absent a saving clause, is not to be abrogated</p>\n<p>"unless it be found that the preexisting right is so repugnant to the statute that the survival of such right would, in effect, deprive the subsequent statute of its efficacy; in other words, render its provisions nugatory."</p>\n<p>204 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/204/426/case.html#437">204 U. S. 437</a></span>.  But the Court found that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 426 U. S. 299</a></p><p> the continuance of private damages actions attacking the reasonableness of rates subject to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission would destroy the purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act, which was to eliminate discrimination by requiring uniform rates.  The saving clause, the Court found,</p>\n<p>"cannot in reason be construed as continuing in shippers a common law right, the continued existence of which would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the act.  In other words, the act cannot be held to destroy itself."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/204/426/case.html#446">204 U. S. 446</a></span>. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, unlike <em>Abilene,</em> we are not faced with an irreconcilable conflict between the statutory scheme and the persistence of common law remedies.  In <em>Abilene,</em> the carrier, if subject to both agency and court sanctions, would be put in an untenable position when the agency and a court disagreed on the reasonableness of a rate.  The carrier could not abide by the rate filed with the Commission, as required by statute, and also comply with a court\'s determination that the rate was excessive.  The conflict between the court\'s common law authority and the agency\'s ratemaking power was direct and unambiguous.  The court in the present case, in contrast, is not called upon to substitute its judgment for the agency\'s on the reasonableness of a rate -- or, indeed, on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 426 U. S. 300</a></p><p> the reasonableness of any carrier practice.  There is no Board requirement that air carriers engage in overbooking, or that they fail to disclose that they do so.  And any impact on rates that may result from the imposition of tort liability or from practices adopted by a carrier to avoid such liability would be merely incidental.  Under the circumstances, the common law action and the statute are not "absolutely inconsistent," and may coexist, as contemplated by \xc2\xa7 1106.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 411 of the Act allows the Board, where "it considers that such action . . . would be in the interest of the public," "upon its own initiative or upon complaint by any air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent," to "investigate and determine whether any air carrier . . . has been or is engaged in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition. . . ."  Practices determined to be in violation of this section "shall" be the subject of a cease and desist order.  The Court of Appeals concluded -- and respondent does not challenge the conclusion here -- that this section does not totally preclude petitioner\'s common law tort action.  But the Court of Appeals also held, relying on the nature of the airline industry as "a regulated system of limited competition," <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. North American Airlines, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/79/case.html">351 U. S. 79</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/79/case.html#84">351 U. S. 84</a></span> (1956), and the Board\'s duty to promote "adequate, economical, and efficient service," \xc2\xa7 102(c) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1302(c), "at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service," \xc2\xa7 1002(e)(2) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1482(e)(2), that the Board has the power in a \xc2\xa7 411 proceeding to approve practices that might otherwise be considered deceptive, and thus to immunize carriers from common law liability.  167 U.S.App.D.C. at 366, 512 F.2d at 543. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 426 U. S. 301</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We cannot agree.  No power to immunize can be derived from the language of \xc2\xa7 411.  And where Congress has sought to confer such power, it has done so expressly, as in \xc2\xa7 414 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1384, which relieves those affected by certain designated orders (not including orders issued under \xc2\xa7 411) "from the operations of the <em>antitrust laws.\'"  When faced with an exemptive provision similar to \xc2\xa7 414 in <em>United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/474/case.html">284 U. S. 474</a></span> (1932), this Court dismissed an antitrust action because initial consideration by the agency had not been sought.  The Court pointed out that the Act in question was "restrictive in its operation upon some of the activities of common carriers . . . and permissive in respect of others."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/474/case.html#485">284 U.

Section 411, in contrast, is purely restrictive.  It contemplates the elimination of "unfair or deceptive practices" that impair the public interest.  Its role has been described in <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. North American Airlines, Inc., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/79/case.html#85">351 U. S. 85</a></span>:\n</em></p>\n<p>"\'Unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition,\' as used in \xc2\xa7 411, are broader concepts than the common law idea of unfair competition. . . .  The section is concerned not with punishment of wrongdoing or protection of injured competitors, but rather with protection of the public interest."</p>\n<p>As such, \xc2\xa7 411 provides an injunctive remedy for vindication of the public interest to supplement the compensatory common law remedies for private parties preserved by \xc2\xa7 1106. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 426 U. S. 302</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus, a violation of \xc2\xa7 411, contrary to the Court of Appeals\' conclusion, is not coextensive with a breach of duty under the common law.  We note that the Board\'s jurisdiction to initiate an investigation under \xc2\xa7 411 is expressly premised on a finding that the "public interest" is involved.  The Board "may not employ its powers to vindicate private rights."  351 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/79/case.html#83">351 U. S. 83</a></span>.  Indeed, individual consumers are not even entitled to initiate proceedings under \xc2\xa7 411, a circumstance that indicates that Congress did not intend to require private litigants to obtain a \xc2\xa7 411 determination before they could proceed with the common law remedies preserved by \xc2\xa7 1106,  <em>Cf. Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#406">397 U. S. 406</a></span> (1970).</p>\n<p>Section 411 is both broader and narrower than the remedies available at common law.  A cease and desist order may issue under \xc2\xa7 411 merely on the Board\'s conclusion, after an investigation determined to be in the public interest, that a carrier is engaged in an "unfair or deceptive practice."  No findings that the practice was intentionally deceptive or fraudulent, or that it, in fact, has caused injury to an individual, are necessary.  <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. North American Airlines, Inc., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/79/case.html#86">351 U. S. 86</a></span>.  On the other hand, a Board decision that a cease and desist order is inappropriate does not represent approval of the practice under investigation.  It may merely represent the Board\'s conclusion that the serious prohibitory sanction of a cease and desist order is inappropriate, that a more flexible approach is necessary.  A wrong may be of the sort that calls for compensation to an injured individual without requiring the extreme remedy of a cease and desist order.  Indeed, the Board, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 426 U. S. 303</a></p><p> in dealing with the problem of overbooking by air carriers, has declined to issue cease and desist orders despite the determination by an examiner in one case that a \xc2\xa7 411 violation had occurred. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Instead, the Board has elected to establish boarding priorities and to ensure that passengers will be compensated for being bumped either by a liquidated sum under Board regulations or by resort to a suit for compensatory damages at common law. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, \xc2\xa7 411 confers upon the Board a new and powerful weapon against unfair and deceptive practices that injure the public.  But it does not represent the only, or best, response to all challenged carrier actions that result in private wrongs.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The doctrine of primary jurisdiction</p>\n<p>"is concerned with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

Even when common law rights and remedies survive and the agency in question lacks the power to confer immunity from common law liability, it may be appropriate to refer specific issues to an agency for initial determination where that procedure would secure "[u]niformity and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 426 U.

In this case, however, considerations of uniformity in regulation and of technical expertise do not call for prior reference to the Board.</p>\n<p>Petitioner seeks damages for respondent\'s failure to disclose its overbooking practices.  He makes no challenge to any provision in the tariff, and indeed there is no tariff provision or Board regulation applicable to disclosure practices. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Petitioner also makes no challenge, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 426 U.

Western Pacific R. Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/59/case.html#64">352 U. S. 64</a></span>, of the Board.  The action brought by petitioner does not turn on a determination of the reasonableness of a challenged practice -- a determination that could be facilitated by an informed evaluation of the economics or technology of the regulated industry.  The standards to be applied in an action for fraudulent misrepresentation are within the conventional competence of the courts, and the judgment of a technically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 426 U. S. 306</a></p><p> expert body is not likely to be helpful in the application of these standards to the facts of this case. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>We are particularly aware that, even where the wrong sought to be redressed is not misrepresentation, but bumping itself, which has been the subject of Board consideration and for which compensation is provided in carrier tariffs, the Board has contemplated that there may be individual adjudications by courts in common law suits brought at the option of the passenger.  The present regulations dealing with the problems of overbooking and oversales were promulgated by the Board in 1967.  They provide for denied boarding compensation to bumped passengers, and require each carrier to establish priority rules for seating passengers and to file reports of passengers who could not be accommodated. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The order instituting these regulations contemplates that the bumped passenger will have a choice between accepting denied boarding compensation as</p>\n<p>"liquidated damages for all damages incurred . . . as a result of the carrier\'s failure to provide the passenger with confirmed reserved space,"</p>\n<p>or pursuing his or her common law remedies. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The Board specifically provided </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 426 U. S. 307</a></p><p> for a 30-day period before the specified compensation need be accepted so that the passenger will not be forced to make a decision before "the consequences of denied boarding have occurred and are known."

The Court of Appeals did not address the question </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 426 U. S. 308</a></p><p> whether petitioner had introduced sufficient evidence to sustain his claim.  We remand the case for consideration of that question, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

JUSTICE WHITE, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion with these additional words.</p>\n<p>It may be that, under its rulemaking authority, the Board would have power to order airline overbooking and to preempt recoveries under state law for undisclosed overbooking or for overselling.  But it has not done so, at least as yet.  It is also unnecessary to stay proceedings on the present state law claim pending Board action under \xc2\xa7 411.  Neither an order denying nor one granting relief under that section would foreclose claims based on state law; and there is not present here the additional consideration that a \xc2\xa7 411 proceeding would be helpful in resolving, or affecting in some manner, the state law claim for compensatory and punitive damages.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/113/case.html">414 U.

Petitioner suggests, for example, that carrier overbooking practices be included in tariffs, which are required to be available for public inspection.
