The defendants, the insured and the beneficiary, denied the responsibility of the insured for any misrepresentations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="262">Page 304 U. S. 262</a></p><p> by reason of his mental incapacity at the time.  They also filed a cross-bill seeking the payment of the monthly disability benefits for which the policy provided.  Decree was rendered in favor of defendants on their cross-bill.  The decree declared void the reinstatement of the policy, but held it to be in full force from the date of its issue.  The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.  94 F.2d 288.</p>\n<p>The stipulation of facts stated that the insured, at the time of the issue of the policy in 1927, was a resident of Missouri, and that the policy was delivered to the insured in that State.  Findings of the District Court followed the stipulation.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals considered the question whether, under the provisions of the policy, the insurer was liable for disability benefits to the insured who became totally and permanently disabled during the period of grace following the date on which a semiannual premium payment fell due where the premium was not paid until after the expiration of the period of grace.  The court considered the question as one of general law.  Its decision should have been made according to the applicable principles of the state law which governed the interpretation of the policy.  <em>Erie Railroad Company v.
