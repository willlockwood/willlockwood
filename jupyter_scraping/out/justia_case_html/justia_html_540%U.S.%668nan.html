DRETKE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">BANKS <em>v.</em> DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL \nINSTITUTIONS DIVISION</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 02\xe2\x80\x938286. Argued December 8, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 24, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">After police found a gun-shot corpse near Texarkana, Texas, Deputy Sheriff Willie Huff learned that the decedent had been seen with petitioner Banks three days earlier.  When a paid informant told Deputy Huff that Banks was driving to Dallas to fetch a weapon, Deputy Huff followed Banks to a residence there.  On the return trip, police stopped Banks\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle, found a handgun, and arrested the car\xe2\x80\x99s occupants.  Returning to the Dallas residence, Deputy Huff encountered Charles Cook and recovered a second gun, which Cook said Banks had left at the residence several days earlier.  On testing, the second gun proved to be the murder weapon.  Prior to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the State advised defense counsel that, without necessity of motions,  the State would provide Banks with all discovery to which he was entitled.  Nevertheless, the State withheld evidence that would have allowed Banks to discredit two essential prosecution witnesses.  At the trial\xe2\x80\x99s guilt phase, Cook testified, <em>inter alia</em>, that Banks admitted \xe2\x80\x9ckill[ing a] white boy.\xe2\x80\x9d  On cross-examination, Cook thrice denied talking to anyone about his testimony.  In fact, Deputy Huff and prosecutors intensively coached Cook about his testimony during at least one pretrial session.  The prosecution allowed Cook\xe2\x80\x99s misstatements to stand uncorrected.  After Banks\xe2\x80\x99s capital murder conviction, the penalty-phase jury found that Banks would probably commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  One of the State\xe2\x80\x99s two penalty-phase witnesses, Robert Farr, testified that Banks had retrieved a gun from Dallas in order to commit robberies.  According to Farr, Banks had said he would \xe2\x80\x9ctake care of it\xe2\x80\x9d if trouble arose during those crimes.  Two defense witnesses impeached Farr, but were, in turn, impeached.  Banks testified, among other things, that, although he had traveled to Dallas to obtain a gun, he had no intent to participate in the robberies, which Farr<em> </em>alone planned to commit.  In summation, the prosecution suggested that Banks had not traveled to Dallas only to supply Farr with a weapon.  Stressing Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Banks said he would \xe2\x80\x9ctake care\xe2\x80\x9d of trouble arising during the robberies, the prosecution urged the jury to find Farr credible.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s admission that he used narcotics, the prosecution suggested, indicated that he had been open and honest in every way.  The State did not disclose that Farr was the paid informant who told Deputy Huff about the Dallas trip.  The judge sentenced Banks to death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Through Banks\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal, the State continued to hold secret Farr\xe2\x80\x99s and Cook\xe2\x80\x99s links to the police.  In a 1992 state-court postconviction motion, Banks alleged for the first time that the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence that would have revealed Farr as a police informant and Banks\xe2\x80\x99s arrest as a \xe2\x80\x9cset-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Banks also alleged that during the trial\xe2\x80\x99s guilt phase, the State deliberately withheld information of a deal prosecutors made with Cook, which would have been critical to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of Cook\xe2\x80\x99s credibility.  Banks asserted that the State\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a>, 87, which held that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s suppression of evidence requested by and favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment, irrespective of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s good or bad faith.  The State denied Banks\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, and the state postconviction court rejected his claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1996, Banks filed the instant federal habeas petition, alleging, as relevant, that the State had withheld material exculpatory evidence revealing Farr to be a police informant and Banks\xe2\x80\x99 arrest as a \xe2\x80\x9cset-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Banks further alleged that the State had concealed Cook\xe2\x80\x99s incentive to testify in a manner favorable to the prosecution.  Banks attached affidavits from Farr and Cook to a February 1999 motion seeking discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s declaration stated that he had agreed to help Deputy Huff with the murder investigation out of fear Huff would arrest him on drug charges; that Huff had paid him $200; and that Farr had \xe2\x80\x9cset [Banks] up\xe2\x80\x9d by convincing him to drive to Dallas to retrieve Banks\xe2\x80\x99s gun.  Cook recalled that he had participated in practice sessions before the Banks trial at which prosecutors told him he must either testify as they wanted or spend the rest of his life in prison.  In response to the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure order in the federal habeas proceeding, the prosecution gave Banks a transcript of a September 1980 pretrial interrogation of Cook by police and prosecutors.  This transcript provided compelling evidence that Cook\xe2\x80\x99s testimony had been tutored, but did not bear on whether Cook had a deal with the prosecution.  At the federal evidentiary hearing Huff acknowledged, for the first time, that Farr was an informant paid for his involvement in Banks\xe2\x80\x99s case.  A Banks trial prosecutor testified, however, that no deal had been offered to gain Cook\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  The Magistrate Judge recommended a writ of habeas corpus with respect to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence based on, <em>inter alia</em>, the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status.  The judge did not recommend disturbing the guilt-phase verdict, concluding in this regard that Banks had not properly pleaded a <em>Brady</em> claim based on the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript.  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and rejected Banks\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Cook transcript claim be treated as if raised in the pleadings, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit reversed to the extent the District Court had granted relief on Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.  The Court of Appeals recognized that, prior to federal habeas proceedings, the prosecution had suppressed Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status and his part in the Dallas trip.  The Fifth Circuit nonetheless concluded that Banks did not act diligently to develop the facts underpinning his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim when he pursued his 1992 state-court postconviction application.  That lack of diligence, the Court of Appeals held, rendered the evidence uncovered in the federal habeas proceeding procedurally barred.  In any event, the Fifth Circuit ruled, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s status as an informant was not \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d for <em>Brady</em> purposes.  That was so, in the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, because Banks had impeached Farr at trial by bringing out that he had been an unreliable police informant in Arkansas, and because much of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses, including Banks himself, who had acknowledged his willingness to get a gun for Farr\xe2\x80\x99s use in robberies.  The Fifth Circuit also denied a certificate of appealability on Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Cook <em>Brady</em> claim.  In accord with the District Court, the Court of Appeals rejected Banks\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that, because his Cook <em>Brady </em>claim had been aired by implied consent, Rule 15(b) required it to be treated as if raised in the pleadings.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit erred in dismissing Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Farr <em>Brady</em> claim and denying him a certificate of appealability on his Cook <em>Brady</em> claim.  When police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching material in the State\xe2\x80\x99s possession, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Both of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claims arose under the regime in place prior to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  P.\xc2\xa017.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Farr <em>Brady</em> claim, as it trains on his death sentence, is not barred.  All three elements of a <em>Brady</em> claim are satisfied as to the suppression of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status and its bearing on the reliability of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict regarding punishment.  Because Banks has also demonstrated cause and prejudice, he is not precluded from gaining federal habeas relief by his failure to produce evidence in anterior state-court proceedings.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Pre-AEDPA habeas law required Banks to exhaust available state-court remedies in order to pursue federal-court relief.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a>.  Banks satisfied this requirement by alleging in his 1992 state-court habeas application that the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence about Farr.  Banks, however, failed to produce evidence in state postconviction court establishing that Farr had served as Deputy Sheriff Huff\xe2\x80\x99s informant.  In the federal habeas forum, Banks must show that he was not thereby barred from producing evidence to substantiate his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.  Banks would be entitled to a federal-court evidentiary hearing if he could show both cause for his failure to develop facts in state court, and actual prejudice resulting from that failure.  <em>Keeney</em> v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/index.html">504 U. S. 1</a>, 11.  A <em>Brady</em> prosecutorial misconduct claim has three essential elements.  <em>Strickler</em> v. <em>Greene, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/263/index.html">527 U. S. 263</a>, 281\xe2\x80\x93282.  Beyond debate, the first such element\xe2\x80\x94that the evidence at issue be favorable to the accused as exculpatory or impeaching\xe2\x80\x94is satisfied here.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s paid informant status plainly qualifies as evidence advantageous to Banks.  Cause and prejudice in this case parallel the second and third of the three <em>Brady</em> components.  Corresponding to the second <em>Brady</em> element\xe2\x80\x94that the State suppressed the evidence at issue\xe2\x80\x94a petitioner shows cause when the reason for the failure to develop facts in state-court proceedings was the State\xe2\x80\x99s suppression of the relevant evidence.  Coincident with the third <em>Brady</em> component\xe2\x80\x94that prejudice ensued\xe2\x80\x94prejudice within the compass of the \xe2\x80\x9ccause and prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d requirement exists when suppressed evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d for <em>Brady</em> purposes.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, if Banks succeeds in demonstrating cause and prejudice, he will also succeed in establishing the essential elements of his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Banks has shown cause for failing to present evidence in state court capable of substantiating his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.  As <em>Strickler</em> instructs, 527 U. S., at 289, three inquiries underlie the \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d determination: (1) whether the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (2) whether the petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s open file policy as fulfilling the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s duty to disclose such evidence; and (3) whether the State confirmed the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on that policy by asserting during the state habeas proceedings that the petitioner had already received everything known to the government.  This case is congruent with <em>Strickler</em> in all three respects.  First, the State knew of, but kept back, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s arrangement with Deputy Huff.  Cf. <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a>, 437.  Second, the State asserted, on the eve of trial, that it would disclose all <em>Brady</em> material.  Banks cannot be faulted for relying on that representation.  See <em>Strickler,</em> 527 U. S., at 283\xe2\x80\x93284.  Third, in its answer to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s 1992 state habeas application, the State denied Banks\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that Farr was a police informant and Banks\xe2\x80\x99s arrest a \xe2\x80\x9cset-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  The State thereby confirmed Banks\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s representation that it had disclosed all <em>Brady</em> material.  In this regard, Banks\xe2\x80\x99s case is stronger than was the <em>Strickler </em>petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s:\xc2\xa0Each time Farr misrepresented his dealings with police, the prosecution allowed that testimony to stand uncorrected.  Cf. <em>Giglio</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html">405 U. S. 150</a>, 153.  Banks appropriately assumed police would not engage in improper litigation conduct to obtain a conviction.  None of the State\xe2\x80\x99s arguments for distinguishing <em>Strickler</em> on the \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d issue accounts adequately for the State\xe2\x80\x99s concealment and misrepresentation of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s link to Huff.  In light of those misrepresentations, Banks did not lack appropriate diligence in pursuing the Farr <em>Brady</em> claim in state court.  Nor is Banks at fault for failing to move, in the 1992 state-court postconviction proceedings, for investigative assistance so that he could inquire into Farr\xe2\x80\x99s police connections, for state law entitled him to no such aid.  Further, <em>Roviaro</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/53/index.html">353 U. S. 53</a>, which concerned the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to reveal the identity of an informant it does not call as a witness, does not support the State\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s suppression of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status is \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d for <em>Brady</em> purposes.  The materiality standard for <em>Brady</em> claims is met when \xe2\x80\x9cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kyles, </em>514 U. S., at 435.  Farr was paid for a critical role in the scenario that led to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s indictment.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s declaration, presented to the federal habeas court, asserts that Farr, not Banks, initiated the proposal to obtain a gun to facilitate robberies.  Had Farr not instigated, upon Deputy Huff\xe2\x80\x99s request, the Dallas excursion to fetch Banks\xe2\x80\x99s gun, the prosecution would have had slim, if any, evidence that Banks planned to continue committing violent acts.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s admission of his instigating role, moreover, would have dampened the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s zeal in urging the jury to consider Banks\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of a gun to commit robbery or his \xe2\x80\x9cplanned violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because Banks had no criminal record, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony about Banks\xe2\x80\x99s propensity to violence was crucial to the prosecution.  Without that testimony, the State could not have underscored to the jury that Banks would use the gun fetched in Dallas to \xe2\x80\x9ctake care\xe2\x80\x9d of trouble arising during robberies.  The stress placed by the prosecution on this part of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, uncorroborated by any other witness, belies the State\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was adequately corroborated.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase summation, moreover, left no doubt about the importance the State attached to Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  In contrast to <em>Strickler</em>, where the Court found \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d 527 U. S., at 289, but no \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 292\xe2\x80\x93296, the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice\xe2\x80\x9d in this case is marked.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony was the centerpiece of the Banks prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase case.  That testimony was cast in large doubt by the declaration Banks ultimately obtained from Farr and introduced in the federal habeas proceeding.  Had jurors known of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s continuing interest in obtaining Deputy Huff\xe2\x80\x99s favor and his receipt of funds to set Banks up, they might well have distrusted Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, and, insofar as it was uncorroborated, disregarded it.  The jury, moreover, did not benefit from customary, truth-promoting precautions that generally accompany informant testimony.  Such testimony poses serious credibility questions.  This Court, therefore, has long allowed defendants broad latitude to cross-examine informants and has counseled the use of careful instructions on submission of the credibility issue to the jury.  See, <em>e.g., On Lee</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/747/index.html">343 U. S. 747</a>, 757.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status was rendered cumulative by his impeachment at trial is contradicted by the record.  Neither witness called to impeach Farr gave evidence directly relevant to Farr\xe2\x80\x99s part in Banks\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  The impeaching witnesses, moreover, were themselves impeached, as the prosecution stressed on summation.  Further, the prosecution turned to its advantage remaining impeachment evidence by suggesting that Farr\xe2\x80\x99s admission of drug use demonstrated his openness and honesty.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The lower courts wrongly denied Banks a certificate of appealability with regard to his <em>Brady</em> claim resting on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s suppression of the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript.  The Court of Appeals rejected Banks\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Rule 15(b) required the claim to be treated as having been raised in the pleadings because the transcript substantiating the claim had been aired at an evidentiary hearing before the Magistrate Judge.  The Fifth Circuit apparently relied on the debatable view that Rule 15(b) is inapplicable in habeas proceedings.  This Court has twice assumed that Rule\xe2\x80\x99s application in such proceedings.  <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Nelson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/286/index.html">394 U. S. 286</a>, 294, n.\xc2\xa05; <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/index.html">507 U. S. 680</a>, 696, and n.\xc2\xa07.  The <em>Withrow</em> District Court had granted habeas on a claim neither pleaded, considered at \xe2\x80\x9can evidentiary hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9ceven argu[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by the parties.  <em>Id.</em>, at 695.  This Court held that there had been no trial of the claim by implied consent; and manifestly, the respondent warden was prejudiced by the lack of opportunity to present evidence bearing on the claim\xe2\x80\x99s resolution.  <em>Id.,</em> at 696.  Here, in contrast, the issue of the undisclosed Cook interrogation transcript was aired at a hearing before the Magistrate Judge, and the transcript was admitted into evidence without objection.  The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view that an evidentiary hearing should not be aligned with a trial for Rule 15(b) purposes is not well grounded.  Nor does this Court agree with the Court of Appeals that applying Rule 15(b) in habeas proceedings would undermine the State\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion and procedural default defenses.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under pre-AEDPA law, no inconsistency arose between Rule 15(b) and those defenses.  Doubtless, that is why this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-AEDPA cases assumed Rule 15(b)\xe2\x80\x99s application in habeas proceedings.  See<em>, e.g., ibid.</em>  While AEDPA forbids a finding that exhaustion has been waived absent an express waiver by the State, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(3), pre-AEDPA law allowed waiver of both defenses\xe2\x80\x94exhaustion and procedural default\xe2\x80\x94based on the State\xe2\x80\x99s litigation conduct, see, <em>e.g., Gray</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/152/index.html">518 U. S. 152</a>, 166.  To obtain a certificate of appealability, a prisoner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could disagree with the district court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of his constitutional claims or that the issues presented warrant encouragement to proceed further.  <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/322/index.html">537 U. S. 322</a>, 327.  This case fits that description as to the application of Rule 15(b).  Pp.\xc2\xa031\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p align="left">48 Fed.

Prior to trial, the State advised Banks\xe2\x80\x99s attorney there would be no need to litigate discovery issues, representing: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e will, without the necessity of motions[,] provide you with all discovery to which you are entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 361, n. 1; App. to Pet. for Cert. A4 (both sources\xe2\x80\x99 internal quotation marks omitted).  Despite that undertaking, the State withheld evidence that would have allowed Banks to discredit two essential prosecution witnesses.  The State did not disclose that one of those witnesses was a paid police informant, nor did it disclose a pretrial transcript revealing that the other witness\xe2\x80\x99 trial testimony had been intensively coached by prosecutors and law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the prosecution raised no red flag when the informant testified, untruthfully, that he never gave the police any statement and, indeed, had not talked to any police officer about the case until a few days before the trial.  Instead of correcting the informant\xe2\x80\x99s false statements, the prosecutor told the jury that the witness \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] been open and honest with you in every way,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 140, and that his testimony was of the \xe2\x80\x9cutmost significance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 146.  Similarly, the prosecution allowed the other key witness to convey, untruthfully, that his testimony was entirely unrehearsed.  Through direct appeal and state collateral review proceedings, the State continued to hold secret the key witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 links to the police and allowed their false statements to stand uncorrected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, through discovery and an evidentiary hearing authorized in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the long-suppressed evidence came to light.  The District Court granted Banks relief from the death penalty, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  In the latter court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, Banks had documented his claims of prosecutorial misconduct too late and in the wrong forum; therefore he did not qualify for federal-court relief.  We reverse that judgment.  When police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching material in the State\xe2\x80\x99s possession, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 14, 1980, police found the corpse of 16-year-old Richard Whitehead in Pocket Park, east of Nash, Texas, a town in the vicinity of Texarkana.  <em>Id.</em>, at 8, 141.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A preliminary autopsy revealed that Whitehead had been shot three times.  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.

Several weeks later, in a July 7, 1980, letter, the prosecution advised Banks\xe2\x80\x99s counsel that \xe2\x80\x9c[the State] will, without necessity of motions provide you with all discovery to which you are entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 361, n.\xc2\xa01; App. to Pet. for Cert.

See Brief for Petitioner 2; App. to Pet. for Cert. C3.  Witnesses testified to seeing Banks and Whitehead together on April 11 in Whitehead\xe2\x80\x99s green Mustang, and to hearing gunshots in Pocket Park at \n4 a.m. on April 12.  <em>Banks</em> v. <em>State</em>, 643 S. W. 2d, at 131.  Charles Cook testified that Banks arrived in Dallas in a green Mustang at about 8:15 a.m. on April 12, and stayed with Cook until April 14.  App. 42\xe2\x80\x9343, 47\xe2\x80\x9353.  Cook gave the following account of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s visit.  On the morning of his arrival, Banks had blood on his leg and told Cook \xe2\x80\x9che [had] got into it on the highway with a white boy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 44.  That night, Banks confessed to having \xe2\x80\x9ckill[ed] the white boy for the hell of it and take[n] his car and come to Dallas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 48.  During their ensuing conversation, Cook first noticed that \xe2\x80\x9c[Banks] had a pistol.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49.  Two days later, Banks left Dallas by bus.  <em>Id.</em>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  The next day, Cook abandoned the Mustang in West Dallas and sold Banks\xe2\x80\x99s gun to a neighbor.  <em>Id.</em>, at 54.  Cook further testified that, shortly before the police arrived at his residence to question him, Banks had revisited him and requested the gun.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On cross-examination, Cook three times represented that he had not talked to anyone about his testimony.  <em>Id.</em>, at 59.  In fact, however, Cook had at least one \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial practice sessio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d at which Huff and prosecutors intensively coached Cook for his appearance on the stand at Banks\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  <em>Id.</em>, at 325, \xc2\xb6  ;10, 381\xe2\x80\x93390; Joint Lodging Material 1\xe2\x80\x9336 (transcript of pretrial preparatory session).  The prosecution allowed Cook\xe2\x80\x99s misstatements to stand uncorrected.  In its guilt-phase summation, the prosecution told the jury \xe2\x80\x9cCook brought you absolute truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 84.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to Cook, Robert Farr was a key witness for the prosecution.  Corroborating parts of Cook\xe2\x80\x99s account, Farr testified to traveling to Dallas with Banks to retrieve Banks\xe2\x80\x99s gun.  <em>Id.</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Farr whether he had \xe2\x80\x9cever taken any money from some police officers,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgive[n] any police officers a statement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  Farr answered no to both questions; he asserted emphatically that police officers had not promised him anything and that he had \xe2\x80\x9ctalked to no one about this [case]\xe2\x80\x9d until a few days before trial.  <em>Ibid.</em>  These answers were untrue, but the State did not correct them.  Farr was the paid informant who told Deputy Sheriff Huff that Banks would travel to Dallas in search of a gun.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329; App. to Pet. for Cert. A4, A9.  In a 1999 affidavit, Farr explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI assumed that if I did not help [Huff] with his investigation of Delma that he would have me arrested for drug charges.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why I agreed to help [Huff].\nI was afraid that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t help him, I would be\narrested\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillie Huff asked me to help him find Delma\xe2\x80\x99s gun.  I told [Huff] that he would have to pay me money right away for my help on the case.  I think altogether he gave me about $200.00 for helping him.  He paid me some of the money before I set Delma up.  He paid me the rest after Delma was arrested and charged with murder\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to help Willie Huff, I had to set Delma up.  I told Delma that I wanted to rob a pharmacy to get drugs and that I needed his gun to do it.  I did not really plan to commit a robbery but I told Delma this so that he would give me his gun\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. I convinced Delma to drive to Dallas with me to get the gun.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 442\xe2\x80\x93443, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;6\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defense presented no evidence.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A6.  Banks was convicted of murder committed in the course of a robbery, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa719.03(a)(2) (1974).  See App. to Pet. for Cert. C3.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The penalty phase ran its course the next day.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Governed by the Texas statutory capital murder scheme applicable in 1980, the jury decided Banks\xe2\x80\x99s sentence by answering three \xe2\x80\x9cspecial issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 142\xe2\x80\x93143.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the jury unanimously answer[ed] \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 to each issue submitted, the trial court [would be obliged to] sentence the defendant to death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U.

The critical question at the penalty phase in Banks\xe2\x80\x99s case was: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant, Delma Banks, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this question, the State offered two witnesses, Vetrano Jefferson and Robert Farr.  <em>Id.</em>, at 104\xe2\x80\x93113.  Jefferson testified that, in early April 1980, Banks had struck him across the face with a gun and threatened to kill him.  <em>Id.</em>, at 104\xe2\x80\x93106.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony focused once more on the trip to Dallas to fetch Banks\xe2\x80\x99s gun.  The gun was needed, Farr asserted, because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e [Farr and Banks] were going to pull some robberies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 108.  According to Farr, Banks \xe2\x80\x9csaid he would take care of it\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cthere was any trouble during these burglaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 109.  When the prosecution asked: \xe2\x80\x9cHow did [Banks] say he would take care of it?\xe2\x80\x9d, Farr responded: \xe2\x80\x9c[Banks] didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into any specifics, but he said it would be taken care of.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On cross-examination, defense counsel twice asked whether Farr had told Deputy Sheriff Huff of the Dallas trip.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The State remained silent as Farr twice perjuriously testified: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Banks\xe2\x80\x99s counsel also inquired whether Farr had previously attempted to obtain prescription drugs by fraud, and, \xe2\x80\x9cup tight over that,\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9ctestify to anything anybody want[ed] to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 110.  Farr first responded: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Instructed by the court to answer defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s questions, Farr again said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two defense witnesses impeached Farr, but were, in turn, impeached themselves.  James Kelley testified to Farr\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to obtain drugs by fraud; the prosecution impeached Kelley by eliciting his close relationship to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend.  <em>Id.</em>, at 124\xe2\x80\x93129.  Later, Kelley admitted to being drunk while on the stand.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A13.  Former Arkansas police officer Gary Owen testified that Farr, as a police informant in Arkansas, had given false information; the prosecution impeached Owen by bringing out his pending application for employment by defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s private investigator.  App. 129\xe2\x80\x93131.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Banks\xe2\x80\x99s parents and acquaintances testified that Banks was a \xe2\x80\x9crespectful, churchgoing young man.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. A7; App. 137\xe2\x80\x93139.  Thereafter, Banks took the stand.  He affirmed that he \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ad never before been convicted of a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 134.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Banks admitted striking Vetrano Jefferson in April 1980, and traveling to Dallas to obtain a gun in late April 1980.  <em>Id.</em>, at 134\xe2\x80\x93136.  He denied, however, any intent to participate in robberies, asserting that Farr alone had planned to commit them.  <em>Id.</em>, at 136\xe2\x80\x93137.  The prosecution suggested on cross-examination that Banks had been willing \xe2\x80\x9cto supply [Farr] the means and possible death weapon in an armed robbery case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 137.  Banks conceded as much.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During summation, the prosecution intimated that Banks had not been wholly truthful in this regard, suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9ca man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t travel two hundred miles, or whatever the distance is from here [Texarkana] to Dallas, Texas, to supply a person with a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 143.  The State homed in on Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Banks said he would \xe2\x80\x9ctake care\xe2\x80\x9d of any trouble arising during the robbery:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Farr] said, \xe2\x80\x98Man, you know, what i[f] there\xe2\x80\x99s trouble?\xe2\x80\x99  And [Banks] says, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of it.\xe2\x80\x99  I think that speaks for itself, and I think you know what that means\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. I submit to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has again met its burden of proof, and that the answer to question number two [propensity to commit violent criminal acts] should also be yes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 140, 144.

Just as Farr had been truthful about his drug use, the prosecution suggested, he was also \xe2\x80\x9copen and honest with [the jury] in every way\xe2\x80\x9d in his penalty-phase testimony.  <em>Id.</em>, at 140.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, the prosecution emphasized, was \xe2\x80\x9cof the utmost significance\xe2\x80\x9d because it showed \xe2\x80\x9c[Banks] is a danger to friends and strangers, alike.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 146.  Banks\xe2\x80\x99s effort to impeach Farr was ineffective, the prosecution further urged, because defense witness \xe2\x80\x9cKelley kn[ew] nothing about the murder,\xe2\x80\x9d and defense witness Owen \xe2\x80\x9cwish[ed] to please his future employers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 148.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury answered yes to the three special issues, and the judge sentenced Banks to death.

In support of this third state-court postconviction plea, Banks attached an unsigned affidavit from his girlfriend, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s sister-in-law Demetra Jefferson, which stated that Farr \xe2\x80\x9cwas well-connected to law enforcement people,\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently managed to stay out of \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble\xe2\x80\x9d for illegally obtaining prescription drugs.  <em>Id.</em>, at 195, \xc2\xb6  ;7.  Banks alleged as well that during the guilt phase of his trial, the State deliberately withheld information \xe2\x80\x9ccritical to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of Cook\xe2\x80\x99s credibility,\xe2\x80\x9d including the \xe2\x80\x9cgenerous \xe2\x80\x98deal\xe2\x80\x99 [Cook had] cut with the prosecutors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 152, \xc2\xb6  ;2, 180, \xc2\xb6  ;114.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s reply to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s pleading, filed October 6, 1992, \xe2\x80\x9cdenie[d] each and every allegation of fact made by [Banks] except those supported by official court records and those specifically admitted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 234; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing was kept secret from the defense,\xe2\x80\x9d the State represented.

App. 330\xe2\x80\x93331, 444; Pet. for Cert. 27, n.\xc2\xa012.  Cook recalled that in preparation for his Banks trial testimony, he had participated in \xe2\x80\x9cthree or four \xe2\x80\xa6 practice sessions\xe2\x80\x9d at which prosecutors told him to testify \xe2\x80\x9cas they wanted [him] to, and that [he] would spend the rest of [his] life in prison if [he] did not.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 325, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 4, 1999, the Magistrate Judge issued an order establishing issues for an evidentiary hearing, <em>id.</em>, at 340, 346, at which she would consider Banks\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the State had withheld \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial exculpatory and impeaching evidence\xe2\x80\x9d concerning \xe2\x80\x9ctwo of the [S]tate\xe2\x80\x99s essential witnesses, Charles Cook and Robert Farr.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 340, 345 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In anticipation of the hearing, the Magistrate Judge ordered disclosure of the Bowie County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s files.  Brief for Petitioner 37\xe2\x80\x9338; Tr. of June 7\xe2\x80\x938, 1999, Federal Evidentiary Hearing (ED Tex.), p.\xc2\xa030 (hereinafter Federal Evidentiary Hearing).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One item lodged in the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s files, turned over to Banks pursuant to the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure order, was a 74-page transcript of a Cook interrogation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A10.  The interrogation, conducted by Bowie County law enforcement officials and prosecutors, occurred in September 1980, shortly before the Banks trial.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The transcript revealed that the State\xe2\x80\x99s representatives had closely rehearsed Cook\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  In particular, the officials told Cook how to reconcile his testimony with affidavits to which he had earlier subscribed recounting Banks\xe2\x80\x99s visits to Dallas.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Joint Lodging Material 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cYour [April 1980] statement is obviously screwed up.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 26 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he way this statement should read is that \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 32 (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]et me tell you how this is going to work.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not in your [earlier] statement.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although the transcript did not bear on Banks\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the prosecution had a deal with Cook, it provided compelling evidence that Cook\xe2\x80\x99s testimony had been tutored by Banks\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutors.  Without objection at the hearing, the Magistrate Judge admitted the September 1980 transcript into evidence.  Brief for Petitioner 39; Federal Evidentiary Hearing 75\xe2\x80\x9376.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Testifying at the evidentiary hearing, Deputy Sheriff Huff acknowledged, for the first time, that Farr was an informant and that he had been paid $200 for his involvement in the case.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C43.  As to Cook, a Banks trial prosecutor testified, in line with the State\xe2\x80\x99s consistent position, that no deal had been offered to gain Cook\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony.  <em>Id.</em>, at C45; Federal Evidentiary Hearing 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  Defense counsel questioned the prosecutor about the September 1980 transcript, calling attention to discrepancies between the transcript and Cook\xe2\x80\x99s statements at trial.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65\xe2\x80\x9368.  In a posthearing brief and again in proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, Banks emphasized the suppression of the September 1980 transcript, noting the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to disclose material, exculpatory evidence, and the assurance in this case that Banks would receive \xe2\x80\x9call [the] discovery to which [Banks was] entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.\xc2\xa0360\xe2\x80\x93361, and n.\xc2\xa01, 378\xe2\x80\x93379 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>supra</em>, at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a May 11, 2000, report and recommendation, the Magistrate Judge recommended a writ of habeas corpus with respect to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence, but not his conviction.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C54.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status, coupled with trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s dismal performance during the punishment phase,\xe2\x80\x9d the Magistrate Judge concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cundermined the reliability of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict regarding punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at C44.  Finding no convincing evidence of a deal between the State and Cook, however, she recommended that the guilt-phase verdict remain undisturbed.  <em>Id.</em>, at C46.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Banks moved to alter or amend the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report on the ground that it left unresolved a fully aired question, <em>i.e.</em>, whether Banks\xe2\x80\x99s rights were violated by the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose to the defense the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s eve-of-trial interrogation of Cook.  App. 398.  That interrogation, Banks observed, could not be reconciled with Cook\xe2\x80\x99s insistence at trial that he had talked to no one about his testimony.  <em>Id.</em>, at 400, n.\xc2\xa017; see <em>supra</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and denied Banks\xe2\x80\x99s motion to amend the report.  App. to Pet. for Cert. B6; App. 421\xe2\x80\x93424.  Concerning the Cook <em>Brady</em> transcript-suppression claim, the District Court recognized that Banks had filed his federal petition in 1996, three years before he became aware of the September 1980 transcript.  App. 422\xe2\x80\x93423.  When the transcript surfaced in response to the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s 1999 disclosure order, Banks raised that newly discovered, long withheld document in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and, again, in his objections to the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report.  <em>Id.</em>, at 423.  The District Court concluded, however, that Banks had not properly pleaded a <em>Brady</em> claim predicated on the withheld Cook rehearsal transcript.  App. 422.  When that <em>Brady</em> claim came to light, the District Court reasoned, Banks should have moved to amend or supplement his 1996 federal habeas petition specifically to include the 1999 discovery as a basis for relief.  App. 423.  Banks urged that a <em>Brady </em>claim based on the September 1980 transcript had been aired by implied consent; under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), he contended, the claim should have been treated as if raised in the pleadings.  App. 433.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Banks sought, and the District Court denied, a certificate of appealability on this question.  <em>Id.</em>, at 433, 436.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an August 20, 2003, unpublished <em>per curiam</em> opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court to the extent that it granted relief on the Farr <em>Brady</em> claim and denied a certificate of appealability on the Cook <em>Brady</em> claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A2, Judgt. order reported at 48 Fed. Appx. 104 (2002).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The Court of Appeals observed that in his 1992 state-court postconviction application, Banks had not endeavored to develop the facts underpinning the Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.  App to Pet. for Cert. A19\xe2\x80\x93A20.  For that reason, the court held, the evidentiary proceeding ordered by the Magistrate Judge was unwarranted.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court of Appeals expressed no doubt that the prosecution had suppressed, prior to the federal habeas proceeding, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status and his part in the fateful trip to Dallas.  But Banks was not appropriately diligent in pursuing his state-court application, the Court of Appeals maintained.  In the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, Banks should have at that time attempted to locate Farr and question him; similarly, he should have asked to interview Deputy Sheriff Huff and other officers involved in investigating the crime.  <em>Id.</em>, at A19, A22.  If such efforts had proved unavailing, the Court of Appeals suggested, Banks might have applied to the state court for assistance.  <em>Id.</em>, at A19.  Banks\xe2\x80\x99s lack of diligence in pursuing his 1992 state-court plea, the Court of Appeals concluded, rendered the evidence uncovered in the federal habeas proceeding procedurally barred.  <em>Id.</em>, at A22\xe2\x80\x93A23.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Fifth Circuit further concluded, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s status as an informant was not \xe2\x80\x9cmateria[l]\xe2\x80\x9d for <em>Brady</em> purposes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A32\xe2\x80\x93A33.  Banks had impeached Farr at trial by bringing out that he had been a police informant in Arkansas, and an unreliable one at that.  <em>Id.</em>, at A28, A32\xe2\x80\x93A33; <em>supra</em>, at 7.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals said, other witnesses had corroborated much of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony against Banks.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A32.  Notably, Banks himself had acknowledged his willingness to get a gun for Farr\xe2\x80\x99s use in robberies.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In addition, the Fifth Circuit observed, the Magistrate Judge had relied on the cumulative effect of <em>Brady </em>error and the ineffectiveness of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s counsel at the penalty phase.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A44.  Banks himself, however, had not urged that position; he had argued <em>Brady</em> and ineffective assistance of counsel discretely, not cumulatively.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A46\xe2\x80\x93A47.  Finally, in accord with the District Court, the Court of Appeals apparently regarded Rule 15(b) as inapplicable in habeas proceedings.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A51\xe2\x80\x93A52.  The Fifth Circuit accordingly denied a certificate of appealability on the Cook <em>Brady</em> transcript-suppression claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A52, A78.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With an execution date set for March 12, 2003, Banks applied to this Court for a writ of certiorari, presenting four issues: the tenability of his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim; a penalty-phase ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim; the question whether, as to the Cook <em>Brady </em>transcript-suppression claim, a certificate of appealability was wrongly denied; and a claim of improper exclusion of minority jurors in violation of <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/index.html"></a><a href="/us/380/202/index.html">380 U. S. 202</a> (1965).  Pet. for Cert. 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  We stayed Banks\xe2\x80\x99s execution on March 12, 2003, and, on April 21, 2003, granted his petition on all questions other than his <em>Swain </em>claim.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/977/index.html">538 U. S. 977</a> (2003).  We now reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment dismissing Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Farr <em>Brady</em> claim and that Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a certificate of appealability on his Cook <em>Brady</em> claim.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note, initially, that Bank\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claims arose under the regime in place prior to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.  Turning to the tenability of those claims, we consider first Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Farr <em>Brady</em> claim as it trains on his death sentence, see App. to Pet. for Cert. B6 (District Court granted habeas solely with respect to the capital sentence), and next, Banks\xe2\x80\x99s Cook <em>Brady</em> claim.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To pursue habeas corpus relief in federal court, Banks first had to exhaust \xe2\x80\x9cthe remedies available in the courts of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b) (1994 ed.); see <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a>, 520 (1982).  Banks alleged in his January 1992 state-court application for a writ of habeas corpus that the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence involving Farr in violation of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights.  App. 180.  Banks thus satisfied the exhaustion requirement as to the legal ground for his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In state postconviction court, however, Banks failed to produce evidence establishing that Farr had served as a police informant in this case.  As support for his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim, Banks appended to his state-court application only Demetra Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s hardly probative statement that Farr \xe2\x80\x9cwas well-connected to law enforcement people.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 195, \xc2\xb6  ;7; see <em>supra</em>, at 9.  In the federal habeas forum, therefore, it was incumbent on Banks to show that he was not barred, by reason of the anterior state proceedings, from producing evidence to substantiate his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.  Banks \xe2\x80\x9c[would be] entitled to an evidentiary hearing [in federal court] if he [could] show cause for his failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Keeney</em> v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/index.html">504 U. S. 1</a>, 11 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Brady</em>, we reiterate, held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  373 U. S., at 87.  We set out in <em>Strickler</em> v. <em>Greene, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/263/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/263/index.html">527 U. S. 263</a>, 281\xe2\x80\x93282 (1999), the three components or essential elements of a <em>Brady</em> prosecutorial misconduct claim: \xe2\x80\x9cThe evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 281\xe2\x80\x93282.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ause and prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d in this case \xe2\x80\x9cparallel two of the three components of the alleged <em>Brady</em> violation itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 282.  Corresponding to the second <em>Brady</em> component (evidence suppressed by the State), a petitioner shows \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d when the reason for his failure to develop facts in state-court proceedings was the State\xe2\x80\x99s suppression of the relevant evidence; coincident with the third <em>Brady</em> component (prejudice), prejudice within the compass of the \xe2\x80\x9ccause and prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d for <em>Brady</em> purposes.  527 U. S., at 282.  As to the first <em>Brady</em> component (evidence favorable to the accused), beyond genuine debate, the suppressed evidence relevant here, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s paid informant status, qualifies as evidence advantageous to Banks.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A26 (Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cFarr\xe2\x80\x99s being a paid informant would certainly be favorable to Banks in attacking Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, if Banks succeeds in demonstrating \xe2\x80\x9ccause and prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d he will at the same time succeed in establishing the elements of his Farr <em>Brady</em> death penalty due process claim.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our determination as to \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d for Banks\xe2\x80\x99s failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings is informed by <em>Strickler</em>.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In that case, Virginia prosecutors told the petitioner, prior to trial, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s files were open to the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d thus \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no need for a formal <em>[Brady]</em> motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 276, n.\xc2\xa014 (quoting App. in <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1998, No. 98\xe2\x80\x935864, pp. 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (brackets in original)).  The prosecution file given to the <em>Strickler</em> petitioner, however, did not include several documents prepared by an \xe2\x80\x9cimportan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d prosecution witness, recounting the witness\xe2\x80\x99 initial difficulty recalling the events to which she testified at the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  527 U.

In state-court postconviction proceedings, the <em>Strickler</em> petitioner had unsuccessfully urged ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to move, pretrial, for <em>Brady </em>material.  Answering that plea, the State asserted that a <em>Brady</em> motion would have been superfluous, for the prosecution had maintained an open file policy pursuant to which it had disclosed all <em>Brady</em> material.  527 U. S., at 276, n.\xc2\xa014, 278.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court determined that in the federal habeas proceedings, the <em>Strickler</em> petitioner had shown cause for his failure to raise a <em>Brady</em> claim in state court.  527 U. S., at 289.  Three factors accounted for that determination:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (b) petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s open file policy as fulfilling the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s duty to disclose such evidence; and (c) the [State] confirmed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the open file policy by asserting during state habeas proceedings that petitioner had already received everything known to the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is congruent with <em>Strickler</em> in all three respects.  First, the State knew of, but kept back, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s arrangement with Deputy Sheriff Huff.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C43; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; cf. <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a>, 437 (1995) (prosecutors are responsible for \xe2\x80\x9cany favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in the case, including the police\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, the State asserted, on the eve of trial, that it would disclose all <em>Brady</em> material.  App. 361, n.\xc2\xa01; see <em>supra</em>, at 3.  As <em>Strickler</em> instructs, Banks cannot be faulted for relying on that representation.  See 527 U. S., at 283\xe2\x80\x93284 (an \xe2\x80\x9copen file policy\xe2\x80\x9d is one factor that \xe2\x80\x9cexplain[s] why trial counsel did not advance [a <em>Brady</em>] claim\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, in his January 1992 state habeas application, Banks asserted that Farr was a police informant and Banks\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, \xe2\x80\x9ca set-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 180, \xc2\xb6  ;114 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In its answer, the State denied Banks\xe2\x80\x99s assertion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 234; see <em>supra</em>, at 10.  The State thereby \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d Banks\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s representation that it had fully disclosed all relevant information its file contained.  527 U. S., at 289; see <em>id.</em>, at 284 (state habeas counsel, as well as trial counsel, could reasonably rely on the State\xe2\x80\x99s representations).  In short, because the State persisted in hiding Farr\xe2\x80\x99s informant status and misleadingly represented that it had complied in full with its <em>Brady</em> disclosure obligations, Banks had cause for failing to investigate, in state postconviction proceedings, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s connections to Deputy Sheriff Huff.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the question of \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, Banks\xe2\x80\x99s case is stronger than was the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s in <em>Strickler </em>in a notable respect.  As a prosecution witness in the guilt and penalty phases of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s trial, Farr repeatedly misrepresented his dealings with police; each time Farr responded untruthfully, the prosecution allowed his testimony to stand uncorrected.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x937.  Farr denied taking money from or being promised anything by police officers, App. 37; he twice denied speaking with police officers, <em>id.</em>, at 38, and twice denied informing Deputy Sheriff Huff about Banks\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Dallas, <em>id.</em>, at 109.  It has long been established that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Giglio</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/150/index.html">405 U.

If it was reasonable for Banks to rely on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s full disclosure representation, it was also appropriate for Banks to assume that his prosecutors would not stoop to improper litigation conduct to advance prospects for gaining a conviction.  See <em>Berger</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/78/index.html">295 U. S. 78</a>, 88 (1935); <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 284.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State presents three main arguments for distinguishing <em>Strickler</em> on the issue of \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d two of them endorsed by the Court of Appeals.  Brief for Respondent 15\xe2\x80\x9320; App. to Pet. for Cert. A19, A22\xe2\x80\x93A23; see <em>supra</em>, at 15.  We conclude that none of these arguments accounts adequately for the State\xe2\x80\x99s concealment and misrepresentation regarding Farr\xe2\x80\x99s link to Deputy Sheriff Huff.  The State first suggests that Banks\xe2\x80\x99s failure, during state postconviction proceedings, to \xe2\x80\x9cattempt to locate Farr and ascertain his true status,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cinterview the investigating officers, such as Deputy Huff, to ascertain Farr\xe2\x80\x99s status,\xe2\x80\x9d undermines a finding of cause; the Fifth Circuit agreed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A22; Brief for Respondent 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  In the State\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question [of cause] revolves around Banks\xe2\x80\x99s conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly his lack of appropriate diligence in pursuing the Farr <em>Brady</em> claim before resorting to federal court.  Brief for Respondent 14.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We rejected a similar argument in <em>Strickler</em>.  There, the State contended that examination of a witness\xe2\x80\x99 trial testimony, alongside a letter the witness published in a local newspaper, should have alerted the petitioner to the existence of undisclosed interviews of the witness by the police.  527 U. S., at 284, and n. 26.  We found this contention insubstantial.  In light of the State\xe2\x80\x99s open file policy, we noted, \xe2\x80\x9cit is especially unlikely that counsel would have suspected that additional impeaching evidence was being withheld.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 285.  Our decisions lend no support to the notion that defendants must scavenge for hints of undisclosed <em>Brady</em> material when the prosecution represents that all such material has been disclosed.  As we observed in <em>Strickler</em>, defense counsel has no \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial misstep may have occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 286\xe2\x80\x93287.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, we have also observed, turns on events or circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cexternal to the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Amadeo</em> v. <em>Zant,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/214/index.html">486 U. S. 214</a>, 222 (1988) (quoting <em>Murray</em> v. <em>Carrier,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/478/index.html">477 U. S. 478</a>, 488 (1986)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State here nevertheless urges, in effect, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecution can lie and conceal and the prisoner still has the burden to \xe2\x80\xa6 discover the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 35, so long as the \xe2\x80\x9cpotential existence\xe2\x80\x9d of a prosecutorial misconduct claim might have been detected, <em>id.</em>, at 36.  A rule thus declaring \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutor may hide, defendant must seek,\xe2\x80\x9d is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process.  \xe2\x80\x9cOrdinarily, we presume that public officials have properly discharged their official duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bracy</em> v. <em>Gramley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/899/index.html">520 U. S. 899</a>, 909 (1997) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Chemical Foundation, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/1/index.html">272 U. S. 1</a>, 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (1926)).  We have several times underscored the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial role played by the American prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 281; accord, <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 439\xe2\x80\x93440; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bagley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/667/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/667/index.html">473 U.

Courts, litigants, and juries properly anticipate that \xe2\x80\x9cobligations [to refrain from improper methods to secure a conviction] \xe2\x80\xa6 plainly rest[ing] upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Berger</em>, 295 U.

Specifically, the State argues, and the Court of Appeals accepted, that Banks cannot show cause because in the 1992 state-court postconviction proceedings, he failed to move for investigative assistance enabling him to inquire into Farr\xe2\x80\x99s police connections, connections he then alleged, but failed to prove.  Brief for Respondent 15\xe2\x80\x9316; App. to Pet. for Cert. A19; see 1977 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 789, \xc2\xa72(d) (as amended) (instructing postconviction court to \xe2\x80\x9cdesignat[e] the issues of fact to be resolved,\xe2\x80\x9d and giving the court discretion to \xe2\x80\x9corder affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, and hearings\xe2\x80\x9d).  Armed in 1992 only with Demetra Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that Farr was \xe2\x80\x9cwell-connected to law enforcement people,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 195, \xc2\xb6  ;7; see <em>supra</em>, at 9, Banks had little to proffer in support of a request for assistance from the state postconviction court.  We assign no overriding significance to Banks\xe2\x80\x99s failure to invoke state-court assistance to which he had no clear entitlement.  Cf. <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 286 (\xe2\x80\x9cProper respect for state procedures counsels against a requirement that all possible claims be raised in state collateral proceedings, even when no known facts support them.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, relying on <em>Roviaro</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/53/index.html">353 U. S. 53</a> (1957), the State asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure [of an informant\xe2\x80\x99s identity] is not automatic,\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsequently, it was Banks\xe2\x80\x99s duty to move for disclosure of otherwise privileged information.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9318, n.\xc2\xa015.  We need not linger over this argument.  The issue of evidentiary law in <em>Roviaro</em> was whether (or when) the Government is obliged to reveal the identity of an undercover informer the Government does <em>not </em>call as a trial witness.  353 U. S., at 55\xe2\x80\x9356.  The Court there stated that no privilege obtains \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the disclosure of an informer\xe2\x80\x99s identify, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  Accordingly, even though the informer in <em>Roviaro </em>did not testify, we held that disclosure of his identity was necessary because he could have \xe2\x80\x9camplif[ied] or contradict[ed] the testimony of government witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 64.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the State elected to call Farr as a witness.  Indeed, he was a key witness at both guilt and punishment phases of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s capital trial.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s status as a paid informant was unquestionably \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d; similarly beyond doubt, disclosure of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s status would have been \xe2\x80\x9chelpful to [Banks\xe2\x80\x99s] defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  Nothing in <em>Roviaro</em>, or any other decision of this Court, suggests that the State can examine an informant at trial, withholding acknowledgment of his informant status in the hope that defendant will not catch on, so will make no disclosure motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In summary, Banks\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutors represented at trial and in state postconviction proceedings that the State had held nothing back.  Moreover, in state postconviction court, the State\xe2\x80\x99s pleading denied that Farr was an informant.  App. 234; <em>supra</em>, at 10.  It was not incumbent on Banks to prove these representations false; rather, Banks was entitled to treat the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s submissions as truthful.  Accordingly, Banks has shown cause for failing to present evidence in state court capable of substantiating his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unless suppressed evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial for <em>Brady</em> purposes, [its] suppression [does] not give rise to sufficient prejudice to overcome [a] procedural default.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 282.  Our touchstone on materiality is <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a> (1995).  <em>Kyles</em> instructed that the materiality standard for <em>Brady</em> claims is met when \xe2\x80\x9cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U. S.,<em> </em>at 435.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 434\xe2\x80\x93435 (\xe2\x80\x9cA defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict.\xe2\x80\x9d); accord, <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 290.  In short, Banks must show a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability of a different result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 434 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Bagley</em>, 473 U. S., at 678).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the State acknowledged at oral argument, Farr was \xe2\x80\x9cpaid for a critical role in the scenario that led to the indictment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s declaration, presented to the federal habeas court, asserts that Farr, not Banks, initiated the proposal to obtain a gun to facilitate the commission of robberies.  See App. 442\xe2\x80\x93443, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;7\xe2\x80\x938; <em>supra</em>, at 5.  Had Farr not instigated, upon Deputy Sheriff Huff\xe2\x80\x99s request, the Dallas excursion to fetch Banks\xe2\x80\x99s gun, the prosecution would have had slim, if any, evidence that Banks planned to \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue\xe2\x80\x9d committing violent acts.  App. 147.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s admission of his instigating role, moreover, would have dampened the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s zeal in urging the jury to bear in mind Banks\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplanning and acquisition of a gun to commit robbery,\xe2\x80\x9d or Banks\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplanned violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Banks had no criminal record, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony about Banks\xe2\x80\x99s propensity to commit violent acts was crucial to the prosecution.  Without that testimony, the State could not have underscored, as it did three times in the penalty phase, that Banks would use the gun fetched in Dallas to \xe2\x80\x9ctake care\xe2\x80\x9d of trouble arising during the robberies.  App. 140, 144, 146\xe2\x80\x93147; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.  The stress placed by the prosecution on this part of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, uncorroborated by any other witness, belies the State\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9cFarr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was adequately corroborated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase summation, moreover, left no doubt about the importance the State attached to Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  What Farr told the jury, the prosecution urged, was \xe2\x80\x9cof the utmost significance\xe2\x80\x9d to show \xe2\x80\x9c[Banks] is a danger to friends and strangers, alike.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 146.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 289, although the Court found \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d for the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default of a <em>Brady</em> claim, it found the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice\xe2\x80\x9d absent, 527 U. S., at 292\xe2\x80\x93296.  Regarding \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d the contrast between <em>Strickler</em> and Banks\xe2\x80\x99s case is marked.  The witness whose impeachment was at issue in <em>Strickler</em> gave testimony that was in the main cumulative, <em>id.</em>, at 292, and hardly significant to one of the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo predicates for capital murder: [armed] robbery,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 294.  Other evidence in the record, the Court found, provided strong support for the conviction even if the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony had been excluded entirely: Unlike the Banks prosecution, in <em>Strickler</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable forensic and other physical evidence link[ed] [the defendant] to the crime\xe2\x80\x9d and supported the capital murder conviction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 293.  Most tellingly, the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony in <em>Strickler</em> \xe2\x80\x9cdid not relate to [the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] eligibility for the death sentence\xe2\x80\x9d; it \xe2\x80\x9cwas not relied upon by the prosecution at all during its closing argument at the penalty phase.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 295.  In contrast, Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was the centerpiece of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Farr\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony, critical at the penalty phase, was cast in large doubt by the declaration Banks ultimately obtained from Farr and introduced in the federal habeas proceeding.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5, 11.  In the guilt phase of Banks\xe2\x80\x99s trial, Farr had acknowledged his narcotics use.  App. 36.  In the penalty phase, Banks\xe2\x80\x99s counsel asked Farr if, \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn up tight over\xe2\x80\x9d previous drug-related activity, he would \xe2\x80\x9ctestify to anything anybody want[ed] to hear\xe2\x80\x9d; Farr denied this.  <em>Id.</em>, at 110; <em>supra</em>, at 7.  Farr\xe2\x80\x99s declaration supporting Banks\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition, however, vividly contradicts that denial: \xe2\x80\x9cI assumed that if I did not help [Huff] \xe2\x80\xa6 he would have me arrested for drug charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 442, \xc2\xb6  ;6.  Had jurors known of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s continuing interest in obtaining Deputy Sheriff Huff\xe2\x80\x99s favor, in addition to his receipt of funds to \xe2\x80\x9cset [Banks] up,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 442, \xc2\xb6  ;7, they might well have distrusted Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, and, insofar as it was uncorroborated, disregarded it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury, moreover, did not benefit from customary, truth-promoting precautions that generally accompany the testimony of informants.  This Court has long recognized the \xe2\x80\x9cserious questions of credibility\xe2\x80\x9d informers pose.  <em>On Lee</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/747/index.html">343 U.

We have therefore allowed defendants \xe2\x80\x9cbroad latitude to probe [informants\xe2\x80\x99] credibility by cross-examination\xe2\x80\x9d and have counseled submission of the credibility issue to the jury \xe2\x80\x9cwith careful instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>On Lee,</em> 343 U.

The record suggests otherwise.  Neither witness called to impeach Farr gave evidence directly relevant to Farr\xe2\x80\x99s part in Banks\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  App. 124\xe2\x80\x93133; <em>id.</em>, at 129 (prosecutor noted that Kelley lacked \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal knowledge with regard to this case on trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  The impeaching witnesses, Kelley and Owen, moreover, were themselves impeached, as the prosecution stressed on summation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 141, 148; <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Further, the prosecution turned to its advantage remaining impeachment evidence concerning Farr\xe2\x80\x99s drug use.  On summation, the prosecution suggested that Farr\xe2\x80\x99s admission \xe2\x80\x9cthat he used dope, that he shot,\xe2\x80\x9d demonstrated that Farr had been \xe2\x80\x9copen and honest with [the jury] in every way.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 140; <em>supra</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least as to the penalty phase, in sum, one can hardly be confident that Banks received a fair trial, given the jury\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s true role in the investigation and trial of the case.  See <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 434 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d).

The District Court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that Banks had not properly pleaded this claim because he had not sought leave to amend his petition, but had stated the claim only in other submissions, <em>i.e.</em>, in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and, again, in his objections to the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report.

Banks contended, unsuccessfully, that evidence substantiating the Cook <em>Brady</em> claim had been aired before the Magistrate Judge; therefore the claim should have been treated as if raised in the pleadings, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) instructs.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A51\xe2\x80\x93A52; <em>supra,</em> at 14, n.\xc2\xa08 (setting out text of Rule 15(b)).  The Fifth Circuit stated its position on this point somewhat obliquely, but appears to have viewed Rule 15(b) as inapplicable in habeas proceedings; the State now concedes, however, that the question whether Rule 15(b) extends to habeas proceedings is one \xe2\x80\x9cjurists of reason would find \xe2\x80\xa6 debatable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare App. to Pet. for Cert.

The jury was presented with the facts of a horrible crime.  Banks, after meeting the victim, Richard Whitehead, a 16-year-old boy who had the misfortune of owning a car that Banks wanted, decided \xe2\x80\x9cto kill the person for the hell of it\xe2\x80\x9d and take his car.  <em>Banks</em> v. <em>State</em>, 643 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 129, 131 (Tex.

Banks proceeded to shoot Whitehead three times, twice in the head and once in the upper back.  Banks fired one of the shots only 18 to 24 inches away from Whitehead.  The jury was thus presented with evidence showing that Banks, apparently on a whim, executed Whitehead simply to get his car.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury was also presented with evidence, in the form of Banks\xe2\x80\x99 own testimony, that he was willing to abet another individual in obtaining a gun, with the full knowledge that this gun would aid future armed robberies.  The colloquy between a prosecuting attorney and Banks makes it clear what Banks thought he was doing:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cQ: You were going to supply him [Farr] your gun so he could do armed robberies?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA: No, not supply him my gun.

Is that correct?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA: Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 137 (cross-examination of Banks).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAccordingly, the jury was also presented with Banks\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to assist others in committing deadly crimes.  Indeed, the prosecution referenced this very fact at one point during its closing argument in its attempt to convince the jury that Banks posed a threat to commit violent acts in the future:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe testimony of Vetrano Jefferson and Robert Farr is of the utmost significance.  Vetrano brought before you the scar on his face, put there by Delma Banks\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. He also corroborates or supports the testimony of Robert Farr.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to believe just Robert in order to find that Delma went to Dallas to get a pistol so that <em>somebody could do some robberies</em>.  Marcus Jefferson told you that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 146 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury also heard testimony that Banks had violently pistol-whipped and threatened to kill his brother-in-law one week before the murder.  Banks now claims that this evidence should be discounted because his trial counsel failed to uncover that the brother-in-law was \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 33.  But even if it is appropriate to mix-and-match the prejudice analysis of the <em>Brady</em> claim and the claim under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984) (rather than to evaluate them independently, as distinct potential constitutional violations), Banks\xe2\x80\x99 response was vastly disproportional to his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the jury knew that Banks had murdered a 16-year-old on a whim, had violently attacked and threatened a relative shortly before the murder, and was willing to assist another individual in committing armed robberies by providing the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans and possible death weapon\xe2\x80\x9d for these robberies.  App. 137.  Even if the jury were to discredit entirely Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Banks was planning more robberies,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] in all likelihood the jury still would have found \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d that there \xe2\x80\x9c[was] a probability that [Banks] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 143.  The randomness and wantonness of the murder would perhaps, standing alone, mandate such a finding.  Accordingly, I cannot find that the nondisclosure of the evidence was prejudicial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Banks cannot show prejudice, I do not resolve whether he has cause to excuse his failure to present his Farr <em>Brady</em> evidence in state court, <em>Keeney</em> v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/index.html">504 U. S. 1</a>, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (1992).  But there are reasons to doubt the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Banks can show cause.  For instance, the Court concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case is congruent with <em>Strickler</em> <em>[</em>v.<em> Greene, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/263/index.html">527 U. S. 263</a> (1999)],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 20, relying in part on the State\xe2\x80\x99s general denial of all of Banks\xe2\x80\x99 factual allegations contained in his January 1992 state habeas application.  But, in the relevant state postconviction proceeding in <em>Strickler</em>, the State alleged that the petitioner had already received \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>everything</em> known to the government,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a statement that federal habeas proceedings established was clearly not true.  527 U. S., at 289 (emphasis added).  In the instant case, the particular allegation raised in Banks\xe2\x80\x99 state habeas application and denied by the State was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecution <em>knowingly</em> failed to turn over exculpatory evidence <em>as required by Brady v. Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/363/83/index.html">363 U. S. 83</a> (1963).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 180 (emphasis added).  The State, then, could have been denying only that the prosecution <em>knowingly</em> failed to turn over the evidence (there is, incidentally, very little evidence in the record tending to show that any prosecutor had actual knowledge of Huff\xe2\x80\x99s payment to Farr).  Or, the State could have been denying only that it had failed to turn over evidence <em>in violation of </em>Brady, <em>i.e.</em>, that any evidence the prosecution did not turn over was not material (a position advanced by the State throughout the federal habeas process), see <em>Strickler</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 281 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]trictly speaking, there is never a real \xe2\x80\x98<em>Brady</em> violation\xe2\x80\x99 unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict\xe2\x80\x9d).  Either way, <em>Strickler </em>does not clearly control, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on it is less than compelling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of Banks\xe2\x80\x99 Farr <em>Brady</em> claim, it does not address his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cany relief he could obtain on that claim would be cumulative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa010.  As I would affirm the Court of Appeals on the Farr <em>Brady</em> claim, I briefly discuss this ineffective-assistance claim.  Although I find the Farr <em>Brady</em> claim a close call, I do not find this to be so as to the ineffective-assistance claim.  Banks comes nowhere close to satisfying the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <em>supra</em>.  The conclusory and uncorroborated claims of some level of physical abuse, the allegations that a bad skin condition negatively affected his childhood development, the evidence that he was a slow learner and possessed a willingness to please others, and the claim that Banks\xe2\x80\x99 brother-in-law was responsible for his own pistol-whipping and receipt of a death threat, are so unpersuasive that there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have come to the opposite conclusion with respect to the future dangerousness special issue, even if presented with this evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I therefore conclude that the Court of Appeals did not err when it denied relief to Banks based on his Farr <em>Brady</em> claim and his <em>Strickland</em> claim.  I would reverse the Court of Appeals only insofar as it did not grant a certificate of appealability on the Cook <em>Brady</em> claim.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I do not address the possible application of the standard enunciated in <em>Giglio</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html">405 U. S. 150</a> (1972), since I agree with the Court of Appeals that the issue was not properly raised below, and since addressing this issue would go beyond the question on which certiorari was granted.  See Brief for Petitioner (i) (stating the question presented as whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fifth Circuit commit[ted] legal error in rejecting Banks\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Brady</em> claim\xe2\x80\x94that the prosecution suppressed material witness impeachment evidence that prejudiced him in the penalty phase of his trial\xe2\x80\x94on the grounds that: \xe2\x80\xa6 the suppressed evidence was immaterial to Banks\xe2\x80\x99 death sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Admittedly, the prosecution used more of its closing argument trying to convince the jury to believe Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Banks himself was planning more robberies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 27, n.\xc2\xa018.  This fact is one of the reasons I find the materiality question to be a close one.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is quite possible that the jury already discredited this aspect of Farr\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  The jury knew, from the testimony of witnesses James Kelley and Officer Gary Owen, that Farr was generally dishonest, as it heard how he had lied about getting into an altercation with a doctor over false prescriptions, and had lied about his status as an informant for an Arkansas officer in other cases.  The Court suggests that the witnesses providing this information were themselves \xe2\x80\x9cimpeached.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 30.  At best, though, they were only slightly impeached.  The prosecution merely intimated that Owen was slanting his testimony in the hopes of being hired by the defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s private investigator, App. 131, and that Kelley was doing the same as he was a \xe2\x80\x9cfriend of [Banks\xe2\x80\x99] family,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at<em> </em>141.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
