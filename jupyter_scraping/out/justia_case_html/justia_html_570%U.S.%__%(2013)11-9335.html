In convicting Alleyne, the jury form indicated that he had \xe2\x80\x9c[u]sed or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d but not that the firearm was \xe2\x80\x9c[b]randished.\xe2\x80\x9d  When the presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence on the \xc2\xa7924(c) count, Alleyne objected, arguing that the verdict form clearly indicated that the jury did not find brandishing beyond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum sentence based on a sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding of brandishing would violate his \n \nSixth Amendment right to a jury trial.  The District Court overruled his objection, relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in Harris v.

New Jersey, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466\n, concluded that any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are elements of the crime, id., at 490, and thus the \n \nSixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 484.  Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s principle applies with equal force to facts increasing the mandatory minimum, for a fact triggering a mandatory minimum alters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed.  Id., at 490.  Because the legally prescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.  It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to the crime.  The fact that criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.  It is also impossible to dispute that the facts increasing the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment, heightening the loss of liberty associated with the crime.  Defining facts that increase a mandatory minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of the indictment, see id., at 478\xe2\x80\x93479, and preserves the jury\xe2\x80\x99s historic role as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants, see United States v. Gaudin, \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506\n\xe2\x80\x93511.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the fact that the 7-year minimum sentence could have been imposed with or without a judicial finding of brandishing, because the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding authorized a sentence of five years to life, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561, but that fact is beside the point.  The essential \n \nSixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is an element of the crime.  Because the fact of brandishing aggravates the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received had a different range been applicable.  There is no basis in principle or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that increase the minimum.

Gaudin, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 510.  Several divided opinions of this Court have addressed the constitutional status of a \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79\n, the Court held that facts found to increase a mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors that a judge could find by a preponderance of the evidence.  In Apprendi, however, the Court declined to extend McMillan to a New Jersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment if the trial judge found that the crime was committed with racial bias, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 470, finding that any fact that increased the prescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense to be found by the jury.  Id., at 483, n.\xc2\xa010, 490.  Two years later in Harris, the Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that increased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence.  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 557.

United States v. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n, ___.  Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s definition necessarily includes not only facts that increase the ceiling, but also those that increase the floor.  At common law, the relationship between crime and punishment was clear.  A sentence was prescribed for each offense, leaving judges with little sentencing discretion.  If a fact was by law essential to the penalty, it was an element of the offense.  There was a well-established practice of including in the indictment, and submitting to the jury, every fact that was a basis for imposing or increasing punishment.  And this understanding was reflected in contemporaneous court decisions and treatises.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Breyer, agreeing that Harris v. United States, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545\n, should be overruled, concluded that he continues to disagree with Apprendi v. New Jersey, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466\n, because it fails to recognize the law\xe2\x80\x99s traditional distinction between elements of a crime and sentencing facts, but finds it highly anomalous to read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing facts that permit a judge to impose a higher sentence while not insisting that juries find sentencing facts that require a judge to impose a higher sentence.  Overruling Harris and applying Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s basic jury-determination rule to mandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly.  Where a maximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who wishes to impose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.  Where a mandatory minimum sentence is at issue, Apprendi would mean that the government cannot force a judge who does not wish to impose a higher sentence to do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.

Following McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of this term, this Court has made a number of efforts to delimit its boundaries.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMcMillan initially invoked the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factors\xe2\x80\x9d to reject a constitutional challenge to Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79712 (1982).  That law provided that anyone convicted of certain felonies would be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence if the judge found, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98visibly possessed a firearm\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the course of committing specified crimes.  477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 81, n.\xc2\xa01.  While the Court acknowledged that there were constitutional limits to the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9cdefin[e] crimes and prescrib[e] penalties,\xe2\x80\x9d it found that the Commonwealth had permissi- bly defined visible possession as a sentencing factor, rather than an element.  Id., at 86.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, this allowed the judge, rather than the jury, to find this fact by a preponderance of evidence without violating the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMcMillan did not address whether legislatures\xe2\x80\x99 freedom to define facts as sentencing factors extended to findings that increased the maximum term of imprisonment for an offense.  We foreshadowed an answer to this question in Jones v. United States, \n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (1999), but did not resolve the issue until Apprendi.  There, we identified a concrete limit on the types of facts that legislatures may designate as sentencing factors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Apprendi, the defendant was sentenced to 12 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment under a New Jersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment from 10 years to 20 years if the trial judge found that the defendant committed his crime with racial bias.  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 470.  In defending its sentencing scheme, the State of New Jersey argued that, under McMillan, the legislature could define racial bias as a sentencing factor to be found by the judge.  We declined to extend McMillan that far.  We explained that there was no \xe2\x80\x9cprincipled basis for treating\xe2\x80\x9d a fact increasing the maximum term of imprisonment differently than the facts constituting the base offense.  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 476.  The historic link between crime and punishment, instead, led us to conclude that any fact that increased the prescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense to be found by the jury.  Id., at 483, n.\xc2\xa010, 490.  We, thus, found that Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s sentence had been unconstitutionally enhanced by the judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding of racial bias by a preponderance of evidence.  Id., at 491\xe2\x80\x93492.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Apprendi only concerned a judicial finding that increased the statutory maximum, the logic of Apprendi prompted questions about the continuing vitality, if not validity, of McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s holding that facts found to increase the mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors and not elements of the crime.  We responded two years later in Harris v. United States, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545\n, where we considered the same statutory provision and the same question before us today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Harris, the defendant was charged, under \xc2\xa7924(c) (1)(A), with carrying a firearm in the course of committing a drug trafficking crime.  The mandatory minimum sentence based on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone was five years, but the District Court imposed a 7-year mandatory minimum sentence based on its finding, by a preponderance of evidence, that the defendant also brandished the firearm.  As in this case, Harris challenged his sentence on the ground that the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi, even though the judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding did not alter the maximum sentence to which he was exposed.  Harris, supra, at 551.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that increased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence.  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 557.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, judicial factfinding that increased the mandatory minimum did not implicate the \n \nSixth Amendment.  Because the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the Court was of the view that the factual basis for increasing the minimum sentence was not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98essential\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s punishment.  Id., at 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (plurality opinion).  Instead, it merely limited the judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchoices within the authorized range.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 567.  From this, the Court drew a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cfacts increasing the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s minimum sentence and facts extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 566.  The Court limited Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s holding to instances where the factual finding increases the statutory maximum sentence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlleyne contends that Harris was wrongly decided and that it cannot be reconciled with our reasoning in Apprendi.  We agree.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cingredient\xe2\x80\x9d of the charged offense.  United States v. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5); Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10; J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 52 (5th Am. ed. 1846) (hereinafter Archbold).  In Apprendi, we held that a fact is by definition an element of the offense and must be submitted to the jury if it increases the punishment above what is otherwise legally prescribed.  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 483, n.\xc2\xa010.  While Harris declined to extend this principle to facts increasing mandatory minimum sentences, Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily includes not only facts that increase the ceiling, but also those that increase the floor.  Both kinds of facts alter the prescribed range of sentences to which a defendant is exposed and do so in a manner that aggravates the punishment.  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 483, n.\xc2\xa010; Harris, supra, at 579 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Facts that increase the mandatory minimum sentence are therefore elements and must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt common law, the relationship between crime and punishment was clear.  As discussed in Apprendi, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he substantive criminal law tended to be sanction-specific,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cit prescribed a particular sentence for each offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France, Germany 1700\xe2\x80\x931900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa ed. 1987) (quoted in Apprendi, supra, at 479).  The system left judges with little sentencing discretion: once the facts of the offense were determined by the jury, the \xe2\x80\x9cjudge was meant simply to impose [the prescribed] sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Langbein, supra, at 36\xe2\x80\x9337; see also 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 396 (1768) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe judgment, though pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not their determination or sentence, but the determination and sentence of the law\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).  This Court has recognized that the same was true, in many instances, early on in this country.  United States v. Grayson, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41, \n45 (1978)\n; see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245 (1804) (describing state law that specified a punishment for larceny of damages three times the value of the stolen goods).  While some early American statutes provided ranges of permissible sentences, K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998), the ranges themselves were linked to particular facts constituting the elements of the crime.  E.g., Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. 13 (1862) (discussing arson statute that provided for a sentence of 7 to 14 years where the house was occupied at the time of the offense, but a sentence of 3 to 10 if it was not); Ga. Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74324\xe2\x80\x934325 (1867) (robbery \xe2\x80\x9cby open force or violence\xe2\x80\x9d was punishable by 4 to 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, while \xe2\x80\x9c[r]obbery by intimidation, or without using force and violence,\xe2\x80\x9d was punishable by 2 to 5 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment).  This linkage of facts with particular sentence ranges (defined by both the minimum and the maximum) reflects the intimate connection between crime and punishment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with this connection between crime and punishment, various treatises defined \xe2\x80\x9ccrime\xe2\x80\x9d as consisting of every fact which \xe2\x80\x9cis in law essential to the punishment sought to be inflicted,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 J.

See also 1 J.

Numerous high courts agreed that this formulation \xe2\x80\x9caccurately captured the common-law understanding of what facts are elements of a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apprendi, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 511\xe2\x80\x93512 (Thomas, J., concurring) (collecting cases).  If a fact was by law essential to the penalty, it was an element of the offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFrom these widely recognized principles followed a well-established practice of including in the indictment, and submitting to the jury, every fact that was a basis for imposing or increasing punishment.  While an exhaustive history need not be recounted here, see id., at 501\xe2\x80\x93509 (Thomas, J., concurring) (detailing practices of American courts from the 1840\xe2\x80\x99s onward), a few particularly salient examples illustrate the point.  In Hope v. Commonwealth, 50 Mass. 134 (1845), the defendant was indicted for (and convicted of) larceny.  The larceny statute established two levels of sentencing based on whether the value of the stolen property exceeded $100.  Because punishment varied with value, the state high court found that value was an element of the offense:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cOur statutes, it will be remembered, prescribe the punishment for larceny, with reference to the value of the property stolen; and for this reason, as well as because it is in conformity with long established practice, the court are of [the] opinion that the value of the property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the indictment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 137.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tNumerous other contemporaneous court decisions reflect this same understanding.  See, e.g., Ritchey v. State, 7 Blackf. 168, 169 (Ind. 1844) (holding that indictment for arson must allege value of property destroyed, because statute set punishment based on value); United States v. Fisher, 25 F. Cas. 1086 (No. 15,102) (CC Ohio 1849) (McLean, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cA carrier of the mail is subject to a higher penalty where he steals a letter out of the mail, which contains an article of value.  And when this offense is committed, the indictment must allege the letter contained an article of value, which aggravates the offense and incurs a higher penalty\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA number of contemporaneous treatises similarly took the view that a fact that increased punishment must be charged in the indictment.  As one 19th-century commentator explained:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhere a statute annexes a higher degree of punishment to a common-law felony, if committed under particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence, in order to bring the defendant within that higher degree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have been committed under those circumstances, and must state the circumstances with certainty and precision. [2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170].\xe2\x80\x9d  Archbold 51 (15th ed. 1862).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tAnother explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe indictment must contain an allegation of every fact which is legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bishop \xc2\xa781, at 51.  This rule \xe2\x80\x9cenabled [the defendant] to determine the species of offence\xe2\x80\x9d with which he was charged \xe2\x80\x9cin order that he may prepare his defence accordingly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and that there may be no doubt as to the judgment which should be given, if the defendant be convicted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Archbold 44 (emphasis added).  As the Court noted in Apprendi, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to predict with certainty the judgment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of punishment with crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with common-law and early American practice, Apprendi concluded that any \xe2\x80\x9cfacts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed\xe2\x80\x9d are elements of the crime.  Id., at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted); id., at 483, n.\xc2\xa010 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]acts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition \xe2\x80\x98elements\xe2\x80\x99 of a separate legal offense\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We held that the \n \nSixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 484.  While Harris limited Apprendi to facts increasing the statutory maximum, the principle applied in Apprendi applies with equal force to facts increasing the mandatory minimum. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is indisputable that a fact triggering a mandatory minimum alters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed.  Apprendi, supra, at 490; Harris, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 575, 582 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  But for a finding of brandishing, the penalty is five years to life in prison; with a finding of brandishing, the penalty becomes seven years to life.  Just as the maximum of life marks the outer boundary of the range, so seven years marks its floor.  And because the legally prescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, infra, this page, it follows that a fact increasing either end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.  Apprendi, supra, at 501 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Bishop \xc2\xa7598, at 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (if \xe2\x80\x9ca statute prescribes a particular punishment to be inflicted on those who commit it under special circumstances which it mentions, or with particular aggravations,\xe2\x80\x9d then those special circumstances must be specified in the indictment (emphasis added)); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law \xc2\xa7371, p.\xc2\xa0291 (rev. 7th ed. 1874) (similar).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to the crime.  See Harris, supra, at 569 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (facts increasing the minimum and facts increasing the maximum cannot be distinguished \xe2\x80\x9cin terms of logic\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges, which is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.  See, e.g., supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x938; N.\xc2\xa0Y. Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7231\xe2\x80\x93232, p. 70 (1882) (punishment for first-degree robbery was 10 to 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment; second-degree robbery was 5 to 15 years); Va. Code ch. 192, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x932, p. 787 (2d ed. 1860) (arson committed at night was punishable by 5 to 10 years; arson committed during the day was 3 to 10 years).  This historical practice allowed those who violated the law to know, ex ante, the contours of the penalty that the legislature affixed to the crime\xe2\x80\x94and comports with the obvious truth that the floor of a mandatory range is as relevant to wrongdoers as the ceiling.  A fact that increases a sen- tencing floor, thus, forms an essential ingredient of the offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, it is impossible to dispute that facts increasing the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.  Harris, supra, at 579 (Thomas, J., dissenting); O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).  Elevating the low-end of a sentenc- ing range heightens the loss of liberty associated with the crime: the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpected punishment has increased as a result of the narrowed range\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecution is empowered, by invoking the mandatory minimum, to require the judge to impose a higher punishment than he might wish.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apprendi, supra, at 522 (Thomas, J., concurring).  Why else would Congress link an increased mandatory minimum to a particular aggravating fact other than to heighten the consequences for that behavior?  See McMillan, 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 88, 89 (twice noting that a mandatory minimum \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ups the ante\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for a criminal defendant); Harris, supra, at 580 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  This reality demonstrates that the core crime and the fact triggering the mandatory minimum sentence together constitute a new, aggravated crime, each element of which must be submitted to the jury.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDefining facts that increase a mandatory statutory minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of the indictment.  See Apprendi, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478\xe2\x80\x93479.  It also preserves the historic role of the jury as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants.  See United States v.

While undoubtedly true, this fact is beside the point.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs noted, the essential \n \nSixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is an element of the crime.  When a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense and must be submitted to the jury.  It is no answer to say that the defendant could have received the same sentence with or without that fact.  It is obvious, for example, that a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime are identical.  One reason is that each crime has different elements and a defendant can be convicted only if the jury has found each element of the crime of conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, because the fact of brandishing aggravates the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received if a different range had been applicable.  Indeed, if a judge were to find a fact that increased the statutory maximum sentence, such a finding would violate the \n \nSixth Amendment, even if the defendant ultimately received a sentence falling within the original sentencing range (i.e., the range applicable without that aggravating fact).  Cf. Hobbs v. State, 44 Tex. 353 (1875) (reversing conviction where the defendant was indicted for a crime punishable by 2 to 5 years and sentenced to 3 years because the trial court improperly instructed the jury to sentence the defendant between 2 to 10 years if it found a particular aggravating fact); State v. Callahan, 109 La. 946, 33 So. 931 (1903) (finding ex post facto violation where a newly enacted law increased the range of punishment, even though defendant was sentenced within the range established by the prior law).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The essential point is that the aggravating fact produced a higher range, which, in turn, conclusively indicates that the fact is an element of a distinct and aggravated crime.  It must, therefore, be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause there is no basis in principle or logic to dis- tinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that increase the minimum, Harris was inconsistent with Ap-prendi.

Our ruling today does not mean that any fact that influences judicial discretion must be found by a jury.  We have long recognized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding, does not violate the \n \nSixth Amendment.  See, e.g., Dillon v.

But that is not a plausible account of the decision today.  The Court overrules McMillan and Harris because the reasoning of those decisions has been thoroughly undermined by intervening decisions and because no significant reliance interests are at stake that might justify adhering to their result.

Washington, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296, \n328 (2004)\n (dissenting opinion); Apprendi, supra, at 555 (same).  But Apprendi has now defined the relevant legal regime for an additional decade.  And, in my view, the law should no longer tolerate the anomaly that the Apprendi/Harris distinction creates.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s basic error in Apprendi, I believe, was its failure to recognize the law\xe2\x80\x99s traditional distinction between elements of a crime (facts constituting the crime, typically for the jury to determine) and sentencing facts (facts affecting the sentence, often concerning, e.g., the manner in which the offender committed the crime, and typically for the judge to determine).  The early historical references that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions have set forth in favor of Apprendi refer to offense elements, not to sentencing facts.  Thus, when Justice Story wrote that the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of trial by jury offered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98securit[y] against the prejudices of judges,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 4 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (quoting Commentaries on the Consti-tution of the United States \xc2\xa7924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833)), he was likely referring to elements of a crime; and the best answer to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s implicit question in Apprendi\xe2\x80\x94what, exactly, does the \xe2\x80\x9cright to trial by jury\xe2\x80\x9d guarantee?\xe2\x80\x94is that it guarantees a jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination of facts that constitute the elements of a crime.  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 498\xe2\x80\x93499 (concurring opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough I have set forth these minority views be- fore, see Booker, supra, at 326 (opinion dissenting in part); Blakely, supra, at 328 (dissenting opinion); Apprendi, su-pra, at 555 (same), I repeat this point now to make clear why I cannot accept the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the \n \nSixth Amendment as simply seeking to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial overreaching\xe2\x80\x9d when sentencing facts are at issue, post, at 4.  At the very least, the Amendment seeks to protect defendants against \xe2\x80\x9cthe wishes and opinions of the government\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  Ibid. (quoting Story, supra, \xc2\xa7924, at 657).  And, that being so, it seems to me highly anomalous to read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing facts that permit a judge to impose a higher sentence while not insisting that juries find sentencing facts that require a judge to impose a higher sentence.  See Harris, supra, at 569\xe2\x80\x93570 (opinion of Breyer, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo overrule Harris and to apply Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s basic jury-determination rule to mandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly.  Where a maximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who wishes to im-pose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.  Where a manda- tory minimum sentence is at issue, application of Apprendi would mean that the government cannot force a judge who does not wish to impose a higher sentence to do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.  In both instances the matter concerns higher sentences; in both instances factfinding must trigger the increase; in both instances jury-based factfinding would act as a check: in the first instance, against a sentencing judge wrongly imposing the higher sentence that the judge believes is appropriate, and in the second instance, against a sentencing judge wrongly being required to impose the higher sentence that the judge believes is inappropriate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Harris has been the law for 11 years, Apprendi has been the law for even longer; and I think the time has come to end this anomaly in Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s application.

Our key sources in this task have been 19th-century treatises and common law cases identifying which facts qualified as \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime, and therefore had to be alleged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., Apprendi v.

In Apprendi, for example, the defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that carried a maximum sentence of ten years.  After his plea, however, the trial judge determined that the defendant had committed the crime with a biased purpose.  Under a New Jersey law, that finding allowed the judge to impose up to ten additional years in prison.  Exercising that authority, the judge sentenced the defendant to 12 years.  530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 469\xe2\x80\x93471.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the sentence was two years longer than would have been possible without the finding of bias, that find- ing was \xe2\x80\x9cessential to the punishment\xe2\x80\x9d imposed.  1 Bishop, supra, at 50; see Apprendi, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 491\xe2\x80\x93492.

The \n \nSixth Amendment therefore provided for trial by jury as a \xe2\x80\x9cdouble security, against the prejudices of judges, who may partake of the wishes and opinions of the government, and against the passions of the multitude, who may demand their victim with a clamorous precipitancy.\xe2\x80\x9d  J.

Ante, at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur ruling today does not mean that any fact that influences judicial discretion must be found by a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, in the absence of a statutory mandatory minimum, there would have been no constitutional problem had the judge, exercising the discretion given him by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, decided that seven years in prison was the appropriate penalty for the crime because of his finding that the firearm had been brandished during the offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view, that is enough to resolve this case.  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict authorized the judge to impose the precise sentence he imposed for the precise factual reason he imposed it.  As we have recognized twice before, the \n \nSixth Amendment demands nothing more.  See Harris v. United States, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545\n\xe2\x80\x93569 (2002); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79, \n93 (1986)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis approach is entirely consistent with Apprendi.  As I have explained, Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s constraint on the normal legislative control of criminal procedure draws its legitimacy from two primary principles: (1) common law understandings of the \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime, and (2) the need to preserve the jury as a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong barrier\xe2\x80\x9d between defendants and the State.  Neither of those principles supports the rule the majority adopts today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, there is no body of historical evidence supporting today\xe2\x80\x99s new rule.  The majority does not identify a single case holding that a fact affecting only the sentencing floor qualified as an element or had to be found by a jury, nor does it point to any treatise language to that effect.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  To be sure, the relatively recent vintage of mandatory minimum sentencing enhancements means that few, if any, 19th-century courts would have encountered such a fact pattern.  So I do not mean to suggest that the absence of historical condemnation of the practice con- clusively establishes its constitutionality today.  But given that Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99s rule rests heavily on affirmative historical evidence about the practices to which we have previously applied it, the lack of such evidence on statutory minimums is a good reason not to extend it here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does the majority\xe2\x80\x99s extension of Apprendi do anything to preserve the role of the jury as a safeguard between the defendant and the State.  That is because even if a jury does not find that the firearm was brandished, a judge can do so and impose a harsher sentence because of his finding, so long as that sentence remains under the statutory maximum.  The question here is about the power of judges, not juries.  Under the rule in place until today, a legislature could tell judges that certain facts carried certain weight, and require the judge to devise a sentence based on that weight\xe2\x80\x94so long as the sentence remained within the range authorized by the jury.  Now, in the name of the jury right that formed a barrier between the defendant and the State, the majority has erected a bar- rier between judges and legislatures, establishing that discretionary sentencing is the domain of judges.  Legislatures must keep their respectful distance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI find this new rule impossible to square with the historical understanding of the jury right as a defense from judges, not a defense of judges.  See Apprendi, supra, at 498 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudges, it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State\xe2\x80\x9d).  Just as the \n \nSixth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9climits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d Blakely, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308, so too it limits legislative power only to the extent that power infringes on the province of the jury.  Because the claimed infringement here is on the province of the judge, not the jury, the jury right has no work to do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority offers several arguments to the contrary.  I do not find them persuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the majority asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the legally prescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11 (citation omitted).  The syllogism trips out of the gate, for its first premise\xe2\x80\x94that the constitutionally relevant \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d includes the bottom end of the statutory range\xe2\x80\x94simply assumes the answer to the question presented.  Neither of the historical sources to which the majority points gives an answer: The Bishop treatise speaks only to situations in which \xe2\x80\x9ca statute prescribes a particular punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d not a range of possible punishments.  1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa7598, at 360\xe2\x80\x93361.  The Wharton treatise is similarly unhelpful, focusing on statutes that change the maximum or alter the nature of the common law crime.  See 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law \xc2\xa7371, p. 291 (rev. 7th ed. 1874).  The sources provided in the Apprendi concurrence offer no support, for as already discussed, we lack historical evidence about the treatment of facts that altered only the floor of a sentencing range.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the majority observes that \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges, which is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  Again, though, this simply assumes the core premise: That the constitution- ally relevant \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d involves both the statutory minimum and the maximum.  Unless one accepts that premise on faith, the fact that statutes have long specified both floor and ceiling is evidence of nothing more than that stat- utes have long specified both the floor and the ceiling.  Nor does it help to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe floor of a mandatory range is as relevant to wrongdoers as the ceiling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  The meaning of the \n \nSixth Amendment does not turn on what wrongdoers care about most.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore importantly, legal rules frequently focus on the maximum sentence while ignoring the minimum, even though both are \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d to punishment.  Closest to this case, the question whether the jury right applies at all turns on whether the maximum sentence exceeds six months\xe2\x80\x94not, say, whether the minimum punishment involves time in prison.  Blanton v. North Las Vegas, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538, \n543 (1989)\n; see also Lewis v. United States, \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322, \n326 (1996)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn evaluating the seriousness of the offense, we place primary emphasis on the maximum prison term authorized\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, the rights to vote and to bear arms are typically denied to felons\xe2\x80\x94that is, those convicted of a crime with a maximum sentence of more than one year in prison.  See Richardson v. Ramirez, \n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 24, \n48 (1974)\n; District of Columbia v. Heller, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570, \n626 (2008)\n; Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed. 2009).  Examples of other distinctions turning only on max- imum penalties abound, as in cases of recidivism enhancements that apply only to prior convictions with a maximum sentence of more than a specified number of years.  See, e.g., \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2).  That a minimum sentence is \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d to punishment, and that a statute defines it, does not mean it must be treated the same as the maximum sentence the law allows.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the majority offers that \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible to dispute that facts increasing the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  This argument proves too much, for it would apply with equal force to any fact which leads the judge, in the exercise of his own discretion, to choose a penalty higher than he otherwise would have chosen.  The majority nowhere explains what it is about the jury right that bars a determination by Congress that brandishing (or any other fact) makes an offense worth two extra years, but not an identical determination by a judge.  Simply calling one \xe2\x80\x9caggravation\xe2\x80\x9d and the other \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d does not do the trick.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the majority argues that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is no answer to say that the defendant could have received the same sentence with or without\xe2\x80\x9d a particular factual finding, pointing out \xe2\x80\x9cthat a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime are identical.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  In that hypothetical case, the legislature has chosen to define two crimes with two different sets of elements.  Courts must, of course, respect that legislative judgment.  But that tells us nothing about when courts can override the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to create separate crimes, and instead to treat a particular fact as a trigger for a minimum sentence within the already-authorized range.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI will not quibble with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s application of our stare decisis precedents.  But because I believe the major- ity\xe2\x80\x99s new rule\xe2\x80\x94safeguarding the power of judges, not juries\xe2\x80\x94finds no support in the history or purpose of the \n \nSixth Amendment, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970701">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x939335\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tALLEN RYAN ALLEYNE, PETITIONER v.

Tennessee, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808, \n828 (1991)\n.  Nevertheless, the Court ought to be consistent in its willingness to reconsider precedent.  If Harris v. United States, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545 (2002)\n, and McMillan v. Pennsylvania, \n\n477 U. S. 79 (1986)\n, can be cast aside simply because a majority of this Court now disagrees with them, that same approach may properly be followed in future cases.  See Arizona v.

Although Apprendi purported to rely on the original understanding of the jury trial right, there are strong reasons to question the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis on that point.  See, e.g., Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1097, 1123\xe2\x80\x931132 (2001) (critiquing the historical evidence relied upon by the Apprendi majority and concurrence, and concluding (1) that the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d characteristic of eighteenth-century common-law misdemeanor sentencing \xe2\x80\x9cundercuts the suggestion that sentencing was the sacred province of juries alone,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) that even the \xe2\x80\x9cnineteenth-century tradition was not uniform, suggesting that the common law had no fixed rule on the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) that \xe2\x80\x9cno eighteenth-century evidence link[ed] this [nineteenth-century] tradition back to the time of the Founding\xe2\x80\x9d); Little &amp; Chen, The Lost History of Apprendi and the Blakely Petition for Rehearing, 17 Fed.

I disagree.\nIn my view, Harris\xe2\x80\x99 force is not vitiated by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Apprendi line of cases, for two reasons.  First, that line of cases is predicated on a purported \n  requirement that juries find facts that increase maximum penalties, not mandatory minimums.  Accordingly, as The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent persuasively explains, ante, at\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x937, Apprendi and its progeny have no impact on the distinct question resolved by Harris, which does not bear on the jury right.  Second, the Apprendi line is now too intellectually incoherent to undermine any \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary\xe2\x80\x9d precedents.  If the rationale of Apprendi\xe2\x80\x94which, as broadly construed by the Court in this case, is that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \xe2\x80\x98element\xe2\x80\x99 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 1\xe2\x80\x94were taken seriously, discretionary sentencing, as prescribed by \n, should also be held to violate the \n .  But a majority of the Court has not been willing to go where its reasoning leads.\nNor can it be correct to say that \xe2\x80\x9cHarris in no way strengthens the force of stare decisis in this case\xe2\x80\x9d because a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98majority of the Court expressly disagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, \n).  Decisions in which no one rationale commands a majority of the Court\xe2\x80\x94including prominent decisions based on the views of a single Justice\xe2\x80\x94are often thought to have precedential effect.  See, e.g., United States v. Booker, \n; Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, \n\xe2\x80\x93272 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).  And, of course, if Harris is not entitled to stare decisis weight, then neither is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in this case.  After all, only four Members of the Court think that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is the correct reading ofthe Constitution.  See ante, at\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x933 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nAs she concedes, ante, at 4, Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence is nec-essarily selective in its discussion of the factors that the Court has previously found to be relevant to the application of stare decisis.  For example, she does not argue\xe2\x80\x94presumably because there is no good argument to be made\xe2\x80\x94that Harris and McMillan v. Pennsylvania, \n (which provide the framework under which criminal prosecutions have been carried out for at least the past 27 years) have proved \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unworkable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Vieth v. Jubelirer, \n (plurality opinion) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, \n).  Nor does she contend that \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances\xe2\x80\x9d outside the Court \xe2\x80\x9chave changed so radically as to undermine [Harris\xe2\x80\x99] critical factual assumptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Randall v. Sorrell, \n (plurality opinion).  Indeed, no party or amicus has cited any such circumstances.\nIn short, other than the fact that there are currently five Justices willing to vote to overrule Harris, and not five Justices willing to overrule Apprendi, there is no compelling reason why the Court overrules the former rather than the latter.  If the opportunity arises in the future to overrule Apprendi or the present case\xe2\x80\x94both of which presumably involve \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural rules .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that do not govern primary conduct and do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 2 (Sotomayor, J., concurring)\xe2\x80\x94the precedent the Court sets today will be relevant to the issue of stare decisis.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
