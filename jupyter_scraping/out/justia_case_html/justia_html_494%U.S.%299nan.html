S. 301</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A Pennsylvania jury sentenced petitioner Scott Wayne Blystone to death after finding him guilty of robbing and murdering a hitchhiker who was unlucky enough to have accepted a ride in his car.  Petitioner challenges his sentence on the ground that the State\'s death penalty statute is unconstitutional because it requires the jury to impose a sentence of death if, as in this case, it finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances.  We hold that the Pennsylvania death penalty statute, and petitioner\'s sentence under it, comport with our decisions interpreting the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>On a September night in 1983, Dalton Charles Smittaburger, Jr., an individual characterized at trial as possessing a learning disability, was attempting to hitch a ride along a Pennsylvania road.  Petitioner, who was driving an auto carrying his girlfriend and another couple, observed Smittaburger and announced:  "I am going to pick this guy up and rob him, okay . . . ?"  His friends acquiesced in the idea.  Once petitioner had Smittaburger in the car, he asked him if he had any money for gas. Smittaburger responded that he only had a few dollars and began searching a pocket for money.  Dissatisfied, petitioner pulled out a revolver, held it to Smittaburger\'s head, and demanded that Smittaburger close his eyes and put his hands on the dash.  Petitioner then pulled off the road and ordered Smittaburger out of the car and into a nearby field.  After searching his victim at gunpoint and recovering $13, petitioner told Smittaburger to lie face down in the field.  He later said to a friend:  "<em>He [Smittaburger] was so scared.  When I was searching him, his body was shaking.\'"  519 Pa. 450, 490, 549 A.2d 81, 100 (1988).\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioner then ordered his victim not to move, and crept back to the car to tell his companions he was going to kill Smittaburger.  Petitioner returned to the field where, paralyzed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 494 U. S. 302</a></p><p> by fright, Smittaburger remained with his face to the ground.  Petitioner asked his victim what kind of car he had been in.  Smittaburger responded with the wrong answer -- he accurately described the car as green with a wrecked back end.  Petitioner then said "<em>goodbye\'" and discharged six bullets into the back of Smittaburger\'s head.  During a subsequent conversation with a friend, petitioner was recorded on a concealed device "bragging in vivid and grisly detail of the killing of that unlucky lad."  <em>Id.</em> at 457, 549 A.2d at 84.  In response to a query during the conversation as to whether petitioner dreamed about, or felt anything from the murder, petitioner stated\n</em></p>\n<p>"[w]e laugh about it . . . it gives you a realization that you can do it . . . [y]ou can walk and blow somebody\'s brains out and you know that you can get away with it . . . [i]t gives you a feeling of power, self-confidence. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 489-490, 549 A.2d at 100.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was charged and convicted of first-degree murder, robbery, criminal conspiracy to commit homicide, and criminal conspiracy to commit robbery.  The same jury that convicted petitioner found as an aggravating circumstance that petitioner "committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony."  42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 9711(d)(6) (1988).  The jury found that no mitigating circumstances existed, and accordingly sentenced petitioner to death pursuant to the Pennsylvania death penalty statute, which provides that</p>\n<p>"[t]he verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance . . . and no mitigating circumstance or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 9711(c)(1)(iv).  On direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, petitioner argued that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional because it mandated a sentence of death based on the outcome of the weighing process.  The court summarily rejected this argument, <em>see</em> 519 Pa. at 473, 549 A.2d at 92, noting that it had been expressly refuted in its decision in <em>Commonwealth</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 494 U. S. 303</a></p><p> <em>v. Peterkin,</em> 511 Pa. 299, 326-328, 513 A.2d 373, 387-388 (1986), <em>cert. denied,</em> 479 U.S. 1070 (1987).  In <em>Peterkin,</em> the court reasoned that the statute properly accommodated the concerns of <em>Furman v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/case.html">408 U. S. 238</a></span> (1972), that jury discretion be channeled to avoid arbitrary and capricious capital sentencing, and <em>Lockett v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html">438 U. S. 586</a></span> (1978), that a capital jury be allowed to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.  511 Pa. at 326-328, 513 A.2d at 387-388.  We granted certiorari, 489 U.S. 1096, (1989), to decide whether the mandatory aspect of the Pennsylvania death penalty statute renders the penalty imposed upon petitioner unconstitutional because it improperly limited the discretion of the jury in deciding the appropriate penalty for his crime.  We now affirm.</p>\n<p>The constitutionality of a death penalty statute having some "mandatory" aspects is not a novel issue for this Court.  In <em>Jurek v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html">428 U. S. 262</a></span> (1976), we upheld a statute requiring the imposition of a death sentence if the jury made certain findings against the defendant beyond the initial conviction for murder.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#278">428 U. S. 278</a></span> (WHITE J., concurring in judgment).  A majority of the Court believed that the Texas sentencing scheme at issue in <em>Jurek</em> cured the constitutional defect identified in <em>Furman</em> -- namely, that unguided juries were imposing the death penalty in an inconsistent and random manner on defendants.  <em>See Furman,</em> 408 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/case.html#309">408 U. S. 309</a></span>-310 (Stewart, J., concurring).  Thus, by suitably directing and limiting a sentencing jury\'s discretion "so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action," <em>Gregg v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html">428 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#189">428 U. S. 189</a></span> (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell and STEVENS, JJ.), the Texas death penalty scheme was found to pass constitutional muster.  <em>See Jurek,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#276">428 U. S. 276</a></span>. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 494 U. S. 304</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It was also thought significant that the Texas sentencing scheme allowed the jury to consider relevant mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>"A jury must be allowed to consider on the basis of all relevant evidence not only why a death sentence should be imposed, but also why it should not be imposed."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#271">428 U. S. 271</a></span> (opinion of Stewart, Powell and STEVENS, JJ.).  On the same day that <em>Jurek</em> was decided, the Court struck down two capital-sentencing schemes largely because they <em>automatically</em> imposed a sentence of death upon an individual convicted of certain murders, without allowing "particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of each convicted defendant before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death."  <em>Woodson v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html">428 U.

S. 305</a></p><p> of the particular offense") (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>In <em>Lockett,</em> the Court provided further guidance on the nature of "relevant" mitigating circumstances, concluding that a sentencer must be allowed to consider, "<em>as a mitigating factor,</em> any aspect of a defendant\'s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#604">438 U. S. 604</a></span> (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).  Last Term, we elaborated on this principle, holding that</p>\n<p>"the jury must be able to consider and give effect to any mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant\'s background, character, or the circumstances of the crime."</p>\n<p><em>Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U.

S. 328</a></span> (1989).</p>\n<p>We think that the Pennsylvania death penalty statute satisfies the requirement that a capital-sentencing jury be allowed to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence.  Section 9711 does not limit the types of mitigating evidence which may be considered, and subsection (e) provides a jury with a nonexclusive list of mitigating factors which may be taken into account -- including a "catchall" category providing for the consideration of "[a]ny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense."  <em>See</em> 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 9711(e)(8) (1988). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Nor is the statute impermissibly "mandatory" as that term was understood in <em>Woodson</em> or <em>Roberts.</em>  Death is not automatically imposed upon conviction for certain types of murder.  It is imposed only after a determination that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances present in the particular crime committed by the particular defendant, or that there are no such mitigating circumstances.  This is sufficient under <em>Lockett and Penry.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 494 U. S. 306</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner challenges the statute as it was applied in his particular case.  This challenge essentially consists of a claim that his sentencing proceeding was rendered "unreliable" by the mandatory aspect of \xc2\xa7 9711 for two reasons.  <em>See Woodson,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#305">428 U. S. 305</a></span> (there is a "need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case") (opinion of Stewart, Powell and STEVENS, JJ.).  First, petitioner asserts that the mandatory feature of his jury instructions -- derived, of course, from the statute -- precluded the jury from evaluating the weight of the particular aggravating circumstance found in his case.  Second, petitioner contends that the mandatory feature of the sentencing instructions unconstitutionally limited the jury\'s consideration of unenumerated mitigating circumstances.  We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, petitioner\'s jury found one aggravating circumstance present in this case -- that petitioner committed a killing while in the perpetration of a robbery.  No mitigating circumstances were found. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Petitioner contends that the mandatory imposition of death in this situation violates the Eighth Amendment requirement of individualized sentencing since the jury was precluded from considering whether the severity of his aggravating circumstance warranted the death sentence.  We reject this argument.  The presence of aggravating circumstances serves the purpose of limiting the class of death-eligible defendants, and the Eighth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 494 U. S. 307</a></p><p> does not require that these aggravating circumstances be further refined or weighed by a jury.  <em>See Lowenfield v. Phelps,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/231/case.html">484 U. S. 231</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/231/case.html#244">484 U. S. 244</a></span> (1988) ("The use of <em>aggravating circumstances\' is not an end in itself, but a means of genuinely narrowing the class of death-eligible persons and thereby channeling the jury\'s discretion").  The requirement of individualized sentencing in capital cases is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In petitioner\'s case the jury was specifically instructed to consider, as mitigating evidence, any "matter concerning the character or record of the defendant, or the circumstances of </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 494 U. S. 308</a></em></p><p><em> his offense." App. 12-13.  This was sufficient to satisfy the dictates of the Eighth Amendment.\n</em></p>\n<p>Next, petitioner maintains that the mandatory aspect of his sentencing instructions foreclosed the jury\'s consideration of certain mitigating circumstances.  The trial judge gave the jury examples of mitigating circumstances that it was entitled to consider, essentially the list of factors contained in \xc2\xa7 9711(e).  Among these, the judge stated that the jury was allowed to consider whether petitioner was affected by an "extreme" mental or emotional disturbance, whether petitioner was "substantially" impaired from appreciating his conduct, or whether petitioner acted under "extreme" duress.  Petitioner argues that these instructions impermissibly precluded the jury\'s consideration of lesser degrees of disturbance, impairment, or duress.  This claim bears scant relation to the mandatory aspect of Pennsylvania\'s statute, but in any event we reject it.  The judge at petitioner\'s trial made clear to the jury that these were merely items they could consider, and that it was also entitled to consider "any other mitigating matter concerning the character or record of the defendant, or the circumstances of his offense." App. 12-13.  This instruction fully complied with the requirements of <em>Lockett and Penry.</em></p>\n<p>Three Terms ago, in <em>McCleskey v. Kemp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/279/case.html">481 U. S. 279</a></span> (1987), we summarized the teachings of the Court\'s death penalty jurisprudence:</p>\n<p>"In sum, our decisions since <em>Furman</em> have identified a constitutionally permissible range of discretion in imposing the death penalty.  First, there is a required threshold below which the death penalty cannot be imposed.  In this context, the State must establish rational criteria that narrow the decisionmaker\'s judgment as to whether the circumstances of a particular defendant\'s case meet the threshold.  Moreover, a societal consensus that the death penalty is disproportionate to a particular offense </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 494 U. S. 309</a></p><p> prevents a State from imposing the death penalty for that offense.  Second, States cannot limit the sentencer\'s consideration of any relevant circumstance that could cause it to decline to impose the penalty.  In this respect, the State cannot channel the sentencer\'s discretion, but must allow it to consider any relevant information offered by the defendant."</p>\n<p>481 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/279/case.html#305">481 U. S. 305</a></span>-306.  We think petitioner\'s sentence under the Pennsylvania statute satisfied these requirements.  The fact that other States have enacted different forms of death penalty statutes which also satisfy constitutional requirements casts no doubt on Pennsylvania\'s choice.  Within the constitutional limits defined by our cases, the States enjoy their traditional latitude to prescribe the method by which those who commit murder shall be punished.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Only three Members of the Court expressly relied on the mandatory nature of the Texas sentencing scheme as one reason why it passed muster under <em>Furman.</em> <em>See Jurek,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#278">428 U.

The jury considers the aggravating circumstances that are listed in the statute. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In addition, the jury considers specific enumerated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 494 U.

The State must prove the existence of aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendant must prove the existence of mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence.  \xc2\xa7 9711(c)(1)(iii).  The statute provides that "[t]he verdict <em>must</em> be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) and no mitigating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 494 U.

The jury found as an aggravating circumstance that petitioner had committed murder during a $13 robbery.  \xc2\xa7 9711(d)(6).

The jury was told that in such a situation, it was not allowed to make the ultimate decision whether the death penalty was justified.

On the same day that the Court upheld three death penalty statutes that "guided" the jury\'s discretion in imposing this sentence, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] the Court invalidated two mandatory death penalty statutes.  <em>Woodson v.

The Court rejected the argument that <em>Furman</em> required removal of all discretion from the sentencer, holding that any consistency obtained by a mandatory statute would be arbitrary because the consistency would not take into account the individual circumstances of the defendant and the crime.  <em>Woodson, supra,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#304">428 U.

But once a Pennsylvania jury finds that no mitigating circumstances are proved by a preponderance of the evidence, it is required to impose the death penalty.  The mandatory provision of the Pennsylvania statute may be effective in a smaller set of cases than the North Carolina statute at issue in <em>Woodson.</em>  Nevertheless, the effect of the mandatory provision in both statutes is the same:  it substitutes a legislative judgment about the severity of a crime for a jury\'s determination that the death penalty is appropriate for the individual. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority is unconcerned that in this category of cases the mandatory provision deprives the defendant of an individualized sentencing determination.  The nature of the individualized determination required by <em>Woodson</em> is derived from this Court\'s recognition that the decision to impose the death penalty must reflect a reasoned moral judgment about the defendant\'s actions and character in light of all the circumstances of the offense and the defendant\'s background.  <em>See, e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U. S. 302</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/361/case.html#391">492 U. S. 391</a></span> (1989); <em>California v.

S. 545</a></span> (1987) (O\'CONNOR J., concurring).  Just as a jury must be free to consider and weigh mitigating circumstances as independently relevant to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 494 U. S. 317</a></p><p> the defendant\'s moral culpability, <em>see Penry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#319">492 U. S. 319</a></span>, a jury must also be able to consider and weigh the severity of each aggravating circumstance.  The weight of an aggravating circumstance depends on the seriousness of the crime -- a significant aspect of the defendant\'s moral culpability.  Thus, a reasoned moral response to the defendant\'s conduct requires the consideration of the significance of both aggravating and mitigating factors.  "[I]n the end it is the jury that must make the difficult, <em>individualized</em> judgment as to whether the defendant deserves the sentence of death."  <em>Turner v.

S. 231</a></span> (1988), for its conclusion that the jury need not consider the weight of the aggravating circumstance before imposing the death sentence.  In <em>Lowenfield,</em> the Court upheld the Louisiana death penalty statute under which a jury could impose a death sentence even if the only aggravating factor found duplicated an element of the offense of capital murder.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 494 U.

The sole question the Court addressed was whether such an aggravating circumstance sufficiently narrowed the class of death-<em>eligible</em> defendants.  As the majority notes today, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/case.html#307">494 U. S. 307</a></span>, <em>Lowenfield</em> held that</p>\n<p>"[t]he use of \'aggravating circumstances\' is not an end in itself, but a means of genuinely narrowing the class of death-eligible persons and thereby channeling the jury\'s discretion."</p>\n<p>484 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/231/case.html#244">484 U. S. 244</a></span>.  Nothing in <em>Lowenfield</em> suggests that a State may preclude a jury from weighing the strength of the aggravating factor. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  As the majority fails to recognize, under the Pennsylvania statute an aggravating circumstance does much more than "channel" the jury\'s discretion:  in the absence of mitigating factors, it <em>mandates</em> the death penalty.</p>\n<p>This Court has never held that a legislature may mandate the death sentence for any category of murderers.  Instead, a legislature\'s role must be limited to the definition of the class of death-<em>eligible</em> defendants.  A legislature does not, and indeed cannot, consider every possible fact pattern that technically will fall within an aggravating circumstance.  Hence, the definition of an aggravating circumstance provides a basis for distinguishing crimes only on a <em>general</em> level; it does not embody the type of reasoned moral judgment required to justify the imposition of the death penalty.  <em>See Sumner v. Shuman,</em> 483 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/66/case.html#78">483 U. S. 78</a></span> (legislative judgment does not "provide an adequate basis on which to determine whether the death sentence is the appropriate sanction in any <em>particular</em> case") (emphasis added).  The Pennsylvania statute provides a stark example of this constitutional flaw.  It permits the jury to find an aggravating circumstance if the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 494 U. S. 319</a></p><p> killing was committed in the course of a felony.  42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 9711(d)(6) (1988).  A variety of murders fit under this aggravating circumstance.  Since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has interpreted this aggravating circumstance to include nonviolent felonies, <em>Commonwealth v. Holcomb,</em> 508 Pa. 425, 498 A.2d 833 (1985), the aggravating circumstance covers a very wide range of cases.  A jury, however, likely would draw a different inference about the culpability of the defendant -- and therefore the propriety of the death sentence -- if the murder were committed during a rape rather than (as here) during a $13 robbery.  The majority today allows the legislature to preclude a jury from considering such factors in deciding whether to impose death. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Such a conclusion flies in the face of our reasoning in <em>Sumner v. Shuman, supra.</em>  In <em>Sumner,</em> we invalidated a statute that mandated death for a prisoner who committed murder while already serving a life term.  Although the Court acknowledged the legislature\'s power to determine that the crime was sufficiently serious to make the defendants <em>eligible</em> for the death penalty, the Court held that the legislature had no power to conclude that the sole fact that the defendant was serving a life sentence justified the death penalty in every such case.  <em>Id.</em> 483 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/66/case.html#78">483 U.

As the Court explained:</p>\n<p>"Past convictions of other criminal offenses can be considered as a valid aggravating factor in determining whether a defendant deserves to be sentenced to death for a later murder, but the inferences to be drawn concerning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="320">Page 494 U.

Without consideration of the nature of the predicate life-term offense and the circumstances surrounding the commission of that offense, the label \'life-term inmate\' reveals little about the inmate\'s record or character.  Even if the offense was first-degree murder, whether the defendant was the primary force in that incident, or a nontriggerman . . . , may be relevant to both his criminal record and his character.  Yet under the mandatory statute, all predicate life-term offenses are given the same weight."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/66/case.html#81">483 U.

In <em>Sumner,</em> the Court invalidated the statute because it precluded the jury from considering mitigating factors <em>and</em> because it prevented the jury from determining whether certain crimes were serious enough to require the death penalty.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s suggestion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/case.html#303">494 U.

[<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Although both the Texas and Pennsylvania statutes contain mandatory language, the Texas statute upheld in <em>Jurek</em> does not deprive the jury of its ability to determine the propriety of the death sentence in a particular case.  In Texas, the class of death-eligible defendants is narrowed at the guilt stage because only five types of murder are classified as first-degree murder.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#270">428 U. S. 270</a></span>.  At the sentencing stage, the jury is instructed that it must impose a sentence of death </p><p><a class="page-number" name="322">Page 494 U. S. 322</a></p><p> if it answers the following two questions affirmatively:</p>\n<p>"(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result; (2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing criminal threat to society."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#269">428 U. S. 269</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  These questions require the jury to do more than find facts supporting a legislatively defined aggravating circumstance.  Instead, by focusing on the deliberateness of the defendant\'s actions and his future dangerousness, the questions compel the jury to make a moral judgment about the severity of the crime and the defendant\'s culpability.  The Texas statute directs the imposition of the death penalty only after the jury has decided that the defendant\'s actions were sufficiently egregious to warrant death.</p>\n<p>The mandatory language in the Pennsylvania statute, however, does deprive the jury of any power to make such an independent judgment.  The jury\'s determination that an aggravating circumstance exists ends the decisionmaking process.  In addition, whether an aggravating circumstance exists is generally a question of fact relating to either the circumstances of the offense, [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] the status of the victim, [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] or the defendant\'s criminal record. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  In many cases, the existence of the aggravating factor is not disputed.  Finding an aggravating circumstance does not entail any moral judgment about the nature of the act or the actor, and therefore it does not give the jury an opportunity to decide whether it believes the defendant\'s particular offense, warrants the death penalty. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 494 U. S. 323</a></p><p> Because the mandatory language in the Pennsylvania statute deprives a defendant of an individualized sentencing hearing in a way that the Texas statute does not, <em>Jurek</em> in no way supports the Court\'s conclusion that the Pennsylvania statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s refusal to recognize that the "mandatory aspect" of the Pennsylvania statute deprives the defendant of an individualized sentencing hearing is contrary to reason.  Rather than address the merits of petitioner\'s claim, the majority summarily concludes that the Eighth Amendment is "satisfied" because the jury may consider mitigating evidence. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Although our cases clearly hold that the ability to consider mitigating evidence is a constitutional requirement, it does not follow that this ability satisfies the constitutional demand for an individualized sentencing hearing.  The "weight" of an aggravating circumstance is just as relevant to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 494 U. S. 324</a></p><p> the propriety of the death penalty as the "weight" of any mitigating circumstances.  The Court\'s unarticulated assumption that the legislature may define a group of crimes for which the death penalty is required in certain situations represents a marked departure from our previous cases.  The Court\'s failure to provide any reasoning to reject a claim well grounded in our case law is always disturbing.  An unexplained departure from fundamental principles in the death penalty context is inexcusable.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even if I did not believe the Pennsylvania statute unconstitutionally deprives the jury of discretion to impose a life sentence, I would vacate petitioner\'s sentence.  I adhere to my belief that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment.  <em>Gregg v.

Since the jury found no mitigating circumstances in this case, the petitioner challenges the constitutionality of only the first part of the provision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor did the instructions on mitigating evidence indicate that the jury was free to choose a life sentence even if it did not find any mitigating circumstances.  The trial judge made no attempt to define the concept of mitigation for the jury.  When the jury pressed for a definition of mitigation, the judge stated that "[t]he legislature has determined what constitutes mitigating circumstances" and proceeded to list the statutory mitigating factors.  App. at 16.  When pressed further for a definition of the last mitigating circumstance -- "any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense" -- the judge said, "[t]his is pretty broad, and allows you a great latitude in determining what you might consider to be a mitigating circumstance."  <em>Id.</em> at 17.  The trial judge did, however, emphasize that the defendant was required to prove mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.  <em>See</em> App. 12 ("[I]f you find that the evidence of mitigation is greater than the other way by a preponderance of the evidence which means simply to exceed in weight, then you would make a finding of mitigat[ion]").  However, because petitioner had not presented any affirmative evidence of mitigation, the judge stressed that the evidence</p>\n<p>"should be . . . something that you can draw from the record of this case as to his character or the record of the defendant or the circumstances of his offense."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 17.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Gregg v.

But until now I thought that all Members of the Court agreed that the holding of <em>Jurek</em> was contained in the joint opinion of Justices Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, which concluded that the statute was constitutional because it adequately narrowed the class of murderers subject to the death penalty and because the questions presented to the jury would be interpreted broadly enough to allow the jury to consider any relevant mitigating circumstance.  <em>Jurek,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html#272">428 U.

Indeed, JUSTICE WHITE\'S concurrence in <em>Jurek</em> may have depended on the view that the Texas statute was constitutional precisely because it deprived the jury of all discretion in determining sentence.  <em>See Roberts,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/325/case.html#358">428 U.

It is arguable that the jury\'s consideration of these aggravating circumstances allows the jury to conclude that the crime does not warrant the death penalty.
