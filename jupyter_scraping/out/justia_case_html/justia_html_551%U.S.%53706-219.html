The previous owner granted the United States an easement to use and maintain a road running through the ranch to federal land in return for a right-of-way to maintain a section of road running across federal land to otherwise isolated parts of the ranch.  When Robbins bought the ranch, he took title free of the easement, which the Bureau had not recorded.  Robbins continued to graze cattle and run guest cattle drives under grazing permits and a Special Recreation Use Permit (SRUP) issued by the Bureau of Land Management.  Upon learning that the easement was never recorded, a Bureau official demanded that Robbins regrant it, but Robbins declined.  Robbins claims that after negotiations broke down, defendant-petitioners (defendants) began a campaign of harassment and intimidation to force him to regrant the lost easement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s suit for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief now includes a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim that defendants repeatedly tried to extort an easement from him and a similarly grounded <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, claim that defendants violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.  Ultimately, the District Court denied defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the RICO claim based on qualified immunity.  As to the <em>Bivens </em>claims, it dismissed what Robbins called his Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim and his Fifth Amendment due process claims, but declined to dismiss a Fifth Amendment claim of retaliation for the exercise of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s rights to exclude the Government from his property and to refuse to grant a property interest without compensation.  It adhered to this denial on summary judgment.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Robbins does not have a private action for damages of the sort recognized in Bivens.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In deciding whether to devise a <em>Bivens </em>remedy for retaliation against the exercise of ownership rights, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first step is to ask whether any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.  <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Lucas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/367/index.html">462 U. S. 367</a>, 378.  But even absent an alternative, a <em>Bivens</em> remedy is a subject of judgment: \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed \xe2\x80\xa6 to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0For purposes of step one, Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s difficulties with the Bureau can be divided into four categories.  The first, torts or tort-like injuries, includes an unauthorized survey of the desired easement\xe2\x80\x99s terrain and an illegal entry into Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s lodge.  In each instance, he had a civil damages remedy for trespass, which he did not pursue.  The second category, charges brought against Robbins, includes administrative claims for trespass and other land-use violations, a fine for an unauthorized road repair, and two criminal charges.  Robbins had the opportunity to contest all of the administrative charges; he fought some of the land-use and trespass citations, and challenged the road repair fine as far as the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA), but did not seek judicial review after losing there.  He exercised his right to jury trial on the criminal complaints.  The fact that the jury took 30 minutes to acquit him tends to support his baseless-prosecution charge; but the federal trial judge did not find the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case thin enough to justify attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and Robbins appealed that ruling late.  The third category, unfavorable agency actions, involved a 1995 cancellation of the right-of-way given to Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in return for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s unrecorded easement, a 1995 decision to reduce the SRUP from five years to one, and in 1999, the SRUP\xe2\x80\x99s termination and a grazing permit\xe2\x80\x99s revocation.  Administrative review was available for each claim, subject to ultimate judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Robbins did not appeal the 1995 decisions, stopped after an IBLA appeal of the SRUP denial, and obtained an IBLA stay of the grazing permit revocation.  The fourth category includes three events that elude classification.  An altercation between Robbins and his neighbor did not implicate the Bureau, and no criminal charges were filed.  Bureau employees\xe2\x80\x99 videotaping of ranch guests during a cattle drive, though annoying and possibly bad for business, may not have been unlawful, depending, <em>e.g.,</em> on whether the guests were on public or private land.  Also, the guests might be the proper plaintiffs in any tort action, and any tort might be chargeable against the Government, not its employees.  Likewise up in the air is the significance of an attempt to pressure a Bureau of Indian Affairs employee to impound Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s cattle.  An impoundment\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy would have depended on whether the cattle were on private or public land, and no impoundment actually occurred.  Thus, Robbins has an administrative, and ultimately a judicial, process for vindicating virtually all of his complaints.  This state of law gives him no intuitively meritorious case for a new constitutional cause of action, but neither does it plainly answer no to the question whether he should have it.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This, then, is a case for <em>Bivens</em> step two, for weighing reasons for and against creating a new cause of action, as common law judges have always done.  Robbins concedes that any single action might have been brushed aside as a small imposition, but says that in the aggregate the campaign against him amounted to coercion to extract the easement and should be redressed collectively.  On the other side of the ledger is the difficulty in defining a workable cause of action.  Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim of retaliation for exercising his property right to exclude the Government does not fit this Court\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation cases, which involve an allegation of impermissible purpose and motivation\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g., </em>an employee is fired after speaking out on matters of public concern, <em>Board of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs, Wabaunsee Cty.</em> v. <em>Umbehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/668/index.html">518 U. S. 668</a>, 675\xe2\x80\x94and whose outcome turns on \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d questions\xe2\x80\x94what was the Government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in firing the employee and would he have been fired anyway.  Such questions have definite answers, and this Court has established methods to identify the presence of an illicit reason.  Robbins alleges not that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s means were illegitimate but that the defendants simply demanded too much and went too far.  However, a \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d kind of liability standard can never be as reliable as a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d one.  Most of the offending actions are legitimate tactics designed to improve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating position.  Although the Government is no ordinary landowner, in many ways it deals with its neighbors as one owner among the rest.  So long as defendants had authority to withhold or withdraw Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s permission to use Government land and to enforce the trespass and land-use rules, they were within their rights to make it plain that Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to give an easement would determine how complaisant they would be about his trespasses on public land.  As for Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s more abstract claim, recognizing a <em>Bivens </em>action for retaliation against those who resist Government impositions on their property rights would invite claims in every sphere of legitimate governmental action affecting property interests, from negotiating tax claim settlements to enforcing Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0RICO does not give Robbins a claim against defendants in their individual capacities.  Robbins argues that the predicate act for his RICO claim is a violation of the Hobbs Act, which criminalizes interference with interstate commerce by extortion, along with attempts or conspiracies, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a), and defines extortion as \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent \xe2\x80\xa6 under color of official right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(2).  Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim fails because the Hobbs Act does not apply when the National Government is the intended beneficiary of allegedly extortionate acts.  That Act does not speak explicitly to efforts to obtain property for the Government rather than a private party, so the question turns on the common law conception of \xe2\x80\x9cextortion,\xe2\x80\x9d which Congress is presumed to have incorporated into the Act in 1946, see, <em>e.g., Scheidler</em> v. <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/393/index.html">537 U. S. 393</a>, 402.  At common law, extortion \xe2\x80\x9cby the public official was the rough equivalent of what [is] now describe[d] as \xe2\x80\x98taking a bribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Evans</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/255/index.html">504 U. S. 255</a>, 260.  While public officials were not immune from extortion charges at common law, that crime focused on the harm of public corruption, by selling public favors for private gain, not on the harm caused by overzealous efforts to obtain property on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  The importance of the line between public and private beneficiaries is confirmed by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law, which is completely barren of an example of extortion under color of official right undertaken for the sole benefit of the Government.  More tellingly, Robbins cites no decision by any court, much less this one, in the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s entire 60-year history finding extortion in Government employees\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to get property for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive benefit.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/415/index.html">350 U. S. 415</a>, 420, which held that \xe2\x80\x9cextortion as defined in the [Hobbs Act] in no way depends upon having a direct benefit conferred on the person who obtains the property,\xe2\x80\x9d does not support Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Congress could not have meant to prohibit extortionate acts in the interest of private entities like unions, but ignore them when the intended beneficiary is the Government.  Without some other indication from Congress, it is not reasonable to assume that the Hobbs Act (let alone RICO) was intended to expose all federal employees to extortion charges whenever they stretch in trying to enforce Government property claims.  Because defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct does not fit the traditional definition of extortion, it also does not survive as a RICO predicate offense on the theory that it is \xe2\x80\x9cchargeable under [Wyoming] law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U.

The questions here are whether the landowner has either a private action for damages of the sort recognized in <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed.

We hold that neither action is available.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiff-respondent Frank Robbins owns and operates the High Island Ranch, a commercial guest resort in Hot Springs County, Wyoming, stretching across some 40 miles of territory.  The ranch is a patchwork of mostly contiguous land parcels intermingled with tracts belonging to other private owners, the State of Wyoming, and the National Government.  Its natural resources include wildlife and mineral deposits, and its mountainous western portion, called the upper Rock Creek area, is a place of great natural beauty.  In response to persistent requests by environmentalists and outdoor enthusiasts, the Bureau tried to induce the ranch\xe2\x80\x99s previous owner, George Nelson, to grant an easement for public use over South Fork Owl Creek Road, which runs through the ranch and serves as a main route to the upper Rock Creek area.  For a while, Nelson refused from fear that the public would disrupt his guests\xe2\x80\x99 activities, but shortly after agreeing to sell the property to Robbins, in March 1994, Nelson signed a nonexclusive deed of easement giving the United States the right to use and maintain the road along a stretch of his property.  In return, the Bureau agreed to rent Nelson a right-of-way to maintain a different section of the road as it runs across federal property and connects otherwise isolated parts of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s holdings.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 1994, Nelson conveyed the ranch to Robbins, who continued to graze cattle and run guest cattle drives in reliance on grazing permits and a Special Recreation Use Permit (SRUP) issued by the Bureau.  But Robbins knew nothing about Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s grant of the easement across South Fork Owl Creek Road, which the Bureau had failed to record, and upon recording his warranty deed in Hot Springs County, Robbins took title to the ranch free of the easement, by operation of Wyoming law.  See Wyo. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa734\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x93120 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s employee Joseph Vessels[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] discovered, in June 1994, that the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s inaction had cost it the easement, he telephoned Robbins and demanded an easement to replace Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s.  Robbins refused but indicated he would consider granting one in return for something.  In a later meeting, Vessels allegedly told Robbins that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Federal Government does not negotiate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and talks broke down.  Brief for Respondent 5.  Robbins says that over the next several years the defendant-petitioners (hereinafter defendants), who are current and former employees of the Bureau, carried on a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at forcing him to regrant the lost easement.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins concedes that any single one of the offensive and sometimes illegal actions by the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s officials might have been brushed aside as a small imposition, but says that in the aggregate the campaign against him amounted to coercion to extract the easement and should be redressed collectively.  The substance of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim, and the degree to which existing remedies available to him were adequate, can be understood and assessed only by getting down to the details, which add up to a long recitation.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the summer of 1994, after the fruitless telephone conversation in June, Vessels wrote to Robbins for permission to survey his land in the area of the desired easement.  Robbins said no, that it would be a waste of time for the Bureau to do a survey without first reaching agreement with him.  Vessels went ahead with a survey anyway, trespassed on Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s land, and later boasted about it to Robbins.  Not surprisingly, given the lack of damage to his property, Robbins did not file a trespass complaint in response.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mutual animosity grew, however, and one Bureau employee, Edward Parodi, was told by his superiors to \xe2\x80\x9clook closer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigate harder\xe2\x80\x9d for possible trespasses and other permit violations by Robbins.  App. 128\xe2\x80\x93129.  Parodi also heard colleagues make certain disparaging remarks about Robbins, such as referring to him as \xe2\x80\x9cthe rich SOB from Alabama [who] got [the Ranch].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 121.  Parodi became convinced that the Bureau had mistreated Robbins and described its conduct as \xe2\x80\x9cthe volcanic point\xe2\x80\x9d in his decision to retire.  <em>Id.,</em> at 133.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vessels and his supervisor, defendant Charles Wilkie, continued to demand the easement, under threat to cancel the reciprocal maintenance right-of-way that Nelson had negotiated.  When Robbins would not budge, the Bureau canceled the right-of-way, citing Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to grant the desired easement and failure even to pay the rental fee.  Robbins did not appeal the cancellation to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) or seek judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 1995, Robbins brought his cattle to a water source on property belonging to his neighbor, LaVonne Pennoyer.  An altercation ensued, and Pennoyer struck Robbins with her truck while he was riding a horse.  Plaintiff-Appellee\xe2\x80\x99s Supp. App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x938016 (CA10), pp. 676\xe2\x80\x93681 (hereinafter CA10 App.); Pl. Exh. 2, Record 164\xe2\x80\x93166; Pl. Exh. 35a, <em>id.,</em> at 102\xe2\x80\x93108.  Defendant Gene Leone fielded a call from Pennoyer regarding the incident, encouraged her to contact the sheriff, and himself placed calls to the sheriff suggesting that Robbins be charged with trespass.  After the incident, Parodi claims that Leone told him: \xe2\x80\x9cI think I finally got a way to get [Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s] permits and get him out of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 125, 126.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In October 1995, the Bureau claimed various permit violations and changed the High Island Ranch\xe2\x80\x99s 5-year SRUP to a SRUP subject to annual renewal.  According to Robbins, losing the 5-year SRUP disrupted his guest ranching business, owing to the resulting uncertainty about permission to conduct cattle drives.  Robbins declined to seek administrative review, however, in part because Bureau officials told him that the process would be lengthy and that his permit would be suspended until the IBLA reached a decision.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beginning in 1996, defendants brought administrative charges against Robbins for trespass and other land-use violations.  Robbins claimed some charges were false,\nand others unfairly selective enforcement, and he took\nall of them to be an effort to retaliate for refusing the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s continuing demands for the easement.  He contested a number of these charges, but not all of them, administratively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the spring of 1997, the South Fork Owl Creek Road, the only way to reach the portions of the ranch in the Rock Creek area, became impassable.  When the Bureau refused to repair the section of road across federal land, Robbins took matters into his own hands and fixed the public road himself, even though the Bureau had refused permission.  The Bureau fined Robbins for trespass, but offered to settle the charge and entertain an application to renew the old maintenance right-of-way.  Instead, Robbins appealed to the IBLA, which found that Robbins had admitted the unauthorized repairs when he sent the Bureau a bill for reimbursement.  The Board upheld the fine, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Robbins</em>, 146 I.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0A. 213 (1998), and rejected Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the Bureau was trying to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98blackmail\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d him into providing the easement; it said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record effectively shows \xe2\x80\xa6 intransigence was the tactic of Robbins, not [the] BLM.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 219.  Robbins did not seek judicial review of the IBLA\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 1997, defendant Teryl Shryack and a colleague entered Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s property, claiming the terms of a fence easement as authority.  Robbins accused Shryack of unlawful entry, tore up the written instrument, and ordered her off his property.  Later that month, after a meeting about trespass issues with Bureau officials, Michael Miller, a Bureau law enforcement officer, questioned Robbins without advance notice and without counsel about the incident with Shryack.  The upshot was a charge with two counts of knowingly and forcibly impeding and interfering with a federal employee, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7111 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), a crime with a penalty of up to one year in prison.  A jury acquitted Robbins in December, after deliberating less than 30 minutes.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, 179 F.\xc2\xa03d 1268, 1269 (CA10 1999).  According to a news story, the jurors \xe2\x80\x9cwere appalled at the actions of the government\xe2\x80\x9d and one said that \xe2\x80\x9cRobbins could not have been railroaded any worse \xe2\x80\xa6 if he worked for the Union Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA10 App. 852.  Robbins then moved for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under the Hyde Amendment, \xc2\xa7617, 111 Stat. 2519, note following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73600A, arguing that the position of the United States was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.  The trial judge denied the motion, and Robbins appealed too late.  See 179 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1269\xe2\x80\x931270.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998, Robbins brought the lawsuit now before us, though there was further vexation to come.  In June 1999, the Bureau denied Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s application to renew his annual SRUP, based on an accumulation of land-use penalties levied against him.  Robbins appealed, the IBLA affirmed, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Robbins, </em>154 I.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0A. 93 (2000), and Robbins did not seek judicial review.  Then, in August, the Bureau revoked the grazing permit for High Island Ranch, claiming that Robbins had violated its terms when he kept Bureau officials from passing over his property to reach public lands.  Robbins appealed to the IBLA, which stayed the revocation pending resolution of the appeal.  Order in <em>Robbins</em> v. <em>Bureau of Land Management</em>, IBLA 2000\xe2\x80\x9312 (Nov. 10, 1999), CA10 App. 1020.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The stay held for several years, despite periodic friction.  Without a SRUP, Robbins was forced to redirect his guest cattle drives away from federal land and through a mountain pass with unmarked property boundaries.  In August 2000, Vessels and defendants Darrell Barnes and Miller tried to catch Robbins trespassing in driving cattle over a corner of land administered by the Bureau.  From a nearby hilltop, they videotaped ranch guests during the drive, even while the guests sought privacy to relieve themselves.  That afternoon, Robbins alleges, Barnes and Miller broke into his guest lodge, left trash inside, and departed without closing the lodge gates.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next summer, defendant David Wallace spoke with Preston Smith, an employee of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who manages lands along the High Island Ranch\xe2\x80\x99s southern border, and pressured him to impound Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s cattle.  Smith told Robbins, but did nothing more.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in January 2003, tension actually cooled to the point that Robbins and the Bureau entered into a settlement agreement that, among other things, established a procedure for informal resolution of future grazing disputes and stayed 16 pending administrative appeals with a view to their ultimate dismissal, provided that Robbins did not violate certain Bureau regulations for a 2-year period.  The settlement came apart, however, in January 2004, when the Bureau began formal trespass proceedings against Robbins and unilaterally voided the settlement agreement.  Robbins tried to enforce the agreement in federal court, but a district court denied relief in a decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals in February 2006.  <em>Robbins</em> v. <em>Bureau of Land Management</em>, 438 F.\xc2\xa03d 1074 (CA10).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this lawsuit (brought, as we said, in 1998), Robbins asks for compensatory and punitive damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.  Although he originally included the United States as a defendant, he voluntarily dismissed the Government, and pressed forward with a RICO claim charging defendants with repeatedly trying to extort an easement from him, as well as a similarly grounded <em>Bivens</em> claim that defendants violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity and failure to state a claim, which the District Court granted, holding that Robbins inadequately pleaded damages under RICO and that the APA and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346, were effective alternative remedies that precluded <em>Bivens</em> relief.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed on both grounds, 300 F.\xc2\xa03d 1208, 1211 (2002), although it specified that <em>Bivens</em> relief was available only for those \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional violations committed by individual federal employees unrelated to final agency action,\xe2\x80\x9d 300 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1212.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, defendants again moved to dismiss on qualified immunity.  As to the RICO claim, the District Court denied the motion; as to <em>Bivens</em>, it dismissed what Robbins called the Fourth Amendment claim for malicious prosecution and those under the Fifth Amendment for due process violations, but it declined to dismiss the Fifth Amendment claim of retaliation for the exercise of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s right to exclude the Government from his property and to refuse any grant of a property interest without compensation.  After limited discovery, defendants again moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity.  The District Court adhered to its earlier denial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This time, the Court of Appeals affirmed, after dealing with collateral order jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal of the denial of qualified immunity, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 755, 761 (2006) (citing <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 530 (1985)).  It held that Robbins had a clearly established right to be free from retaliation for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to exclude the Government from his private property, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 765\xe2\x80\x93767, and it explained that Robbins could go forward with the RICO claim because Government employees who \xe2\x80\x9cengag[e] in lawful actions with an intent to extort a right-of-way from [a landowner] rather than with an intent to merely carry out their regulatory duties\xe2\x80\x9d commit extortion under Wyoming law and within the meaning of the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951.  433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 768.  The Court of Appeals rejected the defense based on a claim of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legal entitlement to demand the disputed easement: \xe2\x80\x9cif an official obtains property that he has lawful authority to obtain, but does so in a wrongful manner, his conduct constitutes extortion under the Hobbs Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 769.  Finally, the Court of Appeals said again that \xe2\x80\x9cRobbins\xe2\x80\x99[s] allegations involving individual action unrelated to final agency action are permitted under <em>Bivens.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 772.  The appeals court declined defendants\xe2\x80\x99 request \xe2\x80\x9cto determine which allegations remain and which are precluded,\xe2\x80\x9d however, because defendants had not asked the District Court to sort them out.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2006), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first question is whether to devise a new <em>Bivens</em> damages action for retaliating against the exercise of ownership rights, in addition to the discrete administrative and judicial remedies available to a landowner like Robbins in dealing with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s employees.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Bivens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html"></a><a href="/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, held that the victim of a Fourth Amendment violation by federal officers had a claim for damages, and in the years following we have recognized two more nonstatutory damages remedies, the first for employment discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Passman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/index.html">442 U. S. 228</a> (1979), and the second for an Eighth Amendment violation by prison officials, <em>Carlson</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/14/index.html">446 U. S. 14</a> (1980).  But we have also held that any freestanding damages remedy for a claimed constitutional violation has to represent a judgment about the best way to implement a constitutional guarantee; it is not an automatic entitlement no matter what other means there may be to vindicate a protected interest, and in most instances we have found a <em>Bivens</em> remedy unjustified.  We have accordingly held against applying the <em>Bivens</em> model to claims of First Amendment violations by federal employers, <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Lucas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/367/index.html">462 U. S. 367</a> (1983), harm to military personnel through activity incident to service, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stanley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/index.html">483 U.

We have seen no case for extending <em>Bivens</em> to claims against federal agencies, <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a> (1994), or against private prisons, <em>Correctional Services Corp.</em> v. <em>Malesko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/61/index.html">534 U. S. 61</a> (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever the ultimate conclusion, however, our consideration of a <em>Bivens</em> request follows a familiar sequence, and on the assumption that a constitutionally recognized interest is adversely affected by the actions of federal employees, the decision whether to recognize a <em>Bivens </em>remedy may require two steps.  In the first place, there is the question whether any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.  <em>Bush</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 378.  But even in the absence of an alternative, a <em>Bivens</em> remedy is a subject of judgment: \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed, however, to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bush, supra, </em>at 378.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this factually plentiful case, assessing the significance of any alternative remedies at step one has to begin by categorizing the difficulties Robbins experienced in dealing with the Bureau.  We think they can be separated into four main groups: torts or tort-like injuries inflicted on him, charges brought against him, unfavorable agency actions, and offensive behavior by Bureau employees falling outside those three categories.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tortious harm inflicted on him includes Vessels\xe2\x80\x99s unauthorized survey of the terrain of the desired easement and the illegal entry into the lodge, and in each instance, Robbins had a civil remedy in damages for trespass.  Understandably, he brought no such action after learning about the survey, which was doubtless annoying but not physically damaging.  For the incident at the lodge, he chose not to pursue a tort remedy, though there is no question that one was available to him if he could prove his allegations.  Cf. <em>Correctional Services Corp.,</em> <em>supra, </em>at 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (considering availability of state tort remedies in refusing to recognize a <em>Bivens</em> remedy).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The charges brought against Robbins include a series of administrative claims for trespass and other land-use violations, a fine for the unauthorized road repair in 1997, and the two criminal charges that same year.  Robbins had the opportunity to contest all of the administrative charges; he did fight some (but not all) of the various land-use and trespass citations, and he challenged the road repair fine as far as the IBLA, though he did not take advantage of judicial review when he lost in that tribunal.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  He exercised his right to jury trial on the criminal complaints, and although the rapid acquittal tended to support his charge of baseless action by the prosecution (egged on by Bureau employees), the federal judge who presided at the trial did not think the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case thin enough to justify awarding attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from that decision was late.  See <em>Robbins</em>, 179 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1269\xe2\x80\x931270.  The trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s denial of fees may reflect facts that dissuaded Robbins from bringing a state-law action for malicious prosecution, though it is also possible that a remedy would have been unavailable against federal officials, see <em>Blake</em> v. <em>Rupe</em>, 651 P.\xc2\xa02d 1096, 1107 (Wyo. 1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cMalicious prosecution is not an action available against a law enforcement official\xe2\x80\x9d)<em>.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</em>  For each charge, in any event, Robbins had some procedure to defend and make good on his position.  He took advantage of some opportunities, and let others pass; although he had mixed success, he had the means to be heard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more conventional agency action included the 1995 cancellation of the right-of-way in Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s favor (originally given in return for the unrecorded easement for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s benefit); the 1995 decision to reduce the SRUP from five years to one; the termination of the SRUP in 1999; and the revocation of the grazing permit that same year.  Each time, the Bureau claimed that Robbins was at fault, and for each claim, administrative review was available, subject to ultimate judicial review under the APA.  Robbins took no appeal from the 1995 decisions, stopped after losing an IBLA appeal of the SRUP denial, and obtained a stay from the IBLA of the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s revocation of the grazing permit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three events elude classification.  The 1995 incident in which Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s horse was struck primarily involved Robbins and his neighbor, not the Bureau, and the sheriff never brought criminal charges.  The videotaping of ranch guests during the 2000 drive, while no doubt thoroughly irritating and bad for business, may not have been unlawful, depending, among other things, upon the location on public or private land of the people photographed.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7652B (1976) (defining tort of intrusion upon seclusion).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Even if a tort was committed, it is unclear whether Robbins, rather than his guests, would be the proper plaintiff, or whether the tort should be chargeable against the Government (as distinct from employees) under the FTCA, cf. <em>Carlson,</em> 446 U. S., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (holding that FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>remedies were \xe2\x80\x9cparallel, complementary causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d and that the availability of the former did not preempt the latter).  The significance of Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 attempt to pressure Smith into impounding Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s cattle is likewise up in the air.  The legitimacy of any impoundment that might have occurred would presumably have depended on where particular cattle were on the patchwork of private and public lands, and in any event, Smith never impounded any.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Robbins has an administrative, and ultimately a judicial, process for vindicating virtually all of his complaints.  He suffered no charges of wrongdoing on his own part without an opportunity to defend himself (and, in the case of the criminal charges, to recoup the consequent expense, though a judge found his claim wanting).  And final agency action, as in canceling permits, for example, was open to administrative and judicial review, as the Court of Appeals realized, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 772.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This state of the law gives Robbins no intuitively meritorious case for recognizing a new constitutional cause of action, but neither does it plainly answer no to the question whether he should have it.  Like the combination of public and private land ownership around the ranch, the forums of defense and redress open to Robbins are a patchwork, an assemblage of state and federal, administrative and judicial benches applying regulations, statutes and common law rules.  It would be hard to infer that Congress expected the Judiciary to stay its <em>Bivens</em> hand, but equally hard to extract any clear lesson that <em>Bivens </em>ought to spawn a new claim.  Compare <em>Bush,</em> 462 U. S., at 388 (refusing to create a <em>Bivens </em>remedy when faced with \xe2\x80\x9can elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations\xe2\x80\x9d); and <em>Schweiker,</em> 487 U. S., at 426 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress chose specific forms and levels of protection for the rights of persons affected\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Bivens</em>, 403 U. S., at 397 (finding \xe2\x80\x9cno explicit congressional declaration that persons injured [in this way] may not recover money damages from the agents, but must instead be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in the view of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This, then, is a case for <em>Bivens</em> step two, for weighing reasons for and against the creation of a new cause of action, the way common law judges have always done.  See <em>Bush</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 378.  Here, the competing arguments boil down to one on a side: from Robbins, the inadequacy of discrete, incident-by-incident remedies; and from the Government and its employees, the difficulty of defining limits to legitimate zeal on the public\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in situations where hard bargaining is to be expected in the back-and-forth between public and private interests that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s employees engage in every day.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we said, when the incidents are examined one by one, Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s situation does not call for creating a constitutional cause of action for want of other means of vindication, so he is unlike the plaintiffs in cases recognizing freestanding claims: Davis had no other remedy, Bivens himself was not thought to have an effective one, and in <em>Carlson</em> the plaintiff had none against Government officials.  <em>Davis</em>, 442 U. S., at 245 (\xe2\x80\x9cFor Davis, as for Bivens, \xe2\x80\x98it is damages or nothing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Bivens</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment))); <em>Carlson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 23 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e cannot hold that Congress relegated respondent exclusively to the FTCA remedy\xe2\x80\x9d against the Government).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s argument for a remedy that looks at the course of dealing as a whole, not simply as so many individual incidents, has the force of the metaphor Robbins invokes, \xe2\x80\x9cdeath by a thousand cuts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 40.  It is one thing to be threatened with the loss of grazing rights, or to be prosecuted, or to have one\xe2\x80\x99s lodge broken into, but something else to be subjected to this in combination over a period of six years, by a series of public officials bent on making life difficult.  Agency appeals, lawsuits, and criminal defense take money, and endless battling depletes the spirit along with the purse.  The whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other side of the ledger there is a difficulty in defining a workable cause of action.  Robbins describes the wrong here as retaliation for standing on his right as a property owner to keep the Government out (by refusing a free replacement for the right-of-way it had lost), and the mention of retaliation brings with it a tailwind of support from our longstanding recognition that the Government may not retaliate for exercising First Amendment speech rights, see <em>Rankin</em> v. <em>McPherson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/378/index.html">483 U. S. 378</a> (1987), or certain others of constitutional rank, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lefkowitz</em> v. <em>Turley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/index.html">414 U. S. 70</a> (1973) (Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/index.html">390 U. S. 570</a> (1968) (Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But on closer look, the claim against the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s employees fails to fit the prior retaliation cases.  Those cases turn on an allegation of impermissible purpose and motivation; an employee who spoke out on matters of public concern and then was fired, for example, would need to \xe2\x80\x9cprove that the conduct at issue was constitutionally protected, and that it was a substantial or motivating factor in the termination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs, Wabaunsee Cty.</em> v. <em>Umbehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/668/index.html">518 U. S. 668</a>, 675 (1996).  In its defense, the Government may respond that the firing had nothing to do with the protected speech, or that \xe2\x80\x9cit would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In short, the outcome turns on \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d questions: what was the Government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in firing him and would he have been fired anyway?  Questions like these have definite answers, and we have established methods for identifying the presence of an illicit reason (in competition with others), not only in retaliation cases but on claims of discrimination based on race or other characteristics.  See <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a> (1973).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But a <em>Bivens</em> case by Robbins could not be resolved merely by answering a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d question or two.  All agree that the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s employees intended to convince Robbins to grant an easement.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  But unlike punishing someone for speaking out against the Government, trying to induce someone to grant an easement for public use is a perfectly legitimate purpose: as a landowner, the Government may have, and in this instance does have, a valid interest in getting access to neighboring lands.  The \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d question thus has a ready answer in terms of lawful conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s challenge, therefore, is not to the object the Government seeks to achieve, and for the most part his argument is not that the means the Government used were necessarily illegitimate; rather, he says that defendants simply demanded too much and went too far.  But as soon as Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim is framed this way, the line-drawing difficulties it creates are immediately apparent.  A \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d kind of liability standard (if standard at all) can never be as reliable a guide to conduct and to any subsequent liability as a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d standard, and that reason counts against recognizing freestanding liability in a case like this.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The impossibility of fitting Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim into the simple \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d framework is demonstrated, repeatedly, by recalling the various actions he complains about.  Most of them, such as strictly enforcing rules against trespass or conditions on grazing permits, are legitimate tactics designed to improve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating position.  Just as a private landowner, when frustrated at a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s stubbornness in refusing an easement, may press charges of trespass every time a cow wanders across the property line or call the authorities to report every land-use violation, the Government too may stand firm on its rights and use its power to protect public property interests.  Though Robbins protests that the Government was trying to extract the easement for free instead of negotiating, that line is slippery even in this case; the Government was not offering to buy the easement, but it did have valuable things to offer in exchange, like continued permission for Robbins to use Government land on favorable terms (at least to the degree that the terms of a permit were subject to discretion).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the Government is no ordinary landowner, with its immense economic power, its role as trustee for the public, its right to cater to particular segments of the public (like the recreational users who would take advantage of the right-of-way to get to remote tracts), and its wide discretion to bring enforcement actions.  But in many ways, the Government deals with its neighbors as one owner among the rest (albeit a powerful one).  Each may seek benefits from the others, and each may refuse to deal with the others by insisting on valuable consideration for anything in return.  And as a potential contracting party, each neighbor is entitled to drive a hard bargain, as even Robbins acknowledges, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  That, after all, is what Robbins did by flatly refusing to regrant the easement without further recompense, and that is what the defendant employees did on behalf of the Government.  So long as they had authority to withhold or withdraw permission to use Government land and to enforce the trespass and land-use rules (as the IBLA confirmed that they did have at least most of the time), they were within their rights to make it plain that Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to give the easement would determine how complaisant they would be about his trespasses on public land, when they had discretion to enforce the law to the letter.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins does make a few allegations, like the unauthorized survey and the unlawful entry into the lodge, that charge defendants with illegal action plainly going beyond hard bargaining.  If those were the only coercive acts charged, Robbins could avoid the \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d problem by fairly describing the Government behavior alleged as illegality in attempting to obtain a property interest for nothing, but that is not a fair summary of the body of allegations before us, according to which defendants\xe2\x80\x99 improper exercise of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory powers\xe2\x80\x9d is essential to the claim.  Brief for Respondent 21.  (Of course, even in that simpler case, the tort or torts by Government employees would be so clearly actionable under the general law that it would furnish only the weakest argument for recognizing a generally available constitutional tort.)  Rather, the bulk of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s charges go to actions that, on their own, fall within the Government\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would not answer the concerns just expressed to change conceptual gears and consider the more abstract concept of liability for retaliatory or undue pressure on a property owner for standing firm on property rights; looking at the claim that way would not eliminate the problem of degree, and it would raise a further reason to balk at recognizing a <em>Bivens</em> claim.  For at this high level of generality, a <em>Bivens</em> action to redress retaliation against those who resist Government impositions on their property rights would invite claims in every sphere of legitimate governmental action affecting property interests, from negotiating tax claim settlements to enforcing Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.  Exercising any governmental authority affecting the value or enjoyment of property interests would fall within the <em>Bivens</em> regime, and across this enormous swath of potential litigation would hover the difficulty of devising a \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d standard that could guide an employee\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and a judicial factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point here is not to deny that Government employees sometimes overreach, for of course they do, and they may have done so here if all the allegations are true.  The point is the reasonable fear that a general <em>Bivens</em> cure would be worse than the disease.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, defendants were acting in the name of the Bureau, which had the authority to grant (and had given) Robbins some use of public lands under its control and wanted a right-of-way in return.  Defendants bargained hard by capitalizing on their discretionary authority and Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s violations of various permit terms, though truculence was apparent on both sides.  One of the defendants, at least, clearly crossed the line into impermissible conduct in breaking into Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, although it is not clear from the record that any other action by defendants was more serious than garden-variety trespass, and the Government has successfully defended every decision to eliminate Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s permission to use public lands in the ways he had previously enjoyed.  Robbins had ready at hand a wide variety of administrative and judicial remedies to redress his injuries.  The proposal, nonetheless, to create a new <em>Bivens</em> remedy to redress such injuries collectively on a theory of retaliation for exercising his property right to exclude, or on a general theory of unjustifiably burdening his rights as a property owner, raises a serious difficulty of devising a workable cause of action.  A judicial standard to identify illegitimate pressure going beyond legitimately hard bargaining would be endlessly knotty to work out, and a general provision for tortlike liability when Government employees are unduly zealous in pressing a governmental interest affecting property would invite an onslaught of <em>Bivens</em> actions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think accordingly that any damages remedy for actions by Government employees who push too hard for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s benefit may come better, if at all, through legislation.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is in a far better position than a court to evaluate the impact of a new species of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d against those who act on the public\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  <em>Bush</em>, 462 U. S., at 389.  And Congress can tailor any remedy to the problem perceived, thus lessening the risk of raising a tide of suits threatening legitimate initiative on the part of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s employees.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[Congress] may inform itself through factfinding procedures such as hearings that are not available to the courts\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 814 (1982) (recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger that fear of being sued will dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible public officials, in the unflinching discharge of their duties\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s other claim is under RICO, which gives civil remedies to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71962].\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71964(c).  Section 1962(c) makes it a crime for \xe2\x80\x9cany person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  RICO defines \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany act which is indictable under\xe2\x80\x9d the Hobbs Act as well as \xe2\x80\x9cany act or threat involving \xe2\x80\xa6 extortion \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71961(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  The Hobbs Act, finally, criminalizes interference with interstate commerce by extortion, along with attempts or conspiracies, \xc2\xa71951(a), extortion being defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins charges defendants with violating the Hobbs Act by wrongfully trying to get the easement under color of official right, to which defendants reply with a call to dismiss the RICO claim for two independent reasons: the Hobbs Act does not apply when the National Government is the intended beneficiary of the allegedly extortionate acts; and a valid claim of entitlement to the disputed property is a complete defense against extortion.  Because we agree with the first contention, we do not reach the second.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hobbs Act does not speak explicitly to efforts to obtain property for the Government rather than a private party, and that leaves defendants\xe2\x80\x99 contention to turn on the common law conception of \xe2\x80\x9cextortion,\xe2\x80\x9d which we presume Congress meant to incorporate when it passed the Hobbs Act in 1946.  See <em>Scheidler</em> v. <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/393/index.html">537 U. S. 393</a>, 402 (2003) (construing the term \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d in the Hobbs Act by reference to its common law meaning); <em>Evans</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/255/index.html">504 U.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 141 (1769), and citing 3 R. Anderson, Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Law and Procedure \xc2\xa71393, pp.\xc2\xa0790\xe2\x80\x93791 (1957); internal quotation marks omitted).  In short, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xtortion by the public official was the rough equivalent of what we would now describe as \xe2\x80\x98taking a bribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Evans</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 260.  Thus, while Robbins is certainly correct that public officials were not immune from charges of extortion at common law, see Brief for Respondent 43, the crime of extortion focused on the harm of public corruption, by the sale of public favors for private gain, not on the harm caused by overzealous efforts to obtain property on behalf of the Government.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The importance of the line between public and private beneficiaries for common law and Hobbs Act extortion is confirmed by our own case law, which is completely barren of an example of extortion under color of official right undertaken for the sole benefit of the Government.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McCormick</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/257/index.html">500 U. S. 257</a>, 273 (1991) (discussing circumstances in which public official\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of campaign contributions constitutes extortion under color of official right); <em>Evans</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 257 (Hobbs Act prosecution for extortion under color of official right, where public official accepted cash in exchange for favorable votes on a rezoning application); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gillock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/360/index.html">445 U. S. 360</a>, 362 (1980) (Hobbs Act prosecution for extortion under color of official right, where state senator accepted money in exchange for blocking a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s extradition and agreeing to introduce legislation); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Deaver</em>, 14 F. 595, 597 (WDNC 1882) (under the \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical meaning [of extortion] in the common law, \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he officer must unlawfully and corruptly receive such money or article of value for<em> his own benefit </em>or <em>advantage</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  More tellingly even, Robbins has cited no decision by any court, much less this one, from the entire 60-year period of the Hobbs Act that found extortion in efforts of Government employees to get property for the exclusive benefit of the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, there is usually a case somewhere that provides comfort for just about any claim.  Robbins musters two for his understanding of extortion under color of official right, neither of which, however, addressed the beneficiary question with any care: <em>People</em> v. <em>Whaley</em>, 6 Cow. 661 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. 1827), and <em>Willett</em> v. <em>Devoy</em>, 170 App. Div. 203, 155 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 920 (1915).  <em>Whaley</em> was about a charge of extortion against a justice of the peace who wrongfully ordered a litigant to pay compensation to the other party as well as a small administrative fee to the court.  Because the case involved illegally obtaining property for the benefit of a private third party, it does not stand for the proposition that an act for the benefit of the Government alone can be extortion.  The second case, <em>Willett</em>, again from New York, construed a provision of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Public Officers Law.  That statute addressed the problem of overcharging by public officers, see Birdseye\xe2\x80\x99s Consol. Laws of N.\xc2\xa0Y. Ann. \xc2\xa767, p.\xc2\xa04640 (1909), and the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on it said that common law extortion did not draw any distinction \xe2\x80\x9con the ground that the official keeps the fee himself,\xe2\x80\x9d 170 App. Div., at 204, 155 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S., at 921.  But a single, two-page opinion from a state intermediate appellate court issued in 1915 is not much indication that the Hobbs Act was adopted in 1946 subject to the understanding that common law extortion was spacious enough to cover the case Robbins states.  There is a reason he is plumbing obscurity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins points to what we said in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/415/index.html">350 U. S. 415</a>, 420 (1956), that \xe2\x80\x9cextortion as defined in the [Hobbs Act] in no way depends upon having a direct benefit conferred on the person who obtains the property.\xe2\x80\x9d  He infers that Congress could not have meant to prohibit extortionate acts in the interest of private entities like unions, but ignore them when the intended beneficiary is the Government.  See Brief for Respondent 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  But Congress could very well have meant just that; drawing a line between private and public beneficiaries prevents suits (not just recoveries) against public officers whose jobs are to obtain property owed to the Government.  So, without some other indication from Congress, it is not reasonable to assume that the Hobbs Act (let alone RICO) was intended to expose all federal employees, whether in the Bureau of Land Management, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), or any other agency, to extortion charges whenever they stretch in trying to enforce Government property claims.  See <em>Sinclair</em> v. <em>Hawke</em>, 314 F.\xc2\xa03d 934, 944 (CA8 2003) (OCC employees \xe2\x80\x9cdo not become racketeers by acting like aggressive regulators\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we just suggested, Robbins does not face up to the real problem when he says that requiring proof of a wrongful intent to extort would shield well-intentioned Government employees from liability.  It is not just final judgments, but the fear of criminal charges or civil claims for treble damages that could well take the starch out of regulators who are supposed to bargain and press demands vigorously on behalf of the Government and the public.  This is the reason we would want to see some text in the Hobbs Act before we could say that Congress meant to go beyond the common law preoccupation with official corruption, to embrace the expansive notion of extortion Robbins urges on us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He falls back to the argument that defendants violated Wyoming\xe2\x80\x99s blackmail statute, see Wyo. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93402 (1977\xe2\x80\x932005),[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] which he says is a separate predicate offense for purposes of RICO liability.  But even assuming that defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct would be \xe2\x80\x9cchargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71961(1)(A), it cannot qualify as a predicate offense for a RICO suit unless it is \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being generically classified as extortionate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Scheidler</em>, 537 U. S.,<em> </em>at<em> </em>409, 410; accord, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nardello</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/286/index.html">393 U. S. 286</a>, 296 (1969).  For the reasons just given, the conduct alleged does not fit the traditional definition of extortion, so Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s RICO claim does not survive on a theory of state-law derivation.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because neither <em>Bivens</em> nor RICO gives Robbins a cause of action, there is no reason to enquire further into the merits of his claim or the asserted defense of qualified immunity.

It thus appears that even if a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d question could be imported into this case, Robbins could not obtain relief without also satisfying an unspecified, and unworkable, \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d standard.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg says we mistakenly fail to see that Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim presents only a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d question: did defendants take the various actions against Robbins in retaliation for refusing to grant the desired right of way <em>gratis</em> (or simply out of malice prompted by Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s refusal and their own embarrassment after forgetting to record the Nelson grant)?  But seeing the case as raising only a traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for\xe2\x80\x9d question gives short shrift to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to bargain hard in a continuing contest.</p>\n<p>\n\nIn the standard retaliation case recognized in our precedent, the plaintiff has performed some discrete act in the past, typically saying something that irritates the defendant official; the question is whether the official\xe2\x80\x99s later action against the plaintiff was taken for a legitimate purpose (firing to rid the workforce of a substandard performer, for example) or for the purpose of punishing for the exercise of a constitutional right (that is, retaliation, probably motivated by spite).  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s action is over and done with, and the only question is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, which may be maliciously motivated.</p>\n<p>\n\nIn this case, however, the past act or acts (refusing the right-of-way without compensation) are simply particular steps in an ongoing refusal to grant requests for a right-of-way.  The purpose of the continuing requests is lawful (the Government still could use the right-of-way) and there are actions the Government may lawfully take to induce or coerce Robbins to end his refusal (presumably like canceling the non-permanent reciprocal right-of-way originally given to Nelson).  The action claimed to be retaliatory may gratify malice in the heart of the official who takes it, but the official act remains an instance of hard bargaining intended to induce the plaintiff to come to legitimate terms.  We do not understand Robbins to contend that malice alone, as distinguished from malice combined with the desire to acquire an easement, caused defendants to act the way they did.  See Brief for Respondent 21 (accusing defendants of \xe2\x80\x9cusing their regulatory powers to harass, punish, and coerce a private citizen into giving the Government his property without payment\xe2\x80\x9d); but cf. <em>post</em>, at 12, n. 3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Their cause, if they had one, is nothing to them now; They hate for hate\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting There Will Be No Peace, reprinted in W. H. Auden: Collected Poems 615 (2007) (E. Mendelson ed.))).  Thus, we are not dealing with one discrete act by a plaintiff and one discrete (possibly retaliatory) act by a defendant, the purpose of which is in question.  Instead we are confronting a continuing process in which each side has a legitimate purpose in taking action contrary to the other\xe2\x80\x99s interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetaliation\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be classed as a basis of liability here, then, except on one or the other of two assumptions.  The first is that the antagonistic acts by the officials extend beyond the scope of acceptable means for accomplishing the legitimate purpose; the acts go beyond hard bargaining on behalf of the Government (whatever spite may lurk in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s heart).  They are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much.\xe2\x80\x9d  The second assumption is that the presence of malice or spite in an official\xe2\x80\x99s heart renders any action unconstitutionally retaliatory, even if it would otherwise have been done in the name of legitimate hard bargaining.  The motive-is-all test is not the law of our retaliation precedent.  If a spiteful heart rendered any official efforts actionable as unconstitutional retaliation, our retaliation discharge cases would have asked not only whether the plaintiff was fired for cause (and would have been fired for cause anyway), but whether the official who discharged the plaintiff tainted any legitimate purpose with spitefulness in firing this particular, outspoken critic.  But we have taken no such position; to the contrary, we have held that proof that the action was independently justified on grounds other than the improper one defeats the claim.  See <em>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Doyle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/index.html">429 U. S. 274</a>, 287 (1977).  Any other approach would have frustrated an employer\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in securing a competent workforce (comparable to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest as a landowner here), and would have introduced the complication of proving motive even in cases in which the action taken was plainly legitimate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since Justice Ginsburg disclaims the second alternative, <em>post</em> at 13, n.\xc2\xa06, the acts of spite and ill-will that she emphasizes will necessarily count in a \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d calculation.  </p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg points out that apprehension of many lawsuits is not a good reason to refrain from creating a <em>Bivens</em> action.  <em>Post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 15.

We ground our judgment on the elusiveness of a limiting principle for Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s claim, not on the potential popularity of a claim that could be well defined.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the legislative history of the Hobbs Act is generally \xe2\x80\x9csparse and unilluminating with respect to the offense of extortion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Evans</em>, 504 U.

In borrowing from these sources, the Hobbs Act expanded the scope of common law extortion to include private perpetrators while retaining the core idea of extortion as a species of corruption, akin to bribery.

They failed to record an easement obtained for the United States along a stretch of land on the privately owned High Island Ranch.  Plaintiff-respondent Frank Robbins purchased the ranch knowing nothing about the easement granted by the prior owner.  Under Wyoming law, Robbins took title to the land free of the easement.  BLM officials, realizing their mistake, demanded from Robbins an easement\xe2\x80\x94for which they did not propose to pay\xe2\x80\x94to replace the one they carelessly lost.  Their demand, one of them told Robbins, was nonnegotiable.  Robbins was directed to provide the easement, or else.  When he declined to follow that instruction, the BLM officials mounted a seven-year campaign of relentless harassment and intimidation to force Robbins to give in.  They refused to maintain the road providing access to the ranch, trespassed on Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 property, brought unfounded criminal charges against him, canceled his special recreational use permit and grazing privileges, interfered with his business operations, and invaded the privacy of his ranch guests on cattle drives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins commenced this lawsuit to end the incessant harassment and intimidation he endured.  He asserted that the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Takings Clause forbids government action calculated to acquire private property coercively and cost-free.  He further urged that federal officials dishonor their constitutional obligation when they act in retaliation for the property owner\xe2\x80\x99s resistance to an uncompensated taking.  In support of his claim for relief, Robbins relied on <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html"></a><a href="/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971).  The Court recognizes that the \xe2\x80\x9cremedy\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Government would confine Robbins\xe2\x80\x94a discrete challenge to each offending action as it occurs\xe2\x80\x94is inadequate.  A remedy so limited would expose Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 business to \xe2\x80\x9cdeath by a thousand cuts.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 15 (quoting Brief for Respondent 40).  Nevertheless, the Court rejects his claim, for it fears the consequences.  Allowing Robbins to pursue this suit, the Court maintains, would open the floodgates to a host of unworthy suits \xe2\x80\x9cin every sphere of legitimate governmental action affecting property interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this is no ordinary case of \xe2\x80\x9chard bargaining,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> or bureaucratic arrogance.  Robbins charged \xe2\x80\x9cvindictive action\xe2\x80\x9d to extract property from him without paying a fair price.  He complains of  a course of conduct animated by an illegitimate desire to \xe2\x80\x9cget him.\xe2\x80\x9d  That factor is sufficient to minimize the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern.  Cf. <em>Village of Willowbrook</em> v. <em>Olech</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/562/index.html">528 U. S. 562</a>, 565\xe2\x80\x93566 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring in result) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Taking Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 allegations as true, as the Court must at this stage of the litigation, the case presents this question: Does the Fifth Amendment provide an effective check on federal officers who abuse their regulatory powers by harassing and punishing property owners who refuse to surrender their property to the United States without fair compensation?  The answer should be a resounding \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges that, at this stage of proceedings, the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to Robbins.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa02.  The full force of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint, however, is not quite captured in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s restrained account of his allegations.  A more complete rendition of the saga that sparked this suit is in order.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Upon discovering that BLM had mistakenly allowed its easement across High Island Ranch to expire, BLM area manager Joseph Vessels contacted Robbins at his home in Alabama to demand that Robbins grant a new easement. Vessels was on shaky legal ground.  A federal regulation authorized BLM to require a landowner seeking a right-of-way across Government land to grant reciprocal access to his own land.  See 43 CFR \xc2\xa72801.1\xe2\x80\x932 (2004).  But Robbins never applied for a right-of-way across federal land (the prior owner did), and the Government cites no law or regulation commanding Robbins to grant a new easement to make up for BLM\xe2\x80\x99s neglect in losing the first one.  Robbins was unwilling to capitulate to unilateral demands, but told Vessels he would negotiate with BLM when he moved to Wyoming.  Vessels would have none of it: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Robbins.  Plaintiff-Appellee\xe2\x80\x99s Supp. App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x938016 (CA10), p.\xc2\xa0325 (hereinafter CA10 App.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Edward Parodi, a range technician in the BLM office, testified that from the very beginning, agency employees referred to Robbins as \xe2\x80\x9cthe rich SOB from Alabama [who] got [the Ranch].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 121.  Trouble started almost immediately.  Shortly after their first conversation, Vessels wrote Robbins to ask permission to survey his land, presumably to establish the contours of the easement.  Robbins refused, believing there was no need for a survey until an agreement had been reached.  Vessels conducted the survey anyway, and chuckled when he told Robbins of the trespass.  CA10 App. 325\xe2\x80\x93327.  At their first face-to-face meeting in Wyoming, Robbins bridled at the one-sided deal BLM proposed.  But Vessels was adamant: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federal Government does not negotiate,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.  <em>Id</em>., at 326.  Over time, Parodi reported, Vessels\xe2\x80\x99 attitude towards Robbins changed from \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9chostile,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cjust got worse and worse and worse.\xe2\x80\x9d App. 124.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other BLM employees shared Vessels\xe2\x80\x99 animosity.  In one notable instance, Robbins alleged, BLM agent Gene Leone provoked a violent encounter between Robbins and a neighboring landowner, LaVonne Pennoyer.  Leone knew Robbins was looking for a water source for his cattle, and he called Pennoyer to warn her to be on the lookout.  Robbins, unfamiliar with the territory and possibly misled by BLM, drove cattle onto Pennoyer\xe2\x80\x99s land to water at a creek.  Pennoyer showed up in her truck, yelling, blowing the horn, and bumping cows.  Realizing that he was on Pennoyer\xe2\x80\x99s land, Robbins started to push his cows out of her way, when Pennoyer revved her engine and drove her truck straight into the horse Robbins was riding.  <em>Id.,</em> at 49; CA10 App. 331\xe2\x80\x93332, 676\xe2\x80\x93681; Pl. Exh. 2, Record 164\xe2\x80\x93166; Pl. Exh. 35a, <em>id.,</em> at 102\xe2\x80\x93108.  According to Parodi, after the dustup, Leone boasted, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I finally got a way to get [Robbins\xe2\x80\x99] permits and get him out of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 125, 126.  Leone pressed the local sheriff to charge Robbins for his conduct in the encounter with Pennoyer, but the sheriff declined to do so.  CA10 App. 331\xe2\x80\x93332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Leone cited the Pennoyer incident as one ground, among others, to suspend Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 special recreation use permit.  That permit allowed Robbins to lead ranch guests on cattle drives, which were his primary source of revenue from the property.  App. 49.  BLM aimed at the cattle drives in other ways too.  Undermining the authenticity of the experience Robbins offered his guests, BLM employees followed along in trucks, videotaping participants.  The Government suggests that this surveillance was a legitimate way to document instances when Robbins crossed onto federal land without permission. The suggestion, however, hardly explains why, on one occasion, BLM employees videotaped several female guests who were seeking privacy so they could relieve themselves.  CA10 App. 506\xe2\x80\x93507.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As part of the campaign against Robbins, Parodi was instructed to \xe2\x80\x9clook closer\xe2\x80\x9d for trespass violations, to \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigate harder\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cif [he] could find anything, to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 129, 130. Parodi testified, in relation to the instructions he was given, that he did not have problems with Robbins: He never found a trespass violation he regarded as willful, and Robbins promptly addressed every concern Parodi raised.  <em>Id</em>., at 124, 127.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court maintains that the BLM employees \xe2\x80\x9cwere within their rights to make it plain that Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to give the easement would determine how complaisant they would be\xe2\x80\x9d about his infractions, but the record leaves doubt.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  Parodi testified that he was asked to \xe2\x80\x9cdo things [he] wasn\xe2\x80\x99t authorized [to do],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 124, and that Leone\xe2\x80\x99s projections about what BLM officers would do to Robbins exceeded \xe2\x80\x9cthe appropriate mission of the BLM,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 128.  About Vessels, Parodi said, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t has been my experience that people given authority and not being held in check and not having solid convictions will run amuck and that [is] what I saw happening.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 125.  Eventually, Parodi was moved to warn Robbins that, if he continued to defy BLM officials, \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be war, a long war and [BLM] would outlast him and outspend him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 132.  Parodi found BLM\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Robbins so disturbing that it became \xe2\x80\x9cthe volcanic point\xe2\x80\x9d in his decision to retire.  <em>Id</em>., at 133.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to go after somebody that is willfully busting the regulations and going out of their way to get something from the government,\xe2\x80\x9d Parodi said, but he saw Robbins only \xe2\x80\x9cas a man standing up for his property rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pl. Exh. 35C, Record 41.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The story thus far told is merely illustrative of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 allegations.  The record is replete with accounts of trespasses to Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 property, vindictive cancellations of his rights to access federal land, and unjustified or selective enforcement actions.  Indeed, BLM was not content with the arrows in its own quiver.  Robbins charged that BLM officials sought to enlist other federal agencies in their efforts to harass him.  In one troubling incident, a BLM employee, petitioner David Wallace, pressured a Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) manager to impound Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 cattle, asserting that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca bad character\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9csomething need[ed] to be done with [him].\xe2\x80\x9d  CA10 App. 359.  The manager rejected the request, observing that the BIA had no problems with Robbins.  <em>Ibid</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even more disconcerting, there was sufficient evidence, the District Court recognized, to support Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 allegation that BLM employees filed false criminal charges against him, claiming that he forcibly interfered with a federal officer.  Federal prosecutors took up the cause, but Robbins was acquitted by a jury in less than 30 minutes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A news account reported that the jurors \xe2\x80\x9cwere appalled at the actions of the government,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them commenting that \xe2\x80\x9cRobbins could not have been railroaded any worse \xe2\x80\xa6 if he worked for Union Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 852.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BLM\xe2\x80\x99s seven-year campaign of harassment had a devastating impact on Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 business.  Robbins testified that in a typical summer, the High Island Ranch would accommodate 120 guests spread across six cattle drives.  As a result of BLM\xe2\x80\x99s harassment, in 2003, Robbins was able to organize only one cattle drive with 21 guests.  <em>Id</em>., at 507\xe2\x80\x93508.  In addition, Robbins reports that he spent \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of thousands of dollars in costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x9d seeking to fend off BLM.  Brief for Respondent 9, n.\xc2\xa06.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To put an end to the incessant harassment, Robbins filed this suit, alleging that the Fifth Amendment forbids government action calculated to acquire private property coercively and cost-free, and measures taken in retaliation for the owner\xe2\x80\x99s resistance to an uncompensated taking.  Even assuming Robbins is correct about the Fifth Amendment, he may not proceed unless he has a right to sue.  To ground his claim for relief, Robbins relies on <em>Bivens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html"></a><a href="/us/403/388/index.html">403 U.

In <em>Bivens</em>, the Court drew upon that venerable principle in holding that a victim of a Fourth Amendment violation by federal officers has a claim for relief in the form of money damages.  \xe2\x80\x9cHistorically,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cdamages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d 403 U.

Soon after <em>Passman</em>, the Court applied <em>Bivens</em> again, recognizing a federal right of action to gain damages for an Eighth Amendment violation.  <em>Carlson</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/14/index.html">446 U. S. 14</a> (1980).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Carlson</em> announced two exceptions to <em>Bivens</em>\xe2\x80\x99 rule.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe first [applies] when defendants demonstrate special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 U.

Likewise, on two occasions, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment\xe2\x80\x9d precluded a <em>Bivens</em> action for harm to military personnel through activity incident to service.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stanley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/index.html">483 U.

As the Court recognizes, Robbins has no alternative remedy for the relentless torment he alleges.  True, Robbins may have had discrete remedies for particular instances of harassment.

In <em>Passman</em>, the Court of Appeals emphasized, as a reason counseling denial of a <em>Bivens</em> remedy, the danger of \xe2\x80\x9cdeluging federal courts with [Fifth Amendment based employment discrimination] claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  442 U. S., at 248 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  This Court disagreed, turning to Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion in <em>Bivens</em> to explain why.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only serious policy argument against recognizing a right of action for Bivens, Justice Harlan observed, was the risk of inundating courts with Fourth Amendment claims.  He found the argument unsatisfactory:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he question appears to be how Fourth Amendment interests rank on a scale of social values compared with, for example, the interests of stockholders defrauded by misleading proxies.

See App. 49.  One may accept that, at the outset, the BLM agents were motivated simply by a desire to secure an easement.  But after Robbins refused to cover for the officials\xe2\x80\x99 blunder, they resolved to drive him out of business.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Even if we allowed that the BLM employees had a permissible objective throughout their harassment of Robbins, and also that they pursued their goal through \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate tactics,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 16,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] it would not follow that Robbins failed to state a retaliation claim amenable to judicial resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Impermissible retaliation may well involve lawful action in service of legitimate objectives.  For example, in <em>Board of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs, Wabaunsee Cty.</em> v. <em>Umbehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/668/index.html">518 U. S. 668</a> (1996), this Court held that a county board of commissioners may cross into unconstitutional territory if it fires a contractor for speaking out against members of the Board on matters of public concern.  The Court recognized that terminating a contractor for public criticism of board practices might promote legitimate governmental objectives (<em>e.g.,</em> maintaining relationships of trust with those from whom services are purchased).  <em>Id</em>., at 674.  The Court, furthermore, instructed that even where the background law allows a government agency to terminate a contractor at will, the agency lacks <em>carte blanche</em> to do so in retaliation for constitutionally protected conduct.  <em>Id</em>., at 677.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The same is true here: BLM officials may have had the authority to cancel Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 permits or penalize his trespasses, but they are not at liberty to do so selectively, in retaliation for his exercise of a constitutional right.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I therefore cannot join the Court in concluding that Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 allegations present questions more \xe2\x80\x9cknotty\xe2\x80\x9d than the mine-run of constitutional retaliation claims.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cwe have established methods for identifying the presence of an illicit reason \xe2\x80\xa6 in retaliation cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 16, Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 suit can be resolved in familiar fashion.  A court need only ask whether Robbins engaged in constitutionally protected conduct (resisting the surrender of his property sans compensation), and if so, whether that was the reason BLM agents harassed him.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is driven by the \xe2\x80\x9cfear\xe2\x80\x9d that a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Bivens</em> cure\xe2\x80\x9d for the retaliation Robbins experienced may be \xe2\x80\x9cworse than the disease.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This concern seems to me exaggerated.  Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 suit is predicated upon the agents\xe2\x80\x99 vindictive motive, and the presence of this element in his claim minimizes the risk of making everyday bureaucratic overreaching fare for constitutional litigation.  See <em>Olech</em>, 528 U. S., at 566 (Breyer, J., concurring in result) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn my view, the presence of [vindictive action] in this case is sufficient to minimize any concern about transforming run-of-the-mill zoning cases into cases of constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, one could securely forecast that the flood the Court fears would not come to pass.  In <em>Passman</em>, the Courts said that it did not \xe2\x80\x9cperceive the potential for \xe2\x80\xa6 a deluge,\xe2\x80\x9d because, under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, \xe2\x80\x9ca damages remedy [was] already available to redress injuries such as petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s when they occur under color of state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  442 U. S., at 248.  A similar sideglance could be cast here.  Because we have no reason to believe that state employees are any more or less respectful of Fifth Amendment rights than federal agents, \xc2\xa71983 provides a controlled experiment.  If numerous <em>Bivens</em> claims would eventuate were courts to entertain claims like Robbins\xe2\x80\x99, then courts should already have encountered endeavors to mount Fifth Amendment Takings suits under \xc2\xa71983.  But the Court of Appeals, the Solicitor General, and Robbins all agree that there are no reported cases on charges of retaliation by state officials against the exercise of Takings Clause rights.  433 F.\xc2\xa03d 755, 767 (CA10 2006); Brief for Petitioners 48; Brief for Respondent 31.  Harassment of the sort Robbins alleges, it seems, is exceedingly rare.  Cf. <em>Olech</em>, 528 U. S., at 565\xe2\x80\x93566 (Breyer, J., concurring in result).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can assume, <em>arguendo</em>, that, as the Court projects, an unqualified judgment for Robbins could prompt \xe2\x80\x9cclaims in every sphere of legitimate governmental action affecting property interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  Nevertheless, shutting the door to all plaintiffs, even those roughed up as badly as Robbins, is a measure too extreme.  Cf. <em>Hein</em> v. <em>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 4 n.\xc2\xa01 (dissenting opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo the degree \xe2\x80\xa6 claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason \xe2\x80\xa6 to keep them from being heard.\xe2\x80\x9d).  There are better ways to ensure that run-of-the-mill interactions between citizens and their Government do not turn into cases of constitutional right.  Cf. <em>Bivens</em>, 403 U. S., at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cI simply cannot agree \xe2\x80\xa6 that the possibility of frivolous claims \xe2\x80\xa6 warrants closing the Courthouse doors to people in Bivens\xe2\x80\x99 situation.  There are other ways, short of that, of coping with frivolous lawsuits.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sexual harassment jurisprudence is a helpful guide.  Title VII, the Court has held, does not provide a remedy for every epithet or offensive remark.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor sexual harassment to be actionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s employment and create an abusive work environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB</em> v. <em>Vinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/57/index.html">477 U. S. 57</a>, 67 (1986) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).  See also <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/101/index.html">536 U. S. 101</a>, 115 (2002) (hostile work environments develop \xe2\x80\x9cover a series of days or perhaps years and, in direct contrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own\xe2\x80\x9d).  Adopting a similar standard for Fifth Amendment retaliation claims would \xe2\x80\x9clesse[n] the risk of raising a tide of suits threatening legitimate initiative on the part of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  Discrete episodes of hard bargaining that might be viewed as oppressive would not entitle a litigant to relief.  But where a plaintiff could prove a pattern of severe and pervasive harassment in duration and degree well beyond the ordinary rough-and-tumble one expects in strenuous negotiations, a <em>Bivens</em> suit would provide a remedy.  Robbins would have no trouble meeting that standard.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I conclude that <em>Robbins</em> has a right to sue under <em>Bivens</em>, I must briefly address the BLM employees\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity.  In resolving claims of official immunity on summary judgment, we ask two questions.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated a constitutional right?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 201 (2001).  And, if so, was that right clearly established, such that a reasonable officer would have known that his conduct was unlawful.  <em>Id</em>., at 201\xe2\x80\x93202.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Takings Clause instructs that no \xe2\x80\x9cprivate property [shall] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Amdt. 5.  Robbins argues that this provision confers on him the right to insist upon compensation as a condition of the taking of his property.  He is surely correct.  Correlative to the right to be compensated for a taking is the right to refuse to submit to a taking where no compensation is in the offing.  Cf. <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>City of Tigard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/374/index.html">512 U. S. 374</a> (1994) (invalidating a permit condition that would have constituted a taking); <em>Nollan</em> v. <em>California Coastal Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/index.html">483 U. S. 825</a> (1987) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robbins further argues that the BLM agents\xe2\x80\x99 persistent harassment impermissibly burdened his right to refuse to grant the Government something for nothing.  Once again, he is surely correct.  To cover for their mistake in failing to record the prior easement, BLM demanded, with no legal authority, that Robbins cede a new easement.  Robbins refused, as was his constitutional right.  At that point, BLM might have sought to take Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 property by eminent domain (assuming the agency was authorized to do so), or it might have attempted to negotiate with him.  Instead, the agents harassed Robbins and tried to drive him out of business.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has held that the Government may not unnecessarily penalize the exercise of constitutional rights.  This principle has been applied, most notably, to protect the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Umbehr</em>, 518 U. S., at 674\xe2\x80\x93675, 686 (freedom of speech); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Hare Truck Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>City of Northlake</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/712/index.html">518 U. S. 712</a>, 716\xe2\x80\x93720 (1996) (freedom of association); <em>Sherbert</em> v. <em>Verner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/index.html">374 U. S. 398</a>, 403\xe2\x80\x93406 (1963) (freedom of religion).  But it has also been deployed to protect other constitutional guarantees, including the privilege against self-incrimination, <em>Turley</em>, 414 U. S., at  82\xe2\x80\x9384, the right to trial by a jury, <em>Jackson</em>, 390 U. S., at 581\xe2\x80\x93583, and the right to travel, <em>Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Maricopa County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/250/index.html">415 U. S. 250</a>, 254\xe2\x80\x93262 (1974).  The principle should apply here too.  The constitutional guarantee of just compensation would be worthless if federal agents were permitted to harass and punish landowners who refuse to give up property without it.  The Fifth Amendment, therefore, must be read to forbid government action calculated to acquire private property coercively and cost-free, and measures taken in retaliation for the owner\xe2\x80\x99s resistance to uncompensated taking.  Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Robbins, BLM agents plainly violated his Fifth Amendment right to be free of such coercion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The closest question in this case is whether the officials are nevertheless entitled to immunity because it is not clearly established that retaliation for the exercise of Fifth Amendment rights runs afoul of the Constitution.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier</em>, 533 U. S., at 202.  As noted, all concede that there are no reported cases recognizing a Fifth Amendment right to be free from retaliation.  However, it is inconceivable that any reasonable official could have believed to be lawful the pernicious harassment Robbins alleges.  In the egregious circumstances of this case, the text of the Takings Clause and our retaliation jurisprudence provided the officers fair warning that their behavior impermissibly burdened a constitutional right.  See <em>Hope</em> v. <em>Pelzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/730/index.html">536 U. S. 730</a>, 739\xe2\x80\x93741 (2002).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thirty-six years ago, the Court created the <em>Bivens</em> remedy.  In doing so, it assured that federal officials would be subject to the same constraints as state officials in dealing with the fundamental rights of the people who dwell in this land.  Today, the Court decides that elaboration of <em>Bivens</em> to cover Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 case should be left to Congress.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  But see <em>supra</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa06.  The <em>Bivens</em> analog to \xc2\xa71983, however, is hardly an obscure part of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence.  If Congress wishes to codify and further define the <em>Bivens</em> remedy, it may do so at anytime.  Unless and until Congress acts, however, the Court should not shy away from the effort to ensure that bedrock constitutional rights do not become \xe2\x80\x9cmerely precatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Passman</em>, 442 U.

As noted above, every time the Court declined to recognize a <em>Bivens</em> action against a federal officer, it did so in deference to a specially crafted administrative regime.
