On the last writ, the sheriff returned, that he had sold the horses to the amount of 1021 dollars; that Thomas Hamilton had bought seven of the horses for 630 dollars; but that, both before and after the sale, he had given written notice, that he claimed the money arising on the sales, by virtue of a levy previously made for him upon an execution, by the former sheriff; and that, therefore, he claimed to retain the amount of his purchases, in part satisfaction of his execution: and the remaining money of the sales aforesaid, the said sheriff has ready , &amp;c. </p><p> From the records, it appeared, that Hamilton had issued a fi. fa. agent Wallis on the 25th of January, returnable to March term 1798, which was levied (inter alia) upon seven horses; and that on the 11th of December 1798, a vend. exp. issued, but was never prosecuted. </p><p> It, also, appeared, that in the case of Perit, executor, v.

In the interior of the state, particularly, it was the universal practice not to remove the goods after a levy. If, however, the intention of leaving them with the defendant was fraudulent, a subsequent execution would be preferred, in Pennsylvania, as well as in England. In the present instance, there is no proof of fraud; the first levies are, of course, good; and the sheriff must pay the money arising from the sales accordingly.
