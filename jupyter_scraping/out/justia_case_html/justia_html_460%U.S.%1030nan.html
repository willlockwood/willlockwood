Finley (1977), 173 Mont. 162, 566 P.2d 1119, we held that a defendant\'s privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by admitting into evidence a videotape recording of his post- arrest words and actions. We decided that the tape had not been introduced for the incriminating content of the words uttered by the defendant, but rather for the purpose of aiding the jury in understanding the testimony of the witnesses who had observed the defendant\'s unsteady walk and his slurred speech after his arrest. We specifically noted that the videotape did not contain incriminating responses to interrogation by the police. But the same situation does not exist here. It is obvious that defendant\'s refusal is inherently self-incriminating because it carries a strong inference of guilt-the prosecutor would surely argue that defendant\'s refusal to take the test was prompted only by his knowledge that the test results would reveal his intoxication, and therefore incriminate him. </p><p> "We hold under our own constitution, that if a communication of refusal, whether written, verbal, or otherwise, involves the defendant\'s consciousness of the facts and the operation of his mind in expressing it, the communication is testimonial in nature. A defendant\'s silence or negative reply to an officer\'s request which calls for an immediate reply is clearly an overt communication of the defendant\'s thoughts in response to the request. Doyle v. Ohio (1976 ), <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/610/case.html">426 U.S. 610</a>. It is the act of refusal that is pertinent and suggestive of guilt, rather than the way in which it is communicated.
