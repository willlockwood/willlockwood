QUARTERMAN, DIRECTOR, TEXAS\nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, COR-RECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x936407.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 18, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 28, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a Texas state court and sentenced to death despite his well-documented history of mental illness.  After the Texas courts denied relief on direct appeal, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, but the District Court and the Fifth Circuit rejected his claims, and this Court denied certiorari.  In the course of these initial state and federal proceedings, petitioner did not argue that mental illness rendered him incompetent to be executed.  Once the state trial court set an execution date, petitioner filed a motion under Texas law claiming, for the first time, that he was incompetent to be executed because of mental illness.  The trial judge denied the motion without a hearing and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He then filed another federal habeas petition under \xc2\xa72254, and the District Court stayed his execution to allow the state trial court time to consider evidence of his then-current mental state.  Once the state court began its adjudication, petitioner submitted 10 motions in which he requested, <em>inter alia</em>, a competency hearing and funds for a mental health expert.  The court indicated it would rule on the outstanding motions once it had received the report written by the experts that it had appointed to review petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition.  The experts subsequently filed this report, which concluded, <em>inter alia,</em> that petitioner had the ability to understand the reason he was to be executed.  Without ruling on the outstanding motions, the judge found petitioner competent and closed the case.  Petitioner then returned to the Federal District Court, seeking a resolution of his pending \xc2\xa72254 petition.  The District Court concluded that the state-court competency proceedings failed to comply with Texas law and were constitutionally inadequate in light of the procedural requirements mandated by <em>Ford</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/399/index.html">477 U. S. 399</a>, 410, where this Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States from inflicting the death penalty upon insane prisoners.  Although the court therefore reviewed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s incompetency claim without<em> </em>deferring to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of competency, it nevertheless granted no relief, finding that petitioner had not demonstrated that he met the standard for incompetency.  Under Fifth Circuit precedent, the court explained, petitioner was competent to be executed so long as he knew the fact of his impending execution and the factual predicate for it.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court has statutory authority to adjudicate the claims raised in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second federal habeas application.  Because \xc2\xa72244(b)(2) requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] claim presented in a second or successive \xe2\x80\xa6 [\xc2\xa72254] application \xe2\x80\xa6 that was not presented in a prior application \xe2\x80\xa6 be dismissed,\xe2\x80\x9d the State maintains that the failure of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first \xc2\xa72254 application to raise a Ford</em>-based incompetency claim deprived the District Court of jurisdiction.  The results this argument would produce show its flaws.  Were the State\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d correct, a prisoner would have two options: forgo the opportunity to raise a <em>Ford</em> claim in federal court; or raise the claim in a first federal habeas application even though it is premature.  <em>Stewart</em> v. <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/637/index.html">523 U. S. 637</a>, 644.  The dilemma would apply not only to prisoners with mental conditions that, at the time of the initial habeas filing, were indicative of incompetency but also to all other prisoners, including those with no early sign of mental illness.  Because all prisoners are at risk of deteriorations in their mental state, conscientious defense attorneys would be obliged to file unripe (and, in many cases, meritless) <em>Ford </em>claims in each and every \xc2\xa72254 application.  This counterintuitive approach would add to the burden imposed on courts, applicants, and the States, with no clear advantage to any.  The more reasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa72244, suggested by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, is that Congress did not intend the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) addressing \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d habeas petitions to govern a filing in the unusual posture presented here: a \xc2\xa72254 application raising a <em>Ford</em>-based incompetency claim filed as soon as that claim is ripe.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Martinez-Villareal, supra</em>, at 643\xe2\x80\x93645.  This conclusion is confirmed by AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes of \xe2\x80\x9cfurther[ing] comity, finality, and federalism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/322/index.html">537 U. S. 322</a>, 337, \xe2\x80\x9cpromot[ing] judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources, \xe2\x80\xa6 and lend[ing] finality to state court judgments within a reasonable time,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Day </em>v. <em>McDonough</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/198/index.html">547 U. S. 198</a>, 205\xe2\x80\x93206.  These purposes, and the practical effects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings, should be considered when interpreting AEDPA, particularly where, as here, petitioners \xe2\x80\x9crun the risk\xe2\x80\x9d under the proposed interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cforever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html">544 U. S. 269</a>, 275.  There is, finally, no argument in this case that petitioner proceeded in a manner that could be considered an abuse of the writ.  Cf. <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 664.  To the contrary, the Court has suggested that it is generally appropriate for a prisoner to wait before seeking the resolution of unripe incompetency claims.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Martinez-Villareal, supra</em>, at 644\xe2\x80\x93645.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9315.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The state court failed to provide the procedures to which petitioner was entitled under the Constitution.  <em>Ford </em>identifies the measures a State must provide when a prisoner alleges incompetency to be executed.  Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in <em>Ford </em>controls, see <em>Marks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/index.html">430 U. S. 188</a>, 193, and constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d governing law for AEDPA purposes, \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  As Justice Powell elaborated, once a prisoner seeking a stay of execution has made \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial threshold showing of insanity,\xe2\x80\x9d 477 U. S., at 424, the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments entitle him to, <em>inter alia,</em> a fair hearing, <em>ibid.,</em> including an opportunity to submit \xe2\x80\x9cexpert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the State\xe2\x80\x99s own psychiatric examination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 427.  The procedures the state court provided petitioner were so deficient that they cannot be reconciled with any reasonable interpretation of the <em>Ford</em> rule.  It is uncontested that petitioner made a substantial showing of incompetency.  It is also evident from the record, however, that the state court reached its competency determination without holding a hearing or providing petitioner with an adequate opportunity to provide his own expert evidence.  Moreover, there is a strong argument that the court violated state law by failing to provide a competency hearing.  If so, the violation undermines any reliance the State might now place on Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe States should have substantial leeway to determine what process best balances the various interests at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 427.  Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant habeas relief, as relevant, only if a state court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication of [a] claim on the merits \xe2\x80\xa6 resulted in a decision that \xe2\x80\xa6 involved an unreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant federal law.  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  If the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication is dependent on an antecedent unreasonable application of federal law, that requirement is satisfied, and the federal court must then resolve the claim without the deference AEDPA otherwise requires.  See, <em>e.g., Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, 534.  Having determined that the state court unreasonably applied <em>Ford </em>when it accorded petitioner the procedures in question<em>, </em>this Court must now consider petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim on the merits without deferring to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s competency finding.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9321.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit employed an improperly restrictive test when it considered petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim of incompetency on the merits.  Pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s incompetency standard is too restrictive to afford a prisoner Eighth Amendment protections.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s experts in the District Court concluded that, although he claims to understand that the State says it wants to execute him for murder, his mental problems have resulted in the delusion that the stated reason is a sham, and that the State actually wants to execute him to stop him from preaching.  The Fifth Circuit held, based on its earlier decisions, that such delusions are simply not relevant to whether a prisoner can be executed so long as he is aware that the State has identified the link between his crime and the punishment to be inflicted.  This test ignores the possibility that even if such awareness exists, gross delusions stemming from a severe mental disorder may put that awareness in a context so far removed from reality that the punishment can serve no proper purpose.  It is also inconsistent with <em>Ford,</em> for none of the principles set forth therein is in accord with the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  Although the <em>Ford</em> opinions did not set forth a precise competency standard, the Court did reach the express conclusion that the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cplaces a substantive restriction on the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to take the life of an insane prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d 477 U. S., at 405, because, <em>inter alia,</em> such an execution serves no retributive purpose, <em>id</em>., at 408.  It might be said that capital punishment is imposed because it has the potential to make the offender recognize at last the gravity of his crime and to allow the community as a whole, including the victim\xe2\x80\x99s surviving family and friends, to affirm its own judgment that the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s culpability is so serious that the ultimate penalty must be sought and imposed.  Both the potential for this recognition and the objective of community vindication are called into question, however, if the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s only awareness of the link between the crime and the punishment is so distorted by mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding shared by the community as a whole.  A prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it.  <em>Ford</em> does not foreclose inquiry into the latter.  To refuse to consider evidence of this nature is to mistake <em>Ford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding and its logic.  Pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9328. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Although the Court rejects the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard, it does not attempt to set down a rule governing all competency determinations.  The record is not as informative as it might be because it was developed by the District Court under the rejected standard, and, thus, this Court finds it difficult to amplify its conclusions or to make them more precise.  It is proper to allow the court charged with overseeing the development of the evidentiary record the initial opportunity to resolve petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim.

S. 399</a>, 409\xe2\x80\x93410 (1986).  The prohibition applies despite a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s earlier competency to be held responsible for committing a crime and to be tried for it.  Prior findings of competency do not foreclose a prisoner from proving he is incompetent to be executed because of his present mental condition.  Under <em>Ford</em>, once a prisoner makes the requisite preliminary showing that his current mental state would bar his execution, the Eighth Amendment, applicable to the States under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, entitles him to an adjudication to determine his condition.  These determinations are governed by the substantive federal baseline for competency set down in <em>Ford</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Scott Louis Panetti, referred to here as petitioner, was convicted and sentenced to death in a Texas state court.  After the state trial court set an execution date, petitioner made a substantial showing he was not competent to be executed.  The state court rejected his claim of incompetency on the merits.  Filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, petitioner claimed again that his mental condition barred his execution; that the Eighth Amendment set forth a substantive standard for competency different from the one advanced by the State; and that prior state-court proceedings on the issue were insufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements mandated by <em>Ford</em>.  The State denied these assertions and argued, in addition, that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude we have statutory authority to adjudicate the claims petitioner raises in his habeas application; we find the state court failed to provide the procedures to which petitioner was entitled under the Constitution; and we determine that the federal appellate court employed an improperly restrictive test when it considered petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim of incompetency on the merits.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On a morning in 1992 petitioner awoke before dawn, dressed in camouflage, and drove to the home of his estranged wife\xe2\x80\x99s parents.  Breaking the front-door lock, he entered the house and, in front of his wife and daughter, shot and killed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s mother and father.  He took his wife and daughter hostage for the night before surrendering to police.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tried for capital murder in 1995, petitioner sought to represent himself.  The court ordered a psychiatric evaluation, which indicated that petitioner suffered from a fragmented personality, delusions, and hallucinations.  1 App. 9\xe2\x80\x9314.  The evaluation noted that petitioner had been hospitalized numerous times for these disorders.  <em>Id</em>., at 10; see also <em>id</em>., at 222.  Evidence later revealed that doctors had prescribed medication for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental disorders that, in the opinion of one expert, would be difficult for a person not suffering from extreme psychosis even to tolerate.  See <em>id</em>., at 233 (\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine anybody getting that dose waking up for two to three days. You cannot take that kind of medication if you are close to normal without absolutely being put out\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s wife described one psychotic episode in a petition she filed in 1986 seeking extraordinary relief from the Texas state courts.  See <em>id</em>., at 38\xe2\x80\x9340.  She explained that petitioner had become convinced the devil had possessed their home and that, in an effort to cleanse their surroundings, petitioner had buried a number of valuables next to the house and engaged in other rituals.  <em>Id</em>., at 39.  Petitioner nevertheless was found competent to be tried and to waive counsel.  At trial he claimed he was not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During his trial petitioner engaged in behavior later described by his standby counsel as \xe2\x80\x9cbizarre,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cscary,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctrance-like.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 26, 21, 22.  According to the attorney, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s behavior both in private and in front of the jury made it evident that he was suffering from \xe2\x80\x9cmental incompetence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 26; see also <em>id</em>., at 22-23, and the net effect of this dynamic was to render the trial \xe2\x80\x9ctruly a judicial farce, and a mockery of self-representation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 26.  There was evidence on the record, moreover, to indicate that petitioner had stopped taking his antipsychotic medication a few months before trial, see <em>id</em>., at 339, 345, a rejection of medical advice that, it appears, petitioner has continued to this day with one brief exception, see Brief for Petitioner 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  According to expert testimony, failing to take this medication tends to exacerbate the underlying mental dysfunction.  See <em>id.,</em> at 16, 18, n.\xc2\xa012; see also 1 App. 195, 228.  And it is uncontested that, less than two months after petitioner was sentenced to death, the state trial court found him incompetent to waive the appointment of state habeas counsel.  See Brief for Petitioner 15, n.\xc2\xa010.  It appears, therefore, that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s condition has only worsened since the start of trial.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death.  Petitioner challenged his conviction and sentence both on direct appeal and through state habeas proceedings.  The Texas courts denied his requests for relief.  See <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. 72,230 (Crim. App., Dec. 3, 1997); <em>Ex parte Panetti</em>, No. 37,145\xe2\x80\x9301 (Crim. App., May 20, 1998).

Among the issues petitioner raised in the course of these state and federal proceedings was his competency to stand trial and to waive counsel.  Petitioner did not argue, however, that mental illness rendered him incompetent to be executed.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 31, 2003, Judge Stephen B. Ables of the 216th Judicial District Court in Gillespie County, Texas, set petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s execution date for February 5, 2004.  See First Order Setting Execution in Cause No. 3310; Order Setting Execution in Cause No. 3310.  On December 10, 2003, counsel for petitioner filed with Judge Ables a motion under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 46.05 (Vernon Supp. Pamphlet 2006).  Petitioner claimed, for the first time, that due to mental illness he was incompetent to be executed.  The judge denied the motion without a hearing.  When petitioner attempted to challenge the ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction, indicating it has authority to review an Art. 46.05 determination only when a trial court has determined a prisoner is incompetent.  <em>Ex parte Panetti</em>, No. 74,868 (Jan. 28, 2004) <em>(per curiam</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner returned to federal court, where he filed another petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \xc2\xa72254 and a motion for stay of execution.  On February 4, 2004, the District Court stayed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s execution to \xe2\x80\x9callow the state court a reasonable period of time to consider the evidence of [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] current mental state.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order in Case No. A\xe2\x80\x9304\xe2\x80\x93CA\xe2\x80\x93042\xe2\x80\x93SS, 1 App. 113\xe2\x80\x93114, 116.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court had before it, at that time, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Renewed Motion To Determine Competency To Be Executed (hereinafter Renewed Motion To Determine Competency).  Attached to the motion were a letter and a declaration from two individuals, a psychologist and a law professor, who had interviewed petitioner while on death row on February 3, 2004.  The new evidence, according to counsel, demonstrated that petitioner did not understand the reasons he was about to be executed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Due to the absence of a transcript, the state-court proceedings after this point are not altogether clear.  The claims raised before this Court nevertheless make it necessary to recount the procedural history in some detail.  Based on the docket entries and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 filings it appears the following occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state trial court ordered the parties to participate in a telephone conference on February 9, 2004, to discuss the status of the case.  There followed a court directive instructing counsel to submit, by February 20, the names of mental health experts the court should consider appointing pursuant to Art. 46.05(f).  See <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the trial court determines that the defendant has made a substantial showing of incompetency, the court shall order at least two mental health experts to examine the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court also gave the parties until February 20 to submit any motions concerning the competency procedures and advised it would hold another status conference on that same date.  Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Motion To Reconsider in Cause No. 3310, pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x932 (Mar. 4, 2004) (hereinafter Motion to Reconsider).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 19, 2004, petitioner filed 10 motions related to the Art. 46.05 proceedings.  They included requests for transcription of the proceedings, a competency hearing comporting with the procedural due process requirements set forth in <em>Ford</em>, and funds to hire a mental health expert.  See Motion To Transcribe All Proceedings Related to Competency Determination Under Article 46.05 in Cause No. 3310; Motion To Ensure That The Article 46.05 \xe2\x80\x9cFinal Competency Hearing\xe2\x80\x9d Comports With The Procedural Due Process Requirements of Ford in Cause No. 3310 (hereinafter Motion to Ensure); Ex Parte Motion for Prepayment of Funds To Hire Mental Health Expert To Assist Defense in Article 46.05 Proceedings in Cause No. 3310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 20 the court failed to hold its scheduled status conference.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel called the courthouse and was advised Judge Ables was out of the office for the day.  Counsel then called the Gillespie County District Attorney, who explained that the judge had informed state attorneys earlier that week that he was cancelling the conference he had set and would appoint the mental health experts without input from the parties.  Motion to Reconsider 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 23, 2004, counsel for petitioner received an order, dated February 20, advising that the court was appointing two mental health experts pursuant to Art. \xc2\xa746.05(f).  Order in Cause No. 3310, p. 1 (Feb. 26, 2004), 1 App. 59.  On February 25, at an informal status conference, the court denied two of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motions, indicating it would consider the others when the court-appointed mental health experts completed their evaluations.  Motion to Reconsider 3.  On March 4, petitioner filed a motion explaining that a delayed ruling would render a number of the motions moot.  <em>Id</em>., at 1.  There is no indication the court responded to this motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court-appointed experts returned with their evaluation on April 28, 2004.  Concluding that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cknows that he is to be executed, and that his execution will result in his death,\xe2\x80\x9d and, moreover, that he \xe2\x80\x9chas the ability to understand the reason he is to be executed,\xe2\x80\x9d the experts alleged that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s uncooperative and bizarre behavior was due to calculated design: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Panetti deliberately and persistently chose to control and manipulate our interview situation,\xe2\x80\x9d they claimed.  1 App. 75.  They maintained that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9ccould answer questions about relevant legal issues \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x82if he were willing to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge sent a letter to counsel, including petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Michael C. Gross, dated May 14, 2004.  It said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDear Counsel:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears from the evaluations performed by [the court-appointed experts] that they are of the opinion that [petitioner] is competent to be executed in accordance with the standards set out in Art. 46.05 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gross, if you have any other matters you wish to have considered, please file them in the case papers and get me copies by 5:00 p.m. on May 21, 2004.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nPetitioner responded with a filing entitled \xe2\x80\x9cObjections to Experts\xe2\x80\x99 Report, Renewed Motion for Funds To Hire Mental Health Expert and Investigator, Renewed Motion for Appointment of Counsel, and Motion for Competency Hearing\xe2\x80\x9d in Cause No. 3310 (May 24, 2004) (hereinafter Objections to Experts\xe2\x80\x99 Report).  In this filing petitioner criticized the methodology and conclusions of the court-appointed experts; asserted his continued need for a mental health expert as his own criticisms of the report were \xe2\x80\x9cby necessity limited,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 1; again asked the court to rule on his outstanding motions for funds and appointment of counsel; and requested a competency hearing.  Petitioner also argued, as a more general matter, that the process he had received thus far failed to comply with Art. 46.05 and the procedural mandates set by <em>Ford</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court, in response, closed the case.  On May 26, it released a short order identifying the report submitted by the court-appointed experts and explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ased on the aforesaid doctors\xe2\x80\x99 reports, the Court finds that [petitioner] has failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is incompetent to be executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order Regarding Competency To Be Executed in Cause No. 3310, 1 App. 99.  The order made no mention of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motions or other filings.  Petitioner did not appeal the ruling to the Court of Criminal Appeals, and he did not petition this Court for certiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This background leads to the matter now before us.  Petitioner returned to federal court, seeking resolution of the \xc2\xa72254 petition he had filed on January 26.  The District Court granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motions to reconsider, to stay his execution, to appoint counsel, and to provide funds.  The court, in addition, set the case for an evidentiary hearing, which included testimony by a psychiatrist, a professor, and two psychologists, all called by petitioner, as well as two psychologists and three correctional officers, called by respondent.  See 1 App. 117\xe2\x80\x93135, 362\xe2\x80\x93363; see also <em>id</em>., at 136\xe2\x80\x93336.  We describe the substance of the experts\xe2\x80\x99 testimony in more detail later in our opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 29, 2004, the District Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas application on the merits.  It concluded that the state trial court had failed to comply with Art. 46.05; found the state proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally inadequate\xe2\x80\x9d in light of <em>Ford;</em> and reviewed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Eighth Amendment claim without<em> </em>deferring to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of competency.  <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, 401 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 702, 706, 705\xe2\x80\x93706 (WD Tex. 2004).  The court nevertheless denied relief.  It found petitioner had not shown incompetency as defined by Circuit precedent.  <em>Id</em>., at 712.  \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fifth Circuit test for competency to be executed requires the petitioner know no more than the fact of his impending execution and the factual predicate for the execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 711.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, 448 F.\xc2\xa03d 815 (CA5 2006), and we granted certiorari, 549 U. S.\xe2\x80\x82___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider our jurisdiction.  The habeas corpus application on review is the second one petitioner has filed in federal court.  Under the gatekeeping provisions of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b)(2), \xe2\x80\x9c[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d except under certain, narrow circumstances.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State maintains that, by direction of \xc2\xa72244, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa72254 application.  Its argument is straightforward: \xe2\x80\x9c[Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] first federal habeas application, which was fully and finally adjudicated on the merits, failed to raise a <em>Ford</em> claim,\xe2\x80\x9d and, as a result, \xe2\x80\x9c[his] subsequent habeas application, which did raise a <em>Ford</em> claim, was a \xe2\x80\x98second or successive\xe2\x80\x99 application\xe2\x80\x9d under the terms of \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).  Supplemental Brief for Respondent 1.  The State contends, moreover, that any <em>Ford</em> claim brought in an application governed by \xc2\xa72244\xe2\x80\x99s gatekeeping provisions must be dismissed.  See Supplemental Brief for Respondent 4\xe2\x80\x936 (citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State acknowledges that <em>Ford</em>-based incompetency claims, as a general matter, are not ripe until after the time has run to file a first federal habeas petition.  See Supplemental Brief for Respondent 6.  The State nevertheless maintains that its rule would not foreclose prisoners from raising <em>Ford</em> claims.  Under <em>Stewart</em> v. <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/637/index.html">523 U. S. 637</a> (1998), the State explains, a federal court is permitted to review a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Ford</em> claim once it becomes ripe if the prisoner preserved the claim by filing it in his first federal habeas application.  Under the State\xe2\x80\x99s approach a prisoner contemplating a future <em>Ford</em> claim could preserve it by this means.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s argument has some force.  The results it would produce, however, show its flaws.  As in <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, if the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation of \xe2\x80\x98second or successive\xe2\x80\x99 were correct, the implications for habeas practice would be far reaching and seemingly perverse.\xe2\x80\x9d  523 U. S., at 644.  A prisoner would be faced with two options: forgo the opportunity to raise a <em>Ford</em> claim in federal court; or raise the claim in a first federal habeas application (which generally must be filed within one year of the relevant state-court ruling), even though it is premature.  The dilemma would apply not only to prisoners with mental conditions indicative of incompetency but also to those with no early sign of mental illness.  All prisoners are at risk of deteriorations in their mental state.  As a result, conscientious defense attorneys would be obliged to file unripe (and, in many cases, meritless) <em>Ford </em>claims in each and every \xc2\xa72254 application.  This counterintuitive approach would add to the burden imposed on courts, applicants, and the States, with no clear advantage to any.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude there is another reasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa72244, one that does not produce these distortions and inefficiencies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d is not self-defining.  It takes its full meaning from our case law, including decisions predating the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.  See <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 486 (2000) (citing <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, <em>supra</em>); see also <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 664 (1996).  The Court has declined to interpret \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d as referring to all \xc2\xa72254 applications filed second or successively in time, even when the later filings address a state-court judgment already challenged in a prior \xc2\xa72254 application.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Slack, </em>529 U. S., at 487 (concluding that a second \xc2\xa72254 application was not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d after the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first application, which had challenged the same state-court judgment, had been dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies); see also <em>id</em>., at 486 (indicating that \xe2\x80\x9cpre-AEDPA law govern[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the case before it but implying that the Court would reach the same result under AEDPA); see also <em>Martinez-Villareal, supra,</em> at 645.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our interpretation of \xc2\xa72244 in <em>Martinez-Villareal</em> is illustrative.  There the prisoner filed his first habeas application before his execution date was set.  In the first application he asserted, <em>inter alia</em>, that he was incompetent to be executed, citing <em>Ford</em>.  The District Court, among other holdings, dismissed the claim as premature; and the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling.  When the State obtained a warrant for the execution, the prisoner filed, for the second time, a habeas application raising the same incompetency<em> </em>claim.  The State argued that because the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9calready had one \xe2\x80\x98fully-litigated habeas petition, the plain meaning of \xc2\xa72244(b) \xe2\x80\xa6 requires his new petition to be treated as successive.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  523 U. S., at 643.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We rejected this contention.  While the later filing \xe2\x80\x9cmay have been the second time that [the prisoner] had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his <em>Ford</em> claim,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court declined to accept that there were, as a result, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo separate applications, [with] the second \xe2\x80\xa6 necessarily subject to \xc2\xa72244(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Court instead held that, in light of the particular circumstances presented by a <em>Ford</em> claim, it would treat the two filings as a single application.  The petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cwas entitled to an adjudication of all the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  523 U. S., at 643.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our earlier holding does not resolve the jurisdictional question in the instant case.  <em>Martinez-Villareal</em> did not address the applicability of \xc2\xa72244(b) \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a prisoner raises a <em>Ford </em>claim for the first time in a petition filed after the federal courts have already rejected the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s initial habeas application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 645, n.  Yet the Court\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to look to the \xe2\x80\x9cimplications for habeas practice\xe2\x80\x9d when interpreting \xc2\xa72244 informs the analysis here.  <em>Id.,</em> at 644.  We conclude, in accord with this precedent, that Congress did not intend the provisions of AEDPA addressing \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d petitions to govern a filing in the unusual posture presented here: a \xc2\xa72254 application raising a <em>Ford</em>-based incompetency claim filed as soon as that claim is ripe.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion is confirmed when we consider AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s design is to \xe2\x80\x9cfurther the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/322/index.html"></a><a href="/us/537/3/index.html">537 U.

This is particularly so when petitioners \xe2\x80\x9crun the risk\xe2\x80\x9d under the proposed interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cforever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html">544 U.

See <em>Duncan, supra,</em> at 178.  Instructing prisoners to file premature claims, particularly when many of these claims will not be colorable even at a later date, does not conserve judicial resources, \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e] piecemeal litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstreamlin[e] federal habeas proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Burton</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s concern for finality, moreover, is not implicated, for under none of the possible approaches would federal courts be able to resolve a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Ford </em>claim before execution is imminent.  See <em>Martinez-Villareal, supra</em>, at 644\xe2\x80\x93645 (acknowledging that the District Court was unable to resolve the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s incompetency claim at the time of his initial habeas filing).  And last-minute filings that are frivolous and designed to delay executions can be dismissed in the regular course.  The requirement of a threshold preliminary showing, for instance, will, as a general matter, be imposed before a stay is granted or the action is allowed to proceed. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, in addition, no argument that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s actions constituted an abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained in our cases.  Cf. <em>Felker</em>, 518 U.

To the contrary, we have confirmed that claims of incompetency to be executed remain unripe at early stages of the proceedings.  See <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, 523 U.

There are, however, exceptions.  We are hesitant to construe a statute, implemented to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism, in a manner that would require unripe (and, often, factually unsupported) claims to be raised as a mere formality, to the benefit of no party.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory bar on \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications does not apply to a <em>Ford</em> claim brought in an application filed when the claim is first ripe.

The state court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide the procedures mandated by <em>Ford</em> constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established law as determined by this Court.  It is uncontested that petitioner made a substantial showing of incompetency.  This showing entitled him to, among other things, an adequate means by which to submit expert psychiatric evidence in response to the evidence that had been solicited by the state court.  And it is clear from the record that the state court reached its competency determination after failing to provide petitioner with this process, notwithstanding counsel\xe2\x80\x99s sustained effort, diligence, and compliance with court orders.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result of this error, our review of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s underlying incompetency claim is unencumbered by the deference AEDPA normally requires.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Ford</em> identifies the measures a State must provide when a prisoner alleges incompetency to be executed.  The four-Justice plurality in <em>Ford</em> concluded as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the condemned prisoner does not enjoy the same presumptions accorded a defendant who has yet to be convicted or sentenced, he has not lost the protection of the Constitution altogether; if the Constitution renders the fact or timing of his execution contingent upon establishment of a further fact, then that fact must be determined with the high regard for truth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of a human being.  Thus, the ascertainment of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sanity as a predicate to lawful execution calls for no less stringent standards than those demanded in any other aspect of a capital proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  477 U. S., at 411\xe2\x80\x93412.</p>\n<p align="left">\nJustice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, which also addressed the question of procedure, offered a more limited holding.  When there is no majority opinion, the narrower holding controls.  See <em>Marks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/index.html">430 U. S. 188</a>, 193 (1977).  Under this rule Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d law for purposes of \xc2\xa72254 and sets the minimum procedures a State must provide to a prisoner raising a <em>Ford</em>-based competency claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion states the relevant standard as follows.  Once a prisoner seeking a stay of execution has made \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial threshold showing of insanity,\xe2\x80\x9d the protection afforded by procedural due process includes a \xe2\x80\x9cfair hearing\xe2\x80\x9d in accord with fundamental fairness.  <em>Ford</em>, 477 U. S., at 426, 424 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This protection means a prisoner must be accorded an \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to be heard,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 424 (internal quotation marks omitted), though \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutionally acceptable procedure may be far less formal than a trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 427.  As an example of why the state procedures on review in <em>Ford</em> were deficient, Justice Powell explained, the determination of sanity \xe2\x80\x9cappear[ed] to have been made <em>solely</em> on the basis of the examinations performed by state-appointed psychiatrists.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 424.  \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a procedure invites arbitrariness and error by preventing the affected parties from offering contrary medical evidence or even from explaining the inadequacies of the State\xe2\x80\x99s examinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Powell did not set forth \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise limits that due process imposes in this area.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 427.  He observed that a State \xe2\x80\x9cshould have substantial leeway to determine what process best balances the various interests at stake\xe2\x80\x9d once it has met the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic requirements\xe2\x80\x9d required by due process.  <em>Ibid</em>.  These basic requirements include an opportunity to submit \xe2\x80\x9cevidence and argument from the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the State\xe2\x80\x99s own psychiatric examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner was entitled to these protections once he had made a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial threshold showing of insanity.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.</em>, at 426.  He made this showing when he filed his Renewed Motion To Determine Competency\xe2\x80\x94a fact disputed by no party, confirmed by the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of mental health experts pursuant to Article 46.05(f), and verified by our independent review of the record.  The Renewed Motion included pointed observations made by two experts the day before petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled execution; and it incorporated, through petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first Motion To Determine Competency, references to the extensive evidence of mental dysfunction considered in earlier legal proceedings.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this showing, the state court failed to provide petitioner with the minimum process required by <em>Ford</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court refused to transcribe its proceedings, notwithstanding the multiple motions petitioner filed requesting this process.  To the extent a more complete record may have put some of the court\xe2\x80\x99s actions in a more favorable light, this only constitutes further evidence of the inadequacy of the proceedings.  Based on the materials available to this Court, it appears the state court on repeated occasions conveyed information to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel that turned out not to be true; provided at least one significant update to the State without providing the same notice to petitioner; and failed in general to keep petitioner informed as to the opportunity, if any, he would have to present his case.  There is also a strong argument the court violated state law by failing to provide a competency hearing.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 46.05(k).  If this did, in fact, constitute a violation of the procedural framework Texas has mandated for the adjudication of incompetency claims, the violation undermines any reliance the State might now place on Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe States should have substantial leeway to determine what process best balances the various interests at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ford, supra</em>, at 427.  See also, <em>e.g</em>., Brief for Respondent 16.  What is more, the order issued by the state court implied that its determination of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s competency was made solely on the basis of the examinations performed by the psychiatrists it had appointed\xe2\x80\x94precisely the sort of adjudication Justice Powell warned would \xe2\x80\x9cinvit[e] arbitrariness and error,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ford, supra</em>, at 424.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court made an additional error, one that <em>Ford</em> makes clear is impermissible under the Constitution: It failed to provide petitioner with an adequate opportunity to submit expert evidence in response to the report filed by the court-appointed experts.  The court mailed the experts\xe2\x80\x99 report to both parties in the first week of May.  The report, which rejected the factual basis for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim, set forth new allegations suggesting that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre behavior was due, at least in part, to deliberate design rather than mental illness.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel reached the reasonable conclusion that these allegations warranted a response.  See Objections to Experts\xe2\x80\x99 Report 13, and n.\xc2\xa01.  On May 14 the court told petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, by letter, to file \xe2\x80\x9cany other matters you wish to have considered\xe2\x80\x9d within a week.  Petitioner, in response, renewed his motions for an evidentiary hearing, funds to hire a mental health expert, and other relief.  He did not submit at that time expert psychiatric evidence to challenge the court-appointed experts\xe2\x80\x99 report, a decision that in context made sense: The court had said it would rule on his outstanding motions, which included a request for funds to hire a mental-health expert and a request for an evidentiary hearing, once the court-appointed experts had completed their evaluation.  Counsel was justified in relying on this representation by the court.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Texas law, moreover, provides that a court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of incompetency will be made on the basis of, <em>inter alia</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal competency hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 46.05(k); see also <em>Ex parte Caldwell</em>, 58 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 127, 129, 130 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (confirming that the \xe2\x80\x9clegislature codified the dictates of <em>Ford</em> by enacting [the precursor to Art. 46.05]\xe2\x80\x9d and indicating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he determination of whether to appoint experts and conduct a hearing is within the discretion of the trial court\xe2\x80\x9d <em>before</em> a petitioner has made a substantial showing of incompetency).  Had the court advised counsel it would resolve the case without first ruling on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motions and without holding a competency hearing, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel might have managed to procure the assistance of experts, as he had been able to do on a <em>pro bono</em> basis the day before petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s previously scheduled execution.  It was, in any event, reasonable for counsel to refrain from procuring and submitting expert psychiatric evidence while waiting for the court to rule on the timely filed motions, all in reliance on the court\xe2\x80\x99s assurances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But at this point the court simply ended the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court failed to provide petitioner with a constitutionally adequate opportunity to be heard.  After a prisoner has made the requisite threshold showing, <em>Ford</em> requires, at a minimum, that a court allow a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel the opportunity to make an adequate response to evidence solicited by the state court.  See 477 U. S., at 424, 427.  In petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case this meant an opportunity to submit psychiatric evidence as a counterweight to the report filed by the court-appointed experts.  <em>Id</em>., at 424.  Yet petitioner failed to receive even this rudimentary process.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this error we need not address whether other procedures, such as the opportunity for discovery or for the cross-examination of witnesses, would in some cases be required under the Due Process Clause.  As <em>Ford</em> makes clear, the procedural deficiencies already identified constituted a violation of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal rights.</p>\n<p>\n\nB</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of certain of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motions rests on an implicit finding: that the procedures it provided were adequate to resolve the competency claim.  In light of the procedural history we have described, however, this determination cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of the controlling standard in <em>Ford</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the standard is stated in general terms does not mean the application was reasonable.  AEDPA does not \xe2\x80\x9crequire state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Musladin</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 2) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  Nor does AEDPA prohibit a federal court from finding an application of a principle unreasonable when it involves a set of facts \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from those of the case in which the principle was announced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lockyer</em> v. <em>Andrade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/63/index.html">538 U. S. 63</a>, 76 (2003).  The statute recognizes, to the contrary, that even a general standard may be applied in an unreasonable manner.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a> (finding a state-court decision both contrary to and involving an unreasonable application of the standard set forth in <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984)).  These principles guide a reviewing court that is faced, as we are here, with a record that cannot, under any reasonable interpretation of the controlling legal standard, support a certain legal ruling.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant habeas relief, as relevant, only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication of [a] claim on the merits \xe2\x80\xa6 resulted in a decision that \xe2\x80\xa6 involved an unreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant law.  When a state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of a claim is dependent on an antecedent unreasonable application of federal law, the requirement set forth in \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) is satisfied.  A federal court must then resolve the claim without the deference AEDPA otherwise requires.  See <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, 534 (2003) (performing the analysis required under <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s second prong without deferring to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision because the state court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first prong involved an unreasonable application of law); <em>id</em>., at 527\xe2\x80\x93529 (confirming that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate decision to reject the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was based on the first prong and not the second).

Four expert witnesses testified on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in the District Court proceedings.  One explained that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental problems are indicative of \xe2\x80\x9cschizo-affective disorder,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 App. 143, resulting in a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine delusion\xe2\x80\x9d involving his understanding of the reason for his execution, <em>id</em>., at 157.  According to the expert, this delusion has recast petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s execution as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of spiritual warfare \xe2\x80\xa6 between the demons and the forces of the darkness and God and the angels and the forces of light.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 149.  As a result, the expert explained, although petitioner claims to understand \xe2\x80\x9cthat the state is saying that [it wishes] to execute him for [his] murder[s],\xe2\x80\x9d he believes in earnest that the stated reason is a \xe2\x80\x9csham\xe2\x80\x9d and the State in truth wants to execute him \xe2\x80\x9cto stop him from preaching.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s other expert witnesses reached similar conclusions concerning the strength and sincerity of this \xe2\x80\x9cfixed delusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 203; see also <em>id</em>., at 202, 231\xe2\x80\x93232, 333.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert witnesses resisted the conclusion that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s stated beliefs were necessarily indicative of incompetency, see <em>id</em>., at 240, 247, 304, particularly in light of his perceived ability to understand certain concepts and, at times, to be \xe2\x80\x9cclear and lucid,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 243; see also <em>id</em>., at 244, 304, 312, they acknowledged evidence of mental problems, see <em>id</em>., at 239, 245, 308.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttal witness attempted to reconcile the experts\xe2\x80\x99 testimony:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, first, you have to understand that when somebody is schizophrenic, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish their cognitive ability\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Instead, you have a situation where\xe2\x80\x94and why we call schizophrenia thought dis-\norder[\xe2\x80\x94]the logical integration and reality connection of their thoughts are disrupted, so the stimulus comes in, and instead of being analyzed and processed in a rational, logical, linear sort of way, it gets scrambled up and it comes out in a tangential, circumstantial, symbolic \xe2\x80\xa6 not really relevant kind of way.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of somebody being schizophrenic\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Now, it may be that if they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with someone who\xe2\x80\x99s more familiar \xe2\x80\xa6 [in] what may feel like a safer, more enclosed environment \xe2\x80\xa6 those sorts of interactions may be reasonably lucid whereas a more extended conversation about more loaded material would reflect the severity of his mental illness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 328\xe2\x80\x93329.</p>\n<p align="left">See also <em>id</em>., at 203 (suggesting that an unmedicated individual suffering from schizophrenia can \xe2\x80\x9cat times\xe2\x80\x9d hold an ordinary conversation and that \xe2\x80\x9cit depends [whether the discussion concerns the individual\xe2\x80\x99s] fixed delusional system\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is, in short, much in the record to support the conclusion that petitioner suffers from severe delusions.  See,<em> e.g</em>., 1 App.<em> </em>157, 149, 202\xe2\x80\x93203, 231\xe2\x80\x93232, 328\xe2\x80\x93329, 333; see generally <em>id</em>., at 136\xe2\x80\x93353.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legal inquiry concerns whether these delusions can be said to render him incompetent.  The Court of Appeals held that they could not.  That holding, we conclude, rests on a flawed interpretation of <em>Ford</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals stated that competency is determined by whether a prisoner is aware \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that he [is] going to be executed and why he [is] going to be executed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 448 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 819 (quoting <em>Barnard</em>, 13 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 877); see also 448 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 818 (discussing <em>Ford, </em>477 U. S., at 421\xe2\x80\x93422 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).  To this end, the Court of Appeals identified the relevant District Court findings as follows: first, petitioner is aware that he committed the murders; second, he is aware that he will be executed; and, third, he is aware that the reason the State has given for the execution is his commission of the crimes in question.  448 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 817.  Under Circuit precedent this ends the analysis as a matter of law; for the Court of Appeals regards these three factual findings as necessarily demonstrating that a prisoner is aware of the reason for his execution.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded that its standard foreclosed petitioner from establishing incompetency by the means he now seeks to employ: a showing that his mental illness obstructs a rational understanding of the State\xe2\x80\x99s reason for his execution.  <em>Id</em>., at 817\xe2\x80\x93818.  As the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause we hold that \xe2\x80\x98awareness,\xe2\x80\x99 as that term is used in <em>Ford</em>, is not necessarily synonymous with \xe2\x80\x98rational understanding,\xe2\x80\x99 as argued by [petitioner,] we conclude that the district court\xe2\x80\x99s findings are sufficient to establish that [petitioner] is competent to be executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 821.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 standard is too restrictive to afford a prisoner the protections granted by the Eighth Amendment.  The opinions in <em>Ford</em>, it must be acknowledged, did not set forth a precise standard for competency.  The four-Justice plurality discussed the substantive standard at a high level of generality; and Justice Powell wrote only for himself when he articulated more specific criteria.  Yet in the portion of Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s discussion constituting the opinion of the Court (the portion Justice Powell joined) the majority did reach the express conclusion that the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cplaces a substantive restriction on the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to take the life of an insane prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ford</em>, 477 U. S., at 405.  The Court stated the foundation for this principle as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]oday, no less than before, we may seriously question the retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and stripped of his fundamental right to life\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Similarly, the natural abhorrence civilized societies feel at killing one who has no capacity to come to grips with his own conscience or deity is still vivid today.  And the intuition that such an execution simply of-fends humanity is evidently shared across this Nation. Faced with such widespread evidence of a restriction upon sovereign power, this Court is compelled to conclude that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 409\xe2\x80\x93410.</p>\n<p align="left">Writing for four Justices, Justice Marshall concluded by indicating that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of \xe2\x80\x9cone whose mental illness prevents him from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or its implications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 417.  Justice Powell, in his separate opinion, asserted that the Eighth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cforbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 422.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 standard treats a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s delusional belief system as irrelevant if the prisoner knows that the State has identified his crimes as the reason for his execution.  See 401 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 712 (indicating that under Circuit precedent \xe2\x80\x9ca petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s delusional beliefs\xe2\x80\x94even those which may result in a fundamental failure to appreciate the connection between the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s crime and his execution\xe2\x80\x94do not bear on the question of whether the petitioner \xe2\x80\x98knows the reason for his execution\xe2\x80\x99 for the purposes of the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id</em>., at 711\xe2\x80\x93712.  Yet the <em>Ford</em> opinions nowhere indicate that delusions are irrelevant to \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehen[sion]\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x9caware[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d if they so impair the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s concept of reality that he cannot reach a rational understanding of the reason for the execution.  If anything, the <em>Ford</em> majority suggests the opposite.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Explaining the prohibition against executing a prisoner who has lost his sanity, Justice Marshall in the controlling portion of his opinion set forth various rationales, including recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe execution of an insane person simply offends humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 407; that it \xe2\x80\x9cprovides no example to others,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cit is uncharitable to dispatch an offender into another world, when he is not of a capacity to fit himself for it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>. (internal quotation marks omitted); that \xe2\x80\x9cmadness is its own punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> and that executing an insane person serves no retributive purpose, <em>id</em>., at 408.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Considering the last\xe2\x80\x94whether retribution is served\xe2\x80\x94it might be said that capital punishment is imposed because it has the potential to make the offender recognize at last the gravity of his crime and to allow the community as a whole, including the surviving family and friends of the victim, to affirm its own judgment that the culpability of the prisoner is so serious that the ultimate penalty must be sought and imposed.  The potential for a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of the severity of the offense and the objective of community vindication are called in question, however, if the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.  This problem is not necessarily overcome once the test set forth by the Court of Appeals is met.  And under a similar logic the other rationales set forth by <em>Ford</em> fail to align with the distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether <em>Ford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into competency is formulated as a question of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehen[d] the reasons\xe2\x80\x9d for his punishment or as a determination into whether he is \xe2\x80\x9cunaware of \xe2\x80\xa6 why [he is] to suffer it,\xe2\x80\x9d then, the approach taken by the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with <em>Ford</em>.  The principles set forth in <em>Ford</em> are put at risk by a rule that deems delusions relevant only with respect to the State\xe2\x80\x99s announced reason for a punishment or the fact of an imminent execution, see 448 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 819, 821, as opposed to the real interests the State seeks to vindicate.  We likewise find no support elsewhere in <em>Ford</em>, including in its discussions of the common law and the state standards, for the proposition that a prisoner is automatically foreclosed from demonstrating incompetency once a court has found he can identify the stated reason for his execution.  A prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it.  <em>Ford</em> does not foreclose inquiry into the latter.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to deny the fact that a concept like rational understanding is difficult to define.  And we must not ignore the concern that some prisoners, whose cases are not implicated by this decision, will fail to understand why they are to be punished on account of reasons other than those stemming from a severe mental illness.  The mental state requisite for competence to suffer capital punishment neither presumes nor requires a person who would be considered \xe2\x80\x9cnormal,\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9crational,\xe2\x80\x9d in a layperson\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of those terms.  Someone who is condemned to death for an atrocious murder may be so callous as to be unrepentant; so self-centered and devoid of compassion as to lack all sense of guilt; so adept in transferring blame to others as to be considered, at least in the colloquial sense, to be out of touch with reality.  Those states of mind, even if extreme compared to the criminal population at large, are not what petitioner contends lie at the threshold of a competence inquiry.  The beginning of doubt about competence in a case like petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s is not a misanthropic personality or an amoral character.  It is a psychotic disorder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s submission is that he suffers from a severe, documented mental illness that is the source of gross delusions preventing him from comprehending the meaning and purpose of the punishment to which he has been sentenced.  This argument, we hold, should have been considered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flaws of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 test are pronounced in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Circuit precedent required the District Court to disregard evidence of psychological dysfunction that, in the words of the judge, may have resulted in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental failure to appreciate the connection between the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s crime and his execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  401 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 712.  To refuse to consider evidence of this nature is to mistake <em>Ford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding and its logic.  Gross delusions stemming from a severe mental disorder may put an awareness of a link between a crime and its punishment in a context so far removed from reality that the punishment can serve no proper purpose.  It is therefore error to derive from <em>Ford</em>, and the substantive standard for incompetency its opinions broadly identify, a strict test for competency that treats delusional beliefs as irrelevant once the prisoner is aware the State has identified the link between his crime and the punishment to be inflicted.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we reject the standard followed by the Court of Appeals, we do not attempt to set down a rule governing all competency determinations.  The record is not as informative as it might be, even on the narrower issue of how a mental illness of the sort alleged by petitioner might affect this analysis.  In overseeing the development of the record and in making its factual findings, the District Court found itself bound to analyze the question of competency in the terms set by Circuit precedent.  It acknowledged, for example, the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult issue\xe2\x80\x9d posed by the delusions allegedly interfering with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the reason behind his execution, 401 F. Supp. 2d, at 712, but it refrained from making definitive findings of fact with respect to these matters, see <em>id</em>., at 709.  See also <em>id</em>., at 712 (identifying testimony by Dr. Mark Cunningham indicating that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cbelieves the State is in league with the forces of evil that have conspired against him\xe2\x80\x9d and, as a result, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not even understand that the State of Texas is a lawfully constituted authority,\xe2\x80\x9d but refraining from setting forth definitive findings of fact concerning whether this was an accurate characterization of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mindset).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court declined to consider the significance those findings might have on the ultimate question of competency under the Eighth Amendment.  See <em>ibid</em>. (disregarding Dr. Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s testimony in light of Circuit precedent).  And notwithstanding the numerous questions the District Court asked of the witnesses, see,<em> e.g</em>., 1 App. 191\xe2\x80\x93197, 216\xe2\x80\x93218, 234\xe2\x80\x93237, 321\xe2\x80\x93323, it did not press the experts on the difficult issue it identified in its opinion, see <em>ibid</em>.  The District Court, of course, was bound by Circuit precedent, and the record was developed pursuant to a standard we have found to be improper.  As a result, we find it difficult to amplify our conclusions or to make them more precise.  We are also hesitant to decide a question of this complexity before the District Court and the Court of Appeals have addressed, in a more definitive manner and in light of the expert evidence found to be probative, the nature and severity of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mental problems.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The underpinnings of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims should be explained and evaluated in further detail on remand.  The conclusions of physicians, psychiatrists, and other experts in the field will bear upon the proper analysis.  Expert evidence may clarify the extent to which severe delusions may render a subject\xe2\x80\x99s perception of reality so distorted that he should be deemed incompetent.  Cf. Brief for American Psychological Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17\xe2\x80\x9319 (discussing the ways in which mental health experts can inform competency determinations).  And there is precedent to guide a court conducting Eighth Amendment analysis.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93564 (2005); <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, 311\xe2\x80\x93314 (2002); <em>Ford</em>, 477 U.

While Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness may make him a sympathetic figure, state and federal courts have repeatedly held that he is competent to face the consequences of the two murders he committed.  In a competency hearing prior to his trial in 1995, a jury determined that Panetti was competent to stand trial.  A judge then determined that Panetti was competent to represent himself.  At his trial, the jury rejected Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s insanity defense, which was supported by the testimony of two psychiatrists.  Since the trial, both state and federal habeas courts have rejected Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s claims that he was incompetent to stand trial and incompetent to waive his right to counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case should be simple.  Panetti brings a claim under <em>Ford</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/399/index.html"></a><a href="/us/477/399/index.html">477 U. S. 399</a> (1986), that he is incompetent to be executed.  Presented for the first time in Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s second federal habeas application, this claim undisputedly does not meet the statutory requirements for filing a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d habeas application.  As such, Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s habeas application must be dismissed.  Ignoring this clear statutory mandate, the Court bends over backwards to allow Panetti to bring his <em>Ford</em> claim despite no evidence that his condition has worsened\xe2\x80\x94or even changed\xe2\x80\x94since 1995.  Along the way, the Court improperly refuses to defer to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of competency even though Panetti had the opportunity to submit evidence and to respond to the court-appointed experts\xe2\x80\x99 report.  Moreover, without undertaking even a cursory Eighth Amendment analysis, the Court imposes a new standard for determining incompetency.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) requires applicants to receive permission from the court of appeals prior to filing second or successive federal habeas applications.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b)(3).  Even if permission is sought, AEDPA requires courts to decline such requests in all but two narrow circumstances.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(3)(C); \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Panetti raised his <em>Ford</em> claim for the first time in his second federal habeas application, <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, 9, but he admits that he did not seek authorization from the Court of Appeals and that his claim does not satisfy either of the statutory exceptions.  Accordingly, \xc2\xa72244(b) requires dismissal of Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond \xe2\x80\xa6 habeas corpus application.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches a contrary conclusion by reasoning that AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctakes its full meaning from our case law, including decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (citing <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 486 (2000)).  But the Court fails to identify any pre-AEDPA case that defines, explains, or modifies the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does the Court identify any pre-AEDPA case in which a subsequent habeas application challenging the same state-court judgment was considered anything but \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  To my knowledge, there are no such cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d meant the same thing it does today\xe2\x80\x94any subsequent federal habeas application challenging a state-court judgment that had been previously challenged in a federal habeas application.  See, <em>e.g., Kuhlmann</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/436/index.html">477 U. S. 436</a>, 451\xe2\x80\x93452 (1986) (plurality opinion); <em>Barefoot</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/880/index.html">463 U. S. 880</a>, 895 (1983).  Prior to AEDPA, however, second or successive habeas applications were not always dismissed.  Rather, the pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ doctrine allowed courts to entertain second or successive applications in certain circumstances.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b) Rule 9(b) (1994 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cA second or successive petition may be dismissed [when] new and different grounds are alleged [if] the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>McCleskey</em> v. <em>Zant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/467/index.html">499 U. S. 467</a>, 470 (1991); <em>Kuhlmann</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 451\xe2\x80\x93452 (plurality opinion); <em>Barefoot</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 895.  Consistent with this practice, prior to AEDPA, federal courts treated <em>Ford</em> claims raised in subsequent habeas applications as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d but usually allowed such claims to proceed under the abuse of the writ doctrine.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  See<em> Martin</em> v. <em>Dugger</em>, 686 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1523, 1528 (SD Fla. 1988) (permitting a <em>Ford </em>claim raised in a \xe2\x80\x9csecond\xe2\x80\x9d habeas petition \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause <em>Ford </em>was a substantial change in constitutional law [and the prisoner] was unaware of the legal significance of relevant facts\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Barnard</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, 13 F.\xc2\xa03d 871, 875, 878 (CA5 1994); <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Delo</em>, 762 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 853, 857\xe2\x80\x93859 (ED Mo. 1991); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Cabana</em>, 661 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 356, 364 (SD Miss. 1987).  Still, though, at least one court found a <em>Ford </em>claim raised in a subsequent application to be an abuse of the writ.  <em>Rector</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, 783 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 398, 402\xe2\x80\x93404 (ED Ark. 1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When it enacted AEDPA, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cfurther restrict[ed] the availability of relief to habeas petitioners\xe2\x80\x9d and placed new \xe2\x80\x9climits on successive petitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 664 (1996).  Instead of the judicial discretion that governed second or successive habeas applications prior to AEDPA, Congress required dismissal of all second and successive applications except in two specified circumstances.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).  AEDPA thus eliminated much of the discretion that previously saved second or successive habeas petitions from dismissal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stating that we \xe2\x80\x9cha[ve] declined to interpret \xe2\x80\x98second or successive\xe2\x80\x99 as referring to all \xc2\xa72254 applications filed second or successively in time,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, the Court relies upon <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/637/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/637/index.html">523 U. S. 637</a>, 640, 645\xe2\x80\x93646 (1998), in which we held that a subsequent application raising a <em>Ford</em> claim could go forward.  In that case, however, the applicant had raised a <em>Ford </em>claim in his initial habeas application, and the District Court had dismissed it as unripe.  523 U. S., at 640.  Refusing to treat the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent application as second or successive, the Court simply held that the second application renewed the <em>Ford </em>claim originally presented in the prior application:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis may have been the second time that respondent had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his <em>Ford </em>claim, but this does not mean that there were two separate applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to \xc2\xa72244(b).  There was only one application for habeas relief, and the District Court ruled (or should have ruled) on each claim at the time it became ripe.  Respondent was entitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  523 U. S., at 643.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn other words, <em>Martinez-Villareal</em> held that where an applicant raises a <em>Ford </em>claim in an initial habeas application, \xc2\xa72244 does not bar a second application once the claim ripens because the second application is a continuation of the first application.  523 U. S., at 643\xe2\x80\x93645; cf. <em>Burton </em>v.<em> Stewart</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nlike Burton, the prisoner [in <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>] had attempted to bring this claim in his initial habeas petition\xe2\x80\x9d).<em>  Martinez-Villareal</em> does not apply here because Panetti did not bring his <em>Ford</em> claim in his initial habeas application.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not and cannot argue that any time a claim would not be ripe in the first habeas petition, it may be raised in a later habeas petition.  We unanimously rejected such an argument in <em>Burton</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, <em>supra.</em>  In <em>Burton</em>, the petitioner filed a federal habeas petition challenging his convictions but not challenging his sentence, which was at that time still on review in the state courts.  After the state courts rejected his sentencing claims, the petitioner filed a second federal habeas petition, this time challenging his sentence.  The Ninth Circuit held that Burton\xe2\x80\x99s second petition was not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA, \xe2\x80\x9creason[ing] that because Burton had not exhausted his sentencing claims in state court when he filed the [first] petition, they were not ripe for federal habeas review at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Ninth Circuit found that the second petition was not foreclosed by AEDPA since the claim would not have been ripe if raised in the first petition.  <em>Ibid</em>.  We rejected the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view and held that AEDPA barred Burton\xe2\x80\x99s second petition.  In light of <em>Burton</em>, it simply cannot be maintained that Panetti is excused from \xc2\xa72244\xe2\x80\x99s requirements solely because his <em>Ford </em>claim would have been unripe had he included it in his first habeas application.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision thus stands only for the proposition that <em>Ford </em>claims somehow deserve a special (and unjustified) exemption from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain import.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because neither AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s text, pre-AEDPA precedent, nor our AEDPA jurisprudence supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court falls back on judicial economy considerations.  The Court suggests that my interpretation of the statute would create an incentive for every prisoner, regardless of his mental state, to raise and preserve a <em>Ford </em>claim in the event the prisoner later becomes insane.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Even if this comes to pass, it would not be the catastrophe the Court suggests.  District courts could simply dismiss unripe <em>Ford </em>claims outright, and habeas applicants could then raise them in subsequent petitions under the safe harbor established by <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>.  Requiring that <em>Ford </em>claims be included in an initial habeas application would have the added benefit of putting a State on notice that a prisoner intends to challenge his or her competency to be executed.  In any event, regardless of whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern is justified, judicial economy considerations cannot override AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.  Remaining faithful to AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate, I would dismiss Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s application as second or successive.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also errs in holding that the state court unreasonably applied \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d Supreme Court precedent by failing to afford Panetti adequate procedural protections.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  Panetti is entitled to habeas relief only if the state-court proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Even if Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in <em>Ford</em> qualifies as clearly established federal law on this point, the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Ford</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The procedural rights described in <em>Ford</em> are triggered only upon \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial threshold showing of insanity.\xe2\x80\x9d  477 U.

Far from containing \xe2\x80\x9cpointed observations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17, Dr. Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s letter is unsworn, contains no diagnosis, and does not discuss whether Panetti understood why he was being executed.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s other exhibit was a one-page declaration of a <em>law professor</em> who attended Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s 85-minute meeting with Panetti.  Declaration of David R. Dow (Feb. 3, 2004), <em>id.,</em> at 110.  Professor Dow obviously made no medical diagnosis and simply discussed his lay perception of Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition in a cursory manner.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court describes Dow as an \xe2\x80\x9cexpert,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17, but law professors are obviously not experts when it comes to medical or psychological diagnoses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s Renewed Motion attached no medical reports or records, no sworn testimony from any medical professional, and no diagnosis of any medical condition.  The Court claims that Panetti referred \xe2\x80\x9cto the extensive evidence of mental dysfunction considered in earlier legal proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But as the Federal District Court noted, Panetti merely \xe2\x80\x9coutlined his mental health history for the time period from 1981 until 1997.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order in Case No. A\xe2\x80\x9304\xe2\x80\x93CA\xe2\x80\x93042\xe2\x80\x93SS (Jan. 30, 2004), p.\xc2\xa04.  This evidence\xe2\x80\x94previously rejected by the state and federal courts that adjudicated Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s other incompetency claims\xe2\x80\x94had no relevance to Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s competency to be executed in 2004 when he filed his <em>Renewed </em>Motion.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In addition to the utter lack of new medical evidence, no layperson who had observed Panetti on a day-to-day basis, such as prison guards or fellow inmates, submitted an affidavit or even a letter.  In short, Panetti supported his alleged incompetency with only the preliminary observations of a psychologist and a lawyer, whose only contact with Panetti was a single 85-minute meeting.  It is absurd to suggest that this quantum of evidence clears the \xe2\x80\x9chigh threshold,\xe2\x80\x9d entitling claimants to the procedural protections described by the plurality and Justice Powell in <em>Ford</em>.  477 U. S., at 417 (plurality opinion); see also <em>id.</em>, at 426 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having determined that Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s evidence exceeded the high threshold set forth in <em>Ford</em>, the Court asserts that <em>Ford</em> requires that \xe2\x80\x9ca court allow a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel the opportunity to make an adequate response to evidence solicited by the state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19 (citing <em>Ford, supra</em>, at 427 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).  Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence states that a prisoner has the right to present his or her evidence to an impartial decisionmaker.  In light of the facts before the Court in <em>Ford</em>, it becomes obvious that in this case Texas more than satisfied any obligations Justice Powell described.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Florida law at issue in <em>Ford</em>, the Governor\xe2\x80\x94not a court\xe2\x80\x94made the final decision as to the condemned prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sanity.  477 U. S., at 412 (plurality opinion).  The prisoner could not submit any evidence and had no opportunity to be heard.  <em>Id.</em>, at 412\xe2\x80\x93413; <em>id.</em>, at 424 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In other words, the Florida procedures required neither a neutral decisionmaker nor an opportunity for the prisoner to present evidence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 412\xe2\x80\x93413; <em>id.</em>, at 424.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against this backdrop, Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence states that due process requires an impartial decisionmaker and a chance to present evidence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe State should provide an impartial officer or board that can receive evidence and argument from the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the State\xe2\x80\x99s own psychiatric examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 427.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn setting forth these minimal procedural protections, Justice Powell explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]eyond these basic requirements, the States should have substantial leeway to determine what process best balances the various interests at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Justice Powell stressed that \xe2\x80\x9cordinary adversarial procedures \xe2\x80\xa6 are not necessarily the best means of arriving at sound, consistent judgments as to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sanity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 426.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because a court considered Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s insanity claim, the state clearly satisfied Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s requirement to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide an impartial officer or board.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at<em> </em>427.  The sole remaining question, then, is whether the state court \xe2\x80\x9creceive[d] evidence and argument from the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the State\xe2\x80\x99s own psychiatric examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset of its discussion, the Court suggests that Texas is not entitled to \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial leeway\xe2\x80\x9d in determining what procedures are appropriate, see <em>Ford, supra,</em> at 427 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), because Texas may have \xe2\x80\x9cviolat[ed] the procedural framework Texas has mandated for the adjudication of incompetency claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  As its sole support for that assertion, the Court states that there is \xe2\x80\x9ca strong argument the court violated state law by failing to provide a competency hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But Article 46.05 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides no right to a competency hearing: \xe2\x80\x9cThe determination of whether to appoint experts and conduct a hearing [under Article 46.05] is within the discretion of the trial court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Caldwell</em>, 58 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 127, 130 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement, <em>ante</em>, at 19, this discretion does not depend on whether a substantial showing of incompetency has been made.  See <em>Caldwell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 130.  Accordingly, there is no basis for denying Texas the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial leeway\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ford</em> grants to States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Texas law allows prisoners to submit \xe2\x80\x9caffidavits, records, or other evidence supporting the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegations\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant is presently incompetent to be executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 46.05 (Vernon Supp. Pamphlet 2006).  Therefore, state law provided Panetti with the legal right to submit whatever evidence he wanted.  Here, it is clear that the state court stood ready and willing to consider any evidence Panetti wished to submit.  The record of the state proceedings shows that Panetti took full advantage of this opportunity.  For example, after the court-appointed experts presented their report, the state court gave Panetti a chance to respond, 1 App. 78, and Panetti filed a 17-page brief objecting to the report and arguing that there were problems in its methodology.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Objections to Experts\xe2\x80\x99 Report, 1 App. 79.  No extensive consideration of Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s submitted evidence was necessary because the submissions\xe2\x80\x94the single-page statements of one doctor and one lawyer\xe2\x80\x94were paltry and unpersuasive.  That the evidence presented did not warrant more extensive examination does not change the fact that Panetti had an unlimited opportunity to submit evidence to the state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, the report by the court-appointed experts, and Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s objections to that report, the state court found that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]efendant has failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is incompetent to be executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 99.  Given Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s meager evidentiary submissions, it is unsurprising that the state court declined to proceed further.  The Court asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe order issued by the state court implied that its determination of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s competency [improperly] was made solely on the basis of the examinations performed by the psychiatrists it had appointed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  However, the order\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>focus on the report of the court-appointed experts indicates only that the court found the report to be persuasive.  1 App. 99.  Supported by the persuasive report of two neutral experts, the court reasonably concluded that Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s meager evidence deserved no mention.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93A,<em> supra</em>.  In my view, the state court fairly implemented the procedures described by Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Ford</em>\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9creceive evidence and argument from the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  477 U. S., at 427.  At the very least, the state court did not unreasonably apply his concurrence.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because it cannot dispute that Panetti had an unlimited opportunity to present evidence, the Court argues that the state court \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to provide petitioner with an adequate opportunity to submit expert evidence in response to the report filed by the court-appointed experts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  According to the Court, this opportunity was denied to Panetti because the state court failed to rule explicitly on his motions and failed to warn him that he would receive no evidentiary hearing.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  This position has no factual basis.  After the court-appointed experts submitted their report, the state court made it clear that the case was proceeding to conclusion and that Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s counsel needed to submit anything else he wanted the judge to consider:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears from the evaluations performed by Dr. Mary Anderson and Dr. George Parker that they are of the opinion that Mr. Panetti is competent to be executed in accordance with the standards set out in Art. 46.05 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gross, if you have any other matters you wish to have considered, please file them in the case papers and get me copies by 5:00 p.m. on May 21, 2004.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from District Judge Stephen B. Ables in Cause No. 3310 (May 14, 2004), 1 App. 77\xe2\x80\x9378.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s counsel got the message.  Far from assuming that there would be a hearing, <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, counsel renewed his motion requesting a competency hearing and his motion seeking state funding for a mental health expert.  1 App. 96\xe2\x80\x9398.  Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s filing indicates that he understood that no hearing was currently scheduled and that if he wanted to convince the state court not to deny relief, he needed to do so immediately.  See <em>id.</em>, at 80\xe2\x80\x9395.  The record demonstrates that what Panetti actually sought was not the opportunity to submit additional evidence\xe2\x80\x94because, at that time, he had no further evidence to submit\xe2\x80\x94but state funding for his pursuit of more evidence.  See Ex Parte Motion for Prepayment of Funds to Hire Mental Health Expert to Assist Defense in Article 46.05 Proceedings in Cause No. 3310 (Feb. 19, 2004), <em>id.,</em> at 54; Ex Parte Motion for Prepayment of Funds to Hire an Investigator to Assist Defense Counsel in Cause No. 3310 (Feb. 19, 2004); Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Motion for Appointment of Counsel to Assist Him in Article 46.05 Proceedings in Cause No. 3310 (Feb. 19, 2004), <em>id.,</em> at 45; Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s Response to Show Cause Order in Case No. A\xe2\x80\x9304\xe2\x80\x93CA\xe2\x80\x93042\xe2\x80\x93SS (June 3, 2004), p. 5; cf. Order in Case No. A\xe2\x80\x9304\xe2\x80\x93CA\xe2\x80\x93042\xe2\x80\x93SS (Jan. 30, 2004), p. 4.  This Court has never recognized a constitutional right to state funding for counsel in state habeas proceedings\xe2\x80\x94much less for experts\xe2\x80\x94and Texas law grants no such right in <em>Ford </em>proceedings.  <em>E.g., Ex parte Caldwell</em>, 58 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 127, 130 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (holding that funding for counsel or experts in Article 46.05 proceedings is at the discretion of the district court);<em> Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 755 (1991) (noting that there is no constitutional right to state-funded counsel in state habeas cases).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Panetti would have submitted any additional evidence had he been given another opportunity to do so.  Panetti never requested more time to submit evidence and never told the court that he wanted to submit additional evidence in the event that his requests for fees were denied.  Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s track record of submitting no new evidence in his first Article 46.05 motion, <em>supra</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa06, and only two insubstantial exhibits in his second, Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>, suggests that it was highly unlikely that Panetti planned to present anything else.  Accordingly, the state-court proceedings to evaluate Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s insanity claim were not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or \xe2\x80\xa6 an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the state court did not unreasonably apply Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>procedural analysis, we must defer to its determination that Panetti was competent to be executed.  See \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Thus, Panetti is entitled to federal habeas relief only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that he is competent to be executed \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\xe2\x80\x9d Supreme Court precedent or \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d).  Not even Panetti argues that this standard is met here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s substantive standard for competency, the state court determined that Panetti was competent to be executed, 1 App. 99; see also Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 46.05(h), a factual determination that is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(e)(1).  That factual determination was based on an expert report by two doctors with almost no evidence to the contrary.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93A,<em> supra.</em>  Hence, Panetti is not entitled to federal habeas relief under \xc2\xa72254.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we lack jurisdiction under AEDPA to consider Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s claim and because, even if jurisdiction were proper, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision constitutes a reasonable application of federal law, I will not address whether the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 standard for insanity is substantively correct.  I do, however, reject the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to answering that question.  The Court parses the opinions in <em>Ford</em> to impose an additional constitutional requirement without undertaking any Eighth Amendment analysis of its own.  Because the Court quibbles over the precise meaning of <em>Ford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s opinions with respect to an issue that was not presented in that case, what emerges is a half-baked holding that leaves the details of the insanity standard for the District Court to work out.  See <em>ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  As its sole justification for thrusting already muddled <em>Ford </em>determinations into such disarray, the Court asserts that <em>Ford </em>itself compels such a result.  It does not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The four-Justice plurality in <em>Ford</em> did not define insanity or create a substantive standard for determining competency.  See 477 U. S., at 418 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not address\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning of in-\nsanity\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Only Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence set forth a standard:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[No state] disputes the need to require that those who are executed know the fact of their impending execution and the reason for it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a standard appropriately defines the kind of mental deficiency that should trigger the Eighth Amendment prohibition.  If the defendant perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law is satisfied.  And only if the defendant is aware that his death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing.  Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at at 422.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBecause the issue before the Court in <em>Ford</em> was actual knowledge, not rational understanding, <em>ibid.</em>, nothing in any of the <em>Ford</em> opinions addresses what to do when a prisoner knows the reason for his execution but does not \xe2\x80\x9crationally understand\xe2\x80\x9d it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tracing the language of Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, the Court of Appeals held that Panetti needed only to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98aware\xe2\x80\x99 of\xe2\x80\x9d the stated reason for his execution.  <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, 448 F.\xc2\xa03d 815, 819 (CA5 2006).  Implicitly, the Court of Appeals also concluded that the fact that Panetti \xe2\x80\x9cdisbelieves the State\xe2\x80\x99s stated reason for executing him,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, 401 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 702, 708 (WD Tex. 2004), does not render him \xe2\x80\x9cunaware\xe2\x80\x9d of the reason for his execution.  The Court challenges this approach based on an expansive interpretation of Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9caware.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  However, the Court does not and cannot deny that \xe2\x80\x9cawareness\xe2\x80\x9d is undefined in <em>Ford</em> and that <em>Ford</em> does not discuss whether \xe2\x80\x9cdelusions [that] so impair the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s concept of reality that he cannot reach a rational understanding of the reason for the execution\xe2\x80\x9d affect awareness in a constitutionally relevant manner.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  Nevertheless, the Court cobbles together stray language from <em>Ford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s multiple opinions and asserts that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 test is somehow inconsistent with the spirit of <em>Ford</em>.  Because that result does not follow naturally from <em>Ford</em>, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion can be understood only as holding for the first time that the Eighth Amendment requires \xe2\x80\x9crational understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although apparently imposing a new substantive Eighth Amendment requirement, the Court assiduously avoids applying our framework for analyzing Eighth Amendment claims.  See<em> Ford, supra</em>, at 405 (first analyzing whether execution of the insane was among \xe2\x80\x9cthose modes or acts of punishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted\xe2\x80\x9d in 1791); <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (2005) (considering also whether the punishment is deemed cruel and unusual according to modern \xe2\x80\x9cstandards of decency\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U.
