The court denied the motion and, as relevant here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that heroin was a contributing cause of death.

The episode began on the morning of April 14, when Banka smoked marijuana at a former roommate\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Banka stole oxycodone pills from the roommate before departing and later crushed, cooked, and injected the oxycodone.  Banka and his wife, Tammy Noragon Banka (Noragon), then met with petitioner Marcus Burrage and purchased one gram of heroin from him.  Banka immediately cooked and injected some of the heroin and, after returning home, injected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April 15.  Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after witnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin.  When Noragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead in the bathroom and called 911.  A search of the couple\xe2\x80\x99s home and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin, alprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a bottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).  Only one of those offenses, count 2, is atissue here.  (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of heroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.)  Count 2 alleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on April 14, 2010, and that \xe2\x80\x9cdeath . . . resulted from the use of th[at] substance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thus subjecting Burrage to the 20-year mandatory minimum of \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the cause of Banka\xe2\x80\x99s death.  Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic toxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present in Banka\xe2\x80\x99s system at the time of his death, including heroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metab-olites, and oxycodone.  (A metabolite is a \xe2\x80\x9cproduct ofmetabolism,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a drug breaks down into in the body,\xe2\x80\x9d 687 F. 3d 1015, 1018, n.\xc2\xa02 (CA8 2012).)  Although morphine, a heroin metabolite, was the only drug present at a level abovethe therapeutic range\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the concentration normally present when a person takes a drug as prescribed\xe2\x80\x94Dr. Schwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin.  Dr. Schwilke nonetheless concluded that heroin \xe2\x80\x9cwas a contributing factor\xe2\x80\x9d inBanka\xe2\x80\x99s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to cause \xe2\x80\x9crespiratory and/or central nervous system depression.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 196.  The heroin, in other words, contributed to an overall effect that caused Banka to stop breathing.  Dr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner, came to similar conclusions.  She described the cause of death as \xe2\x80\x9cmixed drug intoxication\xe2\x80\x9d with heroin, oxycodone, alprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a \xe2\x80\x9ccontributing\xe2\x80\x9d role.  Id., at 157.  Dr. McLemore could not say whether Banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but observed that Banka\xe2\x80\x99s death would have been \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ery less likely.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 171.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court denied Burrage\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a judgment of acquittal, which argued that Banka\xe2\x80\x99s death did not \xe2\x80\x9cresult from\xe2\x80\x9d heroin use because there was no evidence that heroin was a but-for cause of death.  Id., at 30.  The court also declined to give Burrage\xe2\x80\x99s proposed jury instructions regarding causation.  One of those instructions would have required the Government to prove that heroin use \xe2\x80\x9cwas the proximate cause of [Banka\xe2\x80\x99s] death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 236.  Another would have defined proximate cause as\xe2\x80\x9ca cause of death that played a substantial part in bringing about the death,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he death musthave been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable consequence of the cause and except for the cause the death would not have occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 238.  The court instead gave an instruction requiring the Government to prove \xe2\x80\x9cthat the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a contributing cause of Joshua Banka\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 241\xe2\x80\x93242.  The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the court sentenced him to 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, consistent with \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed minimum.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Burrage\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  687 F.\xc2\xa03d 1015.  As to the causation-in-fact element of count 2, the court held that theDistrict Court\xe2\x80\x99s contributing-cause instruction was consistent with its earlier decision in United States v. Monnier, 412 F.\xc2\xa03d 859, 862 (CA8 2005).  See 687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1021.  As to proximate cause, the court held that Burrage\xe2\x80\x99s proposed instructions \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not correctly state the law\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ca showing of \xe2\x80\x98proximate cause\xe2\x80\x99 is not required.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1020 (quoting United States v.

United States, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).  That changed in 1986 when Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act,\n\n100Stat.\n3207, which redefined the offense categories, increased the maximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many offenders, including the \xe2\x80\x9cdeath results\xe2\x80\x9d enhancement at issue here.  See id., at 3207\xe2\x80\x934.  With respect to violations involving distribution of a Schedule I or II substance (the types of drugs defined as the most dangerous and addictive[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]) the Act imposes sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment for large-scale distributions, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A), from 5 to 40 years for medium-scale distribu-tions, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B), and not more than 20 years forsmaller distributions, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(C), the type of offense at issue here.  These default sentencing rules do not apply, however, when \xe2\x80\x9cdeath or serious bodily injury results from the use of [the distributed] substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C).  In those instances, the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than twenty years or more than life,\xe2\x80\x9d a substantial fine, \xe2\x80\x9cor both.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because the \xe2\x80\x9cdeath results\xe2\x80\x9d enhancement increased the minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was exposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315); Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466,\n490 (2000)\n.  Thus, the crime charged in count 2 of Burrage\xe2\x80\x99s superseding indictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or intentional distribution of heroin, \xc2\xa7841(a)(1),[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] and (ii) death caused by (\xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d) the use of that drug, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept, consisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal cause.  H. Hart &amp; A. Honor\xc3\xa9, Causation in the Law 104 (1959).  When a crime requires \xe2\x80\x9cnot merely conduct but also a specified result of conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant generally may not be convicted unless his conduct is \xe2\x80\x9cboth (1) the actual cause, and (2) the \xe2\x80\x98legal\xe2\x80\x99 cause (often called the \xe2\x80\x98proximate cause\xe2\x80\x99) of the result.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa76.4(a), pp. 464\xe2\x80\x93466 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.03,p. 25 (1985).  Those two categories roughly coincide with the two questions on which we granted certiorari.  We find it necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of heroin was the actual cause of Banka\xe2\x80\x99s death in the sense that \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(C) requires.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Controlled Substances Act does not define the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresults from,\xe2\x80\x9d so we give it its ordinary meaning.  See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 179,\n187 (1995)\n.

The Model Penal Code reflects this traditional understanding; it states that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onduct is the cause of a result\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cit is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72.03(1)(a).

Thus, if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without the incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.

Consider a baseball game in which the visiting team\xe2\x80\x99s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of the first inning.  If the visiting team goes on to win by a score of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English language and familiar with the American pastime would agree that the victory resulted from the home run.  This is so because it is natural to say that one event is the outcome or consequence of another when the former would not have occurred but for the latter.  It is beside the point that the victory also resulted from a host of other necessary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach\xe2\x80\x99s decision to put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league\xe2\x80\x99s decision to schedule the game.  By contrast, it makes little sense to say that an event resulted from or was the outcome of some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event.  If the visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than 1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page that the victory resulted from the leadoff batter\xe2\x80\x99s early, non-dispositive home run.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the contrary, courts regularly read phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cresults from\xe2\x80\x9d to require but-for causality.  Our interpretation of statutes that prohibit adverse employment action \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d an employee\xe2\x80\x99s age or complaints about unlawful workplace discrimination is instructive.

The same result obtained in an earlier case interpreting a provision in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for an employer . . . to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) (emphasis added).

Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co.,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 639\n\xe2\x80\x93654 (2008)).  See also Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,\n\n503 U. S. 258\n\xe2\x80\x93268 (1992) (explaining that a statute permitting recovery for injuries suffered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98by reason of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful conduct \xe2\x80\x9crequire[s] a showing that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s violation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was,\xe2\x80\x9d among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98but for\xe2\x80\x99 cause of his injury\xe2\x80\x9d).  State courts, which hear and decide the bulk of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s criminal matters, usually interpret similarly worded crim-inal statutes in the same manner.  See, e.g., People v. Wood, 276 Mich. App. 669, 671, 741 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 574, 575\xe2\x80\x93578 (2007) (construing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the violation results in the death of another individual\xe2\x80\x9d to require proof of but-for causation (emphasis deleted)); State v.

The Government argues, however, that distinctive problems associated with drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with the usual but-for causation requirement.  Addicts often take drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010 involved more than one drug.  See Brief for United States 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  This consideration leads the Government to urge an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cresults from\xe2\x80\x9d under which use of a drug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for cause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause death, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such as mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of death.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In support of its argument, the Government can point to the undoubted reality that courts have not always required strict but-for causality, even where criminal liability is at issue.  The most common (though still rare) instance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes independently, but concurrently, produce a result.  See Nassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467 (describing these cases as \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnumerically in the minority\xe2\x80\x9d).  To illustrate, if \xe2\x80\x9cA stabs B, inflicting a fatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting independently, shoots B in the head .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. also inflicting [a fatal] wound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two wounds,\xe2\x80\x9d A will generally be liable for homicide even though his conduct was not a but-for cause of B\xe2\x80\x99s death (since B would have died from X\xe2\x80\x99s actions in any event).  Id., at 468 (italics omitted).  We need not accept or reject the special rule developed for these cases, since there was no evidence here that Banka\xe2\x80\x99s heroin use was an independently sufficient cause of his death.  No expert was prepared to say that Banka would have died from the heroin use alone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less demanding (but also less well established) line of author-ity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause-in-fact if it was a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontributing\xe2\x80\x9d factor in producing a given result.  Several state courts have adopted such a rule, see State v. Christman, 160 Wash. App. 741, 745, 249 P.\xc2\xa03d 680, 687 (2011); People v. Jennings, 50 Cal. 4th 616, 643, 237 P. 3d 474, 496 (2010); People v. Bailey, 451 Mich. 657, 676\xe2\x80\x93678, 549 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 325, 334\xe2\x80\x93336 (1996); Commonwealth v. Osachuk, 43 Mass. App. 71, 72\xe2\x80\x9373, 681 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 292, 294 (1997), but the American Law Institute declined to do so in its Model Penal Code, see ALI, 39th Annual Meeting Proceedings 135\xe2\x80\x93141 (1962); see also Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.03(1)(a).  One prominent authority on tort law asserts that \xe2\x80\x9ca broader rule .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has found general acceptance: The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is a cause of the event if it was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing it about.\xe2\x80\x9d  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa741, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted).  But the authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the tort context, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated\xe2\x80\x9d (an apparent reference to the situation where each of two causes is independently effective) \xe2\x80\x9cno case has been found where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s act could be called a substantial factor when the event would have occurred without it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 268.  The authors go on to offer an alternative rule\xe2\x80\x94functionally identical to the one the Government argues here\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the conduct of two or more actors is so related to an event that their combined conduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event, and application of the but-for rule to them individually would absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Yet, as of 1984, \xe2\x80\x9cno judicial opinion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid., n. 40.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdeath results\xe2\x80\x9d enhancement became law just two years later.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We decline to adopt the Government\xe2\x80\x99s permissive interpretation of \xc2\xa7841(b)(1).  The language Congress enacted requires death to \xe2\x80\x9cresult from\xe2\x80\x9d use of the unlawfully distributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which drug use merely contributed.  Congress could have written \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the underlying crime \xe2\x80\x9ccontributes to\xe2\x80\x9d death or serious bodily injury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to cases involving concurrent causes, as five States have done, see Ala. Code \xc2\xa713A\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x935(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\xe2\x80\x93A, \xc2\xa733 (2006); N.\xc2\xa0D. Cent.

Especially in the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n\xe2\x80\x93108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is different from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that disfavors the defendant.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cresults from\xe2\x80\x9d will \xe2\x80\x9cunduly limi[t] criminal responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be reconciled with sound policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 24.  We doubt that the requirement of but-for causation for this incremental punishment will prove a policy disaster.  A cursory search of the Federal Reporter reveals that but-for causation is not nearly the insuper-able barrier the Government makes it out to be.  See, e.g., United States v. Krieger, 628 F.\xc2\xa03d 857, 870\xe2\x80\x93871 (CA7 2010) (affirming \xe2\x80\x9cdeath results\xe2\x80\x9d conviction based on expert testimony that, although the victim had several drugs in her system, the drug distributed by the defendant was a but-for cause of death); United States v. Webb, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d 1238, 1254\xe2\x80\x931255 (CA11 2011) (per curiam) (same).  Moreover, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for causation, the defendant will still be liable for violating \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Indeed, it is more likely the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be reconciled with sound policy,\xe2\x80\x9d given the need for clarity and certainty in the criminal law.  The judicial authorities invoking a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontributing\xe2\x80\x9d factor test in criminal cases differ widely in their application of it.  Compare Wilson v. State, 24 S. W. 409, 410 (Tex. Crim. App. 1893) (an act is an actual cause if it \xe2\x80\x9ccontributed materially\xe2\x80\x9d to a result, even if other concurrent acts would have produced that result on their own), with Cox v. State, 305 Ark. 244, 248, 808 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 306, 309 (1991) (causation cannot be found where other concurrent causes were clearly sufficient to produce the result and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s act was clearly insufficient to produce it (applying Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93205 (1987)).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Here the Government is uncertain about the precise application of the test that it proposes.  Taken literally, its \xe2\x80\x9ccontributing-cause\xe2\x80\x9d test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or omission that makes a positive incremental contribution, however small, to a particular result.  See Brief for State of Alaska et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccontributing cause\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] factor that\xe2\x80\x94though not the primary cause\xe2\x80\x94plays a part in producing a result\xe2\x80\x9d).  But at oral argument the Government insisted that its test excludes causes that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot important enough\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctoo insubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.  Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how important or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.  See id., at 41\xe2\x80\x9342.  Presumably the lower courts would be left to guess.  That task would be particularly vexing since the evidence in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms of probabilities and percentages.  One of the experts in this case, for example, testified that Banka\xe2\x80\x99s death would have been \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ery less likely\xe2\x80\x9d had he not used the heroin that Burrage provided.  App. 171.  Is it sufficient that use of a drug made the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death 50 percent more likely?  Fifteen percent?  Five?  Who knows.  Uncertainty of that kind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the need to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons can comprehend.  See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co.,\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n\xe2\x80\x9390 (1921).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But in the last analysis, these always-fascinating policy discussions are beside the point.  The role of this Court is to apply the statute as it is written\xe2\x80\x94even if we think some other approach might \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98accor[d] with good policy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Commissioner v.
