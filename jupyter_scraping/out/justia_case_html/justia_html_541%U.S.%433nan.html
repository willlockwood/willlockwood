MCNEIL<br/>\n541 U. S. ____ (2004)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">RAYMOND L. MIDDLETON, WARDEN <em>v.</em> SALLY MARIE McNEIL</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931028. Decided May 3, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Sally Marie McNeil killed her husband after an argument over his infidelity and spending habits.  The State of California charged her with murder.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s theory at trial was that her husband had tried to strangle her during the argument, but that she had escaped, fetched a shotgun from the bedroom, and killed him out of fear for her life.  Fingernail marks were indeed found on her neck after the shooting.  She testified that her husband had been abusive, and a defense expert opined that she suffered from Battered Women\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrome.  The State countered with forensic evidence showing that the fingernail marks were not her husband\xe2\x80\x99s and may have been self-inflicted, and with the testimony of a 911 operator who overheard respondent tell her husband she had shot him because she would no longer tolerate his behavior. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under California law, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]urder is the unlawful killing of a human being \xe2\x80\xa6 with malice aforethought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7187(a) (West 1999).  The element of malice is negated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Christian S.</em>, 7 Cal. 4th 768, 773, 872 P.\xc2\xa02d 574, 576 (1994).  Where that fear is unreasonable (but nevertheless genuine), it reduces the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter\xe2\x80\x94a doctrine known as \xe2\x80\x9cimperfect self-defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  At respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the judge instructed the jury on these concepts as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The specific intent for voluntary manslaughter, as opposed to murder, must arise upon one of [the] following circumstances:</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A]n honest but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend oneself against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury.  That would be imperfect self-defense.</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98To establish that a killing is murder [and] not manslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of murder and that the act which caused the death was not done \xe2\x80\xa6 in the honest, even though unreasonable, belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or to great bodily injury.</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A person, who kills another person in the actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, kills unlawfully, but is not guilty of murder.  This would be so even though a reasonable person in the same situation, seeing and knowing the same facts, would not have had the same belief.  Such an actual but unreasonable belief is not a defense to the crime of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98An \xe2\x80\x9cimminent\xe2\x80\x9d peril is one that is apparent, present, immediate and must be instantly dealt with, or must so appear at the time to the slayer as a reasonable person.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 31\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe last four words of this instruction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as a reasonable person\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not part of the relevant form instruction, 1\xc2\xa0California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 5.17 (6th ed. 1996), and were apparently included in error.  The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument, however, correctly stated the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder and appealed on the basis of the erroneous jury instruction.  The California Court of Appeal acknowledged the error but upheld her conviction, reasoning:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eversal is not required because \xe2\x80\x98[e]rror cannot be predicated upon an isolated phrase, sentence or excerpt from the instructions since the correctness of an instruction is to be determined in its relation to the other instructions and in light of the instructions as a whole.\xe2\x80\x99  Here, when all of the jury instructions on voluntary manslaughter and imperfect self-defense, are considered in their entirety, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have misunderstood the requirements of the imperfect self-defense component of voluntary manslaughter.  On the contrary, these instructions repeatedly informed the jury that if the defendant had an honest (or actual) but <em>unreasonable </em>belief in the need to act in self-defense, then the offense would be manslaughter and the defendant could not be convicted of murder.  Furthermore, in arguing to the jury, the prosecutor set forth the appropriate standard, stating \xe2\x80\x98[i]f you believe it is an imperfect self-defense, that she actually believed but that a reasonable person would not believe in the necessity for self-defense, that lessens the crime to what is called, \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary manslaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 33\xe2\x80\x9334 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent then sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court denied her petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  344 F.\xc2\xa03d 988 (2003).  We now grant the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em>,<em> </em>and reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if a state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of his constitutional claim was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere, as here, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of governing federal law is challenged, it must be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Gentry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1/index.html">540 U. S. 1</a>, ___ (2003) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935) <em>(per curiam);</em> see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 409 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a criminal trial, the State must prove every element of the offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if it fails to give effect to that requirement.  See <em>Sandstrom</em> v. <em>Montana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/index.html">442 U. S. 510</a>, 520\xe2\x80\x93521 (1979).  Nonetheless, not every ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency in a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation.  The question is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whether the ailing instruction \xe2\x80\xa6 so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>McGuire,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/62/index.html">502 U. S. 62</a>, 72 (1991) (quoting <em>Cupp</em> v. <em>Naughten,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/141/index.html">414 U. S. 141</a>, 147 (1973)).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a>, 378 (1990) (quoting <em>Cupp</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 146\xe2\x80\x93147).  If the charge as a whole is ambiguous, the question is whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way\xe2\x80\x99 that violates the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Estelle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 72 (quoting <em>Boyde,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 380).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit held that the erroneous imminent-peril instruction \xe2\x80\x9celiminated\xe2\x80\x9d respondent\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect self-defense claim, and that the state court unreasonably applied federal law by \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely ignor[ing] unchallenged and uncorrected instructions to the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  344 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 999.  It acknowledged that it was bound to consider the jury charge as a whole, but held that the other instructions were irrelevant because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only time that the trial judge actually defined imminent peril for the jury was in the erroneous instruction on imperfect self-defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 997.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion failed to give appropriate deference to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s description, the state court did not \xe2\x80\x9cignor[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the faulty instruction.  It merely held that the instruction was not reasonably likely to have misled the jury given the multiple other instances (at least three, see <em>supra</em>, at 2) where the charge correctly stated that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s belief could be unreasonable.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34.  Given three correct instructions and one contrary one, the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law when it found that there was no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit thought that the other references to unreasonableness were irrelevant because they were not part of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cimminent peril.\xe2\x80\x9d  That alone does not make them irrelevant; whether one defines imminent peril in terms of an unreasonable belief or instead describes imperfect self-defense as allowing an unreasonable belief in imminent peril, the import of the instruction is the same.  Perhaps the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the erroneous definition of \xe2\x80\x9cimminent peril\xe2\x80\x9d caused the jury to believe that the earlier, correct instructions (\xe2\x80\x9cactual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril\xe2\x80\x9d) meant that, although the belief in the necessity to defend may be unreasonable, the belief in the <em>existence</em> of the \xe2\x80\x9cimminent peril\xe2\x80\x9d may not.  This interpretation would require such a rare combination of extremely refined lawyerly parsing of an instruction, and extremely gullible acceptance of a result that makes no conceivable sense, that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s implicit rejection of the possibility was surely not an <em>unreasonable</em> application of federal law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relying on the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s argument, noting that instructions from a judge are presumed to have more influence than arguments of counsel.  344 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 999 (citing <em>Boyde,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 384).  But this is not a case where the jury charge clearly says one thing and the prosecutor says the opposite; the instructions were at worst ambiguous because they were internally inconsistent.  Nothing in <em>Boyde </em>precludes a state court from assuming that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s arguments clarified an ambiguous jury charge.  This assumption is particularly apt when it is the <em>prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s</em> argument that resolves an ambiguity in favor of the <em>defendant</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
