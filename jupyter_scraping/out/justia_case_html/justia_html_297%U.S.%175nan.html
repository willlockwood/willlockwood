JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit brought by the United States against the state of California in the District Court for Northern California to recover the statutory penalty of $100 for violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act, \xc2\xa7 2, Act of March 2, 1893, c.196, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2, and \xc2\xa7 6 of the Act, as amended April 1, 1896, 29 Stat. 85, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/175/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that California, in the operation of the state-owned State Belt Railroad, is a common carrier engaged in interstate transportation by railroad, and that it has violated the Safety Appliance Act by hauling over the road a car equipped with defective coupling apparatus.  Upon the trial, without a jury, upon stipulated facts, the District Court gave judgment for the United States.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, 75 F.2d 41, on the ground that, as exclusive jurisdiction of suits to which a state is a party is conferred upon this Court by \xc2\xa7 233 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1156, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 341, the District Court was without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 297 U. S. 181</a></p><p> jurisdiction of the cause.  We granted certiorari to review the case, as one involving questions of public importance, upon a petition of the government which urged that the state is a common carrier by railroad, subject to the Safety Appliance Act, and, under its provisions, to suit in the District Court to recover penalties for violation of the act.</p>\n<p>In an earlier suit, <em>Sherman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/282/25/case.html">282 U. S. 25</a></span>, brought against the Board of State Harbor Commissioners, which supervises operation of the State Belt Railroad, to recover penalties for violation of the Act, this Court set aside the judgment of the District Court for the government because the state had not been made a party.</p>\n<p>1. Whether a transportation agency is a common carrier depends not upon its corporate character or declared purposes, but upon what it does.  <em>United States v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/296/case.html">249 U. S. 296</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/296/case.html#304">249 U. S. 304</a></span>.  The State Belt Railroad is owned and operated by the state, <em>see Sherman v. United States, supra.</em>  It parallels the waterfront of San Francisco harbor and extends onto some forty-five state-owned wharves.  It serves directly about one hundred and seventy-five industrial plants, has track connection with one interstate railroad, and, by wharf connections with freight car ferries, links that and three other interstate rail carriers with freight yards in San Francisco leased to them by the state.  It receives and transports from the one to the other, by its own engines, all freight cars, loaded and empty, and the freight they contain, offered to it by railroads, steamship companies, and industrial plants.  The larger part of this traffic has its origin or destination in states other than California.  For the transportation service, it makes a flat charge per car.  It issues no bills of lading, and is not a party to through rates.  It moves the cars on instructions contained in "switch lists" made out by the delivering or receiving carrier, which pays the charge and absorbs it in its rate.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 297 U. S. 182</a></p><p> charge on cars not delivered to or received from another carrier is paid by the industry concerned.</p>\n<p>The Belt Railroad is thus a terminal railroad for the industries and carriers with which it connects, and it serves as a link in the through transportation of interstate freight shipped to or from points in San Francisco over the connecting carriers.  Its service is of a public character, for hire, and does not differ in any salient feature from that which this Court, in <em>United States v. Brooklyn Terminal, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/296/case.html#304">249 U. S. 304</a></span>-305, held to be common carriage by rail in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Federal Hours of Service Act, 34 Stat. 1415, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 61.</p>\n<p>The state insists that the facts that it maintains no freight station, issues no bills of lading, and is engaged only in moving cars for a flat rate instead of at a charge per hundred pounds of freight moved, distinguish the operation of its railroad from that of the Brooklyn Terminal.  As the service involves transportation of the cars and their contents, the method of fixing the charge is unimportant.  <em>Belt Railway Co. of Chicago v. United States,</em> 168 F. 542, 544; <em>see United States v. Union Stock Yard &amp; Transit Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/226/286/case.html">226 U.

And, while maintenance of a freight station and the issue of bills of lading may be embraced in the service of a common carrier, and a part of interstate commerce, <em>see United States v. Ferger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/250/199/case.html">250 U. S. 199</a></span>, <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry. Co. v.

S. 193</a></span>, they are not indispensable adjuncts to either where the subject of transportation -- here cars loaded and empty -- may be effected without.</p>\n<p>All the essential elements of interstate rail transportation are present in the service rendered by the State Belt Railroad.  They are the receipt and transportation, for the public, for hire, of cars moving in interstate commerce.  <em>See United States v. Union Stock Yard &amp; Transit Co., supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/226/286/case.html#299">226 U. S. 299</a></span>; <em>Union Stockyards Co. v. United</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 297 U. S. 183</a></p><p> <em>States,</em> 169 F. 404; <em>Belt Railway Co. of Chicago v. United States, supra.</em>  Its service, involving as it does the transportation of all carload freight moving in interstate commerce between the industries concerned and all railroad and steamship lines reaching the port, is of the same character, though wider in scope, as that held to be common carriage by rail in interstate commerce in the <em>Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal</em> and the <em>Union Stockyards Co.</em> cases.  They abundantly support the conclusion that such is the service rendered by the state in the present case, a conclusion twice reached by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, <em>see McCallum v. United States,</em> 298 F. 373; <em>Tilden v. United States,</em> 21 F.2d 967.</p>\n<p>2. The state urges that it is not subject to the Federal Safety Appliance Act.  It is not denied that the omission charged would be a violation if by a privately owned rail carrier in interstate commerce.  But it is said that, as the state is operating the railroad without profit, for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and is using the net proceeds of operation for harbor improvement, <em>see Sherman v. United States, supra, Denning v. State,</em> 123 Cal. 316, 55 P. 1000, it is engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity, and for that reason cannot constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of the federal Act.  In any case, it is argued that the statute is not to be construed as applying to the state acting in that capacity.</p>\n<p>Despite reliance upon the point both by the government and the state, we think it unimportant to say whether the state conducts its railroad in its "sovereign" or in its "private" capacity.  That, in operating its railroad, it is acting within a power reserved to the states cannot be doubted.  <em>See Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co. v. Seattle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/291/619/case.html">291 U. S. 619</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/291/619/case.html#624">291 U. S. 624</a></span>; <em>Green v. Frazier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/233/case.html">253 U. S. 233</a></span>; <em>Jones v. Portland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/245/217/case.html">245 U. S. 217</a></span>.  The only question we need consider is whether the exercise of that power, in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 297 U. S. 184</a></p><p> whatever capacity, must be in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been granted specifically to the national government.  The sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution.  The power of a state to fix intrastate railroad rates must yield to the power of the national government when their regulation is appropriate to the regulation of interstate commerce.  <em>United States v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/70/case.html">290 U. S. 70</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/70/case.html#74">290 U.

A contract between a state and a rail carrier fixing intrastate rates is subject to regulation and control by Congress, acting within the commerce clause, <em>New York v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/591/case.html">257 U. S. 591</a></span>, as are state agencies created to effect a public purpose, <em>see Sanitary District of Chicago v.

Chattanooga,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/472/case.html">264 U. S. 472</a></span>.  In each case, the power of the state is subordinate to the constitutional exercise of the granted federal power.</p>\n<p>The analogy of the constitutional immunity of state instrumentalities from federal taxation, on which respondent relies, is not illuminating.  That immunity is implied from the nature of our federal system and the relationship within it of state and national governments, and is equally a restriction on taxation by either of the instrumentalities of the other.  Its nature requires that it be so construed as to allow to each government reasonable scope for its taxing power, <em>see Metcalf &amp; Eddy v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/269/514/case.html">269 U.

United States, supra.</em>  Hence, we look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power.  But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce.  The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.</p>\n<p>California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power, and is liable for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as are other carriers, unless the statute is to be deemed inapplicable to state-owned railroads because it does not specifically mention them.  The Federal Safety Appliance Act is remedial, to protect employees and the public from injury because of defective railway appliances, <em>Swinson v. Chicago, St. Paul, M. &amp; O. Ry. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/529/case.html">294 U. S. 529</a></span>; <em>Fairport, P. &amp; E. R. Co. v.

S. 17</a></span>, and to safeguard interstate commerce itself from obstruction and injury due to defective appliances upon locomotives and cars used on the highways of interstate commerce, even though their individual use is wholly intrastate.  <em>Southern Ry.

No convincing reason is advanced why interstate commerce and persons and property concerned in it should not receive the protection of the act whenever a state, as well as a privately owned carrier, brings itself within the sweep of the statute, or why its all-embracing language should not be deemed to afford that protection.</p>\n<p>In <em>Ohio v.

S. 186</a></p><p> statute imposing a tax on those dealing in intoxicating liquors, although states were not specifically mentioned in the statute.  The same conclusion was reached in <em>South Carolina v. United States, supra, and see Helvering v. Powers, supra.</em>  Similarly, the Interstate Commerce Commission has regarded this and other state-owned interstate rail carriers as subject to its jurisdiction although the Interstate Commerce Act does not in terms apply to state-owned rail carriers.  <em>See</em> California Canneries Co. v. Southern P. Co., 51 I.C.C. 500, 502, 503; United States v. Belt Line R. Co., 56 I.C.C. 121; Texas State Railroad, 34 I.C.C.Val.R., 276.</p>\n<p>Respondent invokes the canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound by its own statute unless named in it, <em>see Guarantee Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty &amp; Surety Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/152/case.html">224 U. S. 152</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/251/case.html">United States v. Herron,</a></span></em> 20 Wall. 251; <em>In re Fowble,</em> 213 F. 676.  This rule has its historical basis in the English doctrine that the Crown is unaffected by acts of Parliament not specifically directed against it.  <em>United States v. Herron, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/251/case.html#255">87 U. S. 255</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/86/227/case.html">Dollar Savings Bank v.

The presumption is an aid to consistent construction of statutes of the enacting sovereign when their purpose is in doubt, but it does not require that the aim of a statute fairly to be inferred be disregarded because not explicitly stated.  <em>See Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Commission of Maryland, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/209/case.html">297 U. S. 209</a></span>.  We can perceive no reason for extending it so as to exempt a business carried on by a state from the otherwise applicable provisions of an act of Congress, all-embracing in scope and national in its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by state as by individual action.  Language and objectives so plain are not to be thwarted by resort to a rule of construction whose purpose is but to resolve doubts, and whose application in the circumstances would be highly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 297 U. S. 187</a></p><p> artificial.  It was disregarded in <em>Ohio v. Helvering, supra,</em> and <em>South Carolina v. United States, supra.</em> <em>See Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/275/232/case.html">275 U.

The jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain suits by the United States against a state under the Safety Appliance Act turns on the construction to be given to \xc2\xa7 6 of the act in the light of \xc2\xa7 233 of the Judicial Code.  Article 3, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States and the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to cases "in which a State shall be a Party."  <em>See United States v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/463/case.html">295 U. S. 463</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/463/case.html#470">295 U. S. 470</a></span>, and cases cited.  But Congress may confer on inferior courts concurrent original jurisdiction of such suits.  <em>Ames v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/449/case.html">111 U. S. 449</a></span>; <em>United States v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/32/case.html">123 U. S. 32</a></span>; <em>compare Bors v. Preston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/252/case.html">111 U. S. 252</a></span>.  Section 233 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. 341, originally enacted as \xc2\xa7 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 80, became \xc2\xa7 687 of the Revised Statutes, and was carried into the Judicial Code in 1911, 36 Stat. 1156.  It gives to this Court</p>\n<p>"exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies of a civil nature where a State is a party, except between a State and its citizens, or between a State and citizens of other States, or aliens."</p>\n<p>The later enacted \xc2\xa7 6 of the Safety Appliance Act, <em>see Smiley v. Holm,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/355/case.html">285 U. S. 355</a></span>, provides that the penalty  which it imposes is</p>\n<p>"to be recovered in a suit or suits to be brought . . . in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction in the locality where such violation shall have been committed."</p>\n<p>If it be assumed that the present suit to recover the payment denominated a "penalty" by \xc2\xa7 6 is a controversy of a civil nature, <em>but see Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/127/265/case.html">127 U. S. 265</a></span>, <em>cf. Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/268/case.html">296 U. S. 268</a></span>, it is by \xc2\xa7 233 of the Judicial Code within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court, unless that provision is supplanted with respect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 297 U. S. 188</a></p><p> to suits such as the present by the provisions of \xc2\xa7 6.  Upon that assumption, \xc2\xa7 6 is in conflict with \xc2\xa7 233 of the Judicial Code, and supersedes it,  <em>United States v. Yuginovich,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/450/case.html">256 U. S. 450</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/450/case.html#463">256 U. S. 463</a></span>, <em>United States ex rel. Chandler v.

S. 92</a></span>, unless, again, the general language of \xc2\xa7 6 is to be taken as not applying to suits brought against a state.  Since the section which, as we have held, imposes the liability upon state and privately owned carriers alike also provides the remedy and designates the manner and the court in which the remedy is to be pursued, we think the jurisdictional provisions are as applicable to suits brought to enforce the liability of states as to those against privately owned carriers, and that the District Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>If we lay aside possible doubts whether the suit is of a "civil nature," in which case only does \xc2\xa7 233 of the Judicial Code purport to make the jurisdiction of this Court exclusive, still, in construing the jurisdictional provisions of \xc2\xa7 6 of the Safety Appliance Act, practical convenience, and "the tacit assumptions" upon which it is reasonable to suppose its language was used, <em>see Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/280/379/case.html">280 U. S. 379</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/280/379/case.html#383">280 U. S. 383</a></span>, are not to be disregarded.  The controversy in a suit authorized by \xc2\xa7 6 is essentially local in character, and involves issues for which a jury trial may be appropriate, <em>compare  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/1/case.html">3 U. S. </a></span> Brailsford,</em> 3 Dall. 1.  Their adjudication often requires the presence, as witnesses, of railroad workers, shippers, and others of the locality.  These are considerations which undoubtedly led to the command that the suit should be brought in the district court of the "locality" where violations occur.  They are considerations as applicable to suits against a state as to suits against a privately owned railroad.  The suggestion that it should be assumed that Congress did not intend to subject a sovereign state to the inconvenience and loss of dignity involved </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 297 U. S. 189</a></p><p> in a trial in a District Court is not persuasive when weighed against the complete appropriateness of the court and venue selected for the trial of issues growing out of the particular activity in which the state has chosen to engage.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>"Section 2.
