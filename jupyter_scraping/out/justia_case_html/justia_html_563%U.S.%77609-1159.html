A Nobel Prize winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral part of these efforts. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford University\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs.  Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time.  When he did so, he signed an agreement stating that he \xe2\x80\x9cagree[d] to assign\xe2\x80\x9d to Stanford his \xe2\x80\x9cright, title and interest in\xe2\x80\x9d inventions resulting from his employment there.  Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus to learn about PCR.  As a condition of gaining access to Cetus, Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he \xe2\x80\x9cwill assign and do[es] hereby assign\xe2\x80\x9d to Cetus his \xe2\x80\x9cright, title and interest in \xe2\x80\xa6 the ideas, inventions, and improvements\xe2\x80\x9d made \xe2\x80\x9cas a consequence of [his] access\xe2\x80\x9d to Cetus.  Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount of HIV in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  Upon returning to Stanford, he and other Stanford employees tested the procedure.  Stanford secured three patents to the measurement process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus\xe2\x80\x99s PCR-related assets.  After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure.  Today, its HIV test kits are used worldwide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention[s]\xe2\x80\x9d between the Federal Government and federal contractors.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(e), (c), 202(a).  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7201(e), and provides that contractors may \xe2\x80\x9celect to retain title to any subject invention,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7202(a).  Because some of Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied.  In accordance with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, Stanford notified NIH that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on the Government a license to use the patented procedure. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits infringed Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s patents.  Roche responded that Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement.  Stanford countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the University had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act.  The District Court agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holodniy had no rights to assign to Cetus.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche.  It also found that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s rights in federally funded inventions.  Thus, the Act did not extinguish Roche\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was deprived of standing. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Since 1790, patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gayler </em>v. <em>Wilder,</em> 10 How. 477, 493.  In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor, or\xe2\x80\x94because an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in his invention is assignable in law by an instrument in writing\xe2\x80\x94an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s assignee.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dubilier Condenser Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/178/index.html">289 U. S. 178</a>, 187.  Absent an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not have rights in an invention \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is the original conception of the employee alone,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 189; an inventor must expressly grant those rights to his employer, see <em>id.</em>, at 187.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Stanford and <em>amicus </em>United States contend that, when an invention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal funds, the Bayh-Dole Act vests title to those inventions in the inventor\xe2\x80\x99s employer\xe2\x80\x94the federal contractor.  Congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified federal contracts become the Government\xe2\x80\x99s property.  Such unambiguous language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole Act.  Instead, the Act provides that contractors may \xe2\x80\x9celect to retain title to any subject invention,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7202(a), defining a \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7201(e). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stanford contends that \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d means all inventions that a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s employees make with the aid of federal funds.  That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.  This Court has rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s invention in the employer. Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s reading also renders the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous since the definition already covers inventions made under a funding agreement.  Construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement\xe2\x80\x94inventions \xe2\x80\x9cof the contractor,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, those owned by or belonging to the contractor\xe2\x80\x94makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.  And \xe2\x80\x9cinvention owned by the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvention belonging to the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d are natural readings of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 202(a), which states that contractors may \xe2\x80\x9celect to retain title,\xe2\x80\x9d confirms that the Act does not <em>vest </em>title.  Stanford reaches the opposite conclusion, but only because it reads \xe2\x80\x9cretain\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cacquire\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creceive.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is certainly not the common meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cretain,\xe2\x80\x9d which is \xe2\x80\x9cto hold or continue to hold in possession or use.\xe2\x80\x9d  You cannot retain something unless you already have it.  And \xc2\xa7210(a)\xe2\x80\x94which provides that the Act \xe2\x80\x9ctake[s] precedence over any other Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions \xe2\x80\xa6 that is inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the Act\xe2\x80\x94does not displace the basic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention.  Only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into play.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of rights does nothing more than clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s isolated provisions dealing with inventors\xe2\x80\x99 rights in subject inventions are consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Act.  See \xc2\xa7202(d).  That construction is also bolstered by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limited procedural protections, which expressly give contractors the right to challenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject invention, \xc2\xa7202(b)(4), but do not provide similar protection for inventor and third-party rights. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s contrary construction would permit title to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the invention\xe2\x80\x99s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding.  It also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar of federal funding applied toward an invention\xe2\x80\x99s conception or reduction to practice.  It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions.  To do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising.  Had Congress intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearly\xe2\x80\x94not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d and an idiosyncratic use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cretain.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Act is also reflected in the common practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments.  With effective assignments, federally funded inventions become \xe2\x80\x9csubject inventions\xe2\x80\x9d and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says it should.  The only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own their inventions.

The question here is whether the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980\xe2\x80\x94commonly referred to as the Bayh-Dole Act\xe2\x80\x94displaces that norm and automatically vests title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.  A Nobel Prize winning technique developed at Cetus\xe2\x80\x94polymerase chain reaction, or PCR\xe2\x80\x94was an integral part of these efforts.  PCR allows billions of copies of DNA sequences to be made from a small initial blood sample.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford University\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs.  Dr. Mark Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time.  When he did so, he signed a Copyright and Patent Agreement (CPA) stating that he \xe2\x80\x9cagree[d] to assign\xe2\x80\x9d to Stanford his \xe2\x80\x9cright, title and interest in\xe2\x80\x9d inventions resulting from his employment at the University.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a\xe2\x80\x93119a.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At Stanford Holodniy undertook to develop an improved method for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood samples, using PCR.  Because Holodniy was largely unfamiliar with PCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus.  As a condition of gaining access to Cetus, Holodniy signed a Visitor\xe2\x80\x99s Confidentiality Agreement (VCA).  That agreement stated that Holodniy \xe2\x80\x9cwill assign and do[es] hereby assign\xe2\x80\x9d to Cetus his \xe2\x80\x9cright, title and interest in each of the ideas, inventions and improvements\xe2\x80\x9d made \xe2\x80\x9cas a consequence of [his] access\xe2\x80\x9d to Cetus.  <em>Id.,</em> at 122a\xe2\x80\x93124a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the next nine months, Holodniy conducted research at Cetus.  Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for calculating the amount of HIV in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  That technique allowed doctors to determine whether a patient was benefiting from HIV therapy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he and other University employees tested the HIV measurement technique.  Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written assignments of rights from the Stanford employees involved in refinement of the technique, including Holodniy, and filed several patent applications related to the procedure.  Stanford secured three patents to the HIV measurement process.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1991, Roche Molecular Systems, a company that specializes in diagnostic blood screening, acquired Cetus\xe2\x80\x99s PCR-related assets, including all rights Cetus had obtained through agreements like the VCA signed by Holodniy.  After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure.  Today, Roche\xe2\x80\x99s HIV test \xe2\x80\x9ckits are used in hospitals and AIDS clinics worldwide.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpromote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9censure that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7200.  To achieve these aims, the Act allocates rights in federally funded \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention[s]\xe2\x80\x9d between the Federal Government and federal contractors (\xe2\x80\x9cany person, small business firm, or nonprofit organization that is a party to a funding agreement\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(e), (c), 202(a).  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201(e).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bayh-Dole Act provides that contractors may \xe2\x80\x9celect to retain title to any subject invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7202(a).  To be able to retain title, a contractor must fulfill a number of obligations imposed by the statute.  The contractor must \xe2\x80\x9cdisclose each subject invention to the [relevant] Federal agency within a reasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d; it must \xe2\x80\x9cmake a written election within two years after disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d stating that\nthe contractor opts to retain title to the invention; and the contractor must \xe2\x80\x9cfile a patent application prior to any statutory bar date.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  The \xe2\x80\x9cFederal Government may receive title\xe2\x80\x9d to a subject invention if a contractor fails to comply with any of these obligations.  <em>Ibid</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has several rights in federally funded subject inventions under the Bayh-Dole Act.  The agency that granted the federal funds receives from the contractor \xe2\x80\x9ca nonexclusive, nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice . . . [the] subject invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7202(c)(4).  The agency also possesses \xe2\x80\x9c[m]arch-in rights,\xe2\x80\x9d which permit the agency to grant a license to a responsible third party under certain circumstances, such as when the con-tractor fails to take \xe2\x80\x9ceffective steps to achieve practical application\xe2\x80\x9d of the invention.  \xc2\xa7203.  The Act further provides that when the contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention, the Government \xe2\x80\x9cmay consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7202(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some of Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s research related to the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the Bayh-Dole Act.  Accordingly, Stanford disclosed the in-vention, conferred on the Government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to use the patented proce-dure, and formally notified NIH that it elected to retain title to the invention.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University filed suit against Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Roche Diagnostics Corporation, and Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. (collectively Roche), contending that Roche\xe2\x80\x99s HIV test kits infringed Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s patents.  As relevant here, Roche responded by asserting that it was a co-owner of the HIV quantification procedure, based on Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s assignment of his rights in the Visitor\xe2\x80\x99s Confidentiality Agreement.  As a result, Roche argued, Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement.  487 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1111, 1115 (ND Cal. 2007).  Stanford claimed that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the University\xe2\x80\x99s HIV research was federally funded, giving the school superior rights in the invention under the Bayh-Dole Act.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court held that the \xe2\x80\x9cVCA effectively assigned any rights that Holodniy had in the patented invention to Cetus,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus to Roche.

The court concluded that the Bayh-Dole Act \xe2\x80\x9cprovides that the individual inventor may obtain title\xe2\x80\x9d to a federally funded invention \xe2\x80\x9conly after the government and the contracting party have declined to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1118.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed.  First, the court concluded that Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s initial agreement with Stanford in the Copyright and Patent Agreement constituted a mere promise to assign rights in the future, unlike Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with Cetus in the Visitor\xe2\x80\x99s Confidentiality Agreement, which itself assigned Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the invention to Cetus.  See 583 F. 3d 832, 841\xe2\x80\x93842 (2009).  Therefore, as a matter of contract law, Cetus obtained Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the HIV quantification technique through the VCA.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Next, the court explained that the Bayh-Dole Act \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not automatically void ab initio the inventors\xe2\x80\x99 rights in government-funded inventions\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory scheme did not automatically void the patent rights that Cetus received from Holodniy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 844\xe2\x80\x93845.

Under the law in its current form, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter \xe2\x80\xa6 may obtain a patent therefor.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U.

In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor, or\xe2\x80\x94because an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in his invention is \xe2\x80\x9cassignable in law by an instrument in writing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s assignee.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7151, 152, 261.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedents confirm the general rule that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gayler</em> v. <em>Wilder</em>, 10 How. 477, 493 (1851) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe discoverer of a new and useful improvement is vested by law with an inchoate right to its exclusive use, which he may perfect and make absolute by proceeding in the manner which the law requires\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Solomons</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/137/342/index.html">137 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> 8 Chisum on Patents \xc2\xa722.01, p. 22\xe2\x80\x932 (2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe presumptive owner of the property right in a patentable invention is the single human inventor\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is equally well established that an inventor can assign his rights in an invention to a third party.  See <em>Dubilier Condenser Corp</em>., <em>supra,</em> at 187 (\xe2\x80\x9cA patent is property and title to it can pass only by assignment\xe2\x80\x9d); 8 Chisum on Patents, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa722.01, at 22\xe2\x80\x932 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe inventor \xe2\x80\xa6 [may] transfer ownership interests by written assignment to anyone\xe2\x80\x9d).

In their view, the Act moves inventors from the front of the line to the back by vesting title to federally funded inventions in the inventor\xe2\x80\x99s employer\xe2\x80\x94the federal contractor.  See Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9327; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts become the property of the United States.  For example, with respect to certain contracts dealing with nuclear material and atomic energy, Congress provided that title to such inventions \xe2\x80\x9cshall be vested in, and be the property of, the [Atomic Energy] Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72182.  Congress has also enacted laws requiring that title to certain inventions made pursuant to contracts with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \xe2\x80\x9cshall be the exclusive property of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Pub. L. 111\xe2\x80\x93314, \xc2\xa73, 124 Stat. 3339, 51 U.

Nowhere in the Act is title expressly vested in contractors or anyone else; nowhere in the Act are inventors expressly deprived of their interest in federally funded inventions.  Instead, the Act provides that contractors may \xe2\x80\x9celect to retain title to any subject invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7202(a).  A \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stanford asserts that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision \xe2\x80\x9cis naturally read to include all inventions made by the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s employees with the aid of federal funding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 32 (footnote omitted).  That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.  It also renders the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  If the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d were deleted from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention,\xe2\x80\x9d the definition would cover \xe2\x80\x9cany invention \xe2\x80\xa6 conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reading \xe2\x80\x9cof the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9call inventions made by the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s employees with the aid of federal funding,\xe2\x80\x9d as Stanford would, adds nothing that is not already in the definition, since the definition already covers inventions made under the funding agreement.  That is contrary to our general \xe2\x80\x9creluctan[ce] to treat statutory terms as surplusage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U.

And \xe2\x80\x9cinvention owned by the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvention belonging to the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d are natural readings of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of the word \xe2\x80\x98of\xe2\x80\x99 denotes ownership.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Poe</em> v. <em>Seaborn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/282/101/index.html">282 U.

No one would claim that an autoworker who builds a car while working in a factory owns that car.  But, as noted, patent law has always been different: We have rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s invention in the employer.  Against this background, a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s invention\xe2\x80\x94an \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94does not automatically include inventions made by the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s employees.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bayh-Dole Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision stating that contractors may \xe2\x80\x9celect to <em>retain</em> title\xe2\x80\x9d confirms that the Act does not <em>vest </em>title.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7202(a) (emphasis added).  Stanford reaches the opposite conclusion, but only because it reads \xe2\x80\x9cretain\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cacquire\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creceive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 36 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is certainly not the common meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cretain.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]etain\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cto hold or continue to hold in possession or use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third, <em>supra</em>, at 1938; see Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New Collegiate Dictionary 980 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cto keep in possession or use\xe2\x80\x9d); American Heritage Dictionary 1109 (1969) (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]o keep or hold in one\xe2\x80\x99s possession\xe2\x80\x9d).  You cannot retain something unless you already have it.  See <em>Alaska</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/75/index.html">545 U. S. 75</a>, 104 (2005) (interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States shall retain title to all property\xe2\x80\x9d to mean that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he United States \xe2\x80\xa6 retained title to <em>its</em> property located within Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s borders\xe2\x80\x9d) (emphasis added).  The Bayh-Dole Act does not confer title to federally funded inventions on contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to those inventions; it simply assures contractors that they may keep title to whatever it is they already have.  Such a provision makes sense in a statute specifying the respective rights and responsibilities of federal contractors and the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bayh-Dole Act states that it \xe2\x80\x9ctake[s] precedence over any other Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions \xe2\x80\xa6 that is inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7210(a).  The United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> argues that this provision operates to displace the basic principle, codified in the Patent Act, that an inventor owns the rights to his invention.  See Brief for United States 21. <em> </em>But because the Bayh-Dole Act, including \xc2\xa7210(a), applies only to \xe2\x80\x9csubject inventions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinventions of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it does not displace an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s antecedent title to his invention.  Only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into play.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of rights\xe2\x80\x94like much of the\nrest of the Bayh-Dole Act\xe2\x80\x94serves to clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor.  Nothing more.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The isolated provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act dealing with inventors\xe2\x80\x99 rights in subject inventions are consistent with our construction of the Act.  Under the Act, a federal agency may \xe2\x80\x9cgrant requests for retention of rights by the inventor \xe2\x80\xa6 [i]f a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7202(d).  If an employee inventor never had title to his invention because title vested in the contractor by operation of law\xe2\x80\x94as Stanford submits\xe2\x80\x94it would be odd to allow the Government to grant \xe2\x80\x9crequests for retention of rights by the inventor.\xe2\x80\x9d  By using the word \xe2\x80\x9cretention,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7202(d) assumes that the inventor had rights in the subject invention at some point, undermining the notion that the Act automatically vests title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The limited scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s procedural protections also bolsters our conclusion.  The Bayh-Dole Act expressly confers on contractors the right to challenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject invention.  \xc2\xa7202(b)(4).  As Roche correctly notes, however, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Act contains not a single procedural protection for third parties that have neither sought nor received federal funds,\xe2\x80\x9d such as cooperating private research institutions.  Brief for Respondents 29.  Nor does the Bayh-Dole Act allow inventors employed by federal contractors to contest their employer\xe2\x80\x99s claim to a subject invention.  The Act, for example, does not expressly permit an interested third party or an inventor to challenge a claim that a particular invention was supported by federal funding.  In a world in which there is frequent collaboration between private entities, inventors, and federal contractors, see Brief for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9323, that absence would be deeply troubling.  But the lack of procedures protecting inventor and third-party rights makes perfect sense if the Act applies only when a federal contractor has already acquired title to an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s interest.  In that case, there is no need to protect inventor or third-party rights, because the only rights at issue are those of the contractor and the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bayh-Dole Act applies to subject inventions \xe2\x80\x9cconceived <em>or</em> first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfunded in whole <em>or in part</em> by the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(e), 201(b) (emphasis added).  Under Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Act, title to one of its employee\xe2\x80\x99s inventions could vest in the University even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became a University employee, so long as the invention\xe2\x80\x99s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding.  What is more, Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s reading suggests that the school would obtain title to one of its employee\xe2\x80\x99s inventions even if only one dollar of federal funding was applied toward the invention\xe2\x80\x99s conception or reduction to practice.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions.  To do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising.  We are confident that if Congress had intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearly\xe2\x80\x94not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d and an idiosyncratic use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cretain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U.

Contractors generally institute policies to obtain assignments from their employees.  See Brief for Respondents 34; Brief for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13\xe2\x80\x9318.  Agencies that grant funds to federal contractors typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments.  So it is with NIH, the agency that granted the federal funds at issue in this case.  In guidance documents made available to contractors, NIH has made clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y law, an inventor has initial ownership of an invention\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that contractors should therefore \xe2\x80\x9chave in place employee agreements requiring an inventor to \xe2\x80\x98assign\xe2\x80\x99 or give ownership of an invention to the organization upon acceptance of Federal funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  NIH Policies, Procedures, and Forms, A \xe2\x80\x9c20\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x9d View of Invention Reporting to the National Institutes of Health (Sept. 22, 1995).  Such guidance would be unnecessary if Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute were correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stanford contends that reading the Bayh-Dole Act as not vesting title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally undermin[es]\xe2\x80\x9d the Act\xe2\x80\x99s frame-work and severely threatens its continued \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 45.  We do not agree.  As just noted, universities typically enter into agreements with their employees requiring the assignment to the university of rights in inventions.  With an effective assignment, those inventions\xe2\x80\x94if federally funded\xe2\x80\x94become \xe2\x80\x9csubject inventions\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act, and the statute as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says it should.  The only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic principle of patent law that inventors own their inventions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Roche submitted a host of other claims to the District Court, including that it had \xe2\x80\x9cshop rights\xe2\x80\x9d to the patents and was entitled to a license to use the patents.

Lest there be any doubt, employees of nonfederal entities that have federal funding contracts\xe2\x80\x94like Holodniy\xe2\x80\x94are <em>not</em> federal employees.  And there is no equivalent executive order governing invention rights with respect to federally funded research; that issue is of course addressed by the Bayh-Dole Act.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Far from superseding the Patent Act in such a backhanded way, it is clear that \xc2\xa7210(a)\xe2\x80\x99s concern is far narrower.  That provision specifies 21 different statutory provisions that the Bayh-Dole Act \xe2\x80\x9ctake[s] precedence over,\xe2\x80\x9d the vast majority of which deal with the division of ownership in certain inventions between a contractor and the Government.  35 U.

That argument has some force.  But there may be situations where an inventor, by the terms of an assignment, has subsidiary rights in an invention to which a contractor has title, as \xc2\xa7202(d) suggests.  Compare \xc2\xa7202(d) (\xe2\x80\x9cretention of <em>rights</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) with \xc2\xa7202(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cretain <em>title</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) (emphasis added).  And at the end of the day, it is Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xe2\x80\x9cretain\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cread as a synonym for \xe2\x80\x98acquire\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98receive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that dooms its argument on this point.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7200\xe2\x80\x93212, in inventions arising from federally funded research can be terminated unilaterally by an individual in-ventor through a separate agreement purporting to as-sign the inventor\xe2\x80\x99s rights to a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner i.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn my view, the answer to this question is likely no.  But because that answer turns on matters that have not been fully briefed (and are not resolved by the opinion of the Court), I would return this case to the Federal Circuit for further argument.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bayh-Dole Act creates a three-tier system for patent rights ownership applicable to federally funded research conducted by nonprofit organizations, such as universities, and small businesses.  It sets forth conditions that mean (1) the funded firm; (2) failing that, the United States Government; and (3) failing that, the employee who made the invention, will likely obtain (or retain) any result-\ning patent rights (normally in that just-listed order).  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202\xe2\x80\x93203.  The statute applies to \xe2\x80\x9csubject in-vention[s]\xe2\x80\x9d defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany <em>invention of the contractor</em> conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201(e) (emphasis added).  Since the \xe2\x80\x9ccontractor\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>e.g.,</em> a university or small business) is unlikely to \xe2\x80\x9cconceiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of an idea or \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cto practice\xe2\x80\x9d <em>other than </em>through its employees, the term \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d must refer\nto the work and ideas of those employees.  We all agree that the term covers those employee inventions that the employee properly assigns to the contractor, <em>i.e.</em>, his or\nher employer.  But does the term \xe2\x80\x9csubject invention\xe2\x80\x9d\nalso include inventions that the employee fails to assign properly?</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted this statute against a background norm that often, but not always, denies individual inventors patent rights growing out of research for which the public has already paid.  This legal norm reflects the fact that patents themselves have both benefits and costs.  Patents, for example, help to elicit useful inventions and research and to assure public disclosure of technological advances.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mazer</em> v. <em>Stein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/201/index.html">347 U. S. 201</a>, 219 (1954); <em>Bilski</em> v. <em>Kappos</em>, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4); <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 10) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  But patents sometimes mean unnecessarily high prices or restricted dissemination; and they sometimes discourage further innovation and competition by re-quiring costly searches for earlier, related patents or by tying up ideas, which, were they free, would more effectively spur research and development.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings</em> v. <em>Metabolite Laboratories, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/124/index.html">548 U. S. 124</a>, 128 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted); Heller &amp; Eisenberg, Can Patents Deter Innovation? The Anticommons in Biomedical Research, 280 Science 698 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, Thomas Jefferson wrote of \xe2\x80\x9cthe difficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washington ed. 1854).  And James Madison favored the patent monopoly because it amounted to \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation for\xe2\x80\x9d a community \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Monopolies. Perpetuities. Corporations. Ecclesiastical Endowments., in J. Madison, Writings 756 (J. Rakove ed. 1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The importance of assuring this community \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit\xe2\x80\x9d is reflected in legal rules that may deny or limit the award of patent rights where the public has already paid to produce an invention, lest the public bear the potential costs of patent protection where there is no offsetting need for such protection to elicit that invention.  Why should the public have to pay twice for the same invention?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Legal rules of this kind include an Executive Order that ordinarily gives to the Government \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire right, title and interest\xe2\x80\x9d to inventions made by Government employees who \xe2\x80\x9cconduct or perform research, development work, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d  37 CFR \xc2\xa7501.6 (2010) (codifying, as amended, Exec. Order 10096, 3 CFR 292 (1949\xe2\x80\x931953 Comp.)).  See also <em>Heinemann</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 796 F.\xc2\xa02d 451, 455\xe2\x80\x93456 (CA Fed. 1986) (holding Executive Order constitutional and finding \xe2\x80\x9cno \xe2\x80\x98taking\xe2\x80\x99 because the invention was not the property of Heinemann\xe2\x80\x9d).  They also include statutes, which, in specific research areas, give the Government title to inventions made pursuant to Government contracts.  See Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \xc2\xa7152, 68 Stat. 944 (codified as amended at 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72182); National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, \xc2\xa7305, 72 Stat. 435 (codified at 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72457), repealed by \xc2\xa76, 124 Stat. 3444; Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, \xc2\xa79, 88 Stat. 1887 (codified as amended at 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75908(a)).  And they have included Government regulations, established prior to the Bayh-Dole Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, that work in roughly similar ways.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 45 CFR \xc2\xa7650.4(b) (1977) (National Science Foundation regulations providing that Foundation would \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine the disposition of the invention [made under the grant] and title to and rights under any patent application\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78.1(a), 8.2(d) (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare regulations providing that inventions made under department grants \xe2\x80\x9cshall be subject to determination\xe2\x80\x9d by the agency and that the department may \xe2\x80\x9crequire that all domestic rights in the invention shall be assigned to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These legal rules provide the basic background against which Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act.  And the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions reflect a related effort to assure that rights to inventions arising out of research for which the public has paid are distributed and used in ways that further specific important public interests.  I agree with the majority that the Act does not simply take the individual inventors\xe2\x80\x99 rights and grant them to the Government.  Rather, it assumes that the federal funds\xe2\x80\x99 recipient, say a university or small business, will possess those rights.  The Act leaves those rights in the hands of that recipient, not because it seeks to make the public pay twice for the same invention, but for a special public policy reason.  In doing so, it seeks to encourage those institutions <em>to commercialize </em>inventions that otherwise might not realize their potentially beneficial public use.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7200.  The Act helps assure that commercialization (while \xe2\x80\x9cpromot[ing] free competition\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[ing] the public,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>) by imposing a set of conditions upon the federal funds recipient, by providing that sometimes the Government will take direct control of the patent rights, and by adding that on occasion the Government will permit the individual inventor to retain those rights.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202\xe2\x80\x93203.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this basic statutory objective, I cannot so easily accept the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that the individual in-ventor can lawfully assign an invention (produced by public funds) to a third party, thereby taking that invention out from under the Bayh-Dole Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions, conditions, and allocation rules.  That conclusion, in my view, is inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes.  It may significantly undercut the Act\xe2\x80\x99s ability to achieve its objectives.  It allows individual inventors, for whose invention the public has paid, to avoid the Act\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding restrictions and conditions.  And it makes the commercialization and marketing of such an invention more difficult:  A potential purchaser of rights from the contractor, say a university, will not know if the university itself possesses the patent right in question or whether, as here, the individual, inadvertently or deliberately, has previously assigned the title to a third party.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, I do not agree that the language to which the majority points\xe2\x80\x94the words \xe2\x80\x9cinvention of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cretain\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94requires its result.  As the majority concedes, Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s alternative reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in-vention of the contractor\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cplausible enough in the abstract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Nor do I agree that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s lack of an explicit provision for \xe2\x80\x9can interested third party\xe2\x80\x9d to claim that an invention was not the result of federal funding \xe2\x80\x9cbolsters\xe2\x80\x9d the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  In any event, universities and businesses have worked out ways to protect the various participants to research.  See Brief for Association of American Universities et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9324 (hereinafter AAU Brief); App. 118\xe2\x80\x93124 (Materials Transfer Agreement between Cetus and Stanford University).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the majority rejects Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s reading (and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading) of the Act because it believes that it is inconsistent with certain background norms of patent law, norms that ordinarily provide an individual inventor with full patent rights.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10<em>.</em>  But in my view, the competing norms governing rights in inventions for which the public has already paid, along with the Bayh-Dole Act\xe2\x80\x99s objectives, suggest a different result.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two different legal routes to what I consider an interpretation more consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  First, we could set aside the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the licensing agreements and its related licensing doctrine.  That doctrine governs interpretation of licensing agreements made <em>before</em> an invention is conceived or reduced to practice.  Here, there are two such agreements.  In the earlier agreement\xe2\x80\x94that between Dr. Holodniy and Stanford University\xe2\x80\x94Dr. Holodniy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI <em>agree to assign</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 to Stanford \xe2\x80\xa6 that right, title and interest in and to \xe2\x80\xa6 such inventions as required by Contracts and Grants.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a (emphasis added).  In the later agreement\xe2\x80\x94that between Dr. Holodniy and the private research firm Cetus\xe2\x80\x94Dr. Holodniy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will assign and <em>do hereby assign</em> to Cetus, my right, title, and interest in\xe2\x80\x9d here relevant \xe2\x80\x9cideas\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinventions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 123a (emphasis added; capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit held that the earlier Stanford agreement\xe2\x80\x99s use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cagree to assign,\xe2\x80\x9d when compared with the later Cetus agreement\xe2\x80\x99s use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cdo hereby assign,\xe2\x80\x9d made all the difference.  It concluded that, once the invention came into existence, the latter words meant that the Cetus agreement trumped the earlier, Stanford agreement.  583 F.\xc2\xa03d 832, 841\xe2\x80\x93842 (CA Fed. 2009).  That, in the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, is because the latter words operated upon the invention automatically, while the former did not.  Quoting its 1991 opinion in <em>FilmTec Corp.</em> v. <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em>, 939 F.\xc2\xa02d 1568, 1572, the Circuit declared that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]nce the invention is made and [the] application for [a] patent is filed, \xe2\x80\xa6 legal title to the rights accruing thereunder would be in the assignee [<em>i.e.</em>, Cetus] \xe2\x80\xa6 , and the assignor-inventor would have nothing remaining to assign.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  583 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 842.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given what seem only slight linguistic differences in the contractual language, this reasoning seems to make too much of too little.  Dr. Holodniy executed his agreement with Stanford in 1988.  At that time, patent law appears to have long specified that a present assignment of future inventions (as in both contracts here) conveyed equitable, but not legal, title.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> G. Curtis, A Treatise on the Law of Patents for Useful Inventions \xc2\xa7170, p. 155 (3d ed. 1867) (\xe2\x80\x9cA contract to convey a future invention \xe2\x80\xa6 cannot alone authorize a patent to be taken by the party in whose favor such a contract was intended to operate\xe2\x80\x9d); Comment, Contract Rights as Commercial Security: Present and Future Intangibles, 67 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 847, 854, n. 27 (1958) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe rule generally applicable grants equitable enforcement to an assignment of an expectancy but demands a further act, either reduction to possession or further assignment of the right when it comes into existence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this rule, both the initial Stanford and later Cetus agreements would have given rise only to equitable interests in Dr. Holodniy\xe2\x80\x99s invention.  And as between these two claims in equity, the facts that Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s contract came first and that Stanford subsequently obtained a postinvention assignment as well should have meant that Stanford, not Cetus, would receive the rights its contract conveyed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1991, however, the Federal Circuit, in <em>FilmTec</em>,<em> </em>adopted the new rule quoted above\xe2\x80\x94a rule that distinguishes between these equitable claims and, in effect, says that Cetus must win.  The Federal Circuit provided no explanation for what seems a significant change in the law.  See 939 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1572.  Nor did it give any explanation for that change in its opinion in this case.  See 583 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 841\xe2\x80\x93842.  The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>FilmTec </em>rule undercuts the objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act.  While the cognoscenti may be able to meet the <em>FilmTec </em>rule in future contracts simply by copying the precise words blessed by the Federal Circuit, the rule nonetheless remains a technical drafting trap for the unwary.  See AAU Brief 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 15 (assuming ease of obtaining effective assignments).  It is unclear to me why, where the Bayh-Dole Act is at issue, we should prefer the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>FilmTec</em> rule to the rule, of apparently much longer vintage, that would treat both agreements in this case as creating merely equitable rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning brings about an interpretation contrary to the intention of the parties to the earlier, Stanford, contract.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a (provision in Stanford contract promising that Dr. Holodniy \xe2\x80\x9cwill not enter into any agreement creating copyright or patent obligations in conflict with this agreement\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it runs counter to what may well have been the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable expectations of how courts would interpret the relevant language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we could interpret the Bayh-Dole Act as ordinarily assuming, and thereby ordinarily requiring, an assignment of patent rights by the federally funded employee to the federally funded employer.  I concede that this interpretation would treat federally funded employees of contractors (subject to the Act) differently than the law ordinarily treats private sector employees.  The Court long ago described the latter, private sector principles.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dubilier Condenser Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/178/index.html">289 U. S. 178</a> (1933), the Court explained that a \xe2\x80\x9cpatent is property, and title to it can pass only by assignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 187.  It then described two categories of private sector employee-to-employer assignments as follows: First, a person who is</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cemployed to make an invention, who succeeds, during his term of service, in accomplishing that task, is bound to assign to his employer any patent obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\nBut, second,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cif the employment be general, albeit it cover a field of labor and effort in the performance of which the employee conceived the invention for which he obtained a patent, the contract is not so broadly construed as to require an assignment of the patent.\xe2\x80\x9d Ibid.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nThe Court added that, because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe peculiar nature of the act of invention,\xe2\x80\x9d courts are \xe2\x80\x9creluctan[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 to imply or infer an agreement by the employee to assign his patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.,</em> at 188.  And it applied these same principles governing assignment to inventions made by employees of the United States.  <em>Id.,</em> at 189\xe2\x80\x93190.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsequently, however, the President promulgated Executive Order 10096.  Courts have since found that this Executive Order, not <em>Dubilier,</em> governs Federal Government employee-to-employer patent right assignments.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Kaplan</em> v. <em>Corcoran</em>, 545 F.\xc2\xa02d 1073, 1076\xe2\x80\x931077 (CA7 1976); <em>Heinemann</em>, 796 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 455\xe2\x80\x93456; <em>Wright</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 164 F.\xc2\xa03d 267, 269 (CA5 1999); <em>Halas</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 28 Fed. Cl. 354, 364 (1993).  The Bayh-Dole Act seeks objectives roughly analogous to the objectives of the Executive Order.  At least one agency has promulgated regulations that require Bayh-Dole contractors to insist upon similar assignments.  See NIH Policies, Procedures, and Forms, A \xe2\x80\x9c20\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x9d View of Invention Reporting to the National Institutes of Health (Sept. 22, 1995) (available in the Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (requiring a Government contractor, such as Stanford University, to \xe2\x80\x9chave in place employee agreements requiring an inventor to \xe2\x80\x98assign\xe2\x80\x99 or give ownership of an invention to the organization upon acceptance of Federal funds,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Bayh-Dole Act \xe2\x80\x9crequire[s]\xe2\x80\x9d).  And an <em>amicus</em> brief, filed by major associations of universities, scientists, medical researchers, and others, argues that we should interpret the rules governing assignments of the employees at issue here (and\nconsequently the Act\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cinventions of the con-tractor\xe2\x80\x9d) in a similar way.  AAU Brief 5\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court in this case adopted roughly this approach.  487 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1099, 1118 (ND Cal. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough title still vests in the named inventor, the inventor remains under a legal obligation to assign his interest either to the government or the nonprofit contractor unless the inventor acts within the statutory framework to retain title\xe2\x80\x9d).  And since a university often enters into a grant agreement with the Government for a researcher\xe2\x80\x99s benefit and at his request, see J. Hall, Grant Management 205 (2010), implying such a presumption in favor of compliance with the grant agreement, and thus with the Bayh-Dole Act, would ordinarily be equitable.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have suggested, these views are tentative.  That is because the parties have not fully argued these matters (though one <em>amicus</em> brief raises the license interpretation question, see Brief for Alexander M. Shukh as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18\xe2\x80\x9324, and at least one other can be read as supporting something like the equitable presumption I have described, see AAU Brief 5\xe2\x80\x9314).  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa02.  While I do not understand the majority to have foreclosed a similarly situated party from raising these matters in a future case, see <em>ibid., </em>I believe them relevant to our efforts to answer the question presented here.  Consequently, I would vacate the judgment of the Federal Circuit and remand this case to provide the parties with an opportunity to argue these, or related, matters more fully.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Court decides otherwise, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
