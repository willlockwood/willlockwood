In reaching this de- cision, the Court of Appeals relied repeatedly and extensively on our decision in <i>Moore </i>v. <i>Texas</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), which was not handed down until long after the state-court decisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <i>Moore </i>was plainly improper under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), and we therefore vacate that decision and remand so that Hill\xe2\x80\x99s claim regarding intellectual disability can be evaluated based solely on holdings of this Court that were clearly established at the relevant time.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In September 1985, 12-year old Raymond Fife set out on his bicycle for a friend\xe2\x80\x99s home.  When he did not arrive, his parents launched a search, and that evening his father found Raymond\xe2\x80\x94naked, beaten, and burned\xe2\x80\x94in a wooded field.  Although alive, he had sustained horrific injuries that we will not describe.  He died two days later.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1986, respondent Danny Hill was convicted for torturing, raping, and murdering Raymond, and he was sentenced to death.  An intermediate appellate court affirmed his conviction and sentence, as did the Ohio Supreme Court.  We denied certiorari.  <i>Hill </i>v.<i> Ohio</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1007 (1993).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After unsuccessful efforts to obtain postconviction relief in state and federal court, Hill filed a new petition in the Ohio courts contending that his death sentence is illegal under <i>Atkins </i>v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304 (2002), which held that the\n \nEighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of a death sentence on a defendant who is \xe2\x80\x9cmentally retarded.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 2006, the Ohio trial court denied this claim, App. to Pet. for Cert. 381a\xe2\x80\x93493a, and in 2008, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, <i>State </i>v. <i>Hill</i>, 177 Ohio App. 3d 171, 2008-Ohio-3509, 894 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 108.  In 2009, the Ohio Supreme Court denied review.  <i>State </i>v. <i>Hill</i>, 122 Ohio St. 3d 1502, 2009-Ohio-4233, 912 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 107.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2010, Hill filed a new federal habeas petition under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, seeking review of the denial of his <i>Atkins </i>claim.  The District Court denied the petition, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a\xe2\x80\x93210a, but the Sixth Circuit reversed and granted habeas relief under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), which applies when a state-court adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Hill </i>v. <i>Anderson</i>, 881 F.\xc2\xa03d 483 (2018).<i> </i>The Sixth Circuit found two alleged deficiencies in the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions: First, they \xe2\x80\x9coveremphasized Hill\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive strengths\xe2\x80\x9d; and second, they \xe2\x80\x9crelied too heavily on adaptive strengths that Hill exhibited in the controlled environment of his death-row prison cell.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 492.  In reaching these conclusions, the court relied repeatedly on our decision in <i>Moore </i>v. <i>Texas</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  See 881 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 486, 487, 488, n.\xc2\xa04, 489, 491, 492, 493, 495, 496, 498, 500.  The court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]rdinarily, Supreme Court decisions that post-date a state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination cannot be \xe2\x80\x98clearly established law\xe2\x80\x99 for the purposes of [the federal habeas statute],\xe2\x80\x9d but the court argued \xe2\x80\x9cthat <i>Moore</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding regarding adaptive strengths [was] merely an application of what was clearly established by <i>Atkins</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 487.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, contending that the Sixth Circuit violated \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) because a fundamental underpinning of its decision was <i>Moore</i>, a case decided by this Court well after the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions.  Against this, Hill echoes the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 argument that <i>Moore </i>merely spelled out what was clearly established by <i>Atkins </i>regarding the assessment of adaptive skills.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The federal habeas statute, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), imposes important limitations on the power of federal courts to overturn the judgments of state courts in criminal cases.  The statute respects the authority and ability of state courts and their dedication to the protection of constitutional rights.  Thus, under the statutory provision at issue here,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), habeas relief may be granted only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\xe2\x80\x9d Supreme Court precedent that was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the adjudication.  <i>E.g., White </i>v. <i>Woodall</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415, 419\xe2\x80\x93420 (2014); <i>Metrish </i>v. <i>Lancaster</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351, 357\xe2\x80\x93358 (2013).<i> </i>This means that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling must be \xe2\x80\x9cso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded dis- agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Harrington </i>v. <i>Richter</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86, 103 (2011).<i> </i> We therefore consider what was clearly established regarding the execution of the intellectually dis- abled in 2008, when the Ohio Court of Appeals rejected Hill\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Atkins</i> claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, <i>Atkins</i> itself was on the books, but <i>Atkins</i> gave no comprehensive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmental retardation\xe2\x80\x9d for\n \nEighth Amendment purposes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The opinion of the Court noted that the definitions of mental retardation adopted by the American Association on Mental Retardation and the American Psychiatric Association required both \xe2\x80\x9csubaverage intellectual functioning\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csignificant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318; see also <i>id.,</i> at 308, n. 3 (quoting definitions).  The Court also noted that state statutory definitions of mental retardation at the time \xe2\x80\x9c[were] not identical, but generally conform[ed] to the[se] clinical definitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 317, n. 22.  The Court then left \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court adopted.  <i>Id</i>., at 317 (quoting <i>Ford </i>v. <i>Wainwright</i>,\n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399, 416 (1986) (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More than a decade later, we expounded on the definition of intellectual disability in two cases.  In <i>Hall</i> v.<i> Florida</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 701 (2014), we considered a rule restricting <i>Atkins</i> to defendants with \xe2\x80\x9can IQ test score of 70 or less.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 704.  We held that this rule violated the\n \nEighth Amendment because it treated an IQ score higher than 70 as conclusively disqualifying and thus prevented consideration of other evidence of intellectual disability, such as evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cdeficits in adaptive functioning over [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 724.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Three years later in <i>Moore</i>, we applied <i>Hall </i>and faulted the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) for concluding that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s IQ scores, some of which were at or below 70, established that he was not intellectually dis- abled.  <i>Moore</i>,<i> </i>581 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  We also held that the CCA improperly evaluated the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive functioning.  It erred, we concluded, in \xe2\x80\x9coveremphasiz[ing] [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] perceived adaptive strengths,\xe2\x80\x9d despite the medical community\xe2\x80\x99s focus on \xe2\x80\x9cadaptive <i>deficits</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 12).<i> </i>And we found that the CCA also went astray in \xe2\x80\x9cstress[ing] [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] improved behavior in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the medical community \xe2\x80\x9ccaution[ed] against reliance on adaptive strengths developed in a controlled setting, as a prison surely is.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 13)<i> </i>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In this case, no reader of the decision of the Court of Appeals can escape the conclusion that it is heavily based on <i>Moore</i>, which came years after the decisions of the Ohio courts.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals, in finding an unreasonable application of clearly established law, drew almost word for word from the two statements in <i>Moore </i>quoted above.  See 881 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 492 (\xe2\x80\x9cContrary to <i>Atkins</i>, the Ohio courts overemphasized Hill\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive strengths and relied too heavily on adaptive strengths that Hill exhibited in the controlled environment of his death-row prison cell.  In so doing, they unreasonably applied clearly established law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although the Court of Appeals asserted that the holding in <i>Moore </i>was \xe2\x80\x9cmerely an application of what was clearly established by <i>Atkins</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d 881 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 487, the court did not explain how the rule it applied can be teased out of the <i>Atkins</i> Court\xe2\x80\x99s brief comments about the meaning of what it termed \xe2\x80\x9cmental retardation.\xe2\x80\x9d  While <i>Atkins</i> noted that standard definitions of mental retardation included as a necessary element \xe2\x80\x9csignificant limitations in adaptive skills .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that became manifest before age 18,\xe2\x80\x9d 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318, <i>Atkins</i> did not definitively resolve how that element was to be evaluated but instead left its application in the first instance to the States.  <i>Id</i>., at 317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the posture in which <i>Moore </i>reached this Court (it did not arise under AEDPA) and the <i>Moore</i> majority\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>primary reliance on medical literature that postdated the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions,<i> </i>581 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___, ___, provide additional reasons to question the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 analysis.  Cf. <i>Cain </i>v. <i>Chappell</i>, 870 F.\xc2\xa03d 1003, 1024, n.\xc2\xa09 (CA9 2017) (because \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Moore </i>is not an AEDPA case\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9cdecided just this spring,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Moore </i>itself cannot serve as \xe2\x80\x98clearly established\xe2\x80\x99 law at the time the state court decided Cain\xe2\x80\x99s claim\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The centrality of <i>Moore </i>in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 analysis is reflected in the way in which the intellectual-disability issue was litigated below.  The <i>Atkins</i> portion of Hill\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition did not focus on \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), the provision on which the decision below is based.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Instead, it began and ended with appeals to a different provision of the habeas statute, \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), which supports relief based on a state court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable determination of the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  In particular, Hill opened with the claim that the Ohio courts\xe2\x80\x99 findings on \xe2\x80\x9cadaptive functioning\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwere an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Amended Pet. for Habeas Corpus in No. 96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93795 (ND Ohio) (Doc. 94), p. 15, \xc2\xb644 (citing \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)), and he closed with the claim that the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that he is \xe2\x80\x9cnot mentally retarded\xe2\x80\x9d was based on \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable determination of the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 36\xe2\x80\x9337, \xc2\xb6101 (citing \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)).  Indeed, Hill\xe2\x80\x99s reply to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer to his petition explicitly \xe2\x80\x9cconcur[red] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that it is proper to review [his <i>Atkins </i>claim] under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  Traverse in No. 96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93795 (ND Ohio) (Doc. 102), p. 47.  And so, unsurprisingly, the District Court analyzed Hill\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Atkins </i>claim solely under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s Hill concedes in his Traverse, his <i>Atkins </i>claim is more appropriately addressed as it relates to the Ohio appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s factual analysis under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hill pressed the same \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) argument in his opening brief in the Sixth Circuit.  There, he argued that the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 finding on \xe2\x80\x9cadaptive functioning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was  an unreasonable determination of the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner\xe2\x80\x93Appellant in No. 14\xe2\x80\x933718 (CA6), p. 34 (citing \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)); see also <i>id.,</i> at 65 (\xe2\x80\x9cAs such, the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 findings of fact that [Hill] is not mentally retarded constitute an unreasonable determination of facts in light of the evidence presented.  (\xc2\xa72254(d)(2))\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It appears that it was not until the Court of Appeals asked for supplemental briefing on <i>Moore</i> that Hill introduced the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) argument that the Court of Appeals adopted.  Although, as noted, the Court of Appeals ultimately disclaimed reliance on <i>Moore</i>, it explicitly asked the parties for supplemental briefing on how <i>Moore </i>\xe2\x80\x9cshould be applied to this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the reasoning of the Court of Appeals leans so heavily on <i>Moore</i>, its decision must be vacated.  On remand, the court should determine whether its conclusions can be sustained based strictly on legal rules that were clearly established in the decisions of this Court at the relevant time.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The petition for certiorari and Hill\xe2\x80\x99s motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis </i>are granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court explained that it was \xe2\x80\x9cfair to say that a national consensus\xe2\x80\x9d had developed against the execution of \xe2\x80\x9cmentally retarded\xe2\x80\x9d offenders.  <i>Atkins </i>v.<i> Virginia</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., 304, 316 (2002). </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0While Hill\xe2\x80\x99s petition argued at one point that certain unidentified \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures\xe2\x80\x9d used by the state courts in making the relevant decisions \xe2\x80\x9cviolated clearly established federal law of <i>Ford/Panetti/Atkins</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>Amended Pet. for Habeas Corpus in No. 96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93795 (ND Ohio) (Doc. 94), p. 15, \xc2\xb645, the petition plainly did not encompass his current argument that the Ohio Court of Appeals unreasonably applied clearly established law under <i>Atkins </i>by overemphasizing adaptive strengths and improperly considering his prison behavior. </span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
