See <i>James, supra, </i>at 211.  At the same time, the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.  Taken together, these uncertainties produce more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.

Holding the residual clause void for vagueness does not put other criminal laws that use terms such as \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d in doubt, because those laws generally require gauging the riskiness of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s conduct on a particular occasion, not the riskiness of an idealized ordinary case of the crime.

Since 2007, this Court has decided four cases attempting to discern its meaning.  We have held that the residual clause (1) covers Florida\xe2\x80\x99s offense of attempted burglary, <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192 (2007)\n; (2) does <i>not</i> cover New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s offense of driving under the influence, <i>Begay</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (2008)\n; (3) does <i>not </i>cover Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 offense of failure to report to a penal institution, <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122 (2009)\n; and (4) does cover Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s offense of vehicular flight from a law-enforcement officer, <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2011)\n.  In both<i> James </i>and<i> Sykes</i>, the Court rejected suggestions by dissenting Justices that the residual clause violates the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of vague criminal laws.

Petitioner Samuel Johnson is a felon with a long criminal record.  In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began to monitor him because of his involvement in a white-supremacist organization that the Bureau suspected was planning to commit acts of terrorism.  During the investigation, Johnson disclosed to undercover agents that he had manufactured explosives and that he planned to attack \xe2\x80\x9cthe Mexican consulate\xe2\x80\x9d in Minnesota, \xe2\x80\x9cprogressive bookstores,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98liberals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Revised Presentence Investigation in No. 0:12CR00104\xe2\x80\x93001 (D. Minn.), p.\xc2\xa015, \xc2\xb616.  Johnson showed the agents his AK\xe2\x80\x9347 rifle, several semiautomatic firearms, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After his eventual arrest, Johnson pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of \xc2\xa7922(g).  The Government requested an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act.  It argued that three of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s previous offenses\xe2\x80\x94including unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, see Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7609.67 (2006)\xe2\x80\x94qualified as violent felonies.  The District Court agreed and sentenced Johnson to a 15-year prison term under the Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  526 Fed. Appx. 708 (CA8 2013) (<i>per curiam</i>).  We granted certiorari to decide whether Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s offense of unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun ranks as a violent felony under the residual clause.  572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).  We later asked the parties to present reargument addressing the compatibility of the residual clause with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of vague criminal laws.  574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFifth Amendment provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our cases establish that the Government violates this guarantee by taking away someone\xe2\x80\x99s life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.  <i>Kolender</i> v. <i>Lawson</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352\n\xe2\x80\x93358 (1983).  The prohibition of vagueness in criminal statutes \xe2\x80\x9cis a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law,\xe2\x80\x9d and a statute that flouts it \xe2\x80\x9cviolates the first essential of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Connally</i> v. <i>General Constr. Co.</i>,\n\n269 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385,\n391 (1926)\n.  These principles apply not only to statutes defining elements of crimes, but also to statutes fixing sentences.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Batchelder</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114,\n123 (1979)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575,\n600 (1990)\n, this Court held that the Armed Career Criminal Act requires courts to use a framework known as the categorical approach when deciding whether an offense \xe2\x80\x9cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the categorical approach, a court assesses whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony \xe2\x80\x9cin terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Begay</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 141.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Deciding whether the residual clause covers a crime thus requires a court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.  <i>James, supra,</i> at 208.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s task goes beyond deciding whether creation of risk is an element of the crime.  That is so because, unlike the part of the definition of a violent felony that asks whether the crime \xe2\x80\x9chas <i>as an element</i> the use .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of physical force,\xe2\x80\x9d the residual clause asks whether the crime \xe2\x80\x9c<i>involves conduct</i>\xe2\x80\x9d that presents too much risk of physical injury.  What is more, the inclusion of burglary and extortion among the enumerated offenses preceding the residual clause confirms that the court\xe2\x80\x99s task also goes beyond evaluating the chances that the physical acts that make up the crime will injure someone.  The act of making an extortionate demand or breaking and entering into someone\xe2\x80\x99s homedoes not, in and of itself, normally cause physical injury.  Rather, risk of injury arises because the extortionist might engage in violence <i>after</i> making his demand or because the burglar might confront a resident in the home <i>after</i> breaking and entering.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We are convinced that the indeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry required by the residual clause both denies fair notice to defendants and invites arbitrary enforcement by judges.  Increasing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence under the clause denies due process of law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Two features of the residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.  In the first place, the residual clause leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.  It ties the judicial assessment of risk to a judicially imagined \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime, not to real-world facts or statutory elements.  How does one go about deciding what kind of conduct the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime involves?  \xe2\x80\x9cA statistical analysis of the state reporter?  A survey?  Expert evidence?  Google? Gut instinct?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mayer</i>, 560 F.\xc2\xa03d 948, 952 (CA9 2009) (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  To take an example, does the ordinary instance of witness tampering involve offering a witness a bribe?  Or threatening a witness with violence?  Critically, picturing the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s behavior is not enough; as we have already discussed, assessing \xe2\x80\x9cpotential risk\xe2\x80\x9d seemingly requires the judge to imagine how the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently plays out.  <i>James</i> illustrates how speculative (and how detached from statutory elements) this enterprise can become.  Explaining why attempted burglary poses a serious potential risk of physical injury, the Court said: \xe2\x80\x9cAn armed would-be burglar may be spotted by a police officer, a private security guard, or a participant in a neighborhood watch program.  Or a homeowner .\xc2\xa0. . may give chase, and a violent encounter may ensue.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211.  The dissent, by contrast, asserted that any confrontation that occurs during an attempted burglary \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant\xe2\x80\x99s yelling \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 from his window, and the burglar\xe2\x80\x99s running away.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 226 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The residual clause offers no reliable way to choose between these competing accounts of what \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d attempted burglary involves.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.  It is one thing to apply an imprecise \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard to real-world facts; it is quite another to apply it to a judge-imagined abstraction.  By asking whether the crime \xe2\x80\x9c<i>otherwise</i> involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, the residual clause forces courts to interpret \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the four enumerated crimes\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives.  These offenses are \xe2\x80\x9cfar from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Begay</i>, 553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143.  Does the ordinary burglar invade an occupied home by night or an unoccupied home by day?  Does the typical extortionist threaten his victim in person with the use of force, or does he threaten his victim by mail with the revelation of embarrassing personal information?  By combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has acknowledged that the failure of \xe2\x80\x9cpersistent efforts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to establish a standard\xe2\x80\x9d can provide evidence of vagueness.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>L. Cohen Grocery Co.,</i>\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81,\n91 (1921)\n.  Here, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated attempts and repeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.  Three of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous four decisions about the clause concentrated on the level of risk posed by the crime in question, though in each case we found it necessary to resort to a different ad\xc2\xa0hoc test to guide our inquiry.  In <i>James</i>, we asked whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses,\xe2\x80\x9d namely completed burglary; we concluded that it was.  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203.  That rule takes care of attempted burglary, but offers no help at all with respect to the vast majority of offenses, which have no apparent analog among the enumerated crimes.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 215 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Chambers</i>, our next case to focus on risk, relied principally on a statistical report prepared by the Sentencing Commission to conclude that an offender who fails to report to prison is not \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender, thereby producing a \xe2\x80\x98serious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 128\xe2\x80\x93129.  So much for failure to report to prison, but what about the tens of thousands of federal and state crimes for which no comparable reports exist?  And even those studies that are available might suffer from methodological flaws, be skewed toward rarer forms of the crime, or paint widely divergent pictures of the riskiness of the conduct that the crime involves.  See <i>Sykes</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x936); <i>id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 6, n.\xc2\xa04).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our most recent case, <i>Sykes</i>, also relied on statistics, though only to \xe2\x80\x9cconfirm the commonsense conclusion that Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s vehicular flight crime is a violent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 8).  But common sense is a much less useful criterion than it sounds\xe2\x80\x94as <i>Sykes </i>itself illustrates.  The Indiana statute involved in that case covered everything from provoking a high-speed car chase to merely failing to stop immediately after seeing a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s signal.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).  How does common sense help a federal court discern where the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d of vehicular flight in Indiana lies along this spectrum?  Common sense has not even produced a consistent conception of the degree of risk posed by each of the four enumerated crimes; there is no reason to expect it to fare any better with respect to thousands of unenumerated crimes.  All in all, <i>James</i>, <i>Chambers</i>, and <i>Sykes</i> failed to establish any generally appli-cable test that prevents the risk comparison required by the residual clause from devolving into guesswork and intuition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The remaining case, <i>Begay</i>, which preceded <i>Chambers</i> and <i>Sykes</i>, took an entirely different approach.  The Court held that in order to qualify as a violent felony under the residual clause, a crime must resemble the enumerated offenses \xe2\x80\x9cin kind as well as in degree of risk posed.\xe2\x80\x9d  553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143.  The Court deemed drunk driving insufficiently similar to the listed crimes, because it typically does not involve \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Alas, <i>Begay</i> did not succeed in bringing clarity to the meaning of the residual clause.  It did not (and could not) eliminate the need to imagine the kind of conduct typically involved in a crime.  In addition, the enumerated crimes are not much more similar to one another in kind than in degree of risk posed, and the concept of \xe2\x80\x9caggressive conduct\xe2\x80\x9d is far from clear.  <i>Sykes</i> criticized the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d test as an \xe2\x80\x9caddition to the statu-tory text,\xe2\x80\x9d explained that \xe2\x80\x9clevels of risk\xe2\x80\x9d would normally be dispositive, and confined <i>Begay</i> to \xe2\x80\x9cstrict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The present case, our fifth about the meaning of the residual clause, opens a new front of uncertainty.  When deciding whether unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun is a violent felony, do we confine our attention to the risk that the shotgun will go off by accident while in someone\xe2\x80\x99s possession?  Or do we also consider the possibility that the person possessing the shotgun will later use it to commit a crime?  The inclusion of burglary and extortion among the enumerated offenses suggests that a crime may qualify under the residual clause even if the physical injury is remote from the criminal act.  But how remote is too remote?  Once again, the residual clause yields no answers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court is not the only one that has had trouble making sense of the residual clause.  The clause has \xe2\x80\x9ccreated numerous splits among the lower federal courts,\xe2\x80\x9d where it has proved \xe2\x80\x9cnearly impossible to apply consistently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chambers</i>, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 133 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  The most telling feature of the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions is not division about whether the residual clause covers this or that crime (even clear laws produce close cases); it is, rather, pervasive disagreement about the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to conduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to consider.  Some judges have concluded that deciding whether conspiracy is a violent felony requires evaluating only the dangers posed by the \xe2\x80\x9csimple act of agreeing [to commit a crime],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Whitson</i>, 597 F.\xc2\xa03d 1218, 1222 (CA11 2010) (<i>per curiam</i>); others have also considered the probability that the agreement will be carried out, <i>United States </i>v. <i>White</i>, 571 F.\xc2\xa03d 365, 370\xe2\x80\x93371 (CA4 2009).  Some judges have assumed that the battery of a police officer (defined to include the slightest touching) could \xe2\x80\x9cexplode into violence and result in physical injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Williams</i>, 559 F.\xc2\xa03d 1143, 1149 (CA10 2009); others have felt that it \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] a great disservice to law enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x9d to assume that they would \xe2\x80\x9cexplod[e] into violence\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9crely on their training and experience to determine the best method of responding,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Carthorne</i>, 726 F.\xc2\xa03d 503, 514 (CA4 2013).  Some judges considering whether statutory rape qualifies as a violent felony have concentrated on cases involving a perpetrator much older than the victim, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Daye</i>, 571 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 230\xe2\x80\x93231 (CA2 2009); others have tried to account for the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cthe perpetrator and the victim [might be] close in age,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>McDonald</i>, 592 F.\xc2\xa03d 808, 815 (CA7 2010).  Disagreements like these go well beyond disputes over matters of degree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It has been said that the life of the law is experience.  Nine years\xe2\x80\x99 experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause convinces us that we have embarked upon a failed enterprise.  Each of the uncertainties in the residual clause may be tolerable in isolation, but \xe2\x80\x9ctheir sum makes a task for us which at best could be only guesswork.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Evans</i>,\n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483,\n495 (1948)\n.  Invoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison for 15 years to life does not comport with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of due process.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government and the dissent claim that there will be straightforward cases under the residual clause, because some crimes clearly pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See <i>post, </i>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (opinion of Alito, J.).  True enough, though we think many of the cases the Government and the dissent deem easy turn out not to be so easy after all.  Consider just one of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s examples, Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s offense of \xe2\x80\x9crioting at a correctional institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Johnson</i>, 616 F.\xc2\xa03d 85 (CA2 2010).  That certainly sounds like a violent felony\xe2\x80\x94until one realizes that Connecticut defines this offense to include taking part in \xe2\x80\x9cany disorder, disturbance, strike, riot or other organized disobedience to the rules and regulations\xe2\x80\x9d of the prison.  Conn. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa753a\xe2\x80\x93179b(a) (2012).  Who is to say which the ordinary \xe2\x80\x9cdisorder\xe2\x80\x9d most closely resembles\xe2\x80\x94a full-fledged prison riot, a food-fight in the prison cafeteria, or a \xe2\x80\x9cpassive and nonviolent [act] such as disregarding an order to move,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Johnson</i>, 616 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 95 (Parker, J., dissenting)?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In all events, although statements in some of our opinions could be read to suggest otherwise, our <i>holdings</i> squarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is constitutional merely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the provision\xe2\x80\x99s grasp.  For instance, we have deemed a law prohibiting grocers from charging an \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable rate\xe2\x80\x9d void for vagueness\xe2\x80\x94even though charging someone a thousand dollars for a pound of sugar would surely be unjust and unreasonable.  <i>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</i>, 255 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89.  We have similarly deemed void for vagueness a law prohibiting people on sidewalks from \xe2\x80\x9cconduct[ing] themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even though spitting in someone\xe2\x80\x99s face would surely be annoying.  <i>Coates </i>v. <i>Cincinnati</i>,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611 (1971)\n.  These decisions refute any suggestion that the existence of <i>some</i> obviously risky crimes establishes the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Resisting the force of these decisions, the dissent insists that \xe2\x80\x9ca statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 1.  It claims that the prohibition of unjust or unreasonable rates in <i>L. Cohen Grocery</i> was \xe2\x80\x9cvague in all applications,\xe2\x80\x9d even though one can easily envision rates so high that they are unreasonable by any measure.  <i>Post, </i>at 16.  It seems to us that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s supposed requirement of vagueness in all applications is not a requirement at all, but a tautology: If we hold a statute to be vague, it is vague in all its applications (and never mind the reality).  If the existence of some clearly unreasonable rates would not save the law in <i>L. Cohen Grocery</i>, why should the existence of some clearly risky crimes save the residual clause?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government and the dissent next point out that dozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgrave risk,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable risk,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that to hold the residual clause unconstitutional is to place these provisions in constitutional doubt.  See <i>post,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938. <i> </i>Not at all.  Almost none of the cited laws links a phrase such as \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d to a confusing list of examples.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe phrase \xe2\x80\x98shades of red,\xe2\x80\x99 standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase \xe2\x80\x98fire-engine red, light pink, maroon, <i>navy blue</i>, or colors that otherwise involve shades of red\xe2\x80\x99 assuredly does so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 230, n.\xc2\xa07 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  More importantly, almost all of the cited laws require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages <i>on a particular occasion</i>.  As a general matter, we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d to real-world conduct; \xe2\x80\x9cthe law is full of instances where a man\xe2\x80\x99s fate depends on his estimating rightly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. some matter of degree,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Nash</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n229 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373,\n377 (1913)\n.  The residual clause, however, requires application of the \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cthe elements necessary to determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain both in nature and degree of effect,\xe2\x80\x9d this abstract inquiry offers significantly less predictability than one \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat deals with the actual, not with an imaginary condition other than the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>International Harvester Co. of America</i> v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n234 U.\xc2\xa0S. 216,\n223 (1914)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the dissent urges us to save the residual clause from vagueness by interpreting it to refer to the risk posed by the particular conduct in which the defendant engaged, not the risk posed by the ordinary case of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime.  See <i>post, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9313.  In other words, the dissent suggests that we jettison for the residual clause (though not for the enumerated crimes) the categorical approach adopted in <i>Taylor</i>, see 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at  599\xe2\x80\x93602, and reaffirmed in each of our four residual-clause cases, see <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202; <i>Begay</i>, 553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141; <i>Chambers</i>, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 125; <i>Sykes</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., ___ (slip op., at 5).  We decline the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s invitation.  In the first place, the Government has not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.  In addition, <i>Taylor</i> had good reasons to adopt the categorical approach, reasons that apply no less to the residual clause than to the enumerated crimes.  <i>Taylor</i> explained that the relevant part of the Armed Career Criminal Act \xe2\x80\x9crefers to \xe2\x80\x98a person who . . . has three previous convictions\xe2\x80\x99 for\xe2\x80\x94not a person who has committed\xe2\x80\x94three previous violent felonies or drug offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600.  This emphasis on convictions indicates that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended the sentencing court to look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> <i>Taylor</i> also pointed out the utter impracticability of requiring a sentencing court to reconstruct, long after the original conviction, the conduct underlying that conviction.  For example, if the original conviction rested on a guilty plea, no record of the underlying facts may be available.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he only plausible interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the law, therefore, requires use of the categorical approach.  <i>Id.,</i> at 602.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">That brings us to <i>stare decisis</i>.  This is the first case in which the Court has received briefing and heard argument from the parties about whether the residual clause is void for vagueness.  In <i>James</i>, however, the Court stated in a footnote that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot persuaded by [the principal dissent\xe2\x80\x99s] suggestion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the residual provision is unconstitutionally vague.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 210, n.\xc2\xa06.  In <i>Sykes</i>, the Court again rejected a dissenting opinion\xe2\x80\x99s claim of vagueness.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> allows us to revisit an ear-lier decision where experience with its application reveals that it is unworkable.  <i>Payne </i>v. <i>Tennessee</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808,\n827 (1991)\n.  Experience is all the more instructive when the decision in question rejected a claim of unconstitu-tional vagueness.  Unlike other judicial mistakes that need correction, the error of having rejected a vagueness challenge manifests itself precisely in subsequent judicial decisions: the inability of later opinions to impart the predictability that the earlier opinion forecast.  Here, the experience of the federal courts leaves no doubt about the unavoidable uncertainty and arbitrariness of adjudication under the residual clause.  Even after <i>Sykes </i>tried to clarify the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, the provision remains a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial morass that defies systemic solution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca black hole of confusion and uncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d that frustrates any effort to impart \xe2\x80\x9csome sense of order and direction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Vann</i>, 660 F.\xc2\xa03d 771, 787 (CA4 2011) (Agee, J., concurring).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases make plain that even decisions rendered after full adversarial presentation may have to yield to the lessons of subsequent experience.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Dixon</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 688,\n711 (1993)\n; <i>Payne</i>,<i> </i>501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 828\xe2\x80\x93830 (1991).  But <i>James</i> and <i>Sykes</i> opined about vagueness without full briefing or argument on that issue\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance that leaves us \xe2\x80\x9cless constrained to follow precedent,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hohn </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 236,\n251 (1998)\n.  The brief discussions of vagueness in <i>James </i>and <i>Sykes</i> homed in on the imprecision of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d; neither opinion evaluated the uncertainty introduced by the need to evaluate the riskiness of an abstract ordinary case of a crime.  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 210, n. 6; 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  And departing from those decisions does not raise any concerns about upsetting private reliance interests.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although it is a vital rule of judicial self-government, <i>stare decisis</i> does not matter for its own sake.  It matters because it \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Payne</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 827.  Decisions under the residual clause have proved to be anything but evenhanded, predictable, or consistent.

Under conventional principles of interpretation and our precedents, the offense of unlawfully possessing a short-barreled shotgun does not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority wants more.  Not content to engage in the usual business of interpreting statutes, it holds this clause to be unconstitutionally vague, notwithstanding the fact that on four previous occasions we found it determinate enough for judicial application.  As Justice Alito explains, that decision cannot be reconciled with our precedents concerning the vagueness doctrine.  See <i>post, </i>at 13\xe2\x80\x9317 (dissenting opinion).  But even if it were a closer case under those decisions, I would be wary of holding the residual clause to be unconstitutionally vague.  Although I have joined the Court in applying our modern vagueness doctrine in the past, see <i>FCC </i>v. <i>Fox Television Stations, Inc.</i>,<i> </i>567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2012) (slip op., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317), I have become increasingly concerned about its origins and application.

As we explained, vehicular flights \xe2\x80\x9cby definitional necessity occur when police are present\xe2\x80\x9d and are done \xe2\x80\x9cin defiance of their instructions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  In <i>James</i>, we likewise held that attempted burglary offenses \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] an overt act directed toward the entry of a structure\xe2\x80\x9d are violent felonies because the underlying conduct often results in a dangerous confrontation.  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 204, 206.  But we distinguished those crimes from \xe2\x80\x9cthe more attenuated conduct encompassed by\xe2\x80\x9d attempt offenses \xe2\x80\x9cthat c[an] be satisfied by preparatory conduct that does not pose the same risk of violent confrontation,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possessing burglary tools.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 205, 206, and n.\xc2\xa04.  At some point, in other words, the risk of injury from the crime may be too attenuated for the conviction to fall within the residual clause, such as when an additional, voluntary act (<i>e.g.</i>, the <i>use</i> of burglary tools to enter a structure) is necessary to bring about the risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of the elements of and reported convictions for the unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, this crime does not \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The acts that form the basis of this offense are simply too remote from a risk of physical injury to fall within the residual clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Standing alone, the elements of this offense\xe2\x80\x94(1) unlawfully (2) possessing (3) a short-barreled shotgun\xe2\x80\x94do not describe inherently dangerous conduct.  As a conceptual matter, \xe2\x80\x9csimple possession [of a firearm], even by a felon, takes place in a variety of ways (<i>e.g.</i>, in a closet, in a storeroom, in a car, in a pocket) many, perhaps most, of which do not involve likely accompanying violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Doe</i>, 960 F.\xc2\xa02d 221, 225 (CA1 1992).  These weapons also can be stored in a manner posing a danger to no one, such as unloaded, disassembled, or locked away.  By themselves, the elements of this offense indicate that the ordinary commission of this crime is far less risky than ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reported convictions support the conclusion that mere possession of a short-barreled shotgun does not, in the ordinary case, pose a serious risk of injury to others.  A few examples suffice.  In one case, officers found the sawed-off shotgun locked inside a gun cabinet in an empty home.  <i>State</i> v. <i>Salyers</i>, 858 N. W. 2d 156, 157\xe2\x80\x93158 (Minn. 2015).  In another, the firearm was retrieved from the trunk of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s car.  <i>State</i> v. <i>Ellenberger</i>, 543 N. W. 2d 673, 674 (Minn. App. 1996).  In still another, the weapon was found missing a firing pin.  <i>State </i>v. <i>Johnson</i>, 171 Wis. 2d 175, 178, 491 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 110, 111 (App. 1992).  In these instances and others, the offense threatened no one.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory for why this crime should nonetheless qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is unpersuasive.  Although it does not dispute that the unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun can occur in a nondangerous manner, the Government contends that this offense poses a serious risk of physical injury due to the connection between short-barreled shotguns and other serious crimes.  As the Government explains, these firearms are \xe2\x80\x9cweapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>District of Columbia </i>v. <i>Heller</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570,\n625 (2008)\n, but are instead primarily intended for use in criminal activity.  In light of that intended use, the Government reasons that the ordinary case of this possession offense will involve the <i>use</i> of a short-barreled shotgun in a serious crime, a scenario obviously posing a serious risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But even assuming that those who unlawfully possess these weapons typically intend to use them in a serious crime, the risk that the Government identifies arises not from the act of possessing the weapon, but from the act of using it.  Unlike attempted burglary (at least of the type at issue in <i>James</i>) or intentional vehicular flight\xe2\x80\x94conduct that by itself often or always invites a dangerous confrontation\xe2\x80\x94possession of a short-barreled shotgun poses a threat <i>only</i> when an offender decides to engage in additional, voluntary conduct that is not included in the elements of the crime.  Until this weapon is assembled, loaded, or used, for example, it poses no risk of injury to others in and of itself.  The risk of injury to others from mere possession of this firearm is too attenuated to treat this offense as a violent felony.  I would reverse the Court of Appeals on that basis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the foregoing analysis demonstrates, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s resid-ual clause can be applied in a principled manner.  One would have thought this proposition well established given that we have already decided four cases addressing this clause.  The majority nonetheless concludes that the operation of this provision violates the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Alito shows why that analysis is wrong under our precedents.  See <i>post, </i>at 13\xe2\x80\x9317 (dissenting opinion).  But I have some concerns about our modern vagueness doctrine itself.  Whether that doctrine is defensible under the original meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdue process of law\xe2\x80\x9d is a difficult question I leave for the another day, but the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s history should prompt us at least to examine its constitutional underpinnings more closely before we use it to nullify yet another duly enacted law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We have become accustomed to using the Due Process Clauses to invalidate laws on the ground of \xe2\x80\x9cvagueness.\xe2\x80\x9d  The doctrine we have developed is quite sweeping: \xe2\x80\x9cA statute can be impermissibly vague .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cif it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hill</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 703,\n732 (2000)\n.  Using this framework, we have nullified a wide range of enactments.  We have struck down laws ranging from city ordinances, <i>Papachristou</i> v. <i>Jacksonville</i>,\n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156\n\xe2\x80\x93171 (1972), to Acts of Congress, <i>United States </i>v. <i>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</i>,\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n\xe2\x80\x9393 (1921).  We have struck down laws whether they are penal, <i>Lanzetta </i>v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n306 U.\xc2\xa0S. 451,\n452,\n458 (1939)\n, or not, <i>Keyishian </i>v. <i>Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 589\n\xe2\x80\x93604 (1967).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  We have struck down laws addressing subjects ranging from abortion, <i>Colautti </i>v. <i>Franklin</i>,\n\n439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379,\n390 (1979)\n, and obscenity, <i>Winters </i>v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507\n\xe2\x80\x93520 (1948), to the minimum wage, <i>Connally </i>v. <i>General Constr.

We have even struck down a law using a term that has been used to describe criminal conduct in this country since before the Constitution was ratified.  <i>Chicago</i> v. <i>Morales</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41,\n51 (1999)\n (invalidating a \xe2\x80\x9cloitering\xe2\x80\x9d law); see <i>id.,</i> at 113, and n. 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (discussing a 1764 Georgia law requiring the apprehension of \xe2\x80\x9call able bodied persons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. who shall be found loitering\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That we have repeatedly used a doctrine to invalidate laws does not make it legitimate.  Cf., <i>e.g., Dred Scott </i>v. <i>Sandford</i>, 19 How. 393, 450\xe2\x80\x93452 (1857) (stating that an Act of Congress prohibiting slavery in certain Federal Territories violated the substantive due process rights of slaveowners and was therefore void).  This Court has a history of wielding doctrines purportedly rooted in \xe2\x80\x9cdue process of law\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve its own policy goals, substantive due process being the poster child.  See <i>McDonald </i>v. <i>Chicago</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742,\n811 (2010)\n (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe one theme that links the Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process precedents together is their lack of a guiding principle to distinguish \xe2\x80\x98fundamental\xe2\x80\x99 rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although our vagueness doctrine is distinct from substantive due process, their histories have disquieting parallels.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The problem of vague penal statutes is nothing new.  The notion that such laws may be void under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clauses, however, is a more recent development.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before the end of the 19th century, courts addressed vagueness through a rule of strict construction of penal statutes, not a rule of constitutional law.  This rule of construction\xe2\x80\x94better known today as the rule of lenity\xe2\x80\x94first emerged in 16th-century England in reaction to Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s practice of making large swaths of crimes capital offenses, though it did not gain broad acceptance until the following century.  See Hall, Strict or Liberal Construction of Penal Statutes, 48 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 748, 749\xe2\x80\x93751 (1935); see also 1 L. Radzinowicz, A History of English Criminal Law and Its Administration From 1750, pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (1948) (noting that some of the following crimes triggered the death penalty: \xe2\x80\x9cmarking the edges of any current coin of the kingdom,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously cutting any hop-binds growing on poles in any plantation of hops,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbeing in the company of gypsies\xe2\x80\x9d).  Courts relied on this rule of construction in refusing to apply vague capital-offense statutes to prosecutions before them.  As an example of this rule, William Blackstone described a notable instance in which an English statute imposing the death penalty on anyone convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cstealing sheep, <i>or other cattle</i>\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cheld to extend to nothing but mere sheep\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cth[e] general words, \xe2\x80\x98or other cattle,\xe2\x80\x99 [were] looked upon as much too loose to create a capital offence.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 88 (1765).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Vague statutes surfaced on this side of the Atlantic as well.  Shortly after the First Congress proposed the Bill of Rights, for instance, it passed a law providing \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat every person who shall attempt to trade with the Indian tribes, or be found in the Indian country with such merchandise in his possession as are usually vended to the Indians, without a license,\xe2\x80\x9d must forfeit the offending goods.  Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, \xc2\xa73,\n\n1Stat.\n137\xe2\x80\x93138.  At first glance, punishing the unlicensed possession of \xe2\x80\x9cmerchandise .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. usually vended to the Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, would seem far more likely to \xe2\x80\x9cinvit[e] arbitrary enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 5, than does the residual clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But rather than strike down arguably vague laws under the\n \nFifth Amendment Due Process Clause, antebellum American courts\xe2\x80\x94like their English predecessors\xe2\x80\x94simply refused to apply them in individual cases under the rule that penal statutes should be construed strictly.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sharp</i>, 27 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 1041 (No. 16,264) (CC Pa. 1815) (Washington, J.).  In <i>Sharp</i>, for instance, several defendants charged with violating an Act rendering it a capital offense for \xe2\x80\x9cany seaman\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmake a revolt in [a] ship,\xe2\x80\x9d Act of Apr. 30, 1790, \xc2\xa78,\n\n1Stat.\n114, objected that \xe2\x80\x9cthe offence of making a revolt, [wa]s not sufficiently defined by this law, or by any other standard, to which reference could be safely made; to warrant the court in passing a sentence upon [them].\xe2\x80\x9d  27 F.\xc2\xa0Cas., at 1043.  Justice Washington, riding circuit, apparently agreed, observing that the common definitions for the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmake a revolt\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cso multifarious, and so different\xe2\x80\x9d that he could not \xe2\x80\x9cavoid feeling a natural repugnance, to selecting from this mass of definitions, one, which may fix a crime upon these men, and that too of a capital nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Remarking that \xe2\x80\x9c[l]aws which create crimes, ought to be so explicit in themselves, or by reference to some other standard, that all men, subject to their penalties, may know what acts it is their duty to avoid,\xe2\x80\x9d he refused to \xe2\x80\x9crecommend to the jury, to find the prisoners guilty of making, or endeavouring to make a revolt, however strong the evidence may be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Such analysis does not mean that federal courts believed they had the power to invalidate vague penal laws as unconstitutional.  Indeed, there is good evidence that courts at the time understood judicial review to consist \xe2\x80\x9cof a refusal to give a statute effect as operative law in resolving a case,\xe2\x80\x9d a notion quite distinct from our modern practice of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strik[ing] down\xe2\x80\x99 legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Walsh, Partial Unconstitutionality, 85 N.\xc2\xa0Y. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 738, 756 (2010).  The process of refusing to apply such laws appeared to occur on a case-by-case basis.  For instance, notwithstanding his doubts expressed in <i>Sharp</i>, Justice Washington, writing for this<i> </i>Court, later rejected the argument that lower courts could arrest a judgment under the same ship-revolt statute because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not define the offence of endeavouring to make a revolt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kelly</i>, 11 Wheat. 417, 418 (1826).  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cit is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. competent to the Court to give a judicial definition\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe offence of endeavouring to make a revolt,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such definition \xe2\x80\x9cconsists in the endeavour of the crew of a vessel, or any one or more of them, to overthrow the legitimate authority of her commander, with intent to remove him from his command, or against his will to take possession of the vessel by assuming the government and navigation of her, or by transferring their obedience from the lawful commander to some other person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 418\xe2\x80\x93419.  In dealing with statutory indeterminacy, federal courts saw themselves engaged in construction, not judicial review as it is now understood. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although vagueness concerns played a role in the strict construction of penal statutes from early on, there is little indication that anyone before the late 19th century believed that courts had the power under the Due Process Clauses to nullify statutes on that ground.  Instead, our modern vagueness doctrine materialized after the rise of substantive due process.  Following the ratification of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment, corporations began to use that Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause to challenge state laws that attached penalties to unauthorized commercial conduct.  In addition to claiming that these laws violated their substantive due process rights, these litigants began\xe2\x80\x94with some success\xe2\x80\x94to contend that such laws were unconstitutionally indefinite.  In one case, a railroad company challenged a Tennessee law authorizing penalties against any railroad that demanded \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a just and reasonable compensation\xe2\x80\x9d or engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cunjust and unreasonable discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d in setting its rates.  <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.\xc2\xa0Co. </i>v. <i>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tenn.</i>, 19 F. 679, 690 (CC MD Tenn. 1884) (internal quotation marks deleted).  Without specifying the constitutional authority for its holding, the Circuit Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o citizen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. can be constitutionally subjected to penalties and despoiled of his property, in a criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, under and by force of such indefinite legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 693 (emphasis deleted). </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Brewer\xe2\x80\x94widely recognized as \xe2\x80\x9ca leading spokesman for \xe2\x80\x98substantized\xe2\x80\x99 due process,\xe2\x80\x9d Gamer, Justice Brewer and Substantive Due Process: A Conservative Court Revisited, 18 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 615, 627 (1965)\xe2\x80\x94employed similar reasoning while riding circuit, though he did not identify the constitutional source of judicial authority to nullify vague laws.  In reviewing an Iowa law authorizing fines against railroads for charging more than a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and just\xe2\x80\x9d rate, Justice Brewer mentioned in dictum that \xe2\x80\x9cno penal law can be sustained unless its mandates are so clearly expressed that any ordinary person can determine in advance what he may and what he may not do under it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chicago &amp; N.\xc2\xa0W. R. Co. </i>v. <i>Dey</i>, 35 F. 866, 876 (CC SD Iowa 1888).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Constitutional vagueness challenges in this Court initially met with some resistance.  Although the Court appeared to acknowledge the possibility of unconstitutionally indefinite enactments, it repeatedly rejected vagueness challenges to penal laws addressing railroad rates, <i>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n Cases</i>,\n\n116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307\n\xe2\x80\x93337 (1886), liquor sales, <i>Ohio ex\xc2\xa0rel.

In <i>International Harvester Co. of America </i>v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n234 U.\xc2\xa0S. 216 (1914)\n, a tobacco company brought a\n \nFourteenth Amendment challenge against several Kentucky antitrust laws that had been construed to render unlawful \xe2\x80\x9cany combination [made] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the purpose or with the effect of fixing a price that was greater or less than the real value of the article,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 221.  The com-pany argued that by referring to \xe2\x80\x9creal value,\xe2\x80\x9d the laws pro-vided \xe2\x80\x9cno standard of conduct that it is possible to know.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court agreed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 223\xe2\x80\x93224.  Although it did not specify in that case which portion of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment served as the basis for its holding, <i>ibid.</i>, it explained in a related case that the lack of a knowable standard of conduct in the Kentucky statutes \xe2\x80\x9cviolated the fundamental principles of justice embraced in the conception of due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Collins</i> v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n234 U.\xc2\xa0S. 634,\n638 (1914)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Since that time, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of its vagueness doctrine has largely mirrored its application of substantive due process.  During the <i>Lochner </i>era, a period marked by the use of substantive due process to strike down economic regulations, <i>e.g., Lochner </i>v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n198 U.\xc2\xa0S. 45,\n57 (1905)\n, the Court frequently used the vagueness doctrine to invalidate economic regulations penalizing commercial activity.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Among the penal laws it found to be impermissibly vague were a state law regulating the production of crude oil, <i>Champlin Refining Co.</i> v. <i>Corporation Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Okla.</i>,\n\n286 U.\xc2\xa0S. 210\n\xe2\x80\x93243 (1932), a state antitrust law, <i>Cline</i>, 274 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 453\xe2\x80\x93465, a state minimum-wage law, <i>Connally</i>, 269 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 390\xe2\x80\x93395, and a federal price-control statute, <i>L.

The Court began to use the vagueness doctrine to invalidate noneconomic regulations, such as state statutes penalizing obscenity, <i>Winters</i>, 333 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 517\xe2\x80\x93520, and membership in a gang, <i>Lanzetta</i>, 306 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 458.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Successful vagueness challenges to regulations penalizing commercial conduct, by contrast, largely fell by the wayside.  The Court, for instance, upheld a federal regulation punishing the knowing violation of an order instructing drivers transporting dangerous chemicals to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98avoid, so far as practicable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. driving into or through congested thoroughfares, places where crowds are assembled, street car tracks, tunnels, viaducts, and dangerous crossings,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 337\n, 338\xe2\x80\x93339, 343 (1952).  And notwithstanding its earlier conclusion that an Oklahoma law requiring state employees and contractors to be paid \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not less than the current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was unconstitutionally vague, <i>Connally, supra,</i> at 393, the Court found sufficiently definite a federal law forbidding radio broadcasting companies from attempting to compel by threat or duress a licensee to hire \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98persons in excess of the number of employees needed by such licensee to perform actual services,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Petrillo</i>,\n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x937 (1947).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In more recent times, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process jurisprudence has focused on abortions, and our vagueness doctrine has played a correspondingly significant role.  In fact, our vagueness doctrine served as the basis for the first draft of the majority opinion in <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113 (1973)\n, on the theory that laws prohibiting all abortions save for those done \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of saving the life of the mother\xe2\x80\x9d forced abortionists to guess when this exception would apply on penalty of conviction.  See B. Schwartz, The Unpublished Opinions of the Burger Court 116\xe2\x80\x93118 (1988) (reprinting first draft of <i>Roe</i>).  <i>Roe</i>, of course, turned out as a substantive due process opinion.  See 410 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 164.  But since then, the Court has repeatedly deployed the vagueness doctrine to nullify even mild regulations of the abortion industry.  See <i>Akron </i>v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 416\n\xe2\x80\x93452 (1983) (nullifying law requiring \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that the remains of the unborn child [be] disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> Colautti</i>, 439 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 381 (nullifying law mandating abortionists adhere to a prescribed standard of care if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0there is \xe2\x80\x98sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In one of our most recent decisions nullifying a law on vagueness grounds, substantive due process was again lurking in the background.

That justification assumes further that providing \xe2\x80\x9ca person of ordinary intelligence [with] fair notice of what is prohib-ited,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Williams</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 304, is one such usage or mode.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To accept the vagueness doctrine as founded in our Constitution, then, one must reject the possibility \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Due Process Clause requires only that our Government must proceed according to the \xe2\x80\x98law of the land\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d which may be all that the original meaning of this provision demands.  <i>Hamdi </i>v. <i>Rumsfeld</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507,\n589 (2004)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting) (some internal quotation marks omitted); accord,<i> Turner</i> v. <i>Rogers</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).  Although <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i> stated the contrary, 18 How., at 276, a number of scholars and jurists have concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable historical evidence supports the position that \xe2\x80\x98due process of law\xe2\x80\x99 was a separation-of-powers concept designed as a safeguard against unlicensed executive action, forbidding only deprivations not authorized by legislation or common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  D.

But the Court rejected my argument, choosing instead to begin that unnecessary exercise.  I see no principled way that, four cases later, the Court can now declare that the residual clause has become too indeterminate to apply.  Having damaged the residual clause through our misguided jurisprudence, we have no right to send this provision back to Congress and ask for a new one.  I cannot join the Court in using the Due Process Clause to nullify an Act of Congress that contains an unmistakable core of forbidden conduct, and I concur only in its judgment.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0By \xe2\x80\x9cpenal,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean laws \xe2\x80\x9cauthoriz[ing] criminal punishment\xe2\x80\x9d as well as those \xe2\x80\x9cauthorizing fines or forfeitures .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

And the Court is not stopped by the well-established rule that a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications.  While conceding that some applications of the residual clause are straightforward, the Court holds that the clause is now void in its entirety.

He pleaded guilty to one of the firearms counts, and the District Court sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment under ACCA, based on his prior felony convictions for robbery, attempted robbery, and illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ACCA provides a mandatory minimum sentence for certain violations of \xc2\xa7922(g), which prohibits the shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms or ammunition by convicted felons, persons previously committed to a mental institution, and certain others.  Federal law normally provides a maximum sentence of 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for such crimes.  See \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).  Under ACCA, however, if a defendant convicted under \xc2\xa7922(g) has three prior convictions \xe2\x80\x9cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense,\xe2\x80\x9d the sentencing court must impose a sentence of at least 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d has three parts.  First, a felony qualifies if it \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Second, the Act specifically names four categories of qualifying felonies: burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives.  See \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Third, the Act contains what we have called a \xe2\x80\x9cresidual clause,\xe2\x80\x9d which reaches any felony that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The present case concerns the residual clause.  The sole question raised in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition was whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun under Minne-sota law qualifies as a violent felony under that clause.  Although Johnson argued in the lower courts that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, he did not renew that argument here.  Nevertheless, after oral argument, the Court raised the question of vagueness on its own.  The Court now holds that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague in all its applications.  I cannot agree.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I begin with <i>stare decisis</i>.  Eight years ago in <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192 (2007)\n, Justice Scalia, the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court, fired an opening shot at the residual clause.  In dissent, he suggested that the residual clause is void for vagueness.  <i>Id</i>., at 230.  The Court held otherwise, explaining that the standard in the residual clause \xe2\x80\x9cis not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding\xe2\x80\x9d its scope.  <i>Id</i>., at 210, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four years later, in <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2011)\n, Justice Scalia fired another round.  Dissenting once again, he argued that the residual clause is void for vagueness and rehearsed the same basic arguments that the Court now adopts.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938); see also <i>Derby</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  As in <i>James</i>, the Court rejected his arguments.  See <i>Sykes</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  In fact, Justice Scalia was the <i>only</i> Member of the <i>Sykes </i>Court who took the position that the residual clause could not be intelligibly applied to the offense at issue.  The opinion of the Court, which five Justices joined, expressly held that the residual clause \xe2\x80\x9cstates an intelligible principle and provides guidance that allows a person to \xe2\x80\x98conform his or her conduct to the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314) (quoting <i>Chicago </i>v. <i>Morales</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41,\n58 (1999)\n (plurality opinion)).  Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, while disagreeing in part with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the residual clause, did not question its constitutionality.  See <i>Sykes</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (opinion concurring in judgment).  And Justice Kagan\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, which Justice Ginsburg joined, argued that a proper application of the provision required a different result.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___.  Thus, eight Members of the Court found the statute capable of principled application.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is, of course, true that \xe2\x80\x9c[<i>s</i>]<i>tare decisis</i> is not an inexorable command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennessee</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808,\n828 (1991)\n.  But neither is it an empty Latin phrase.  There must be good reasons for overruling a precedent, and there is none here.  Nothing has changed since our decisions in <i>James</i> and <i>Sykes</i>\xe2\x80\x94nothing, that is, except the Court\xe2\x80\x99s weariness with ACCA cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reprising an argument that Justice Scalia made to no avail in <i>Sykes</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 7), the Court reasons that the residual clause must be unconstitutionally vague because we have had trouble settling on an interpretation.  See <i>ante,</i> at 7.  But disagreement about the meaning and application of the clause is not new.  We were divided in <i>James</i> and in <i>Sykes</i> and in our intervening decisions in <i>Begay </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (2008)\n, and <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>United States, </i>\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122 (2009)\n.<i> </i>And that pattern is not unique to ACCA; we have been unable to come to an agreement on many recurring legal questions.  The Confrontation Clause is one example that comes readily to mind.  See, <i>e.g., Williams</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012); <i>Bullcoming </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011); <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> v. <i>Massachusetts</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305 (2009)\n.  Our disagreements about the meaning of that provision do not prove that the Confrontation Clause has no ascertainable meaning.  Likewise, our disagreements on the residual clause do not prove that it is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also points to conflicts in the decisions of the lower courts as proof that the statute is unconstitutional.  See <i>ante, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The Court overstates the degree of disagreement below.  For many crimes, there is no dispute that the residual clause applies.  And our certiorari docket provides a skewed picture because the decisions that we are asked to review are usually those involving issues on which there is at least an arguable circuit conflict.  But in any event, it has never been thought that conflicting interpretations of a statute justify judicial elimination of the statute.  One of our chief responsibilities is to resolve those disagreements, see Supreme Court Rule 10, not to strike down the laws that create this work.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court may not relish the task of resolving residual clause questions on which the Circuits disagree, but the provision has not placed a crushing burden on our docket.  In the eight years since <i>James</i>, we have decided all of three cases involving the residual clause.  See <i>Begay</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Chambers</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Sykes</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Nevertheless, faced with the unappealing prospect of resolving more circuit splits on various residual clause issues, see <i>ante, </i>at 9, six Members of the Court have thrown in the towel.  That is not responsible.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if we put <i>stare decisis</i> aside, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision remains indefensible.  The residual clause is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFifth Amendment prohibits the enforcement of vague criminal laws, but the threshold for declaring a law void for vagueness is high.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe strong presumptive validity that attaches to an Act of Congress has led this Court to hold many times that statutes are not automatically invalidated as vague simply because difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal offenses fall within their language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>National Dairy Products Corp.</i>,\n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29,\n32 (1963)\n.  Rather, it is sufficient if a statute sets out an \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</i>,\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n (1921).  A statute is thus void for vagueness only if it wholly \xe2\x80\x9cfails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 285,\n304 (2008)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The bar is even higher for sentencing provisions.  The fair notice concerns that inform our vagueness doctrine are aimed at ensuring that a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98person of ordinary intelligence [has] a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hoffman Estates</i> v. <i>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 489,\n498 (1982)\n (quoting <i>Grayned</i> v. <i>City of Rockford</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104,\n108 (1972)\n).  The fear is that vague laws will \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trap the innocent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 498.  These concerns have less force when it comes to sentencing provisions, which come into play only after the defendant has been found guilty of the crime in question.  Due process does not require, as Johnson oddly suggests, that a \xe2\x80\x9cprospective criminal\xe2\x80\x9d be able to calculate the precise penalty that a conviction would bring.  Supp. Brief for Petitioner 5; see <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 453\n\xe2\x80\x93468 (1991) (concluding that a vagueness challenge was \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly\xe2\x80\x9d weak \xe2\x80\x9csince whatever debate there is would center around the appropriate sentence and not the criminality of the conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause unquestionably provides an ascertainable standard.  It defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include any offense that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  That language is by no means incomprehensible.  Nor is it unusual.  There are scores of federal and state laws that employ similar standards.  The Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s brief contains a 99-page appendix setting out some of these laws.  See App. to Supp. Brief for United States; see also <i>James</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 210, n.\xc2\xa06.  If all these laws are unconstitutionally vague, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not a blast from a sawed-off shotgun; it is a nuclear explosion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Attempting to avoid such devastation, the Court distinguishes these laws primarily on the ground that almost all of them \xe2\x80\x9crequire gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages <i>on a</i> <i>particular occasion</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12 (emphasis in original).  The Court thus admits that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a general matter, we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk\xe2\x80\x99 to real-world conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Its complaint is that the residual clause \xe2\x80\x9crequires application of the \xe2\x80\x98serious potential risk\xe2\x80\x99 standard to an <i>idealized ordinary case of the crime</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (emphasis added).  Thus, according to the Court, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague because its standard must be applied to \xe2\x80\x9can idealized ordinary case of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d and not, like the vast majority of the laws in the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s appendix, to \xe2\x80\x9creal-world conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">ACCA, however, makes no reference to \xe2\x80\x9can idealized ordinary case of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  That requirement was the handiwork of this Court in <i>Taylor </i>v.<i> United States,</i><i> </i>\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575 (1990)\n.  And as I will show, the residual clause can reasonably be interpreted to refer to \xe2\x80\x9creal-worldconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When a statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality is in doubt, we have an obligation to interpret the law, if possible, to avoid the constitutional problem.  See, <i>e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</i> v. <i>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</i>,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 568,\n575 (1988)\n.  As one treatise puts it, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] statute should be interpreted in a way that avoids placing its constitutionality in doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts \xc2\xa738, p. 247 (2012).  This canon applies fully when considering vagueness challenges.  In cases like this one, \xe2\x80\x9cour task is not to destroy the Act if we can, but to construe it, if consistent with the will of Congress, so as to comport with constitutional limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Letter Carriers, </i>\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 548,\n571 (1973)\n; see also <i>Skilling </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358,\n403 (2010)\n.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 406 (quoting <i>Hooper</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648,\n657 (1895)\n; emphasis deleted); see also <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Randolph</i>, 20 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11,558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court all but concedes that the residual clause would be constitutional if it applied to \xe2\x80\x9creal-world conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether that is the <i>best</i> interpretation of the residual clause is beside the point.  What matters is whether it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.  And it surely is that.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, this interpretation heeds the pointed distinction that ACCA draws between the \xe2\x80\x9celement[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of an offense and \xe2\x80\x9cconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), a crime qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d if one of its \xe2\x80\x9celement[s]\xe2\x80\x9d involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the residual clause, which appears in the very next subsection, \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), focuses on \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94specifically, \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  The use of these two different terms in \xc2\xa7924(e) indicates that \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d refers to things done during the commission of an offense that are not part of the elements needed for conviction.  Because those extra actions vary from case to case, it is natural to interpret \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d to mean real-world conduct, not the conduct involved in some Platonic ideal of the offense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, as the Court points out, standards like the one in the residual clause almost always appear in laws that call for application by a trier of fact.  This strongly suggests that the residual clause calls for the same sort of application.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, if the Court is correct that the residual clause is nearly incomprehensible when interpreted as applying to an \xe2\x80\x9cidealized ordinary case of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d then that is telling evidence that this is not what Congress intended.  When another interpretation is ready at hand, why should we assume that Congress gave the clause a meaning that is impossible\xe2\x80\x94or even, exceedingly difficult\xe2\x80\x94to apply?</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Not only does the \xe2\x80\x9creal-world conduct\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation fit the terms of the residual clause, but the reasons that persuaded the Court to adopt the categorical approach in <i>Taylor </i>either do not apply or have much less force in residual clause cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Taylor</i>, the question before the Court concerned the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d one of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated of-fenses.  The Court gave three reasons for holding that a judge making an ACCA determination should generally look only at the elements of the offense of conviction and not to other things that the defendant did during the commission of the offense.  First, the Court thought that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cconvictions\xe2\x80\x9d pointed to the categorical approach.  The Court wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cSection 924(e)(1) refers to \xe2\x80\x98a person who .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has three previous convictions\xe2\x80\x99 for\xe2\x80\x94not a person who has committed\xe2\x80\x94three previous violent felonies or drug offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600. <b> </b>Second, the Court relied on legislative history, noting that ACCA had previously contained a generic definition of burglary and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe deletion of [this] definition .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may have been an inadvertent casualty of a complex drafting process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 589\xe2\x80\x93590, 601.  Third, the Court felt that \xe2\x80\x9cthe practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach [were] daunting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 601.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">None of these three grounds dictates that the categorical approach must be used in residual clause cases.  The second ground, which concerned the deletion of a generic definition of burglary, obviously has no application to the residual clause.  And the first ground has much less force in residual clause cases.  In <i>Taylor</i>, the Court reasoned that a defendant has a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction\xe2\x80\x9d for burglary only if burglary is the offense set out in the judgment of conviction.  For instance, if a defendant commits a burglary but pleads guilty, under a plea bargain, to possession of burglar\xe2\x80\x99s tools, the <i>Taylor</i> Court thought that it would be unnatural to say that the defendant had a <i>conviction</i> for burglary.  Now consider a case in which a gang member is convicted of illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun and the evidence shows that he concealed the weapon under his coat, while searching for a rival gang member who had just killed his brother.  In that situation, it is not at all unnatural to say that the defendant had a conviction for a crime that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[d]<i> conduct</i> that present[ed] a seri-ous potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  At the very least, it would be a reasonable way to describe the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Taylor</i> Court\xe2\x80\x99s remaining reasons for adopting the categorical approach cannot justify an interpretation that renders the residual clause unconstitutional.  While the <i>Taylor</i> Court feared that a conduct-specific approach would unduly burden the courts, experience has shown that application of the categorical approach has not always been easy.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s main argument for overturning the statute is that this approach is unmanageable in residual clause cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for the notion that the categorical approach is more forgiving to defendants, there is a strong argument that the opposite is true, at least with respect to the residual clause.  Consider two criminal laws:  Injury occurs in 10% of cases involving the violation of statute A, but in 90% of cases involving the violation of statute B.  Under the categorical approach, a truly dangerous crime under statute A might not qualify as a violent felony, while a crime with no measurable risk of harm under statute B would count against the defendant.  Under a conduct-specific inquiry, on the other hand, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actual conduct would determine whether ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory penalty applies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is also significant that the allocation of the burden of proof protects defendants.  The prosecution bears the burden of proving that a defendant has convictions that qualify for sentencing under ACCA.  If evidentiary deficiencies, poor recordkeeping, or anything else preventsthe prosecution from discharging that burden under the conduct-specific approach, a defendant would not receive an ACCA sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor would a conduct-specific inquiry raise constitutional problems of its own.  It is questionable whether the\n \nSixth Amendment creates a right to a jury trial in this situation.  See <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224 (1998)\n.  But if it does, the issue could be tried to a jury, and the prosecution could bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior crimes involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of injury to another.  I would adopt this alternative interpretation and hold that the residual clause requires an examination of real-world conduct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only reason for refusing to consider this interpretation is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government has not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.  But the Court cites no case in which wehave suggested that a saving interpretation may be adopted only if it is proposed by one of the parties.  Nor does the Court cite any secondary authorities advocating this rule.  Cf. Scalia, Reading Law \xc2\xa738 (stating the canon with no such limitation).  On the contrary, we have long recognized that it is \xe2\x80\x9cour plain duty to adopt that construction which will save [a] statute from constitutional infirmity,\xe2\x80\x9d where fairly possible.  <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Attorney General</i> v. <i>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.</i>,\n\n213 U.\xc2\xa0S. 366,\n407 (1909)\n.  It would be strange if we could fulfill that \xe2\x80\x9cplain duty\xe2\x80\x9d only when a party asks us to do so.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consider a saving interpretation not advocated by the Government is hard to square with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of an argument that petitioner chose not to raise.  As noted, Johnson did not ask us to hold that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, but the Court inter-jected that issue into the case, requested supplemental briefing on the question, and heard reargument.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to look beyond the arguments of the parties apparently applies only to arguments that the Court does not want to hear.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if the categorical approach is used in residual clause cases, however, the clause is still not void for vagueness.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well established that vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve\n \nFirst Amendment freedoms must be examined\xe2\x80\x9d on an as-applied basis.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mazurie</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544,\n550 (1975)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cObjections to vagueness under the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice, and hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maynard</i> v. <i>Cartwright</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356,\n361 (1988)\n.  Thus, in a due process vagueness case, we will hold that a law is facially invalid \xe2\x80\x9conly if the enactment is impermissibly vague in <i>all</i> of its applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hoffman Estates</i>, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 494\xe2\x80\x93495 (emphasis added); see also <i>Chapman</i>, 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In concluding that the residual clause is facially void for vagueness, the Court flatly contravenes this rule.  The Court admits \xe2\x80\x9cthat there will be straightforward cases under the residual clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  But rather than exercising the restraint that our vagueness cases prescribe, the Court holds that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague even when its application is clear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of this issue is startling.  Its facial invalidation precludes a sentencing court that is applying ACCA from counting convictions for even those specific offenses that this Court previously found to fall within the residual clause.  See <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203\xe2\x80\x93209 (attempted burglary); <i>Sykes</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x939) (flight from law enforcement in a vehicle).  Still worse, the Court holds that vagueness bars the use of the residual clause in other cases in which its applicability can hardly be questioned.  Attempted rape is an example.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Dawson </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 702 F.\xc2\xa03d 347, 351\xe2\x80\x93352 (CA6 2012).  Can there be any doubt that \xe2\x80\x9can idealized ordinary case of th[is] crime\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d?  How about attempted arson,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] attempted kidnapping,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] solicitation to commit aggravated assault,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] possession of a loaded weapon with the intent to use it unlawfully against another person,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>] possession of a weapon in prison,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>] or compelling a person to act as a prostitute?[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Is there much doubt that those offenses \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Transforming vagueness doctrine, the Court claims that we have never actually <i>held </i>that a statue may be voided for vagueness only when it is vague in all its applications.  But that is simply wrong.  In <i>Hoffman Estates</i>, we reversed a Seventh Circuit decision that voided an ordinance prohibiting the sale of certain items.  See 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 491.  The Seventh Circuit struck down the ordinance because it was \xe2\x80\x9cunclear in <i>some</i> of its applications,\xe2\x80\x9d but we reversed and emphasized that a law is void for vagueness \xe2\x80\x9conly if [it] is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 494\xe2\x80\x93495; see also <i>id.,</i> at 495, n.\xc2\xa07 (collecting cases).  Applying that principle, we held that the \xe2\x80\x9cfacial challenge [wa]s unavailing\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cat least some of the items sold .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [we]re covered\xe2\x80\x9d by the ordinance.  <i>Id.,</i> at 500.  These statements were not dicta.  They were the holding of the case.  Yet the Court does not even mention this binding precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, the Court says that the facts of two <i>earlier</i> cases support a broader application of the vagueness doctrine.  See <i>ante, </i>at 11.  That, too, is incorrect.  Neither case remotely suggested that mere overbreadth is enough for facial invalidation under the\n \nFifth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Coates</i> v. <i>Cincinnati</i>,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611,\n612 (1971)\n, we addressed an ordinance that restricted free assembly and association rights by prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cannoying\xe2\x80\x9d conduct.  Our analysis turned in large part on those\n \nFirst Amendment concerns.  In fact, we specifically explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cvice of the ordinance lies not alone in its violation of the due process standard of vagueness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 615.  In the present case, by contrast, no\n \nFirst Amendment rights are at issue.  Thus, <i>Coates</i> cannot support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of our repeated statements that \xe2\x80\x9cvagueness challenges to statutes which <i>do not involve\n \nFirst Amendment freedoms</i> must be examined in light of the facts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mazurie</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 550 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Likewise, <i>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</i>,\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n, proves precisely the opposite of what the Court claims.  In that case, we struck down a statute prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unjust or unreasonable rate[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because it provided no \xe2\x80\x9cascertain-able standard of guilt\xe2\x80\x9d and left open \xe2\x80\x9cthe widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 89.  The clear import of this language is that the law at issue was impermissibly vague in all applications.  And in the years since, we have never adopted the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contradictory interpretation.  On the contrary, we have characterized the case as involving a statute that could \xe2\x80\x9cnot constitutionally be applied to any set of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Powell</i>,\n\n423 U.\xc2\xa0S. 87,\n92 (1975)\n.  Thus, our holdings and our dicta prohibit the Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of the vagueness doctrine.  The Constitution does not allow us to hold a statute void for vagueness unless it is vague in all its applications.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because I would not strike down ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, it is necessary for me to address whether Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for possessing a sawed-off shotgun qualifies as a violent felony.  Under either the categorical approach or a conduct-specific inquiry, it does.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The categorical approach requires us to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 208.  This is an \xe2\x80\x9cinherently probabilistic\xe2\x80\x9d determination that considers the circumstances and conduct that ordinarily attend the offense.  <i>Id.,</i> at 207.  The mere fact that a crime <i>could</i> be committed without a risk of physical harm does not exclude it from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  See <i>id.,</i> at 207\xe2\x80\x93208.  Instead, the residual clause speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cpotential risk[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), a term suggesting \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress in-tended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a simple \xe2\x80\x98risk,\xe2\x80\x99 much less a certainty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 207\xe2\x80\x93208.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under these principles, unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun qualifies as a violent felony.<i> </i>As we recognized in <i>District of Columbia</i> v. <i>Heller</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570,\n625 (2008)\n, sawed-off shotguns are \xe2\x80\x9cnot typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, they are uniquely attractive to violent criminals.  Much easier to conceal than long-barreled shotguns used for hunting and other lawful purposes, short-barreled shotguns can be hidden under a coat, tucked into a bag, or stowed under a car seat.  And like a handgun, they can be fired with one hand\xe2\x80\x94except to more lethal effect.  These weapons thus combine the deadly characteristics of conventional shotguns with the more convenient handling of handguns.  Unlike those common firearms, however, they are not typically possessed for lawful purposes.  And when a person illegally possesses a sawed-off shotgun during the commission of a crime, the risk of violence is seriously increased. The ordinary case of unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun therefore \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7922(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of sawed-off shotguns confirms this judgment.  As the Government\xe2\x80\x99s initial brief colorfully recounts, sawed-off shotguns were a weapon of choice for gangsters and bank robbers during the Prohibition Era.  See Brief for United States 4.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  In response, Congress enacted the National Firearms Act of 1934, which required individuals possessing certain especially dangerous weapons\xe2\x80\x94including sawed-off shotguns\xe2\x80\x94to register with the Federal Government and pay a special tax.  26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75845(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  The Act was passed on the understanding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhile there is justification for permitting the citizen to keep a pistol or revolver for his own protection without any restriction, there is no reason why anyone except a law officer should have a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sawed-off shotgun.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No.\xc2\xa01780, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1934).  As amended, the Act imposes strict registration requirements for any individual wishing to possess a covered shotgun, see, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75822, 5841(b), and illegal possession of such a weapon is punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75861(b)\xe2\x80\x93(d), 5871.  It is telling that this penalty exceeds that prescribed by federal law for quintessential violent felonies.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  It thus seems perfectly clear that Congress has long regarded the illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun as a crime that poses a serious risk of harm to others.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority of States agree.  The Government informs the Court, and Johnson does not dispute, that 28 States have followed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 lead by making it a crime to possess an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, and 11 other States and the District of Columbia prohibit private possession of sawed-off shotguns entirely.  See Brief forUnited States 8\xe2\x80\x939 (collecting statutes).  Minnesota, where petitioner was convicted, has adopted a blanket ban, based on its judgment that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he sawed-off shotgun has no legitimate use in the society whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>State</i> v. <i>Ellenberger</i>, 543 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 673, 676 (Minn. App. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Possession of a sawed-off shotgun in Minnesota is thus an inherently criminal act.  It is fanciful to assume that a person who chooses to break the law and risk the heavy criminal penalty incurred by possessing a notoriously dangerous weapon is unlikely to use that weapon in violent ways.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">If we were to abandon the categorical approach, the facts of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s offense would satisfy the residual clause as well.  According to the record in this case, Johnson possessed his sawed-off shotgun while dealing drugs.  When police responded to reports of drug activity in a parking lot, they were told by two people that \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson and another individual had approached them and offered to sell drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  PSR \xc2\xb645.  The police then searched the vehicle where Johnson was seated as a passenger, and they found a sawed-off shotgun and five bags of mari-juana.  Johnson admitted that the gun was his.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Understood in this context, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s conduct posed an acute risk of physical injury to another.  Drugs and guns are never a safe combination.  If one of his drug deals had gone bad or if a rival dealer had arrived on the scene, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s deadly weapon was close at hand.  The sawed-off nature of the gun elevated the risk of collateral damage beyond any intended targets.  And the location of the crime\xe2\x80\x94a public parking lot\xe2\x80\x94significantly increased the chance that innocent bystanders might be caught up in the carnage.  This is not a case of \xe2\x80\x9cmere possession\xe2\x80\x9d as Johnson suggests.  Brief for Petitioner i.  He was not storing the gun in a safe, nor was it a family heirloom or collector\xe2\x80\x99s item.  He illegally possessed the weapon in case he needed to use it during another crime.  A judge or jury could thus conclude that Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s offense qualified as a violent felony.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There should be no doubt that Samuel Johnson was an armed career criminal.  His record includes a number of serious felonies.  And he has been caught with dangerous weapons on numerous occasions.  That this case has led to the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s demise is confounding.  I only hope that Congress can take the Court at its word that either amending the list of enumerated offenses or abandoning the categorical approach would solve the problem that the Court perceives.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court also says that the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the enumerated offenses is \xe2\x80\x9cconfusing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 12.  But this is another argument we rejected in <i>James </i>v.<i> United States</i>,<i> </i>\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192 (2007)\n, and <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<i> </i>\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2011)\n, and it is no more persuasive now.  Although the risk level varies among the enumerated offenses, all four categories of offenses involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of harm to others.  If the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern is that some of the enumerated offenses do not seem especially risky, all that means is that the statute \xe2\x80\x9csets a low baseline level for risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0This rule is simply an application of the broader rule that, except in\n \nFirst Amendment cases, we will hold that a statute is facially unconstitutional only if \xe2\x80\x9cno set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v.<i> Salerno</i>,\n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 739,\n745 (1987)\n.  A void-for-vagueness challenge is a facial challenge.  See <i>Hoffman Estates</i> v.<i> Flipside, Hoffman Estates, In</i>c.,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 489\n\xe2\x80\x93495, and nn. 5, 6, 7 (1982); <i>Chicago </i>v.<i> Morales</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41,\n79 (1999)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Consequently, there is no reason why the no-set-of-circumstances rule should not apply in this context.  I assume that the Court does not mean to abrogate the no-set-of-circumstances rule in its entirety, but the Court provides no justification for its refusal to apply that rule here.  Perhaps the Court has concluded, for some undisclosed reason, that void-for-vagueness claims are different from all other facial challenges not based on the\n \nFirst Amendment.
