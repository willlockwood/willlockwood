JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The federal anti-injunction statute provides that a federal court</p>\n<p>"may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>An Act of Congress, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, expressly authorizes a "suit in equity" to redress "the deprivation," under color of state law, "of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution. . . ." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The question before us is whether this "Act of Congress" comes within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute so as to permit a federal court in a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit to grant an injunction to stay a proceeding pending in a state court.  This question, which has divided the federal courts, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] has lurked in the background of many of our recent cases, but we have not until today explicitly decided it. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 407 U. S. 227</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The prosecuting attorney of Bay County, Florida, brought a proceeding in a Florida court to close down the appellant\'s bookstore as a public nuisance under the claimed authority of Florida law.  The state court entered a preliminary order prohibiting continued operation of the bookstore.  After further inconclusive proceedings in the state courts, the appellant filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, alleging that the actions of the state judicial and law enforcement officials were depriving him of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Relying upon 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] he asked for injunctive and declaratory relief against the state court proceedings on the ground that Florida laws were being unconstitutionally applied by the state court so as to cause him great and irreparable harm.  A single federal district judge issued temporary restraining orders, and a three-judge court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2281 and 2284.  After a hearing, the three-judge court dissolved the temporary restraining orders and refused to enjoin the state court proceeding, holding that the</p>\n<p>"injunctive relief sought here </p><p><a class="page-number" name="228">Page 407 U. S. 228</a></p><p> as to the proceedings pending in the Florida courts does not come under any of the exceptions set forth in Section 2283.  It is not expressly authorized by Act of Congress, it is not necessary in the aid of this court\'s jurisdiction, and it is not sought in order to protect or effectuate any judgment of this court."</p>\n<p>315 F.Supp. 1387, 1389.  An appeal was brought directly here under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and we noted probable jurisdiction.  402 U.S. 941.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In denying injunctive relief, the District Court relied on this Court\'s decision in <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/case.html">398 U. S. 281</a></span>.  The <em>Atlantic Coast Line</em> case did not deal with the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] but the Court\'s opinion in that case does bring into sharp focus the critical importance of the question now before us.  For, in that case, we expressly rejected the view that the anti-injunction statute merely states a flexible doctrine of comity, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and made clear that the statute imposes an absolute ban upon the issuance of a federal injunction against a pending </p><p><a class="page-number" name="229">Page 407 U. S. 229</a></p><p> state court proceeding, in the absence of one of the recognized exceptions:</p>\n<p>"On its face, the present Act is an absolute prohibition against enjoining state court proceedings unless the injunction falls within one of three specifically defined exceptions.  The respondents here have intimated that the Act only establishes a \'principle of comity,\' not a binding rule on the power of the federal courts.  The argument implies that, in certain circumstances, a federal court may enjoin state court proceedings even if that action cannot be justified by any of the three exceptions.  We cannot accept any such contention. . . .  [We] hold that any injunction against state court proceedings otherwise proper under general equitable principles must be based on one of the specific statutory exceptions to \xc2\xa7 2283 if it is to be upheld. . . ."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/case.html#286">398 U. S. 286</a></span>-287.</p>\n<p>It follows, in the present context, that, if 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 is not within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, then a federal equity court is wholly without power to grant any relief in a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit seeking to stay a state court proceeding.  In short, if a \xc2\xa7 1983 action is not an "expressly authorized" statutory exception, the anti-injunction law absolutely prohibits, in such an action, all federal equitable intervention in a pending state court proceeding, whether civil or criminal and regardless of how extraordinary the particular circumstances may be.</p>\n<p>Last Term, in <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>, and its companion cases, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the Court dealt at length with the subject of federal judicial intervention in pending </p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 407 U. S. 230</a></p><p> state criminal prosecutions.  In <em>Younger,</em> a three-judge federal district court in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action had enjoined a criminal prosecution pending in a California court.  In asking us to reverse that judgment, the appellant argued that the injunction was in violation of the federal anti-injunction statute.  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#40">401 U. S. 40</a></span>.  But the Court carefully eschewed any reliance on the statute in reversing the judgment, basing its decision instead upon what the Court called "Our Federalism" -- upon "the national policy forbidding federal courts to stay or enjoin pending state court proceedings except under special circumstances."  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#41">401 U. S. 41</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#44">401 U. S. 44</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Younger,</em> this Court emphatically reaffirmed "the fundamental policy against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions."  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">401 U. S. 46</span>.  It made clear that even "the possible unconstitutionality of a statute <em>on its face\' does not, in itself, justify an injunction against good faith attempts to enforce it."  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#54">401 U. S. 54</a></span>.  At the same time, however, the Court clearly left room for federal injunctive intervention in a pending state court prosecution in certain exceptional circumstances -- where irreparable injury is "both great and immediate," 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">401 U. S. 46</span>, where the state law is "`flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions,\'" 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#53">401 U. S. 53</a></span>, or where there is a showing of "bad faith, harassment, or . . . other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief."  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#54">401 U. S. 54</a></span>.  In the companion case of <em>Perez v. Ledesma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html">401 U. S. 82</a></span>, the Court said that\n</em></p>\n<p>"[o]nly in cases of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by state officials in bad faith without hope of obtaining a valid conviction and perhaps in other extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can be shown is federal injunctive relief against pending </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 407 U. S. 231</a></p><p> state prosecutions appropriate."</p>\n<p>401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html#85">401 U. S. 85</a></span>.  <em>See also Dyson v. Stein,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/200/case.html">401 U. S. 200</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/200/case.html#203">401 U. S. 203</a></span>.</p>\n<p>While the Court in <em>Younger</em> and its companion cases expressly disavowed deciding the question now before us -- whether \xc2\xa7 1983 comes within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/1/case.html#5">401 U. S. 5</a></span> it is evident that our decisions in those cases cannot be disregarded in deciding this question.  In the first place, if \xc2\xa7 1983 is not within the statutory exception, then the anti-injunction statute would have absolutely barred the injunction issued in <em>Younger,</em> as the appellant in that case argued, and there would have been no occasion whatever for the Court to decide that case upon the "policy" ground of "Our Federalism."  Secondly, if \xc2\xa7 1983 is not within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, then we must overrule <em>Younger</em> and its companion cases insofar as they recognized the permissibility of injunctive relief against pending criminal prosecutions in certain limited and exceptional circumstances.  For, under the doctrine of <em>Atlantic Coast Line,</em> the anti-injunction statute would, in a \xc2\xa7 1983 case, then be an "absolute prohibition" against federal equity intervention in a pending state criminal or civil proceeding -- under any circumstances whatever.</p>\n<p>The <em>Atlantic Coast Line</em> and <em>Younger</em> cases thus serve to delineate both the importance and the finality of the question now before us.  And it is in the shadow of those cases that the question must be decided.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The anti-injunction statute goes back almost to the beginnings of our history as a Nation.  In 1793, Congress enacted a law providing that no "writ of injunction be granted [by any federal court] to stay proceedings </p><p><a class="page-number" name="232">Page 407 U. S. 232</a></p><p> in any court of a state. . . ."  Act of March 2, 1793; 1 Stat. 335.  The precise origins of the legislation are shrouded in obscurity, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] but the consistent understanding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="233">Page 407 U. S. 233</a></p><p> has been that its basic purpose is to prevent "needless friction between state and federal courts."  <em>Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/4/case.html">309 U. S. 4</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/4/case.html#9">309 U. S. 9</a></span>.  The law remained unchanged until 1874, when it was amended to permit a federal court to stay state court proceedings that interfered with the administration of a federal bankruptcy proceeding. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The present wording of the legislation was adopted with the enactment of Title 28 of the United States Code in 1948.</p>\n<p>Despite the seemingly uncompromising language of the anti-injunction statute prior to 1948, the Court soon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="234">Page 407 U. S. 234</a></p><p> recognized that exceptions must be made to its blanket prohibition if the import and purpose of other Acts of Congress were to be given their intended scope.  So it was that, in addition to the bankruptcy law exception that Congress explicitly recognized in 1874, the Court through the years found that federal courts were empowered to enjoin state court proceedings, despite the anti-injunction statute, in carrying out the will of Congress under at least six other federal laws.  These covered a broad spectrum of congressional action:  (1) legislation providing for removal of litigation from state to federal courts, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>](2) legislation limiting the liability of shipowners, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] (3) legislation providing for federal interpleader actions, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] (4) legislation conferring federal jurisdiction over farm mortgages, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] (5) legislation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="235">Page 407 U. S. 235</a></p><p> governing federal habeas corpus proceedings, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and (6) legislation providing for control of prices. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to the exceptions to the anti-injunction statute found to be embodied in these various Acts of Congress, the Court recognized other "implied" exceptions to the blanket prohibition of the anti-injunction statute.  One was an "<em>in rem</em>" exception, allowing a federal court to enjoin a state court proceeding in order to protect its jurisdiction of a <em>res</em> over which it had first acquired jurisdiction. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Another was a "relitigation" exception, permitting a federal court to enjoin relitigation in a state court of issues already decided in federal litigation. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Still a third exception, more recently developed, permits a federal injunction of state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 407 U. S. 236</a></p><p> court proceedings when the plaintiff in the federal court is the United States itself, or a federal agency asserting "superior federal interests." [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/118/case.html">314 U. S. 118</a></span>, the Court in 1941 issued an opinion casting considerable doubt upon the approach to the anti-injunction statute reflected in its previous decisions.  The Court\'s opinion expressly disavowed the "relitigation" exception to the statute, and emphasized generally the importance of recognizing the statute\'s basic directive "of <em>hands off\' by the federal courts in the use of the injunction to stay litigation in a state court."  314 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/118/case.html#132">314 U. S. 132</a></span>.  The congressional response to <em>Toucey</em> was the enactment in 1948 of the anti-injunction statute in its present form in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, which, as the Reviser\'s Note makes evident, served not only to overrule the specific holding of <em>Toucey,</em> [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] but to restore "the basic law as generally understood and interpreted prior to the <em>Toucey</em> decision." [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>We proceed, then, upon the understanding that, in determining whether \xc2\xa7 1983 comes within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 407 U. S. 237</a></p><p> criteria to be applied are those reflected in the Court\'s decisions prior to <em>Toucey.</em> [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  A review of those decisions makes reasonably clear what the relevant criteria are.  In the first place, it is evident that, in order to qualify under the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, a federal law need not contain an express reference to that statute.  As the Court has said, "no prescribed formula is required; an authorization need not expressly refer to \xc2\xa7 2283."  <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/511/case.html">348 U. S. 511</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/511/case.html#516">348 U. S. 516</a></span>.  Indeed, none of the previously recognized statutory exceptions contains any such reference. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Secondly, a federal law need not expressly authorize an injunction of a state court proceeding in order to qualify as an exception.  Three of the six previously recognized statutory exceptions contain no such authorization. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Thirdly, it is clear that, in order to qualify as an "expressly authorized" exception to the anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress must have created a specific and uniquely federal right or remedy, enforceable in a federal court of equity, that could be frustrated if the federal court were not empowered to enjoin a state court proceeding.  This is not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 407 U. S. 238</a></p><p> to say that, in order to come within the exception, an Act of Congress must, on its face and in every one of its provisions, be totally incompatible with the prohibition of the anti-injunction statute. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The test, rather, is whether an Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity, could be given its intended scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding.  <em>See Toucey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/118/case.html#132">314 U.

Proponents of the legislation noted that state courts were being used to harass and injure individuals, either because the state courts were powerless to stop deprivations or were in league with those who were bent upon abrogation of federally protected rights.</p>\n<p>As Representative Lowe Stated, the</p>\n<p>"records of the [state] tribunals are searched in vain for evidence of effective redress [of federally secured rights]. . . .  What less than this [the Civil Rights Act of 1871] will afford an adequate remedy?  The Federal Government cannot serve a writ of mandamus upon State Executives or upon State courts to compel them to protect the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens. . . .  The case has arisen . . . when the Federal Government must resort to its own agencies to carry its own authority into execution.  Hence, this bill throws open the doors of the United States courts to those whose rights under the Constitution are denied or impaired."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 374-376 (1871).  This view was echoed by Senator Osborn:</p>\n<p>"If the State courts had proven themselves competent to suppress the local disorders, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 407 U. S. 241</a></p><p> or to maintain law and order, we should not have been called upon to legislate. . . .  We are driven by existing facts to provide for the several states in the South what they have been unable to fully provide for themselves, <em>i.e.,</em> the full and complete administration of justice in the courts.  And the courts with reference to which we legislate must be the United States courts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 653.  And Representative Perry concluded:</p>\n<p>"Sheriffs, having eyes to see, see not; judges, having ears to hear, hear not; witnesses conceal the truth or falsify it; grand and petit juries act as if they might be accomplices. . . .  [A]ll the apparatus and machinery of civil government, all the processes of justice, skulk away as if government and justice were crimes, and feared detection.  Among the most dangerous things an injured party can do is to appeal to justice."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at App. 78. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>Those who opposed the Act of 1871 clearly recognized that the proponents were extending federal power in an attempt to remedy the state courts\' failure to secure federal rights.  The debate was not about whether the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 1983 extended to actions of state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 407 U. S. 242</a></p><p> courts, but whether this innovation was necessary or desirable. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>This legislative history makes evident that Congress clearly conceived that it was altering the relationship between the States and the Nation with respect to the protection of federally created rights; it was concerned that state instrumentalities could not protect those rights; it realized that state officers might, in fact, be antipathetic to the vindication of those rights; and it believed that these failings extended to the state courts.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 1983 was thus a product of a vast transformation from the concepts of federalism that had prevailed in the late 18th century, when the anti-injunction statute was enacted.  The very purpose of \xc2\xa7 1983 was to interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people\'s federal rights -- to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law, "whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial."  <em>Ex parte Virginia,</em> 100 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/339/case.html#346">100 U. S. 346</a></span>.  In carrying out that purpose, Congress plainly authorized the federal courts to issue injunctions in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions by expressly authorizing a "suit in equity" as one of the means of redress.  And this Court long ago recognized that federal injunctive relief against a state court proceeding can, in some circumstances, be essential to prevent great, immediate, and irreparable loss of a person\'s constitutional rights.  <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U.

We know that, on December 31, 1790, Attorney General Edmund Randolph reported to the House of Representatives on desirable changes in the Judiciary Act of 1789.  Am.State Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 17, pp. 21-36.  The most serious question raised by Randolph concerned the arduousness of the circuit duties imposed on the Supreme Court justices.  But the Report also suggested a number of amendments dealing with procedural matters.  A section of the proposed bill submitted by him provided that \'no injunction in equity shall be granted by a district court to a judgment at law of a State court.\'  <em>Id.</em> p. 26.  Randolph explained that this clause"</p>\n<p>"will debar the district court from interfering with the judgments at law in the State courts; for if the plaintiff and defendant rely upon the State courts, as far as the judgment, they ought to continue there as they have begun.  It is enough to split the same suit into one at law, and another in equity, without adding a further separation, by throwing the common law side of the question into the State courts, and the equity side into the federal courts."</p>\n<p>"<em>Id.</em> p. 34.  The Report was considered by the House sitting as a Committee of the Whole, and then was referred to successive special committees for further consideration.  No action was taken until after Chief Justice Jay and his associates wrote the President that their circuit-riding duties were too burdensome.  American State Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 32, p. 51.  In response to this complaint, which was transmitted to Congress, the Act of March 2, 1793, was passed, containing, in \xc2\xa7 5, <em>inter alia,</em> the prohibition against staying state court proceedings."</p>\n<p>"Charles Warren, in his article Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345, 347, suggests that this provision was the direct consequence of Randolph\'s report.  This seems doubtful in view of the very narrow purpose of Randolph\'s proposal, namely, that federal courts of equity should not interfere with the enforcement of judgments at law rendered in the state courts.  <em>See</em> Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L.J. 1169, 1171, n. 14."</p>\n<p>"There is no record of any debates over the statute.  <em>See</em> 3 Annals of Congress (1791-93).  It has been suggested that the provision reflected the then strong feeling against the unwarranted intrusion of federal courts upon state sovereignty.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/2/419/case.html">Chisholm v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 2 Dall. 419, was decided on February 18, 1793, less than two weeks before the provision was enacted into law.  The significance of this proximity is doubtful.  <em>Compare</em> Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345, 347-348, <em>with Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/200/273/case.html">200 U. S. 273</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/200/273/case.html#291">200 U. S. 291</a></span>-292.  Much more probable is the suggestion that the provision reflected the prevailing prejudices against equity jurisdiction.  The Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.), chronicling the proceedings of the Senate while he was one of its members (1789-1791), contains abundant evidence of a widespread hostility to chancery practice.  <em>See especially</em> pp. 92-94, 101-06 (debate on the bill that became Judiciary Act of 1789).  Moreover, Senator Ellsworth (soon to become Chief Justice of the United States), the principal draftsman of both the 1789 and 1793 Judiciary Acts, often indicated a dislike for equity jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> Brown, Life of Oliver Ellsworth (1905 ed.) 194; Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.) 103-04; Warren, New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv.L.Rev. 49, 96-100."</p>\n<p><em>Toucey v.

The Court holds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 407 U. S. 244</a></p><p> only that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, which is an absolute bar to injunctions against state court proceedings in most suits, does not apply to a suit brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 seeking an injunction of state proceedings.  But, as the Court\'s opinion has noted, it does nothing to</p>\n<p>"question or qualify in any way the principles of equity, comity, and federalism that must restrain a federal court when asked to enjoin a state court proceeding."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#243">407 U. S. 243</a></span>.  In the context of pending state criminal proceedings, we held in <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971), that these principles allow a federal court properly to issue an injunction in only a narrow class of circumstances.  We have not yet reached or decided exactly how great a restraint is imposed by these principles on a federal court asked to enjoin state civil proceedings.  Therefore, on remand in this case, it seems to me the District Court, before reaching a decision on the merits of appellant\'s claim, should properly consider whether general notions of equity or principles of federalism, similar to those invoked in <em>Younger,</em> prevent the issuance of an injunction against the state "nuisance abatement" proceedings in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
