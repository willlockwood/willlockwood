At the sentencing hearing, the judge found additional facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  Because these findings mandated a sentence between 360 months and life, the judge gave Booker a 30-year sentence instead of the 21-year, 10-month, sentence he could have imposed based on the facts proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Seventh Circuit held that this application of the Guidelines conflicted with the <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>, 490, holding that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Relying on <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> 542 U. S. ___, the court<em> </em>held that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment and instructed the District Court either to sentence Booker within the sentencing range supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings or to hold a separate sentencing hearing before a jury.  In respondent Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s case, the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict under the Guidelines was 78 months in prison.  At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge found by a preponderance of the evidence additional facts authorizing a sentence in the 188-to-235-month range, which would have required him to impose a 15- or 16-year sentence instead of the 5 or 6 years authorized by the jury verdict alone.  Relying on <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion, statements in its dissenting opinions, and the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s brief in <em>Blakely, </em>the judge concluded that he could not follow the Guidelines and imposed a sentence based solely upon the guilty verdict in the case.  The Government filed a notice of appeal in the First Circuit and a petition for certiorari before judgment in this Court.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 04\xe2\x80\x93104 is affirmed, and the case is remanded.

Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In addressing Washington State\xe2\x80\x99s determinate sentencing scheme, the<em> Blakely</em> Court found that <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/227/index.html">526 U. S. 227</a>; <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>; and <em>Ring</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/584/index.html">536 U. S. 584</a>, made clear \xe2\x80\x9cthat the \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi</em> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d 542 U. S., at ___.  As <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinions recognized, there is no constitutionally significant distinction between the Guidelines and the Washington procedure at issue in that case.  This conclusion rests on the premise, common to both systems, that the relevant sentencing rules are mandatory and impose binding requirements on all sentencing judges.  Were the Guidelines merely advisory\xe2\x80\x94recommending, but not requiring, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts\xe2\x80\x94their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.  However, that is not the case.  Title 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b) directs that a court \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range\xe2\x80\x9d established by the Guidelines, subject to departures in specific, limited cases.  Because they are binding on all on judges, this Court has consistently held that the Guidelines have the force and effect of laws.  Further, the availability of a departure where the judge \xe2\x80\x9cfinds \xe2\x80\xa6 an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), does not avoid the constitutional issue.  Departures are unavailable in most cases because the Commission will have adequately taken all relevant factors into account, and no departure will be legally permissible.  In those instances, the judge is legally bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range.  Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case illustrates this point.  The jury found him guilty of possessing at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, based on evidence that he had 92.5 grams.  Under those facts, the Guidelines required a possible 210-to-262-month sentence.  To reach Booker\xe2\x80\x99s actual sentence\xe2\x80\x94which was almost 10 years longer\xe2\x80\x94the judge found that he possessed an additional 566 grams of crack.  Although, the jury never heard any such evidence, the judge found it to be true by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thus, as in <em>Blakely,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.  The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at ___.  Finally, because there were no factors the Sentencing Commission failed to adequately consider, the judge was required to impose a sentence within the higher Guidelines range.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments for its position that <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning should not be applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are unpersuasive.  The fact that the Guidelines are promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, rather than Congress, is constitutionally irrelevant.  The Court has not previously considered the question, but the same Sixth Amendment principles apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Further, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-<em>Apprendi</em> cases considering the Guidelines are inapplicable, as they did not consider the application of <em>Apprendi</em> to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Finally, separation of powers concerns are not present here, and were rejected in <em>Mistretta</em>.  In <em>Mistretta </em>the Court concluded that even though the Commission performed political rather than adjudicatory functions, Congress did not exceed constitutional limitations in creating the Commission.  488 U. S., at 393, 388.  That conclusion remains true regardless of whether the facts relevant to sentencing are labeled \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factors\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of crimes.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court in part, concluding that 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), which makes the Federal Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, is incompatible with today\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cjury trial\xe2\x80\x9d holding and therefore must be severed and excised from the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act).  Section 3742(e), which depends upon the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 mandatory nature, also must be severed and excised.  So modified, the Act makes the Guidelines effectively advisory, requiring a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see \xc2\xa73553(a)(4), but permitting it to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns, see \xc2\xa73553(a).  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Answering the remedial question requires a determination of what \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would have intended\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding.  <em>E.g., Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/727/index.html">518 U. S. 727</a>, 767.  Here, the Court must decide which of two approaches is the more compatible with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent as embodied in the Act: (1) retaining the Act (and the Guidelines) as written, with today\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment requirement engrafted onto it; or (2) eliminating some of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  Evaluation of the constitutional requirement\xe2\x80\x99s consequences in light of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language, history, and basic purposes demonstrates that the requirement is not compatible with the Act as written and that some severance (and excision) is necessary.  Congress would likely have preferred the total invalidation of the Act to an Act with the constitutional requirement engrafted onto it, but would likely have preferred the excision of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory language to the invalidation of the entire Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x936. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Several considerations demonstrate that adding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement onto the Act as currently written would so transform the statutory scheme that Congress likely would not have intended the Act as so modified to stand.  First, references to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73553(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94which  requires \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court\xe2\x80\x9d when sentencing to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and references to \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s history must be read in context to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge without the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge working together with the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is made clear by \xc2\xa73661, which removes typical \xe2\x80\x9cjury trial\xe2\x80\x9d limitations on \xe2\x80\x9cthe information\xe2\x80\x9d concerning the offender that the sentencing \xe2\x80\x9ccourt \xe2\x80\xa6 may receive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic statutory goal of diminishing sentencing disparity depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the <em>real conduct</em> underlying the crime of conviction.  In looking to real conduct, federal sentencing judges have long relied upon a probation officer\xe2\x80\x99s presentence report, which is often unavailable until <em>after</em> the trial.  To engraft the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement onto the Act would destroy the system by preventing a sentencing judge from relying upon a presentence report for relevant factual information uncovered after the trial.  Third, the Act, read to include today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement, would create a system far more complex than Congress could have intended, thereby greatly complicating the tasks of the prosecution, defense, judge, and jury.  Fourth, plea bargaining would not significantly diminish the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding for the operation of the Guidelines, but would make matters worse, leading to sentences that gave greater weight not to real conduct, but rather to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s skill, the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s policies, the caseload, and other factors that vary from place to place, defendant to defendant, and crime to crime.  Fifth, Congress would not have enacted sentencing statutes that make it more difficult to adjust sentences <em>upward </em>than to adjust them <em>downward, </em>yet that is what the engrafted system would create.  For all these reasons, the Act cannot remain valid in its entirety.  Severance and excision are necessary.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The entire Act need not be invalidated, since most of it is perfectly valid.  In order not to \xe2\x80\x9cinvalidat[e] more of the statute than is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Time, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/641/index.html">468 U. S. 641</a>, 652, the Court must retain those portions of the Act that are (1) constitutionally valid, <em>ibid.</em>, (2) capable of \xe2\x80\x9cfunctioning independently,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684, and (3) consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic objectives in enacting the statute, <em>Regan, supra</em>, at 653.  Application of these criteria demonstrates that only \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), which requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range (absent circumstances justifying a departure), and \xc2\xa73742(e), which provides for <em>de novo</em> review on appeal of departures, must be severed and excised.  With these two sections severed (and statutory cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated), the rest of the Act satisfies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement and falls outside the scope of <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>.  The Act still requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals, see \xc2\xa73553(a)(4); to consider the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9csentencing range established for \xe2\x80\xa6 the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and to restitute victims, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(1), (3)\xe2\x80\x93(7); and to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and effectively provide the defendant with needed training and medical care, \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).  Moreover, despite \xc2\xa73553(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s absence, the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range).  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73742(a) and (b).  Excision of \xc2\xa73742(e), which sets forth appellate review standards, does not pose a critical problem.  Appropriate review standards may be inferred from related statutory language, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure, and the \xe2\x80\x9csound administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/552/index.html">487 U. S. 552</a>, 559\xe2\x80\x93560.  Here, these factors and the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures from the Guidelines imply a familiar and practical standard of review: review for \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable[ness].\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).  Finally, the Act without its mandatory provision and related language remains consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted sentencing disparities \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] maintai[n] sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(b)(1)(B), in that the Sentencing Commission remains in place to perform its statutory duties, see \xc2\xa7994, the district courts must consult the Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a)(4), and the courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.  Thus, it is more consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent (1) to preserve the Act\xe2\x80\x99s important pre-existing elements while severing and excising \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(b) and 3742(e) than (2) to maintain all of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions and engraft today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement onto the statutory scheme.  Pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0 Other possible remedies\xe2\x80\x94including, <em>e.g.,</em> the parties\xe2\x80\x99 proposals that the Guidelines remain binding in cases other than those in which the Constitution prohibits judicial factfinding and that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions requiring such factfinding at sentencing be excised\xe2\x80\x94are rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0On remand in respondent Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court should impose a sentence in accordance with today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, and, if the sentence comes before the Seventh Circuit for review, that court should apply the review standards set forth in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial opinion.  In respondent Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Government (and Fanfan should he so choose) may seek resentencing under the system set forth in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions.  As these dispositions indicate, today\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment holding and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act must be applied to all cases on direct review.  See, <em>e.g., Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>, 328.  That does not mean that every sentence will give rise to a Sixth Amendment violation or that every appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing.  That is \nbecause reviewing courts are expected to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, <em>e.g.,</em> whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the \xe2\x80\x9cplain-error\xe2\x80\x9d test.  It is also because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a \nsentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine.

We must decide whether or to what extent, \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of severability analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable \xe2\x80\xa6 such that the sentencing court must exercise its discretion to sentence the defendant within the maximum and minimum set by statute for the offense of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x93104, p.\xc2\xa0I.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We answer the question of remedy by finding the provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), incompatible with today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding.  We conclude that this provision must be severed and excised, as must one other statutory section, \xc2\xa73742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004), which depends upon the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 mandatory nature.  So modified, the Federal Sentencing Act, see Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73551 <em>et seq.,</em> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991 <em>et seq</em>., makes the Guidelines effectively advisory.  It requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(a)(4) (Supp. 2004), but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see \xc2\xa73553(a) (Supp. 2004).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We answer the remedial question by looking to legislative intent.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/172/index.html">526 U. S. 172</a>, 191 (1999); <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684 (1987); <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Time, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/641/index.html">468 U. S. 641</a>, 653 (1984) (plurality opinion).  We seek to determine what \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would have intended\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding.  <em>Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/727/index.html">518 U. S. 727</a>, 767 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cWould Congress still have passed\xe2\x80\x9d the valid sections \xe2\x80\x9chad it known\xe2\x80\x9d about the constitutional invalidity of the other portions of the statute? (internal quotation marks omitted)).  In this instance, we must determine which of the two following remedial approaches is the more compatible with the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent as embodied in the 1984 Sentencing Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One approach, that of Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 dissent, would retain the Sentencing Act (and the Guidelines) as written, but would engraft onto the existing system today\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cjury trial\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  The addition would change the Guidelines by preventing the sentencing court from increasing a sentence on the basis of a fact that the jury did not find (or that the offender did not admit).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The other approach, which we now adopt, would (through severance and excision of two provisions) make the Guidelines system advisory while maintaining a strong connection between the sentence imposed and the offender\xe2\x80\x99s real conduct\xe2\x80\x94a connection important to the increased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its Guidelines system to achieve.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both approaches would significantly alter the system that Congress designed.  But today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding means that it is no longer possible to maintain the judicial factfinding that Congress thought would underpin the mandatory Guidelines system that it sought to create and that Congress wrote into the Act in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a) and 3661 (main ed. and Supp. 2004).  Hence we must decide whether we would deviate less radically from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intended system (1) by superimposing the constitutional requirement announced today or (2) through elimination of some provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To say this is not to create a new kind of severability analysis.  <em>Post</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Rather, it is to recognize that sometimes severability questions (questions as to how, or whether, Congress would intend a statute to apply) can arise when a legislatively unforeseen constitutional problem requires modification of a statutory provision as applied in a significant number of instances.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/333/index.html">398 U. S. 333</a>, 361 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (explaining that when a statute is defective because of its failure to extend to some group a constitutionally required benefit, the court may \xe2\x80\x9ceither declare it a nullity\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d the benefit \xe2\x80\x9cto include those who are aggrieved by exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Mathews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/index.html">465 U.

L.\xc2\xa0J. 1945, 1950, n.\xc2\xa026 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In today\xe2\x80\x99s context\xe2\x80\x94a highly complex statute, interrelated provisions, and a constitutional requirement that creates fundamental change\xe2\x80\x94we cannot assume that Congress, if faced with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity in key applications, would have preferred to apply the statute in as many other instances as possible.  Neither can we determine likely congressional intent mechanically.  We cannot simply approach the problem grammatically, say, by looking to see whether the constitutional requirement and the words of the Act are linguistically compatible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do simple numbers provide an answer.  It is, of course, true that the numbers show that the constitutional jury trial requirement would lead to additional decisionmaking by juries in only a minority of cases.  See <em>post,</em> at 7 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Prosecutors and defense attorneys would still resolve the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of criminal matters through plea bargaining, and plea bargaining takes place without a jury.  See <em>ibid</em>.  Many of the rest involve only simple issues calling for no upward Guidelines adjustment.  See <em>post</em>, at 5.  And in at least some of the remainder, a judge may find adequate room to adjust a sentence within the single Guidelines range to which the jury verdict points, or within the overlap between that range and the next highest.  See <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the constitutional jury trial requirement would nonetheless affect every case.  It would affect decisions about whether to go to trial.  It would affect the content of plea negotiations.  It would alter the judge\xe2\x80\x99s role in sentencing.  Thus we must determine likely intent not by counting proceedings, but by evaluating the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement in light of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language, its history, and its basic purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While reasonable minds can, and do, differ about the outcome, we conclude that the constitutional jury trial requirement is not compatible with the Act as written and that some severance and excision are necessary.  In Part II, <em>infra</em>, we explain the incompatibility.  In Part III, <em>infra,</em> we describe the necessary excision.  In Part IV, <em>infra</em>, we explain why we have rejected other possibilities.  In essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why Congress would likely have preferred the total invalidation of the Act to an Act with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2) why Congress would likely have preferred the excision of some of the Act, namely the Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory language, to the invalidation of the entire Act.  That is to say, in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, we compare maintaining the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 proposed remedy) to the total invalidation of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have preferred the latter.  We then compare our own remedy to the total invalidation of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have preferred our remedy.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several considerations convince us that, were the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement added onto the Sentencing Act as currently written, the requirement would so transform the scheme that Congress created that Congress likely would not have intended the Act as so modified to stand.  First, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court\xe2\x80\x9d when sentencing will consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(a)(1) (main ed. and Supp. 2004).  In context, the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x9d mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge without the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge working together with the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  A further statutory provision, by removing typical \xe2\x80\x9cjury trial\xe2\x80\x9d evidentiary limitations, makes this clear.  See \xc2\xa73661 (ruling out any \xe2\x80\x9climitation \xe2\x80\xa6 on the information concerning the [offender\xe2\x80\x99s] background, character, and conduct\xe2\x80\x9d that the \xe2\x80\x9ccourt \xe2\x80\xa6 may receive\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s history confirms it.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p.\xc2\xa051 (1983) (the Guidelines system \xe2\x80\x9cwill guide <em>the judge</em> in making\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing decisions) (emphasis added); <em>id</em>., at 52 (before sentencing, \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge\xe2\x80\x9d must consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 53 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe judge\xe2\x80\x9d must conduct \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive examination of the characteristics of the particular offense and the particular offender\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This provision is tied to the provision of the Act that makes the Guidelines mandatory, see \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004).  They are part and parcel of a single, unified whole\xe2\x80\x94a whole that Congress intended to apply to all federal sentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This provision makes it difficult to justify Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 approach, for that approach requires reading the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x9d as if they meant \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge working together with the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike Justice Stevens, we do not believe we can interpret the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language to save its constitutionality, see <em>post</em>, at 16 (Stevens, J., dissenting), because we believe that any such reinterpretation, even if limited to instances in which a Sixth Amendment problem arises, would be \xe2\x80\x9cplainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>X\xe2\x80\x93Citement Video</em>,<em> Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/64/index.html">513 U. S. 64</a>, 78 (1994).  Without some such reinterpretation, however, this provision of the statute, along with those inextricably connected to it, are constitutionally invalid, and fall outside of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to enact.  Nor can we agree with Justice Stevens that a newly passed \xe2\x80\x9cidentical statute\xe2\x80\x9d would be valid, <em>post,</em> at 13 (dissenting opinion).  Such a new, identically worded statute would be valid only if (unlike the present statute) we could interpret that new statute (without disregarding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic intent) as being consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jury factfinding requirement.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  If so, the statute would stand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic statutory goal\xe2\x80\x94a system that diminishes sentencing disparity\xe2\x80\x94depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the <em>real conduct</em> that underlies the crime of conviction.  That determination is particularly important in the federal system where crimes defined as, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cobstruct[ing], delay[ing], or affect[ing] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by \xe2\x80\xa6 extortion,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a), or, say, using the mail \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of executing\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71341 (2000 ed., Supp. II), can encompass a vast range of very different kinds of underlying conduct.  But it is also important even in respect to ordinary crimes, such as robbery, where an act that meets the statutory definition can be committed in a host of different ways.  Judges have long looked to real conduct when sentencing.  Federal judges have long relied upon a presentence report, prepared by a probation officer, for information (often\nunavailable until <em>after</em> the trial) relevant to the manner\nin which the convicted offender committed the crime of conviction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress expected this system to continue.  That is why it specifically inserted into the Act the provision cited above, which (recodifying prior law) says that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73661.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier opinions assumed that this system would continue.  That is why the Court, for example, held in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Watts, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/519/148/index.html">519 U. S. 148</a> (1997) (<em>per curiam</em>)<em>,</em> that a sentencing judge could rely for sentencing purposes upon a fact that a jury had found <em>unproved </em>(beyond a reasonable doubt).  See <em>id.,</em> at 157; see also <em>id</em>., at 152\xe2\x80\x93153 (quoting United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa71B1.3, comment., backg\xe2\x80\x99d (Nov. 1995) (USSG), which \xe2\x80\x9cdescribes in sweeping language the conduct that a sentencing court may consider in determining the applicable guideline range,\xe2\x80\x9d and which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[c]onduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sentencing Guidelines also assume that Congress intended this system to continue.  See USSG \xc2\xa71B1.3, comment., backg\xe2\x80\x99d (Nov. 2003).  That is why, among other things, they permit a judge to reject a plea-bargained sentence if he determines, after reviewing the presentence report, that the sentence does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actual conduct.  See \xc2\xa76B1.2(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To engraft the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement onto the sentencing statutes, however, would destroy the system.  It would prevent a judge from relying upon a presentence report for factual information, relevant to sentencing, uncovered after the trial.  In doing so, it would, even compared to pre-Guidelines sentencing, weaken the tie between a sentence and an offender\xe2\x80\x99s real conduct.  It would thereby undermine the sentencing statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic aim of ensuring similar sentences for those who have committed similar crimes in similar ways.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several examples help illustrate the point.  Imagine Smith and Jones, each of whom violates the Hobbs Act in very different ways.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a) (forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cobstruct[ing], delay[ing], or affect[ing] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by \xe2\x80\xa6 extortion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Smith threatens to injure a co-worker unless the co-worker advances him a few dollars from the interstate company\xe2\x80\x99s till; Jones, after similarly threatening the co-worker, causes far more harm by seeking far more money, by making certain that the co-worker\xe2\x80\x99s family is aware of the threat, by arranging for deliveries of dead animals to the co-worker\xe2\x80\x99s home to show he is serious, and so forth.  The offenders\xe2\x80\x99 behavior is very different; the known harmful consequences of their actions are different; their punishments both before, and after, the Guidelines would have been different.  But, under the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 approach, unless prosecutors decide to charge more than the elements of the crime, the judge would have to impose similar punishments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now imagine two former felons, Johnson and Jackson, each of whom engages in identical criminal behavior: threatening a bank teller with a gun, securing $50,000, and injuring an innocent bystander while fleeing the bank.  Suppose prosecutors charge Johnson with one crime (say, illegal gun possession, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)) and Jackson with another (say, bank robbery, see \xc2\xa72113(a)).  Before the Guidelines, a single judge faced with such similar real conduct would have been able (within statutory limits) to impose similar sentences upon the two similar offenders despite the different charges brought against them.  The Guidelines themselves would ordinarily have required judges to sentence the two offenders similarly.  But under the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 system, in these circumstances the offenders likely would receive different punishments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider, too, a complex mail fraud conspiracy where a prosecutor may well be uncertain of the amount of harm and of the role each indicted individual played until after conviction\xe2\x80\x94when the offenders may turn over financial records, when it becomes easier to determine who were the leaders and who the followers, when victim interviews are seen to be worth the time.  In such a case the relation between the sentence and what actually occurred is likely to be considerably more distant under a system with a jury trial requirement patched onto it than it was even prior to the Sentencing Act, when judges routinely used information obtained after the verdict to decide upon a proper sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This point is critically important.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic goal in passing the Sentencing Act was to move the sentencing system in the direction of increased uniformity.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(b)(1)(B); see also \xc2\xa7994(f).  That uniformity does not consist simply of similar sentences for those convicted of violations of the same statute\xe2\x80\x94a uniformity consistent with the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 remedial approach.  It consists, more importantly, of similar relationships between sentences and real conduct, relationships that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing statutes helped to advance and that Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 approach would undermine.  Compare<em> post</em>, at 18 (dissenting opinion) (conceding that the Sixth Amendment requirement would \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly affect \xe2\x80\x98real conduct\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing in certain cases,\xe2\x80\x9d but minimizing the significance of that circumstance).  In significant part, it is the weakening of this real-conduct/uniformity-in-sentencing relationship, and not any \xe2\x80\x9cinexplicabl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d concerns for the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>manner</em> of achieving uniform sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2 (Scalia, J., dissenting), that leads us to conclude that Congress would have preferred <em>no</em> mandatory system to the system the dissenters envisage.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the sentencing statutes, read to include the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment requirement, would create a system far more complex than Congress could have intended.  How would courts and counsel work with an indictment and a jury trial that involved not just whether a defendant robbed a bank but also how?  Would the indictment have to allege, in addition to the elements of robbery, whether the defendant possessed a firearm, whether he brandished or discharged it, whether he threatened death, whether he caused bodily injury, whether any such injury was ordinary, serious, permanent or life threatening, whether he abducted or physically restrained anyone, whether any victim was unusually vulnerable, how much money was taken, and whether he was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in a robbery gang?  See USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72B3.1, 3B1.1.  If so, how could a defendant mount a defense against some or all such specific claims should he also try simultaneously to maintain that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence failed to place him at the scene of the crime?  Would the indictment in a mail fraud case have to allege the number of victims, their vulnerability, and the amount taken from each?  How could a judge expect a jury to work with the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 definitions of, say, \xe2\x80\x9crelevant conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes \xe2\x80\x9call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and [in the case of a conspiracy] all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\xe2\x80\x9d?  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.3(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B).  How would a jury measure \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d in a securities fraud case\xe2\x80\x94a matter so complex as to lead the Commission to instruct judges to make \xe2\x80\x9conly \xe2\x80\xa6 a reasonable estimate\xe2\x80\x9d?  \xc2\xa72B1.1, comment., n.\xc2\xa03(C).  How would the court take account, for punishment purposes, of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contemptuous behavior at trial\xe2\x80\x94a matter that the Government could not have charged in the indictment?  \xc2\xa73C1.1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, plea bargaining would not significantly diminish the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding for the operation of the Guidelines.  Compare <em>post,</em> at 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Rather, plea bargaining would make matters worse.  Congress enacted the sentencing statutes in major part to achieve greater uniformity in sentencing, <em>i.e.</em>, to increase the likelihood that offenders who engage in similar real conduct would receive similar sentences.  The statutes reasonably assume that their efforts to move the trial-based sentencing process in the direction of greater sentencing uniformity would have a similar positive impact upon plea-bargained sentences, for plea bargaining takes place <em>in the shadow of</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, with an eye towards the hypothetical result of) a potential trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That, too, is why Congress, understanding the realities of plea bargaining, authorized the Commission to promulgate policy statements that would assist sentencing judges in determining whether to reject a plea agreement after reading about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s real conduct in a presentence report (and giving the offender an opportunity to challenge the report).  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(a)(2)(E); USSG \xc2\xa76B1.2(a).  This system has not worked perfectly; judges have often simply accepted an agreed-upon account of the conduct at issue.  But compared to pre-existing law, the statutes try to move the system in the right direction, <em>i.e.</em>, toward greater sentencing uniformity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional jury trial requirement, however, if patched onto the present Sentencing Act, would move the system backwards in respect both to tried and to plea-bargained cases.  In respect to tried cases, it would effectively deprive the judge of the ability to use post-verdict-acquired real-conduct information; it would prohibit the judge from basing a sentence upon any conduct other than the conduct the prosecutor chose to charge; and it would put a defendant to a set of difficult strategic choices as to which prosecutorial claims he would contest.  The sentence that would emerge in a case tried under such a system would likely reflect real conduct less completely, less accurately, and less often than did a pre-Guidelines, as well as a Guidelines, trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because plea bargaining inevitably reflects estimates of what would happen at trial, plea bargaining too under such a system would move in the wrong direction.  That is to say, in a sentencing system modified by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement, plea bargaining would likely lead to sentences that gave greater weight, not to real conduct, but rather to the skill of counsel, the policies of the prosecutor, the caseload, and other factors that vary from place to place, defendant to defendant, and crime to crime.  Compared to pre-Guidelines plea bargaining, plea bargaining of this kind would necessarily move federal sentencing in the direction of diminished, not increased, uniformity in sentencing.  Compare <em>supra, </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938 with <em>post, </em>at 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It would tend to defeat, not to further, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic statutory goal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a system would have particularly troubling consequences with respect to prosecutorial power.  Until now, sentencing factors have come before the judge in the presentence report.  But in a sentencing system with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement engrafted onto it, any factor that a prosecutor chose not to charge at the plea negotiation would be placed beyond the reach of the judge entirely.  Prosecutors would thus exercise a power the Sentencing Act vested in judges: the power to decide, based on relevant information about the offense and the offender, which defendants merit heavier punishment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respondent Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case, for example, the jury heard evidence that the crime had involved 92.5 grams of crack cocaine, and convicted Booker of possessing more than 50 grams.  But the judge, at sentencing, found that the crime had involved an additional 566 grams, for a total of 658.5 grams.  A system that would require the jury, not the judge, to make the additional \xe2\x80\x9c566 grams\xe2\x80\x9d finding is a system in which the prosecutor, not the judge, would control the sentence.  That is because it is the prosecutor who would have to decide what drug amount to charge.  He could choose to charge 658.5 grams, or 92.5, or less.  It is the prosecutor who, through such a charging decision, would control the sentencing range.  And it is different prosecutors who, in different cases\xe2\x80\x94say, in two cases involving 566 grams\xe2\x80\x94would potentially insist upon different punishments for similar defendants who engaged in similar criminal conduct involving similar amounts of unlawful drugs\xe2\x80\x94say, by charging one of them with the full 566 grams, and the other with 10.  As long as different prosecutors react differently, a system with a patched-on jury factfinding requirement would mean different sentences for otherwise similar conduct, whether in the context of trials or that of plea bargaining.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, Congress would not have enacted sentencing statutes that make it more difficult to adjust sentences <em>upward </em>than to adjust them <em>downward</em>.  As several United States Senators have written in an <em>amicus </em>brief, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Congress that enacted the 1984 Act did not conceive of\xe2\x80\x94much less establish\xe2\x80\x94a sentencing guidelines system in which sentencing judges were free to consider facts or circumstances not found by a jury or admitted in a plea agreement for the purpose of adjusting a base-offense level <em>down</em>, but not <em>up,</em> within the applicable guidelines range.  Such a one-way lever would be grossly at odds with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Senator Orrin G. Hatch et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 22.  Yet that is the system that the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 remedy would create.  Compare <em>post,</em> at 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (conceding asymmetry but stating belief that this \xe2\x80\x9cis unlikely to have more than a minimal effect\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, Congress, had it been faced with the constitutional jury trial requirement, likely would not have passed the same Sentencing Act.  It likely would have found the requirement incompatible with the Act as written.  Hence the Act cannot remain valid in its entirety.  Severance and excision are necessary.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now turn to the question of <em>which </em>portions of the sentencing statute we must sever and excise as inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement.  Although, as we have explained, see Part II, <em>supra, </em>we believe that Congress would have preferred the total invalidation of the statute to the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 remedial approach, we nevertheless do not believe that the entire statute must be invalidated.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 22 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Most of the statute is perfectly valid.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73551 (main ed. and Supp. 2004) (describing authorized sentences as probation, fine, or imprisonment); \xc2\xa73552 (presentence reports); \xc2\xa73554 (forfeiture); \xc2\xa73555 (notification to the victims); \xc2\xa73583 (supervised release).  And we must \xe2\x80\x9crefrain from invalidating more of the statute than is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Regan,</em> 468 U. S., at 652.  Indeed, we must retain those portions of the Act that are (1) constitutionally valid, <em>id.</em>, at 652\xe2\x80\x93653, (2) capable of \xe2\x80\x9cfunctioning independently,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alaska Airlines</em>,<em> </em>480 U. S., at 684, and (3) consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic objectives in enacting the statute, <em>Regan, supra</em>, at 653.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of these criteria indicates that we must sever and excise two specific statutory provisions: the provision that requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range (in the absence of circumstances that justify a departure), see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), and the provision that sets forth standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo</em> review of departures from the applicable Guidelines range, see \xc2\xa73742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004) (see Appendix, <em>infra,</em> for text of both provisions).  With these two sections excised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated), the remainder of the Act satisfies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court today recognizes in its first opinion in these cases, the existence of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) is a necessary condition of the constitutional violation.  That is to say, without this provision\xe2\x80\x94namely the provision that makes \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant sentencing rules \xe2\x80\xa6 mandatory and impose[s] binding requirements on all sentencing judges\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the statute falls outside the scope of <em>Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99</em>s requirement.  <em>Ante,</em> at 10 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court); see also<em> ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]veryone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [Sentencing Reform Act] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x938 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remainder of the Act \xe2\x80\x9cfunction[s] independently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alaska Airlines, supra</em>, at 684.  Without the \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(a) (Supp. 2004).  The Act nonetheless requires judges to consider the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9csentencing range established for \xe2\x80\xa6 the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(4), the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(1), (3), (5)\xe2\x80\x93(7) (main ed. and Supp. 2004).  And the Act nonetheless requires judges to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and effectively provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training and medical care.  \xc2\xa73553(a)(2) (main ed. and Supp. 2004) (see Appendix, <em>infra</em>, for text of \xc2\xa73553(a)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, despite the absence of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range in the exercise of his discretionary power under \xc2\xa73553(a)).  See \xc2\xa73742(a) (main ed.) (appeal by defendant); \xc2\xa73742(b) (appeal by Government).  We concede that the excision of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) requires the excision of a different, appeals-related section, namely \xc2\xa73742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004), which sets forth standards of review on appeal.  That section contains critical cross-references to the (now-excised) \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and consequently must be severed and excised for similar reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Excision of \xc2\xa73742(e), however, does not pose a critical problem for the handling of appeals.  That is because, as we have previously held, a statute that does not <em>explicitly</em> set forth a standard of review may nonetheless do so <em>implicitly</em>.  See <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/552/index.html">487 U. S. 552</a>, 558\xe2\x80\x93560 (1988) (adopting a standard of review, where \xe2\x80\x9cneither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition\xe2\x80\x9d existed, based on the statutory text and structure, and on practical considerations); see also <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>v. <em>Hartmarx Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/384/index.html">496 U. S. 384</a>, 403\xe2\x80\x93405 (1990) (same); <em>Koon </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/81/index.html">518 U. S. 81</a>, 99 (1996) (citing <em>Pierce</em> and <em>Cooter &amp; Gell</em> with approval).  We infer appropriate review standards from related statutory language, the structure of the statute, and the \xe2\x80\x9csound administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pierce</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 559\xe2\x80\x93560.  And in this instance those factors, in addition to the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures, imply a practical standard of review already familiar to appellate courts: review for \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable[ness].\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until 2003, \xc2\xa73742(e) explicitly set forth that standard.  See \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).  In 2003, Congress modified the pre-existing text, adding a <em>de novo</em> standard of review for departures and inserting cross-references to \xc2\xa73553(b)(1).  Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub. L. 108\xe2\x80\x9321, \xc2\xa7401(d)(1), 117 Stat. 670.  In light of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the reasons for these revisions\xe2\x80\x94to make Guidelines sentencing even more mandatory than it had been\xe2\x80\x94have ceased to be relevant.  The pre-2003 text directed appellate courts to review sentences that reflected an applicable Guidelines range for correctness, but to review other sentences\xe2\x80\x94those that fell \xe2\x80\x9coutside the applicable Guideline range\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with a view toward determining whether such a sentence</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c<em>is unreasonable</em>, having regard for \xe2\x80\xa6 the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in chapter 227 of this title; and \xe2\x80\xa6 the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn other words, the text told appellate courts to determine whether the sentence \xe2\x80\x9cis unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to \xc2\xa73553(a).  Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing.  Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking into account the factors set forth in <em>Pierce</em>, we read the statute as implying this appellate review standard\xe2\x80\x94a standard consistent with appellate sentencing practice during the last two decades.  Justice Scalia believes that only in \xe2\x80\x9cWonderland\xe2\x80\x9d is it possible to infer a standard of review after excising \xc2\xa73742(e).  See <em>post</em>, at 8 (dissenting opinion).  But our application of <em>Pierce</em> does not justify that characterization.  <em>Pierce</em> requires us to judge the appropriateness of our inference based on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and basic purposes.  We believe our inference a fair one linguistically, and one consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to provide appellate review.  Under these circumstances, to refuse to apply <em>Pierce</em> and thereby retreat to a remedy that raises the problems discussed in Part II, <em>supra </em>(as the dissenters would do), or thereby eliminate appellate review entirely, would cut the statute loose from its moorings in congressional purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we share the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 doubts about the practicality of a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review.  \xe2\x80\x9cReasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standards are not foreign to sentencing law.  The Act has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances\xe2\x80\x94both on review of departures, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) (1994 ed.), and on review of sentences imposed where there was no applicable Guideline, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73742(a)(4), (b)(4), (e)(4).  Together, these cases account for about 16.7% of sentencing appeals.  See United States Sentencing Commission, 2002 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 107 n.\xc2\xa01, 111 (at least 711 of 5,018 sentencing appeals involved departures), 108 (at least 126 of 5,018 sentencing appeals involved the imposition of a term of imprisonment after the revocation of supervised release).  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>White Face</em>, 383 F.\xc2\xa03d 733, 737\xe2\x80\x93740 (CA8 2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tsosie</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d 1210, 1218\xe2\x80\x931219 (CA10 2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salinas</em>, 365 F.\xc2\xa03d 582, 588\xe2\x80\x93590 (CA7 2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cook</em>, 291 F.\xc2\xa03d 1297, 1300\xe2\x80\x931302 (CA11 2002); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olabanji</em>, 268 F.\xc2\xa03d 636, 637\xe2\x80\x93639 (CA9 2001); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ramirez-Rivera</em>, 241 F.\xc2\xa03d 37, 40\xe2\x80\x9341 (CA1 2001).  That is why we think it fair (and not, in Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s words, a \xe2\x80\x9cgross exaggeratio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 10 (dissenting opinion)), to assume judicial familiarity with a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  And that is why we believe that appellate judges will prove capable of facing with greater equanimity than would Justice Scalia what he calls the \xe2\x80\x9cdaunting prospect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., of applying such a standard across the board.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither do we share Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s belief that use of a reasonableness standard \xe2\x80\x9cwill produce a discordant symphony\xe2\x80\x9d leading to \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive sentencing disparities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwreak havoc\xe2\x80\x9d on the judicial system, <em>post</em>, at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Sentencing Commission will continue to collect and study appellate court decisionmaking.  It will continue to modify its Guidelines in light of what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be better sentencing practices.  It will thereby promote uniformity in the sentencing process.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7994 (main ed. and Supp. 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, in this context, we must view fears of a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscordant symphony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive disparities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chavoc\xe2\x80\x9d (if they are not themselves \xe2\x80\x9cgross exaggerations\xe2\x80\x9d) with a comparative eye.  We cannot and do not claim that use of a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard will provide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to secure.  Nor do we doubt that Congress wrote the language of the appellate provisions to correspond with the mandatory system it intended to create.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 5 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (expressing concern regarding the presence of \xc2\xa73742(f) in light of the absence of \xc2\xa73742(e)).  But, as by now should be clear, that mandatory system is no longer an open choice.  And the remedial question we must ask here (as we did in respect to \xc2\xa73553(b)(1)) is, which alternative adheres more closely to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 original objective: (1) retention of sentencing appeals, or (2) invalidation of the entire Act, including its appellate provisions?  The former, by providing appellate review, would tend to iron out sentencing differences; the latter would not.  Hence we believe Congress would have preferred the former to the latter\xe2\x80\x94even if the former means that some provisions will apply differently from the way Congress had originally expected.  See <em>post</em>, at 5 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But, as we have said, we believe that Congress would have preferred even the latter to the system the dissenters recommend, a system that has its own problems of practicality.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Act without its \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d provision and related language remains consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 initial and basic sentencing intent.  Congress sought to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, [while] avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(b)(1)(B); see also USSG \xc2\xa71A1.1, application note (explaining that Congress sought to achieve \xe2\x80\x9chonesty,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuniformity,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproportionality\xe2\x80\x9d in sentencing (emphases deleted)).  The system remaining after excision, while lacking the mandatory features that Congress enacted, retains other features that help to further these objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have said, the Sentencing Commission remains in place, writing Guidelines, collecting information about actual district court sentencing decisions, undertaking research, and revising the Guidelines accordingly.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7994 (main ed. and Supp. 2004).  The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(4), (5) (Supp. 2004).  But compare <em>post,</em> at 4 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (claiming that the sentencing judge has the same discretion \xe2\x80\x9che possessed before the Act was passed\xe2\x80\x9d).  The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.  These features of the remaining system, while not the system Congress enacted, nonetheless continue to move sentencing in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(b).  We can find no feature of the remaining system that tends to hinder, rather than to further, these basic objectives.  Under these circumstances, why would Congress not have preferred excision of the \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d provision to a system that engrafts today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement onto the unchanged pre-existing statute\xe2\x80\x94a system that, in terms of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic objectives, is counterproductive?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not doubt that Congress, when it wrote the Sentencing Act, intended to create a form of mandatory Guidelines system.  See <em>post,</em> at 21\xe2\x80\x9326 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But, we repeat, given today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding, that is not a choice that remains open.  Hence we have examined the statute in depth to determine Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent <em>in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc.</em>, 518 U. S., at 767.  And we have concluded that today\xe2\x80\x99s holding is fundamentally inconsistent with the judge-based sentencing system that Congress enacted into law.  In our view, it is more consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act (1) to preserve important elements of that system while severing and excising two provisions (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and 3742(e)) than (2) to maintain all provisions of the Act and engraft today\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement onto that statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ours, of course, is not the last word: The ball now lies in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 court.  The National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long-term, the sentencing system, compatible with the Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal system of justice.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We briefly explain why we have not fully adopted the remedial proposals that the parties have advanced.  First, the Government argues that \xe2\x80\x9cin any case in which the Constitution prohibits the judicial factfinding procedures that Congress and the Commission contemplated for implementing the Guidelines, the Guidelines as a whole become inapplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in No. 04\xe2\x80\x93104, p.\xc2\xa044.  Thus the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9csystem contemplated by Congress and created by the Commission would be inapplicable in a case in which the Guidelines would require the sentencing court to find a sentence-enhancing fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  The Guidelines would remain advisory, however, for \xc2\xa73553(a) would remain intact.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Cf. Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15, n.\xc2\xa09 (A \xe2\x80\x9cdecision that Section 3553(b) \xe2\x80\xa6 is unconstitutional \xe2\x80\xa6 would not necessarily jeopardize the other reforms made by the Sentencing Reform Act, including \xe2\x80\xa6 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>ibid</em>. (recognizing that the remainder of the Act functions independently); Brief for<em> </em>Families Against Mandatory Minimums as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 29, 30.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we understand the Government\xe2\x80\x99s remedial suggestion, it coincides significantly with our own.  But compare <em>post,</em> at 11 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (asserting that no party or <em>amicus</em> sought the remedy we adopt); <em>post,</em> at 8 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (same).  The Government would render the Guidelines advisory in \xe2\x80\x9cany case in which the Constitution prohibits\xe2\x80\x9d judicial factfinding.  But it apparently would leave them as binding in all other cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the first part of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion.  However, we do not see how it is possible to leave the Guidelines as binding in other cases.  For one thing, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would impose mandatory Guidelines-type limits upon a judge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to <em>reduce</em> sentences, but it would not impose those limits upon a judge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to <em>increase </em>sentences.  We do not believe that such \xe2\x80\x9cone-way lever[s]\xe2\x80\x9d are compatible with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Cf. Brief for Senator Orrin G. Hatch et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22; see also <em>supra,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  For another, we believe that Congress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a nonmandatory system in others, given the administrative complexities that such a system would create.  Such a two-system proposal seems unlikely to further Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic objective of promoting uniformity in sentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the respondents in essence would take the same approach as would Justice Stevens.  They believe that the constitutional requirement is compatible with the Sentencing Act, and they ask us to hold that the Act continues to stand as written with the constitutional requirement engrafted onto it.  We do not accept their position for the reasons we have already given.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Fanfan argues in the alternative that we should excise those provisions of the Sentencing Act that require judicial factfinding at sentencing.  That system, however, would produce problems similar to those we have discussed in Part II, see <em>ibid</em>.  We reject Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s remedial suggestion for that reason.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respondent Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court applied the Guidelines as written and imposed a sentence higher than the maximum authorized solely by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  The Court of Appeals held <em>Blakely</em> applicable to the Guidelines, concluded that Booker\xe2\x80\x99s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, vacated the judgment of the District Court, and remanded for resentencing.  We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case.  On remand, the District Court should impose a sentence in accordance with today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, and, if the sentence comes before the Court of Appeals for review, the Court of Appeals should apply the review standards set forth in this\nopinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respondent Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court held <em>Blakely</em> applicable to the Guidelines.  It then imposed a sentence that was authorized by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict\xe2\x80\x94a sentence lower than the sentence authorized by the Guidelines as written.  Thus, Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment.  Nonetheless, the Government (and the defendant should he so choose) may seek resentencing under the system set forth in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions.  Hence we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As these dispositions indicate, we must apply today\xe2\x80\x99s holdings\xe2\x80\x94both the Sixth Amendment holding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act\xe2\x80\x94to all cases on direct review.  See <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>, 328 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases \xe2\x80\xa6 pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \xe2\x80\x98clear break\xe2\x80\x99 with the past\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Reynoldsville Casket Co. </em>v. <em>Hyde</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/749/index.html">514 U.

That fact does not mean that we believe that every sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation.  Nor do we believe that every appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing.  That is because we expect reviewing courts to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the \xe2\x80\x9cplain-error\xe2\x80\x9d test.  It is also because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine. </p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p align="left">Title 18 U.

In each case, the courts below held that binding rules set forth in the Guidelines limited the severity of the sentence that the judge could lawfully impose on the defendant based on the facts found by the jury at his trial.  In both cases the courts rejected, on the basis of our decision in <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 542 U. S. ___ (2004), the Government\xe2\x80\x99s recommended application of the Sentencing Guidelines because the proposed sentences were based on additional facts that the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence.  We hold that both courts correctly concluded that the Sixth Amendment as construed in <em>Blakely</em> does apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.  In a separate opinion authored by Justice Breyer, the Court concludes that in light of this holding, two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) that have the effect of making the Guidelines mandatory must be invalidated in order to allow the statute to operate in a manner consistent with congressional intent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Booker was charged with possession with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base (crack).  Having heard evidence that he had 92.5 grams in his duffel bag, the jury found him guilty of violating 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).  That statute prescribes a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life for that offense.  \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based upon Booker\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history and the quantity of drugs found by the jury, the Sentencing Guidelines required the District Court Judge to select a \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d sentence of not less than 210 nor more than 262 months in prison.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(4), 4A1.1 (Nov. 2003) (hereinafter USSG).  The judge, however, held a post-trial sentencing proceeding and concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that Booker had possessed an additional 566 grams of crack and that he was guilty of obstructing justice.  Those findings mandated that the judge select a sentence between 360 months and life imprisonment; the judge imposed a sentence at the low end of the range.  Thus, instead of the sentence of 21 years and 10 months that the judge could have imposed on the basis of the facts proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Booker received a 30-year sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the dissent of Judge Easterbrook, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that this application of the Sentencing Guidelines conflicted with our holding in <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>, 490 (2000), that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  375 F.\xc2\xa03d 508, 510 (2004).  The majority relied on our holding in <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 542 U. S. ___ (2004), that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi</em> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 7).  The court held that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, and remanded with instructions to the District Court either to sentence respondent within the sentencing range supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings or to hold a separate sentencing hearing before a jury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Fanfan was charged with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7846, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii).  He was convicted by the jury after it answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d to the question \xe2\x80\x9cWas the amount of cocaine 500 or more grams?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. C to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x93105, p.\xc2\xa015a.  Under the Guidelines, without additional findings of fact, the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict was imprisonment for 78 months.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few days after our decision in <em>Blakely</em>, the trial judge conducted a sentencing hearing at which he found additional facts that, under the Guidelines, would have authorized a sentence in the 188-to-235 month range.  Specifically, he found that respondent Fanfan was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine powder, and 261.6 grams of crack.  He also concluded that respondent had been an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity.  Both findings were made by a preponderance of the evidence.  Under the Guidelines, these additional findings would have required an enhanced sentence of 15 or 16 years instead of the 5 or 6 years authorized by the jury verdict alone.  Relying not only on the majority opinion in <em>Blakely</em>, but also on the categorical statements in the dissenting opinions and in the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s brief in <em>Blakely</em>, see App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x93105, pp.\xc2\xa06a\xe2\x80\x937a, the judge concluded that he could not follow the particular provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cwhich involve drug quantity and role enhancement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 11a.  Expressly refusing to make \xe2\x80\x9cany blanket decision about the federal guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d he followed the provisions of the Guidelines that did not implicate the Sixth Amendment by imposing a sentence on respondent \xe2\x80\x9cbased solely upon the guilty verdict in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the denial of its motion to correct the sentence in Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Government filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and a petition in this Court for a writ of certiorari before judgment.  Because of the importance of the questions presented, we granted that petition, 542 U. S. ___ (2004), as well as a similar petition filed by the Government in Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case, 542 U. S. ___ (2004).  In both petitions, the Government asks us to determine whether our <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases applies to the Sentencing Guidelines, and if so, what portions of the Guidelines remain in effect.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this opinion, we explain why we agree with the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 answer to the first question.

S. 227</a>, 230 (1999), we considered the federal carjacking statute, which provides three different maximum sentences depending on the extent of harm to the victim: 15 years in jail if there was no serious injury to a victim, 25 years if there was \xe2\x80\x9cserious bodily injury,\xe2\x80\x9d and life in prison if death resulted.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72119 (1988 ed., Supp. V).  In spite of the fact that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cat first glance has a look to it suggesting [that the provisions relating to the extent of harm to the victim] are only sentencing provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d 526 U. S., at 232, we concluded that the harm to the victim was an element of the crime.  That conclusion was supported by the statutory text and structure, and was influenced by our desire to avoid the constitutional issues implicated by a contrary holding, which would have reduced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s role \xe2\x80\x9cto the relative importance of low-level gatekeeping.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 244.  Foreshadowing the result we reach today, we noted that our holding was consistent with a \xe2\x80\x9crule requiring jury determination of facts that raise a sentencing ceiling\xe2\x80\x9d in state and federal sentencing guidelines systems.  <em>Id.</em>, at 251, n.\xc2\xa011.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), the defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, which carried a prison term of 5-to-10 years.  Thereafter, the trial court found that his conduct had violated New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chate crime\xe2\x80\x9d law because it was racially motivated, and imposed a 12-year sentence.  This Court set aside the enhanced sentence.  We held:<font b="1"> \xe2\x80\x9cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 490.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that New Jersey labeled the hate crime a \xe2\x80\x9csentence enhancement\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a separate criminal act was irrelevant for constitutional purposes.  <em>Id.,</em> at 478.  As a matter of simple justice, it seemed obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to protect Apprendi from punishment for the possession of a firearm should apply equally to his violation of the hate crime statute.  Merely using the label \xe2\x80\x9csentence enhancement\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the latter did not provide a principled basis for treating the two crimes differently.  <em>Id.,</em> at 476.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Ring</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/584/index.html">536 U.

There, we held that it was impermissible for \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial judge, sitting alone\xe2\x80\x9d to determine the presence or absence of the aggravating factors required by Arizona law for imposition of the death penalty.  <em>Id.,</em> at 588\xe2\x80\x93589.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf a State makes an increase in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\xe2\x80\x94no matter how the State labels it\xe2\x80\x94must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 602.  Our opinion made it clear that ultimately, while the procedural error in Ring\xe2\x80\x99s case might have been harmless because the necessary finding was implicit in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict, <em>id</em>., at 609, n.\xc2\xa07, \xe2\x80\x9cthe characterization of a fact or circumstance as an \xe2\x80\x98element\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98sentencing factor\xe2\x80\x99 is not determinative of the question \xe2\x80\x98who decides,\xe2\x80\x99 judge or jury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 605.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 542 U. S. ___ (2004), we dealt with a determinate sentencing scheme similar to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  There the defendant pleaded guilty to kidnaping, a class B felony punishable by a term of not more than 10 years.  Other provisions of Washington law, comparable to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, mandated a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d sentence of 49-to-53 months, unless the judge found aggravating facts justifying an exceptional sentence.  Although the prosecutor recommended a sentence in the standard range, the judge found that the defendant had acted with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliberate cruelty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and sentenced him to 90 months.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For reasons explained in <em>Jones</em>, <em>Apprendi</em>, and <em>Ring</em>, the requirements of the Sixth Amendment were clear.  The application of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing scheme violated the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to have the jury find the existence of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any particular fact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the law makes essential to his punishment.  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  That right is implicated whenever a judge seeks to impose a sentence that is not solely based on \xe2\x80\x9cfacts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 7) (emphasis deleted).  We rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the jury verdict was sufficient to authorize a sentence within the general 10-year sentence for Class B felonies, noting that under Washington law, the judge was <em>required</em> to find additional facts in order to impose the greater 90-month sentence.  Our precedents, we explained, make clear \xe2\x80\x9cthat the \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi</em> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (slip op., at 7) (emphasis in original).  The determination that the defendant acted with deliberate cruelty, like the determination in <em>Apprendi</em> that the defendant acted with racial malice,  increased the sentence that the defendant could have otherwise received.  Since this fact was found by a judge using a preponderance of the evidence standard, the sentence violated Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the dissenting opinions in <em>Blakely</em> recognized, there is no distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in that case.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 542 U. S., at ___ (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (slip op., at 12) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe structure of the Federal Guidelines likewise does not, as the Government half-heartedly suggests, provide any grounds for distinction. \xe2\x80\xa6 If anything, the structural differences that do exist make the Federal Guidelines more vulnerable to attack\xe2\x80\x9d).  This conclusion rests on the premise, common to both systems, that the relevant sentencing rules are mandatory and impose binding requirements on all sentencing judges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.  We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.  See <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U. S., at 481; <em>Williams</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/index.html">337 U. S. 241</a>, 246 (1949).  Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the SRA the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges; it is that circumstance that makes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the second question presented possible.  For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Guidelines as written, however, are not advisory; they are mandatory and binding on all judges.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  While subsection (a) of  \xc2\xa73553 of the sentencing statute[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] lists the Sentencing Guidelines as one factor to be considered in imposing a sentence, subsection (b) directs that the court \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range\xe2\x80\x9d established by the Guidelines, subject to departures in specific, limited cases.  Because they are binding on judges, we have consistently held that the Guidelines have the force and effect of laws.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mistretta</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html"></a><a href="/us/488/361/index.html"></a><a href="/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 391 (1989); <em>Stinson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/36/index.html">508 U. S. 36</a>, 42 (1993). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The availability of a departure in specified circumstances does not avoid the constitutional issue, just as it did not in <em>Blakely</em> itself.  The Guidelines permit departures from the prescribed sentencing range in cases in which the judge \xe2\x80\x9cfinds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004).  At first glance, one might believe that the ability of a district judge to depart from the Guidelines means that she is bound only by the statutory maximum.  Were this the case, there would be no <em>Apprendi</em> problem.  Importantly, however, departures are not available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in most.  In most cases, as a matter of law, the Commission will have adequately taken all relevant factors into account, and no departure will be legally permissible.  In those instances, the judge is bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range.  It was for this reason that we rejected a similar argument in <em>Blakely</em>, holding that although the Washington statute allowed the judge to impose a sentence outside the sentencing range for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial and compelling reasons,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that exception was not available for Blakely himself.  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  The sentencing judge would have been reversed had he invoked the departure section to justify the sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case illustrates the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.  The jury convicted him of possessing at least 50 grams of crack in violation of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) based on evidence that he had 92.5 grams of crack in his duffel bag.  Under these facts, the Guidelines specified an offense level of 32, which, given the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history category, authorized a sentence of 210-to-262 months.  See USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(4).  Booker\xe2\x80\x99s is a run-of-the-mill drug case, and does not present any factors that were inadequately considered by the Commission.  The sentencing judge would therefore have been reversed had he not imposed a sentence within the level 32 Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Booker\xe2\x80\x99s actual sentence, however, was 360 months, almost 10 years longer than the Guidelines range supported by the jury verdict alone.  To reach this sentence, the judge found facts beyond those found by the jury: namely, that Booker possessed 566 grams of crack in addition to the 92.5 grams in his duffel bag.  The jury never heard any evidence of the additional drug quantity, and the judge found it true by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thus, just as in <em>Blakely</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.  The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  There is no relevant distinction between the sentence imposed pursuant to the Washington statutes in <em>Blakely</em> and the sentences imposed pursuant to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in these cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In his dissent, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934, Justice Breyer argues on historical grounds that the Guidelines scheme is constitutional across the board.  He points to traditional judicial authority to increase sentences to take account of any unusual blameworthiness in the manner employed in committing a crime, an authority that the Guidelines require to be exercised consistently throughout the system.  This tradition, however, does not provide a sound guide to enforcement of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of a jury trial in today\xe2\x80\x99s world.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is quite true that once determinate sentencing had fallen from favor, American judges commonly determined facts justifying a choice of a heavier sentence on account of the manner in which particular defendants acted.  <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 481.  In 1986, however, our own cases first recognized a new trend in the legislative regulation of sentencing when we considered the significance of facts selected by legislatures that not only authorized, or even mandated, heavier sentences than would otherwise have been imposed, but increased the range of sentences possible for the underlying crime.  See <em>McMillan</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/79/index.html">477 U. S. 79</a>, 87\xe2\x80\x9388 (1986).  Provisions for such enhancements of the permissible sentencing range reflected growing and wholly justified legislative concern about the proliferation and variety of drug crimes and their frequent identification with firearms offences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The effect of the increasing emphasis on facts that enhanced sentencing ranges, however, was to increase the judge\xe2\x80\x99s power and diminish that of the jury.  It became\nthe judge, not the jury, that determined the upper limits\nof sentencing, and the facts determined were not re-\nquired to be raised before trial or proved by more than a preponderance. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the enhancements became greater, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of the underlying crime became less significant.  And the enhancements became very serious indeed. See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Jones</em>, 526 U. S., at 330 (judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding increased the maximum sentence from 15 to 25 years); respondent Booker (from 262 months to a life sentence); respondent Fanfan (from 78 to 235 months); <em>United States </em>v.<em> Rodriguez</em>, 73 F. 3d 161, 162\xe2\x80\x93163 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (from approximately 54 months to a life sentence); <em>United States </em>v.<em> Hammoud</em>, 381 F. 3d 316, 361\xe2\x80\x93362 (CA4 2004) (en banc) (Motz, J., dissenting) (actual sentence increased from 57 months to 155 years).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As it thus became clear that sentencing was no longer taking place in the tradition that Justice Breyer invokes, the Court was faced with the issue of preserving an ancient guarantee under a new set of circumstances.  The new sentencing practice forced the Court to address the question how the right of jury trial could be preserved, in a meaningful way guaranteeing that the jury would still stand between the individual and the power of the government under the new sentencing regime.  And it is the new circumstances, not a tradition or practice that the new circumstances have superseded, that have led us to the answer first considered in <em>Jones</em> and developed in <em>Apprendi</em> and subsequent cases culminating with this one.  It is an answer not motivated by Sixth Amendment formalism, but by the need to preserve Sixth Amendment substance.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government advances three arguments in support of its submission that we should not apply our reasoning in <em>Blakely</em> to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  It contends that <em>Blakely</em> is distinguishable because the Guidelines were promulgated by a commission rather than the Legislature; that principles of <em>stare decisis</em> require us to follow four earlier decisions that are arguably inconsistent with <em>Blakely;</em> and that the application of <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines would conflict with separation of powers principles reflected in <em>Mistretta</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html"></a><a href="/us/488/361/index.html"></a><a href="/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a> (1989).  These arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Commission vs. Legislature:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our judgment the fact that the Guidelines were promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, rather than Congress, lacks constitutional significance.  In order to impose the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 sentences under the Guidelines, the judges in these cases were required to find an additional fact, such as drug quantity, just as the judge found the additional fact of serious bodily injury to the victim in Jones</em>.  As far as the defendants are concerned, they face significantly higher sentences\xe2\x80\x94in Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case almost 10 years higher\xe2\x80\x94because a judge found true by a preponderance of the evidence a fact that was never submitted to the jury.  Regardless of whether Congress or a Sentencing Commission concluded that a particular fact must be proved in order to sentence a defendant within a particular range, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Framers would not have thought it too much to demand that, before depriving a man of [ten] more years of his liberty, the State should suffer the modest inconvenience of submitting its accusation to \xe2\x80\x98the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours,\xe2\x80\x99 rather than a lone employee of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government correctly notes that in <em>Apprendi</em> we referred to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\xc2\xa0</em>\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 15 (quoting <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis in Brief for United States)).  The simple answer, of course, is that we were only considering a statute in that case; we expressly declined to consider the Guidelines.  See <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 497, n.\xc2\xa021.  It was therefore appropriate to state the rule in that case in terms of a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory maximum\xe2\x80\x9d rather than answering a question not properly before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More important than the language used in our holding in <em>Apprendi</em> are the principles we sought to vindicate.  Those principles are unquestionably applicable to the Guidelines.  They are not the product of recent innovations in our jurisprudence, but rather have their genesis in the ideals our constitutional tradition assimilated from the common law.  See <em>Jones</em>, 526 U. S., at 244\xe2\x80\x93248.  The Framers of the Constitution understood the threat of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial despotism\xe2\x80\x9d that could arise from \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions\xe2\x80\x9d without the benefit of a jury in criminal cases.  The Federalist No. 83, p.\xc2\xa0499 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  The Founders presumably carried this concern from England, in which the right to a jury trial had been enshrined since the Magna Carta.  As we noted in <em>Apprendi:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he historical foundation for our recognition of these principles extends down centuries into the common law.  \xe2\x80\x98[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98as the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties,\xe2\x80\x99 trial by jury has been understood to require that \xe2\x80\x98the truth of every accusation</em>, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] equals and neighbors\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U.

We disagree.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dunnigan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/87/index.html">507 U. S. 87</a> (1993), we held that the provisions of the Guidelines that require a sentence enhancement if the judge determines that the defendant committed perjury do not violate the privilege of the accused to testify on her own behalf.  There was no contention that the enhancement was invalid because it resulted in a more severe sentence than the jury verdict had authorized.  Accordingly, we found this case indistinguishable from <em>United States</em> v. <em>Grayson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/41/index.html">438 U. S. 41</a> (1978), a pre-Guidelines case in which we upheld a similar sentence increase.  Applying <em>Blakely</em> to the Guidelines would invalidate a sentence that relied on such an enhancement if the resulting sentence was outside the range authorized by the jury verdict.  Nevertheless, there are many situations in which the district judge might find that the enhancement is warranted, yet still sentence the defendant within the range authorized by the jury.  See <em>post,</em> at 6\xe2\x80\x939. (Stevens, J., dissenting in part).  Thus, while the reach of <em>Dunnigan</em> may be limited, we need not overrule it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Witte </em>v<em>.

In <em>Watts</em>, relying on <em>Witte</em>, we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause permitted a court to consider acquitted conduct in sentencing a defendant under the Guidelines.  In neither <em>Witte</em> nor <em>Watts</em> was there any contention that the sentencing enhancement had exceeded the sentence authorized by the jury verdict in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  The issue we confront today simply was not presented.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/511/index.html">523 U.

Even though the indictment had charged that their conspiracy embraced both, they argued on appeal that the verdict limited the judge\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing authority.  We recognized that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 statutory and constitutional claims might have had merit if it had been possible to argue that their crack-related activities were not part of the same conspiracy as their cocaine activities.  But they failed to make that argument, and, based on our review of the record which showed \xe2\x80\x9ca series of interrelated drug transactions involving both cocaine and crack,\xe2\x80\x9d we concluded that no such claim could succeed.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Id., </em>at 515.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of our prior cases is inconsistent with today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  <em>Stare decisis</em> does not compel us to limit <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Separation of Powers:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government and, to a lesser extent, Justice Breyer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, argue that any holding that would require Guidelines sentencing factors to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt would effectively transform them into a code defining elements of criminal offenses.  The result, according to the Government, would be an unconstitutional grant to the Sentencing Commission of the inherently legislative power to define criminal elements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no merit to this argument because the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s authority to identify the facts relevant to sentencing decisions and to determine the impact of such facts on federal sentences is precisely the same whether one labels such facts \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factors\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of crimes.  Our decision in <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U.

The constitutional safeguards that figure in our analysis concern not the identity of the elements defining criminal liability but only the required procedures for finding the facts that determine the maximum permissible punishment; these are the safeguards going to the formality of notice, the identity of the factfinder, and the burden of proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  526 U.

That decision<em> </em>was premised on an understanding that the Commission, rather than performing adjudicatory functions, instead makes political and substantive decisions.  488 U. S., at 393.  We noted that the promulgation of the Guidelines was much like other activities in the Judicial Branch, such as the creation of the Federal Rules of Evidence, all of which are non-adjudicatory activities.  <em>Id.,</em> at 387.  We also noted that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may delegate to the Judicial Branch nonadjudicatory functions that do not trench upon the prerogatives of another Branch and that are appropriate to the central mission of the Judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 388.  While we recognized that the Guidelines were more substantive than the Rules of Evidence or other nonadjudicatory functions delegated to the Judicial Branch, we nonetheless concluded that such a delegation did not exceed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 powers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, a recognition that the Commission did not exercise judicial authority, but was more properly thought of as exercising some sort of legislative power, <em>ibid.</em>, was essential to our holding.  If the Commission in fact performed adjudicatory functions, it would have violated Article III because some of the members were not Article III judges.  As we explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98practical consequences\xe2\x80\x99 of locating the Commission within the Judicial Branch pose no threat of undermining the integrity of the Judicial Branch or of expanding the powers of the Judiciary beyond constitutional bounds by uniting within the Branch the political or quasi-legislative power of the Commission with the judicial power of the courts\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s] powers are not united with the powers\nof the Judiciary in a way that has meaning for\nseparation-of-powers analysis.  Whatever constitutional problems might arise if the powers of the Commission were vested in a court, the Commission is not a court, does not exercise judicial power, and is not controlled by or accountable to members of the Judicial Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 393.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have thus always recognized the fact that the Commission is an independent agency that exercises policy-making authority delegated to it by Congress.

We recognize, as we did in <em>Jones, Apprendi</em>, and <em>Blakely</em>, that in some cases jury factfinding may impair the most expedient and efficient sentencing of defendants.  But the interest in fairness and reliability protected by the right to a jury trial\xe2\x80\x94a common-law right that defendants enjoyed for centuries and that is now enshrined in the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94has always outweighed the interest in concluding trials swiftly.   <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U.

Neither the Government, nor the respondents, nor any of the numerous <em>amici </em>has suggested that there is any need to invalidate either provision in order to avoid violations of the Sixth Amendment in the administration of the Guidelines.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do so represents a policy choice that Congress has considered and decisively rejected.  While it is perfectly clear that Congress has ample power to repeal these two statutory provisions if it so<font b="1"> desires, this Court should not make that choice on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.  I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary exercise of authority.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before explaining why the law does not authorize the Court\xe2\x80\x99s creative remedy, why the reasons it advances in support of its decision are unpersuasive, and why it is abundantly clear that Congress has already rejected that very remedy, it is appropriate to explain how the violation of the Sixth Amendment that occurred in Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case could readily have been avoided without making any change in the Guidelines.  Booker received a sentence of 360 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  His sentence was based on four factual determinations: (1) the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that he possessed 92.5 grams of crack (cocaine base); (2) the judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that he possessed an additional 566 grams; (3) the judge\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that he had obstructed justice; and (4) the judge\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of his prior criminal record.  Under the jury\xe2\x80\x99s 92.5 grams finding, the maximum sentence authorized by the Guidelines was a term of 262 months.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(4) (Nov. 2003) (USSG).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the 566 gram finding had been made by the jury based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that finding would have authorized a guidelines sentence anywhere between 324 and 405 months\xe2\x80\x94the equivalent of a range from 27 to nearly 34 years\xe2\x80\x94given Booker\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history.  \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(2).  Relying on his own appraisal of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s obstruction of justice, and presumably any other information in the presentence report, the judge would have had discretion to select any sentence within that range.  Thus, if the two facts, which in this case actually established two separate crimes, had both been found by the jury, the judicial factfinding that produced the actual sentence would not have violated the Constitution.  In other words, the judge could have considered Booker\xe2\x80\x99s obstruction of justice, his criminal history, and all other real offense and offender factors without violating the Sixth Amendment.  Because the Guidelines as written possess the virtue of combining a mandatory determination of sentencing ranges and discretionary decisions within those ranges, they allow ample latitude for judicial factfinding that does not even arguably raise any Sixth Amendment issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s chosen remedy is its assumption that Congress did not contemplate that the Sixth Amendment would be violated by depriving the defendant of the right to a jury trial on a factual issue as important as whether Booker possessed the additional 566 grams of crack that exponentially increased the maximum sentence that he could receive.  I am not at all sure that that assumption is correct, but even if it is, it does not provide an adequate basis for volunteering a systemwide remedy that Congress has already rejected and could enact on its own if it elected to.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When one pauses to note that over 95% of all federal criminal prosecutions are terminated by a plea bargain, and the further fact that in almost half of the cases that go to trial there are no sentencing enhancements, the extraordinary overbreadth of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented remedy is manifest.  It is, moreover, unique because, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, if Congress should decide to reenact the exact text of the two provisions that the Court has chosen to invalidate, that reenactment would be unquestionably constitutional.  In my judgment, it is therefore clear that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s creative remedy is an exercise of legislative, rather than judicial, power.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is a fundamental premise of judicial review that all Acts of Congress are presumptively valid.  See <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Time, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/641/index.html">468 U. S. 641</a>, 652 (1984).  \xe2\x80\x9cA ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the past, because of its respect for the coordinate branches of Government, the Court has invalidated duly enacted statutes\xe2\x80\x94or particular provisions of such statutes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U.

The exercise of such power is traditionally limited to issues presented in the case or controversy before the Court, and to the imposition of remedies that redress specific constitutional violations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two narrow exceptions to<font b="1"> this general rule.  A<font b="1"> facial challenge may succeed if a legislative scheme is unconstitutional in all or nearly all of its applications.  That is certainly not true in these cases, however, because most applications of the Guidelines are unquestionably valid.  A second exception involves cases in which an invalid provision or application cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute.  That exception is inapplicable because there is no statutory or Guidelines provision that is invalid.  Neither exception supports the majority\xe2\x80\x99s newly minted remedy.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p align="left"><em>Facial Invalidity:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless of how the Court defines the standard for determining when a facial challenge to a statute should succeed,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] it is abundantly clear that the fact that a statute, or any provision of a statute, is unconstitutional in a portion of its applications does not render the statute or provision invalid, and no party suggests otherwise.  The Government conceded at oral argument that 45% of federal sentences involve no enhancements.  Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, 2002 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (hereinafter Sourcebook).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And, according to two U. S. Sentencing Commissioners who testified before Congress shortly after we handed down our decision in Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> 542 U. S. ___ (2004), the number of enhancements that would actually implicate a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment rights is even smaller.  See Hearings on <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em> and the Future of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., p.\xc2\xa02 (2004) (hereinafter Hearings on <em>Blakely</em>) (testimony of Commissioners John R. Steer and Hon. William K. Sessions III) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] majority of the cases sentenced under the federal guidelines do not receive sentencing enhancements that could potentially implicate <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x9d), available at http://www.ussc.gov/hearings/BlakelyTest.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 7, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Simply stated, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s submissions to this Court and to Congress demonstrate that the Guidelines could be constitutionally applied in their entirety, without any modifications, in the \xe2\x80\x9cmajority of the cases sentenced under the federal guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  On the basis of these submissions alone, this Court should have declined to find the Guidelines, or any particular provisions of the Guidelines, facially invalid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s claim that a jury factfinding requirement would \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy the system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 9 (opinion of Breyer, J.), would at most apply to a <em>minority </em>of sentences imposed under the Guidelines.  In reality, given that the Government and judges have been apprised of the requirements of the Sixth Amendment, the number of unconstitutional applications would have been even smaller had we allowed them the opportunity to comply with our constitutional holding.  This is so for several reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it is axiomatic that a defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.  <em>Patton</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/281/276/index.html">281 U. S. 276</a>, 312\xe2\x80\x93313 (1930).  In <em>Blakely</em> we explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a defendant pleads guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Such reasoning applies with equal force to sentences imposed under the Guidelines.  As the majority concedes, <em>ante,</em> at 5, only a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions ever go to trial.  See Estimate 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn FY02, 97.1 percent of cases sentenced under the guidelines were the result of plea agreements\xe2\x80\x9d).  If such procedures were followed in the future, our holding that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the Guidelines would be consequential only in the tiny portion of prospective sentencing decisions that are made after a defendant has been found guilty by a jury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in the remaining fraction of cases that result in a jury trial, I am confident that those charged with complying with the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94judges, aided by prosecutors and defense attorneys\xe2\x80\x94could adequately protect defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Sixth Amendment rights without this Court\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary remedy.  In many cases, prosecutors could avoid an <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000),<em> </em>problem simply by alleging in the indictment<font b="1"> the facts necessary to reach the chosen Guidelines sentence.  Following our decision in <em>Apprendi</em>, and again after our decision in <em>Blakely</em>, the Department of Justice advised federal prosecutors to adopt practices that would enable them \xe2\x80\x9cto charge and prove to the jury facts that increase the statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x94for example, drug type and quantity for offenses under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 841.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Enhancing the specificity of indictments would be a simple matter, for example, in prosecutions under the federal drug statutes (such as Booker\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution).  The Government has already directed its prosecutors to allege facts such as the possession of a dangerous weapon or \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants\xe2\x80\x9d in the indictment and prove them to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, even in those trials in which the Guidelines require the finding of facts not alleged in the indictment, such factfinding by a judge is not unconstitutional <em>per se</em>.  To be clear, our holding in Parts I\xe2\x80\x93III, <em>ante,</em> at 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court), that <em>Blakely</em> applies to the Guidelines does not establish the \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibility of judicial factfinding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 46.  Instead, judicial factfinding to support an offense level determination or an enhancement is <em>only unconstitutional when that finding raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant</em>.<em> </em>This distinction is crucial to a proper understanding of why the Guidelines could easily function as they are currently written.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider, for instance, a case in which the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial sentencing range under the Guidelines is 130-to-162 months, calculated by combining a base offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of V.  See USSG ch. 5, pt. A (Table).  Depending upon the particular offense, the sentencing judge may use her discretion to select any sentence within this range, even if her selection relies upon factual determinations beyond the facts found by the jury.  If the defendant described above also possessed a firearm, the Guidelines would direct the judge to apply a two-level enhancement under \xc2\xa72D1.1, which would raise the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s total offense level from 28 to 30.  That, in turn, would raise the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s eligible sentencing range to 151-to-188 months.  That act of judicial factfinding would comply with the Guidelines and the Sixth Amendment so long as the sentencing judge then selected a sentence between 151-to-162 months\xe2\x80\x94the lower number (151) being the bottom of offense level 30 and the higher number (162) being the maximum sentence under level 28, which is the upper limit of the range supported by the jury findings alone.  This type of overlap between sentencing ranges is the rule, not the exception, in the Guidelines as currently constituted.  See 1 Practice Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines \xc2\xa76.01[B], p.\xc2\xa07 (P. Bamberger &amp; D. Gottlieb eds. 4th ed. 2003 Supp.) (noting that nearly all Guidelines ranges overlap and that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the overlap, the actual sentence imposed can theoretically be the same no matter which guideline range is chosen\xe2\x80\x9d).  Trial courts have developed considerable expertise in employing overlapping provisions in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary resolution of factual disputes, see \xc2\xa77.03[B][2], at 34 (2004 Supp.), and lower courts have shown themselves capable of distinguishing proper from improper applications of sentencing enhancements under <em>Blakely</em>,  see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mayfield</em>, 386 F.\xc2\xa03d 1301 (CA9 2004) (upholding a two-level enhancement for firearm possession from offense level 34 to 36 because the sentencing judge selected a sentence within the overlapping range between the two levels).  The interaction of these various Guidelines provisions demonstrates the fallacy in the assumption that judicial factfinding can never be constitutional under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the fact that the vast majority of applications of the Guidelines are constitutional is that \xe2\x80\x9cwe must determine likely intent, not by counting proceedings, but by evaluating the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement\xe2\x80\x9d on every imaginable case.  <em>Ante,</em> at 5 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  That approach ignores the lessons of our facial invalidity cases.  Those cases stress that this Court is ill suited to the task of drafting legislation and that, therefore, as a matter of respect for coordinate branches of Government, we ought to presume whenever possible that those charged with writing and implementing legislation will and can apply \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute consistently with the constitutional command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Time, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/index.html">385 U. S. 374</a>, 397 (1967).  Indeed, this Court has generally refused to consider \xe2\x80\x9cevery conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U. S. 249</a>, 256 (1953), because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html"></a><a href="/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 22 (1960).  The Government has already shown it can apply the Guidelines constitutionally even as written, and Congress is perfectly capable of redrafting the statute on its own.  Thus, there is no justification for the extreme judicial remedy of total invalidation of any part of the SRA or the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, it is indisputable that the vast majority of federal sentences under the Guidelines would have complied with the Sixth Amendment without the Court\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary remedy.  Under any reasonable reading of our precedents, in no way can it be said that the Guidelines are, or that any particular Guidelines provision is, facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Severability:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though a statute is not facially invalid, a holding that certain specific provisions are unconstitutional may make it necessary to invalidate the entire statute.

Our normal rule, however, is that the \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutionality of a part </em>of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions.  Unless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted <em>those provisions</em> which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Champlin Refining Co.</em> v. <em>Corporation Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Okla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/210/index.html">286 U.

See <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684 (1987).  Accordingly, severability analysis simply does not apply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority concludes that our constitutional holding requires the invalidation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and 3742(e).  The first of these sections uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d to make the substantive provisions of the Guidelines mandatory.  See <em>Mistretta </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 367 (1989).  The second authorizes <em>de novo </em>review of sentencing judges\xe2\x80\x99 applications of relevant Guidelines provisions.  Neither section is unconstitutional.  While these provisions can in certain cases, when combined with other statutory and Guidelines provisions, result in a violation of the Sixth Amendment, they are plainly constitutional on their faces.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than rely on traditional principles of facial invalidity or severability, the majority creates a new category of cases in which this Court may invalidate any part or parts of a statute (and add others) when it concludes that Congress would have preferred a modified system to administering the statute in compliance with the Constitution.  This is entirely new law.  Usually the Court first declares unconstitutional a particular provision of law, and only then does it inquire whether the remainder of the statute can be saved.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Time</em>, 468 U. S., at 652; <em>Alaska Airlines</em>, 480 U. S., at 684.  Review in this manner <em>limits </em>judicial power by <em>minimizing </em>the damage done to the statute by judicial fiat.  There is no case of which I am aware, however, in which this Court has used \xe2\x80\x9cseverability\xe2\x80\x9d analysis to do what the majority does today: determine that <em>some </em>unconstitutional applications of a statute, when viewed in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d legislative intent, justifies the invalidation of certain statutory sections in their entirety, their constitutionality notwithstanding, in order to save the parts of the statute the Court deemed most important.  The novelty of this remedial maneuver perhaps explains why <em>no party</em> or <em>amicus curiae </em>to this litigation has requested the remedy the Court now orders.  In addition, none of the federal courts that have addressed <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application to the Guidelines has concluded that striking down \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) is a proper solution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most importantly, the Court simply has no authority to invalidate legislation absent a showing that it is unconstitutional.  To paraphrase Chief Justice Marshall, an \xe2\x80\x9cact of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9crepugnant to the constitution\xe2\x80\x9d in order to be void.  <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  When a provision of a statute is unconstitutional, that provision is void, and the Judiciary is therefore not bound by it in a particular case.  Here, however, the provisions the majority has excised from the statute are perfectly valid: Congress could pass the identical statute tomorrow and it would be binding on this Court so long as it were administered in compliance with the Sixth Amendment.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Because the statute itself is not repugnant to the Constitution and can by its terms comport with the Sixth Amendment, the Court does not have the constitutional authority to invalidate it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The precedent on which the Court relies is scant indeed.  It can only point to cases in which a provision of law was unconstitutionally extended to or limited to a particular class; in such cases it is necessary either to invalidate the provision or to require the legislature to extend the benefit to an excluded class.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Given the sweeping nature of the remedy ordained today, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that it is proper to engage in an <em>ex ante</em> analysis of congressional intent in order to select in the first instance the statutory provisions to be struck down is contrary to the very purpose of engaging in severability analysis\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedy expands, rather than limits, judicial power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no justification for extending our severability cases to cover this situation.  The SRA and the Guidelines can be read\xe2\x80\x94and are being currently read\xe2\x80\x94in a way that complies with the Sixth Amendment.  If Congress wished to amend the statute to enact the majority\xe2\x80\x99s vision of how the Guidelines should operate, it would be perfectly free to do so.  There is<font b="1"> no need to devise a novel and<font b="1"> questionable method of invalidating statutory provisions that can be constitutionally applied.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than engage in a wholesale rewriting of the SRA, I would simply allow the Government to continue doing what it has done since this Court handed down <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x94prove any fact that is <em>required</em> to increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence under the Guidelines to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  As I have already discussed, a requirement of jury factfinding for certain issues can be implemented without difficulty in the vast majority of cases.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, this already appears to be the case.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Department of Justice already has instituted procedures which would protect the overwhelming majority of future cases from <em>Blakely</em> infirmity.  The Department of Justice has issued detailed guidance for every stage of the prosecution from indictment to final sentencing, including alleging facts that would support sentencing enhancements and requiring defendants to waive any potential <em>Blakely</em> rights in plea agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearings on <em>Blakely</em> 1\xe2\x80\x932.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Given this experience, I think the Court dramatically overstates the difficulty of implementing this solution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority advances five reasons why the remedy that is already in place will not work.  First, the majority points to the statutory text referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x9d in arguing that jury factfinding is impermissible.  While this text is no doubt evidence that Congress <em>contemplated</em> judicial factfinding, it does not demonstrate that Congress thought that judicial factfinding was so essential that, if forced to choose between a system including jury determinations of certain facts in certain cases on the one hand, and a system in which the Guidelines would cease to restrain the discretion of federal judges on the other, Congress would have selected the latter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a textual matter, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d can certainly be read to include a judge\xe2\x80\x99s selection of a sentence as supported by a jury verdict\xe2\x80\x94this reading is plausible either as a pure matter of statutory construction or under principles of constitutional avoidance.  Ordinarily, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/227/index.html">526 U. S. 227</a>, 239 (1999) (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Attorney General</em> v. <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/213/366/index.html">213 U. S. 366</a>, 408 (1909)).  This principle, which \xe2\x80\x9chas for so long been applied by this Court that it is beyond debate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U.

S. 173</a>, 191 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, reverses the ordinary presumption.  It interprets the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court \xe2\x80\xa6 shall consider\xe2\x80\x9d in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(a) (Supp. 2004) to mean: the judge shall consider and impose the appropriate sentence, but the judge shall not be constrained by any findings of a jury.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.) (interpreting the word \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the judge without the jury\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrow reading of the statutory text is unnecessary.  Even assuming that the word \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d should be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cjudge, and only the judge,\xe2\x80\x9d a requirement that certain enhancements be supported by jury verdicts leaves the ultimate sentencing decision exclusively within the judge\xe2\x80\x99s hands\xe2\x80\x94the judge, and the judge alone, would retain the discretion to sentence the defendant anywhere within the required Guidelines range and within overlapping Guidelines ranges when applicable.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  The judge would, no doubt, be limited by the findings of the jury in <em>certain cases</em>, but the fact that such a limitation would be required by the Sixth Amendment in those limited circumstances is not a reason to adopt such a constrained view of an Act of Congress.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In adopting its constrictive reading of \xe2\x80\x9ccourt,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority has manufactured a broader constitutional problem than is necessary, and has thereby made necessary the extraordinary remedy it has chosen.  I pause, however, to stress that it is not this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Guidelines must be applied consistently with the Sixth Amendment that has made the majority\xe2\x80\x99s remedy necessary.  Rather, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s miserly reading of the statutory language that results in \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional infirmities.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 11 (opinion of Breyer, J.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court argues that simply applying <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines would make \xe2\x80\x9creal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing more difficult.  While that is perhaps true in some cases, judges could always consider relevant conduct obtained from a presentence report pursuant to 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73661 (main ed.) and USSG \xc2\xa76A1.1 in selecting a sentence within a Guidelines range, and of course would be free to consider any such circumstances in cases in which the defendant pleads guilty and waives his <em>Blakely</em> rights.  Further, in many cases the Government could simply prove additional facts to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94as it has been doing in some cases since <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x94or, the court could use bifurcated proceedings in which the relevant conduct is proved to a jury after it has convicted the defendant of the underlying crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority is correct, however, that my preferred holding would undoubtedly affect \xe2\x80\x9creal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing in certain cases.  This is so because the goal of such sentencing\xe2\x80\x94increasing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence on the basis of conduct not proved at trial\xe2\x80\x94is contrary to the very core of <em>Apprendi</em>.  That certain applications of \xe2\x80\x9crelevant conduct\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing are unconstitutional should not come as a complete surprise to Congress: The House Report recognized that \xe2\x80\x9creal offense\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing could pose constitutional difficulties.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x931017, p. 98 (1984).  In reality, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about relevant conduct are nothing more than an objection to <em>Apprendi</em> itself, an objection that this Court rejected in Parts I\xe2\x80\x93III, <em>ante </em>(opinion of Stevens, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the Court does not explain how its proposed remedy will ensure that judges take real conduct into account.  While judges certainly may do so in their discretion under \xc2\xa73553(a), there is no indication as to how much or to what extent \xe2\x80\x9crelevant conduct\xe2\x80\x9d should matter under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s regime.  Nor is there any meaningful standard by which appellate courts may review a sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelevant conduct\xe2\x80\x9d determination\xe2\x80\x94only a general \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry that may discourage sentencing judges from considering such conduct altogether.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding thus may do just as much damage to real conduct sentencing as would simply<font b="1"> requiring the Government to follow the Guidelines consistent with the Sixth Amendment.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the majority argues that my remedy would make sentencing proceedings far too complex.  But of the very small number of cases in which a Guidelines sentence would implicate the Sixth Amendment, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937, most involve drug quantity determinations, firearm enhancements, and other factual findings that can readily be made by juries.  I am not blind to the fact that some cases, such as fraud prosecutions, would pose new problems for prosecutors and trial judges.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  In such cases, I am confident that federal trial judges, assisted by capable prosecutors and defense attorneys, could have devised appropriate procedures to impose the sentences the Guidelines envision in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.  We have always trusted juries to sort through complex facts in various areas of law.  This may not be the most efficient system imaginable, but the Constitution does not permit efficiency to be our primary concern.  See <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the majority assails my reliance on plea bargaining.  The Court claims that I cannot discount the effect that applying <em>Blakely</em> to the Guidelines would have on plea-bargained cases, since the specter of <em>Blakely</em> will affect those cases.  However, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision suffers from the same problem to a much greater degree.  Prior to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to strike the mandatory feature of the Guidelines, prosecutors and defendants alike could bargain from a position of reasonable confidence with respect to the sentencing range into which a defendant would likely fall.  The majority, however, has eliminated the certainty of expectations in the plea process.  And, unlike my proposed remedy, which would potentially affect only a fraction of plea bargains, the uncertainty resulting from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s regime change will infect the entire universe of guilty pleas which occur in 97% of all federal prosecutions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also argues that applying <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines would allow prosecutors to exercise \xe2\x80\x9ca power the Sentencing Act vested in judges,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 14 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.), by giving prosecutors the choice whether to \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d a particular fact.  Under the remedy I favor, however, judges would still be able to reject factually false plea agreements under USSG \xc2\xa76B1.2(a), and could still consider relevant information about the offense and the offender in every single case.  Judges could consider such characteristics as an aid in selecting the appropriate sentence within the Guidelines range authorized by the jury verdict, determining the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history level, reducing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, or justifying discretionary departures from the applicable Guidelines range.  The Court is therefore incorrect when it suggests that requiring a supporting jury verdict for certain enhancements in certain cases would place certain sentencing factors \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the reach of the judge entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 14 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the premise on which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument is based\xe2\x80\x94that the Guidelines as currently written prevent fact bargaining and therefore diminish prosecutorial power\xe2\x80\x94is probably not correct.  As one commentator has noted,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cprosecutors exercise nearly as much control when guidelines tie sentences to so-called \xe2\x80\x98real-offense\xe2\x80\x99 factors\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. One might reasonably assume those factors are outside of prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 control, but experience with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines suggests otherwise; when necessary, the litigants simply bargain about what facts will (and won\xe2\x80\x99t) form the basis for sentencing.  It seems to be an iron rule: guidelines sentencing empowers prosecutors, even where the guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 authors try to fight that tendency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stuntz, Plea Bargaining and Criminal Law\xe2\x80\x99s Disappearing Shadow, 117 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 2548, 2559\xe2\x80\x932560 (2004) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nNot only is fact bargaining quite common under the current system, it is also clear that prosecutors have substantial bargaining power.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  And surely, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s response to this dissent, <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.), a prosecutor who need only prove an enhancing fact by a preponderance of the evidence has more bargaining power than if required to prove the same fact beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority argues that my solution would require a different burden of proof for enhancements above the maximum authorized by the jury verdict and for reductions.  This is true because the requirement that guilt be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a constitutional mandate.  However, given the relatively few reductions available in the Guidelines and the availability of judicial discretion within the applicable range, this is unlikely to have more than a minimal effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I find unpersuasive the Court\xe2\x80\x99s objections to allowing Congress to decide in the first instance whether the Guidelines should be converted from a mandatory into a discretionary system.  Far more important than those objections is the overwhelming evidence that Congress has already considered, and unequivocally rejected, the regime that the Court endorses today.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s innovative approach to severability analysis when confronted with unconstitutional applications of a statute, its opinion is unpersuasive.  It assumes that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s only inquiry is to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide whether we would deviate less radically from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intended system (1) by superimposing the constitutional requirement announced today or (2) through elimination of some provisions of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion of Breyer, J.).

The Court cannot meet this burden<font b="1"> because Congress has already<font b="1"> considered and overwhelmingly rejected the system it enacts today.  In doing so, Congress revealed both an unmistakable preference for the certainty of a binding regime and a deep suspicion of judges\xe2\x80\x99 ability to reduce disparities in federal sentencing.

The elimination of sentencing disparity, which Congress determined was chiefly the result of a discretionary sentencing regime, was unquestionably Congress\xe2\x80\x99 principal aim.  See Feinberg, Federal Criminal Sentencing Reform: Congress and the United States Sentencing Commission, 28 Wake Forest L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 291, 295\xe2\x80\x93296 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe first and foremost goal of the sentencing reform effort was to alleviate the perceived problem of federal criminal sentencing disparity\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Quite frankly, all other considerations were secondary\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Revisited, 2 Fed. Sentencing Rptr. 180 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn seeking \xe2\x80\x98greater fairness,\xe2\x80\x99 Congress, acting in bipartisan fashion, intended to respond to complaints of unreasonable disparity in sentencing\xe2\x80\x94that is, complaints that differences among sentences reflected not simply</em> different offense conduct or different offender history, but the fact that <em>different judges</em> imposed the sentences\xe2\x80\x9d (emphases added)).  As Senator Hatch, a central participant in the reform effort, has explained: \xe2\x80\x9cThe discretion that Congress had conferred for so long upon the judiciary and the parole authorities was <em>at the heart of sentencing disparity</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Role of Congress in Sentencing: The United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Sentences, and the Search for a Certain and Effective Sentencing System, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 185, 187 (1993) (hereinafter Hatch) (emphasis added).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, Congress explicitly rejected as a model for reform the various proposals for advisory guidelines that had been introduced in past Congresses.  One example of such legislation was the bill introduced in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and McClellan, S. 1437, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Nov. 15, 1977) (hereinafter S. 1437), which allowed judges to impose sentences based on the characteristics of the individual defendant and granted judges substantial discretion to depart from recommended guidelines sentences.  See Stith &amp; Koh, The Politics of Sentencing Reform: The Legislative History of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 28 Wake Forest L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 223, 238 (1993) (hereinafter Stith &amp; Koh).  That bill never became law and was refined several times between 1977 and 1984: Each of those refinements made the regime more, not less, restrictive on trial judges\xe2\x80\x99 discretion in sentencing.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p align="left"><em> Passage of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 preference for binding guidelines was evident in the debate over passage of the SRA itself, which was predicated entirely on the move from a discretionary guidelines system to the mandatory system the Court strikes down today.  The SRA was the product of competing versions of sentencing reform legislation: the House bill, H.\xc2\xa0R. 6012, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., authorized the creation of discretionary guidelines whereas the Senate bill, S.\xc2\xa0668, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., provided for binding guidelines and de novo </em>appellate review.

That text <em>requires </em>the sentencing judge to impose the sentence dictated by the Guidelines (\xe2\x80\x9cthe court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range\xe2\x80\x9d provided in the Guidelines unless there is a circumstance \xe2\x80\x9cnot adequately taken into consideration by the\xe2\x80\x9d Guidelines), and \xc2\xa73742(e) gives \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) teeth by instructing judges that any sentence outside of the Guidelines range without adequate explanation will be overturned on appeal.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen regime was carefully designed to produce uniform compliance with the Guidelines.  Congress surely would not have taken the pains to create such a regime had it found the Court\xe2\x80\x99s system of discretionary guidelines acceptable <em>in any way</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The accompanying Senate Report and floor debate make plain what should be obvious from the structure of the statute: Congress refused to accept the discretionary system that<font b="1"> the Court implausibly deems most consistent with congressional intent.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In other words, given the choice between the statute created by the Court today or a clean slate on which to write a wholly different law, Congress undoubtedly would have selected the latter.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left"><em>Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Method of Reducing Disparities:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The notion that Congress had any confidence that judges</em> would reduce sentencing disparities by considering relevant conduct\xe2\x80\x94an idea that is championed by the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of Breyer, J.)\xe2\x80\x94either ignores or misreads the political environment in which the SRA passed.  It is true that the SRA instructs sentencing judges to consider real offense and offender characteristics, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7994 (main ed. and Supp. 2004), but Congress only wanted judges to consider those characteristics within the limits of a mandatory system.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The Senate Report on which the Court relies, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, clearly concluded that the existence of sentencing disparities \xe2\x80\x9ccan be traced directly to the unfettered discretion the law confers on those judges \xe2\x80\xa6 responsible for imposing and implementing the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p.\xc2\xa038 (1983).  Even in a system in which judges could not impose sentences based on \xe2\x80\x9crelevant conduct\xe2\x80\x9d determinations (absent a plea agreement or supporting jury findings), sentences would still be every bit as certain and uniform as in the status quo\xe2\x80\x94at most, the process for imposing those sentences would be more complex.  The same can hardly be said of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s chosen system, in which <em>all</em> federal sentencing judges, in <em>all</em> cases, regain the unconstrained discretion Congress eliminated in 1984.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Congress envisioned a sentencing judge as the centerpiece of its effort to reduce disparities is remarkable given the context of the broader legislative debate about what entity would be responsible for drafting the Guidelines under the SRA.  The House version of the bill preferred the Guidelines to be written by the Judicial Conference of the United States\xe2\x80\x94the House Report accompanying that bill argued that judges had vast experience in sentencing and would best be able to craft a system capable of providing sentences based on real conduct without excessive disparity.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x931017, at 93\xe2\x80\x9394.  Those in the Senate majority, however, favored an independent commission.  They did so, whether rightly or wrongly, based on a belief that federal judges could not be trusted to impose fair and uniform sentences.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 130 Cong. Rec. 976 (1984) (remarks of Sen. Laxalt) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe present problem with disparity in sentencing \xe2\x80\xa6 stems precisely from the failure of [f]ederal judges\xe2\x80\x94individually and collectively\xe2\x80\x94to sentence similarly situated defendants in a consistent, reasonable manner.  There is little reason to believe that judges will now begin to do what they have failed to do in the past\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, at the end of the debate, the few remaining Members in the minority recognized that the battle to empower judges with more discretion had been lost.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 973 (remarks of Sen. Mathias) (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proponents of the bill \xe2\x80\xa6 argue in essence that judges cannot be trusted.  You cannot trust a judge \xe2\x80\xa6 you must not trust a judge\xe2\x80\x9d).  I find it impossible to believe that a Congress in which these sentiments prevailed would have ever approved of the discretionary sentencing regime the Court enacts today.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Congressional Activity Since 1984:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has not wavered in its commitment to a binding system of Sentencing Guidelines.  In fact, Congress has rejected each and every attempt to loosen the rigidity of the Guidelines or vest judges with more sentencing options.  See Hatch 189 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn ensuing years, Congress would maintain its adherence to the concept of binding guidelines by consistently rejecting efforts to make the guidelines more discretionary\xe2\x80\x9d).  Most recently, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 passage of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. 108\xe2\x80\x9321, 117 Stat. 650, reinforced the mandatory nature of the Guidelines by expanding de novo </em>review of sentences to include all departures from the Guidelines and by directing the Commission to limit the number of available departures.  The majority admits that its holding has made the PROTECT Act irrelevant.  See <em>ante,</em> at 18 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (admitting that after the Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedy, the PROTECT Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions \xe2\x80\x9chave ceased to be relevant\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even a cursory reading of the legislative history of the PROTECT Act reveals the absurdity of the claim that Congress would find acceptable, under any circumstances, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s restoration of judicial discretion through the facial invalidation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and 3742(e).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In sum, despite Congress\xe2\x80\x99 unequivocal demand that the Guidelines operate as a binding system, and in the name of avoiding any reduction in the power of the sentencing judge vis-\xc5\x95-vis the jury (a subject to which Congress did not speak), the majority has erased the heart of the SRA and ignored in their entirety all of the Legislative Branch\xe2\x80\x99s post-enactment expressions of how the Guidelines are supposed to operate.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this overwhelming history is that retaining a mandatory Guidelines system \xe2\x80\x9cis not a choice that remains open\xe2\x80\x9d given our holding that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the Guidelines.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22. This argument\xe2\x80\x94essentially, that the <em>Apprendi </em>rule makes determinate sentencing unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94has been advanced repeatedly since <em>Apprendi</em>.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 530 U. S., at 549\xe2\x80\x93554 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at ___  (slip op., at 1) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at ___  (slip op., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  These prophecies were self fulfilling.  It is not <em>Apprendi</em> that has brought an end to determinate sentencing.  This Court clearly had the power to adopt a remedy that both complied with the Sixth Amendment and also preserved a determinate sentencing regime in which judges make regular factual determinations regarding a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  It has chosen instead to exaggerate the constitutional problem and to expand the scope of judicial invalidation far beyond that which is even arguably necessary. Our holding that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the Sentencing Guidelines did not dictate the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented remedy.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a matter of policy, the differences between the regime enacted by Congress and the system the Court has chosen are stark.  Were there any doubts about whether Congress would have preferred the majority\xe2\x80\x99s solution, these are sufficient to dispel them.  First, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 stated goal of uniformity is eliminated by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s remedy.  True, judges must still <em>consider </em>the sentencing range contained in the Guidelines, but that range is now nothing more than a suggestion that may or may not be persuasive to a judge when weighed against the numerous other considerations listed in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(a).  The result is certain to be a return to the same type of sentencing disparities Congress sought to eliminate in 1984.  Prior to the PROTECT Act, rates of departure from the applicable Guidelines sentence (via upward or downward departure) varied considerably depending upon the Circuit in which one was sentenced.  See Sourcebook 53\xe2\x80\x9355 (Table 26) (showing that 76.6% of sentences in the Fourth Circuit were within the applicable Guidelines range, whereas only 48.8% of sentences in the Ninth Circuit fell within the range).  Those disparities will undoubtedly increase in a discretionary system in which the Guidelines are but one factor a judge must consider in sentencing a defendant within a broad statutory range.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Court has neglected to provide a critical procedural protection that existed prior to the enactment of a binding Guidelines system.  Before the SRA, the sentencing judge had the discretion to impose a sentence that designated a minimum term \xe2\x80\x9cat the expiration of which the prisoner shall become eligible for parole.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74205(b) (1982 ed.) (repealed by Pub. L. 98\xe2\x80\x93473, \xc2\xa7218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 2027).  Sentencing judges had the discretion to reduce a minimum term of imprisonment upon the recommendation of the Bureau of Prisons.  \xc2\xa74205(g) (1982 ed.).  Through these provisions and others, see generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74201\xe2\x80\x934215, all of which were effectively repealed in 1984, it was the Parole Commission\xe2\x80\x94not the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x94that was ultimately responsible for determining the length of each defendant\xe2\x80\x99s real sentence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, at 38.  Prior to the Guidelines regime, the Parole Commission was designed to reduce sentencing disparities and to provide a check for defendants who had received excessive sentences.  Today, the Court reenacts the discretionary Guidelines system that once existed without providing this crucial safety net.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other concerns are likely to arise.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 demand in the PROTECT Act that departures from the Guidelines be closely regulated and monitored is eviscerated\xe2\x80\x94for there can be no \xe2\x80\x9cdeparture\xe2\x80\x9d from a mere suggestion.  How will a judge go about determining how much deference to give to the applicable Guidelines range?  How will a court of appeals review for reasonableness a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that the need for \xe2\x80\x9cjust punishment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadequate deterrence to criminal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d simply outweighs the considerations contemplated by the Sentencing Commission?  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B) (main ed.).  What if a sentencing judge determines that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s need for \xe2\x80\x9ceducational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(D), requires disregarding the stiff Guidelines range Congress presumably preferred?  These questions will arise in every case in the federal system under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s system.  Regrettably, these are exactly the sort of questions Congress hoped that sentencing judges would not ask after the SRA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consequences of such a drastic change\xe2\x80\x94unaided by the usual processes of legislative deliberation\xe2\x80\x94are likely to be sweeping.  For example, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessarily broad remedy sends every federal sentence back to the drawing board, or at least into the novel review for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of whether those individuals\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights were violated.  It is highly unlikely that the mere application of \xe2\x80\x9cprudential doctrines\xe2\x80\x9d will mitigate the consequences of such a gratuitous change.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s remedy was not the inevitable result of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the Guidelines.  Neither <em>Apprendi</em>, nor <em>Blakely</em>, nor these cases made determinate sentencing unconstitutional.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Merely requiring all applications of the Guidelines to comply with the Sixth Amendment would have allowed judges to distinguish harmless error from error requiring correction, would have required no more complicated procedures than the procedural regime the majority enacts today, and, ultimately, would have left most sentences intact.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike a rule that would merely<font b="1"> require judges and prosecutors to comply with the Sixth Amendment, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s systematic overhaul turns the entire system on its head <em>in every case</em>, and, in so doing, runs contrary to the central purpose that motivated Congress to act in the first instance.  Moreover, by repealing the right to a determinate sentence that<font b="1"> Congress established in the SRA, the Court has effectively eliminated the very constitutional right <em>Apprendi </em>sought to vindicate.  No judicial remedy is proper if it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot commensurate with the constitutional violation to be repaired.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hills</em> v. <em>Gautreaux</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/284/index.html">425 U. S. 284</a>, 294 (1976).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s system fails that test, frustrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 principal goal in enacting the SRA, and violates the tradition of judicial restraint that has heretofore limited<font b="1"> our power to overturn validly enacted statutes.</font></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We have, on occasion, debated the proper interpretation of various precedents concerning facial challenges to statutes.

See Stern 82.  However, these cases simply hold that a statute that may apply both to situations within the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers and also to situations that exceed such powers, the Court will sustain the statute only if it can be validly limited to the former situations, and will strike it down if it cannot be so limited.

See <em>post,</em> at 11.  While I understand the intuitive appeal of Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 dissent, I do not believe that our cases  support this approach.  In any event, given the vast number of constitutional applications, see <em>supra</em>, at 6, it is clear that Congress would, as Justice Thomas concludes, prefer that the Guidelines not be invalidated.

That is why I find the Court\xe2\x80\x99s professed disagreement with this proposition unpersuasive.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  Surely Congress could reenact the identical substantive provisions if the reenactment included a clarifying provision stating that the word \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d shall not be construed to prohibit a judge from requiring jury factfinding when necessary to comply with the Sixth Amendment.  Indeed, because in my view such a construction of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d is appropriate in any event, see <em>infra, </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9317, there would be no need to include the clarifying provision to save the statute.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left"> In <em>Sloan</em> v. <em>Lemon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/825/index.html"></a><a href="/us/413/825/index.html">413 U.

The Court did not, as the dissent would have us do, strike down particular parts of the statute.  In <em>Welsh</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/333/index.html">398 U.

None of these cases stands for the sweeping proposition that where parts of a statute are invalid in certain applications, the Court may opine as to whether Congress would prefer facial invalidation of some, but not all, of the provisions necessary to the constitutional violation.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Commissioners went on to note that, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if <em>Blakely </em>is found to apply to the federal guidelines, the waters are not as choppy as some would make them out to be.

Rather than applying the usual presumption in favor of severability, and leaving the Guidelines standing insofar as they may be applied without any constitutional problem, the remedial majority converts the Guidelines from a mandatory system to a discretionary one.

Booker challenges Guidelines enhancements that, based on factfinding by a judge alone, raised his sentence above the range legally mandated for his base offense level, determined by reference to the jury verdict.  In effect, he contends that the Guidelines supporting the enhancements, and the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) that makes the Guidelines enhancements mandatory, were unconstitutionally applied to him.  (Fanfan makes no similar contention, as he seeks to uphold the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of the Guidelines.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A provision of the SRA, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), commands that the court \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4),\xe2\x80\x9d which in turn refers to the Guidelines.  (Emphasis added.)  The Court reasons that invalidating \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) would render the Guidelines nonbinding and therefore constitutional.  Hence, it concludes, \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) must fall on its face.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s excision of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) is at once too narrow and too broad.  It is too narrow in that it focuses only on \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), when Booker\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional sentence enhancements stemmed not from \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) alone, but from the combination of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and individual Guidelines.  Specifically, in Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court increased the base offense level[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] under these Guidelines[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]: USSG \xc2\xa71B1.3(a)(2), which instructs that the base offense level shall (for certain offenses) take into account all acts \xe2\x80\x9cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\xe2\x80\x9d; \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(2), which sets the offense level for 500g to 1.5kg of cocaine base at 36; and \xc2\xa73C1.1, which provides for a two-level increase in the offense level for obstruction of justice.  The court also implicitly applied \xc2\xa71B1.1, which provides general instructions for applying the Guidelines, including determining the base offense level and applying appropriate adjustments; \xc2\xa71B1.11(b)(2), which requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied in its entirety\xe2\x80\x9d; \xc2\xa76A1.3(b) p.\xc2\xa0s.,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencing hearing in accordance with Rule 32(c)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P.\xe2\x80\x9d; and Rule 32(c)(1),[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] which in turn provided:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAt the sentencing hearing, the court \xe2\x80\xa6 must rule on any unresolved objections to the presentence report\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. For each matter controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into account in, or will not affect, sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3553(b)(1), the listed Guidelines and policy statement, and Rule 32(c)(1) are unconstitutional as applied to Booker.  Under their authority, the judge, rather than the jury, found the facts necessary to increase Booker\xe2\x80\x99s offense level pursuant to the listed provisions; the judge found those facts by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt; and, on the basis of these findings, the judge imposed a sentence above the maximum legally permitted by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings.  Thus, in Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case, the concerted action of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) <em>and </em>the operative Guidelines <em>and</em> the relevant Rule of Criminal Procedure resulted in unconstitutional judicial factfinding.  The majority cannot pinpoint \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) alone as the source of the violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s remedy is far too broad.  We have before us only a single unconstitutional application of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (and accompanying parts of the sentencing scheme).  In such a case, facial invalidation is unprecedented.  It is particularly inappropriate here, where it is evident that \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) is entirely constitutional in numerous other applications.  Fanfan\xe2\x80\x99s case is an example: The judge applied the Guidelines to the extent supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings.  This application of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) was constitutional.  To take another example, when the Government seeks a sentence within the Guidelines range supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, applying \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) to restrict the judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to that Guidelines range is constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3553(b)(1) is also constitutional when the Government seeks a sentence above the Guidelines range supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, but proves the facts supporting the enhancements to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  Section 3553(b)(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court shall <em>impose</em> a sentence of the kind, and within the range,\xe2\x80\x9d set by the Guidelines. (Emphasis added.)  It says nothing, however, about the procedures the court must employ to determine the sentence it ultimately \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  It says nothing about whether, before imposing a sentence, the court may submit sentence-enhancing facts to the jury; and it says nothing about the standard of proof.  Because it does not address at all the procedures for Guidelines sentencing proceedings, \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) comfortably accommodates cases in which a court determines a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range by way of jury factfinding or admissions rather than judicial factfinding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution does not prohibit what \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) accomplishes\xe2\x80\x94binding district courts to the Guidelines.  It prohibits allowing a judge alone to make a finding that raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.  Many applications of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) suffer from no such vice.  Yet the majority, by facially invalidating the statute, also invalidates these unobjectionable applications of the statute and thereby ignores the longstanding distinction between as-applied and facial challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as there is no reason to strike \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) on its face, there is likewise no basis for striking any Guideline at issue here on its face.  Respondents have not established that USSG \xc2\xa71B1.3(a)(2), \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(2), \xc2\xa73C1.1, or \xc2\xa71B1.11(b)(2) is invalid in all its applications, as <em>Salerno</em> requires.  To the contrary, numerous applications of these provisions are valid.  Such applications include cases in which the defendant admits the relevant facts or the jury finds the relevant facts beyond a reasonable doubt.  Like \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.3(a)(2), 2D1.1(c)(2), 3C1.1, and 1B1.11(b)(2) say nothing about who must find the facts supporting enhancements, or what standard of proof the prosecution must satisfy.  They simply attach effects to certain facts; they do not prescribe procedures for determining those facts.  Even \xc2\xa71B1.1, which provides instructions for applying the Guidelines, directs an order in which the various provisions are to be applied (\xe2\x80\x9c[d]etermine the base offense level,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71B1.1(b), then \xe2\x80\x9c[a]pply the adjustments,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71B1.1(c)), but says nothing about the specific procedures a sentencing court may employ in determining the base offense level and applying adjustments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, there is no basis for facially invalidating \xc2\xa76A1.3 or Rule 32(c)(1).  To be sure, \xc2\xa76A1.3(b) and Rule 32(c)(1) prescribe procedure: They require the judge, acting alone, to resolve factual disputes.  When Booker was sentenced, \xc2\xa76A1.3(b) provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencing hearing in accordance with Rule 32(c)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P.\xe2\x80\x9d  At the time, the relevant portions of Rule\xc2\xa032(c)(1) provided:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAt the sentencing hearing, the court \xe2\x80\xa6 must <em>rule</em> on any unresolved objections to the presentence report\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. For each matter controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into account in, or will not affect, sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe natural meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe court \xe2\x80\xa6 must rule\xe2\x80\x9d is that the <em>judge</em>, without the jury, must resolve factual disputes as necessary.  This Rule of Criminal Procedure, as applied at Booker\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing hearing, required the judge to make findings that increased Booker\xe2\x80\x99s offense level beyond the Guidelines range authorized by the jury.  The application of  the Rule to Booker therefore was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, the Rule has other valid applications.  For example, the Rule is valid when it requires the sentencing judge, without a jury, to resolve a factual dispute in order to decide where within the jury-authorized Guidelines range a defendant should be sentenced.  The Rule is equally valid when it requires the judge to resolve a factual dispute in order to support a downward adjustment to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offense level.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the significant number of valid applications of all portions of the current sentencing scheme, we should not facially invalidate any particular section of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Guidelines, or the SRA.  Instead, we should invalidate only the application to Booker, at his previous sentencing hearing, of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1); USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.3(a)(2), 2D1.1(c)(2), 3C1.1, 1B1.1, 1B1.11(b)(2), and 6A1.3(b); and Rule 32(c)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Invalidating \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), the Guidelines listed above, and Rule 32(c)(1) <em>as applied</em> to Booker by the District Court leaves the question whether the scheme\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional application to Booker can be severed from the scheme\xe2\x80\x99s many other constitutional applications to defendants like Fanfan.  Severability doctrine is grounded in a presumption that Congress intends statutes to have effect to the full extent the Constitution allows.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Time, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/641/index.html">468 U.

The severability issue may arise when a court strikes either a provision of a statute or an application of a provision.  Severability of provisions is perhaps more visible than severability of applications in our case law.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684\xe2\x80\x93697 (1987) (severing unconstitutional legislative veto provision from other provisions).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However, severability questions arise from unconstitutional applications of statutes as well.  Congress often expressly provides for severance of unconstitutional applications.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  This Court has acknowledged the severability of applications in striking down some applications of a statute while leaving others standing.  In <em>Brockett,</em> 472 U. S., at 504\xe2\x80\x93507, the Court invalidated a state moral nuisance statute only insofar as it reached constitutionally protected materials, relying on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s severability clause.  And in <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1985), the Court considered a state statute that authorized police to use \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all the necessary means to effect [an] arrest.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court held the statute unconstitutional insofar as it allowed the use of deadly force against an unarmed, nondangerous suspect; but it declined to invalidate the statute on its face, specifically noting that the statute could be applied constitutionally in other circumstances.  <em>Id.,</em> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In <em>Brockett</em> and <em>Garner</em>, then, the Court recognized that the unconstitutional applications of the statutes were severable from the constitutional applications.  The Court fashioned the remedy narrowly, in keeping with the usual presumption of severability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I thus disagree with Justice Stevens that severability analysis does not apply.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11, and n.\xc2\xa06 (opinion dissenting in part).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  I acknowledge that, as a general matter, the Court often disposes of as-applied challenges to a statute by simply invalidating particular applications of the statute, without saying anything at all about severability.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Grace,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/171/index.html">461 U. S. 171</a>, 183 (1983) (concluding that statute that prohibited carrying banners in the United States Supreme Court Building and on its grounds was unconstitutional as applied to the sidewalks surrounding the building); <em>Edenfield</em> v. <em>Fane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/761/index.html">507 U. S. 761</a>, 763 (1993) (striking down a solicitation ban on certified public accountants as applied \xe2\x80\x9cin the business context\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Treasury Employees,</em> 513 U. S., at 501\xe2\x80\x93503 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., dissenting) (expressing view that injunction against honoraria ban should be tailored to unconstitutional applications).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such decisions (in which the Court is silent as to applications not before it) might be viewed as having conducted an implicit severability analysis.  See <em>id.,</em> at 485\xe2\x80\x93489 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  A better view is that the parties in those cases could have raised the issue of severability, but did not bother, because (as is often the case) there was no arguable reason to defeat the presumption of severability.  The unconstitutional applications of the statute were fully independent of and severable from the remaining constitutional applications.  Here, the question is squarely presented: the parties press it, and there is extraordinary reason to clarify the remedy, namely, that our decision potentially affects every sentencing by the federal courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I therefore proceed to the severability question\xe2\x80\x94whether the unconstitutional application of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1); USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.3, 2D1.1(c)(2), 3C1.1, 1B1.1, 1B1.11(b)(2), and 6A1.3; and Rule 32(c)(1) to Booker is severable from the constitutional applications of these provisions.  That is, even though we have invalidated the application of these provisions to Booker, may other defendants be sentenced pursuant to them?  We presume that the unconstitutional application is severable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Regan, </em>468 U. S., at 653.  This presumption is a manifestation of <em>Salerno</em>\xe2\x80\x99s general rule that we should not strike a statute on its face unless it is invalid in all its applications.  Unless the Legislature clearly would not have enacted the constitutional applications independently of the unconstitutional application, the Court leaves the constitutional applications standing.  468 U. S., at 653.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the presumption of severability has not been overcome.  In light of the significant number of constitutional applications of the scheme, it is far from clear that Congress would not have passed the SRA or allowed Rule 32 to take effect, or that the Commission would not have promulgated the particular Guidelines at issue, had either body known that the application of the scheme to Booker was unconstitutional.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9310 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part).  As noted above, many applications of the Guidelines are constitutional: The defendant may admit the necessary facts; the Government may not seek enhancements beyond the offense level supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict; the judge may find facts supporting an enhancement but (taking advantage of the overlap in Guidelines ranges) sentence the defendant within the jury-authorized range; or the jury may find the necessary facts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certainly it is not obvious that Congress would have preferred the entirely discretionary system that the majority fashions.  The text and structure of the SRA show that Congress meant the Guidelines to bind judges.  One of the purposes of the Commission, as set forth in the SRA, was to</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cprovide <em>certainty</em> and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, <em>avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities</em> among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(b)(1)(B) (emphases added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAccordingly, Congress made the Guidelines mandatory and closely circumscribed courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to depart from the Guidelines range.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004).  Congress also limited appellate review of sentences imposed pursuant to the Guidelines to instances in which the sentence was (1) in violation of law, (2) a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, (3) outside the applicable Guidelines range, or (4) in the absence of an applicable Guideline, plainly unreasonable.  \xc2\xa73742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004).  Striking down \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and the Guidelines only as applied to Booker (and other defendants who have received unconstitutional enhancements) would leave in place the essential framework of the mandatory system Congress created.  Applying the Guidelines in a constitutional fashion affords some uniformity; total discretion, none.  To suggest, as Justice Breyer does, that a discretionary system would do otherwise, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311, 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (opinion of the Court), either supposes that the system is discretionary in name only or overlooks the very nature of discretion.  Either assumption is implausible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority says that retaining the SRA and the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cengraft[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a jury trial requirement onto the sentencing scheme.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.).  I am, of course, aware that, though severability analysis may proceed \xe2\x80\x9cby striking out or disregarding words [or, here, applications] that are in the [challenged] section,\xe2\x80\x9d it may not proceed \xe2\x80\x9cby inserting [applications] that are not now there\xe2\x80\x9d; that would constitute legislation beyond our judicial power.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reese,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/214/index.html">92 U. S. 214</a>, 221 (1876).  By allowing jury factfinding in some cases, however, we are no more \xe2\x80\x9cengrafting\xe2\x80\x9d a new requirement onto the statute than we do every time we invalidate a statute in some of the applications that the statute, on its face, appears to authorize.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Brockett</em> v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/index.html"></a><a href="/us/472/491/index.html">472 U. S. 491</a> (1985)<em>.  </em>I therefore do not find the \xe2\x80\x9cengraftment\xe2\x80\x9d label helpful as a means of judging the correctness of our severability analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granted, part of the severability inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the statute [as severed] will function in a <em>manner</em> consistent with the intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.,</em> 480 U. S., at 685.  Applying the Guidelines constitutionally (for instance, when admissions or jury findings support all upward enhancements) might seem at first glance to violate this principle.  But so would the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposal of applying the Guidelines as a whole to some defendants, but not others.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s solution violates it even more clearly by creating a system that eliminates the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.  In the end, nothing except the Guidelines as written will function in a manner perfectly consistent with the intent of Congress, and the Guidelines as written are unconstitutional in some applications.  While all of the remedial possibilities are thus, in a sense, second-best, the solution Justice Stevens and I would adopt does the least violence to the statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would hold that \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), the provisions of the Guidelines discussed above, and Rule 32(c)(1) are unconstitutional as applied to Booker, but that the Government has not overcome the presumption of severability.  Accordingly, the unconstitutional application of the scheme in Booker\xe2\x80\x99s case is severable from the constitutional applications of the same scheme to other defendants.  I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because the majority invalidates 18 U.

I continue to disagree with the constitutional analysis the Court set forth in <em>Apprendi </em>and in <em>Blakely.  </em>But even were I to accept that analysis as valid, I would disagree with the way in which the Court applies it here.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Justice Kennedy, and I have previously explained at length why we cannot accept the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional analysis.

See<em> Blakely</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 10) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting);<em> Apprendi, supra</em>, at 525\xe2\x80\x93528 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today illustrates the historical mistake upon which its conclusions rest.  The Court reiterates its view that the right of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trial by jury has been understood to require\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a jury trial for determination of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>the truth of every accusation</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 14 (opinion of Stevens,\xc2\xa0J.) (quoting <em>Apprendi, supra</em>, at 477) (emphasis in original).  This claim makes historical sense insofar as an \xe2\x80\x9c<em>accusation</em>\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses each factual <em>element </em>of the crime of which a defendant is accused.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/506/index.html">515 U. S. 506</a>, 509\xe2\x80\x93510, 522\xe2\x80\x93523 (1995).  But the key question here is whether that word also encompasses <em>sentencing facts</em>\xe2\x80\x94facts about the offender (say, recidivism) or about the way in which the offender committed the crime (say, the seriousness of the injury or the amount stolen) that help a sentencing judge determine a convicted offender\xe2\x80\x99s specific sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0History does not support a \xe2\x80\x9cright to jury trial\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to sentencing facts.  Traditionally, the law has distinguished between facts that are elements of crimes and facts that are relevant only to sentencing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 228 (1998); <em>Witte </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/389/index.html">515 U. S. 389</a>, 399 (1995); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/148/index.html">519 U. S. 148</a>, 154 (1997) (<em>per curiam</em>)<em>;</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dunnigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/87/index.html">507 U. S. 87</a>, 97 (1993); <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 396 (1989).  Traditionally, federal law has looked to judges, not to juries, to resolve disputes about sentencing facts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa032(a).  Traditionally, those familiar with the criminal justice system have found separate, postconviction <em>judge</em>-run sentencing procedures sensible given the difficulty of obtaining relevant sentencing information before the moment of conviction.  They have found those proceedings practical given the impracticality of the alternatives, say, two-stage (guilt, sentence) jury procedures.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Judicial Conference of the United States, Committee on Defender Services, Subcommittee on Federal Death Penalty Cases, Federal Death Penalty Cases: Recommendations Concerning the Cost and Quality of Defense Representation 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (May 1998).  And, despite the absence of jury determinations, they have found those proceedings fair as long as the convicted offender has the opportunity to contest a claimed fact before the judge, and as long as the sentence falls within the maximum of the range that a congressional statute specifically sets forth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The administrative rules at issue here, Federal Sentencing Guidelines, focus on <em>sentencing facts.  </em>They circumscribe a federal judge\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing discretion in respect to such facts, but in doing so, they do not change the nature of those facts.  The sentencing courts continue to use those facts, not to convict a person of a crime as a statute defines it, but to help determine an appropriate punishment.  Thus, the Court cannot ground today\xe2\x80\x99s holding in a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional tradition assimilated from the common law\xe2\x80\x9d or in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Magna Carta.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 14 (opinion of Stevens,\xc2\xa0J.).  It cannot look to the Framers for support, for they, too, enacted criminal statutes with indeterminate sentences, revealing their own understanding and acceptance of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding role at sentencing.  See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112\xe2\x80\x93118.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, it is difficult for the Court to find historical support other than in two recent cases, <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x94cases that we, like lower courts, read not as confirming, but as confounding a pre-<em>Apprendi</em>,<em> </em>pre-<em>Blakely </em>legal tradition that stretches back a century or more.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/index.html">337 U. S. 241</a>, 246 (1949); cf., <em>e.g.</em>, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d 508, 514 (CA7 2004) (case below) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Blakely</em> redefined \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ameline</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d 967, 973 (CA9 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Blakely</em> court worked a sea change in the body of sentencing law\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pineiro</em>, 377 F.\xc2\xa03d 464, 468\xe2\x80\x93469 (CA5 2004) (same); see also<em> United States </em>v. <em>Penaranda</em>, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d 238, 243, n.\xc2\xa05 (CA2 2004) (same, collecting cases).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, applied in the federal context of <em>mandatory</em> guidelines, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment decision would risk unwieldy trials, a two-tier jury system, a return to judicial sentencing discretion, or the replacement of sentencing ranges with specific mandatory sentences.  Cf.<em> Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x9313) (Breyer,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  The decision would pose a serious obstacle to congressional efforts to create a sentencing law that would mandate more similar treatment of like offenders, that would thereby diminish sentencing disparity, and that would consequently help to overcome irrational discrimination (including racial discrimination) in sentencing.  See <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 3) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  These consequences would seem perverse when viewed through the lens of a Constitution that seeks a fair criminal process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment decisions\xe2\x80\x94<em>Apprendi,</em> <em>Blakely,</em> and today\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94deprive Congress and state legislatures of authority that is constitutionally theirs.  Cf. <em>Blakely, supra</em>, at ___ (Kennedy,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting);<em> Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 544\xe2\x80\x93545 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting); <em>id</em>., at 560\xe2\x80\x93564 (Breyer,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  The \xe2\x80\x9csentencing function long has been a peculiarly shared responsibility among the Branches of Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta, supra</em>, at 390.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 share of this joint responsibility has long included not only the power to define crimes (by enacting statutes setting forth their factual elements) but also the power to specify sentences, whether by setting forth a range of individual-crime-related sentences (say, 0 to 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for bank robbery) or by identifying sentencing factors that permit or require a judge to impose higher or lower sentences in particular circumstances.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Almendarez-Torres</em>, 523 U. S., at 228; <em>McMillan</em>, 477 U. S., at 85.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This last mentioned power is not absolute.  As the Court suggested in <em>McMillan</em>, confirmed in <em>Almendarez-Torres</em>, and recognized but rejected in <em>Blakely</em>, one might read the Sixth Amendment as permitting \xe2\x80\x9clegislatures\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish legally essential [judge-determined] sentencing factors <em>within </em>[say, due process] <em>limits</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Blakely, supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 11) (emphasis in original); cf. <em>Almendarez-Torres</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228 (distinguishing between \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfactors relevant only to \xe2\x80\xa6 sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d and noting that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithin limits, the question of which factors are which is normally a matter for Congress\xe2\x80\x9d) (citation omitted); <em>McMillan, supra</em>, at 88 (upholding a Pennsylvania statute in part because it gave \xe2\x80\x9cno impression of having been tailored to permit the [sentencing factor] finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the power does give Congress a degree of freedom (within constraints of fairness) to choose to characterize a fact as a \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factor,\xe2\x80\x9d relevant only to punishment, or as an element of a crime, relevant to guilt or innocence.  The Court has rejected this approach apparently because it finds too difficult the judicial job of managing the \xe2\x80\x9cfairness\xe2\x80\x9d constraint, <em>i.e.</em>, of determining when Congress has overreached.  But the Court has nowhere asked, \xe2\x80\x9ccompared to what?\xe2\x80\x9d  Had it done so, it could not have found the practical difficulty it has mentioned, <em>Blakely, supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 11), sufficient to justify the severe limits that its approach imposes upon Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legislative authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations\xe2\x80\x94of history, of constitutionally relevant consequences, and of constitutional authority\xe2\x80\x94have been more fully discussed in other opinions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Blakely, supra</em>, at ___ (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting); <em>id</em>., at ___  (Kennedy,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting); <em>id</em>., at ___ (Breyer,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting);<em> Harris</em>,<em> </em>536 U. S., at 549\xe2\x80\x93550, 569\xe2\x80\x93572; <em>Apprendi, supra</em>, at 523\xe2\x80\x93554, 555\xe2\x80\x93556; <em>McMillan, supra</em>, at 86\xe2\x80\x9391.  I need not elaborate them further.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the considerations just mentioned did not dissuade the Court from its holdings in <em>Apprendi</em> and <em>Blakely</em>, I should have hoped they would have dissuaded the Court from extending those holdings to the statute and Guidelines at issue here.  See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73551 <em>et seq.,</em> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991 <em>et seq</em>.; United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG).  Legal logic does not require that extension, for there are key differences.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Federal Guidelines are not statutes.  The rules they set forth are <em>administrative</em>, not statutory, in nature<em>. </em> Members, not of Congress, but of a Judicial Branch Commission, wrote those rules.  The rules do not \xe2\x80\x9cestablis[h] minimum and maximum penalties\xe2\x80\x9d for individual crimes, but guide sentencing courts, only to a degree, \xe2\x80\x9cfetter[ing] the discretion of sentencing judges to do what they have done for generations\xe2\x80\x94impose sentences within the broad limits established by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 396; see also USSG \xc2\xa75G1.1; cf. <em>Witte</em>, 515 U. S., at 399 (explaining that the Guidelines range \xe2\x80\x9cstill falls within the scope of the legislatively authorized penalty\xe2\x80\x9d).  The rules do not create a new set of legislatively determined sentences so much as they reflect, organize, rationalize, and modify an old set of judicially determined pre-Guidelines sentences.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(a); USSG \xc2\xa71A1.1, editorial note, \xc2\xa73, pp. 2\xe2\x80\x934 (describing the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s empirical approach).  Thus, the rules do not, in <em>Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99</em>s words, set forth a \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed <em>statutory</em> maximum,\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added), as the law has traditionally understood that phrase.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concede that <em>Blakely </em>defined \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x9d more broadly as \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (emphasis omitted).  But the Court need not read this language as extending the scope of <em>Apprendi.  Blakely </em>purports to follow, not to extend, <em>Apprendi</em>.  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  And <em>Blakely</em>, like <em>Apprendi</em>, involved sentences embodied in a statute, not in administrative rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, there is less justification for applying an <em>Apprendi</em>-type constitutional rule where administrative guidelines, not statutes, are at issue.  The Court applies its constitutional rule to statutes in part to avoid what <em>Blakely </em>sees as a serious problem, namely, a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make of a particular fact an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime or a sentencing factor, at will.  See <em>ante, </em>at 5 (opinion of Stevens,\xc2\xa0J.).  That problem\xe2\x80\x94that legislative temptation\xe2\x80\x94is severely diminished when Commission Guidelines are at issue, for the Commission cannot create \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of crimes.  It cannot write rules that \xe2\x80\x9cbind or regulate the primary conduct of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta, supra</em>, at 396.  Rather, it must write rules that reflect what the law has traditionally understood as sentencing factors.  That is to say, the Commission cannot switch between \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factors\xe2\x80\x9d at will because it cannot write substantive criminal statutes at all.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(a); cf. <em>Blakely, supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 7\xe2\x80\x938).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, to extend <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding to administratively written sentencing rules risks added legal confusion and uncertainty.  Read literally, <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s language would include within <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s strictures a host of nonstatutory sentencing determinations, including appellate court decisions delineating the limits of the legally \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Imagine an appellate opinion that says a sentence for ordinary robbery greater than five years is unreasonably long unless a special factor, such as possession of a gun, is present.)  Indeed, read literally, <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding would apply to a single judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the factors that make a particular sentence disproportionate or proportionate.  (Imagine a single judge setting forth, as a binding rule of law, the legal proposition about robbery sentences just mentioned.)  Appellate courts\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to define the limits of the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d of course would fall outside <em>Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  But they would do so, <em>not because they escape Blakely</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> literal language</em>, but<em> </em>because they are not <em>legislative </em>efforts to create limits.  Neither are the Guidelines <em>legislative </em>efforts.  See <em>Mistretta, supra</em>, at 412.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the sentencing statutes at issue in <em>Blakely</em> imposed absolute constraints on a judge\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing discretion, while the federal sentencing statutes here at issue do not.  As the <em>Blakely </em>Court emphasized, the Washington statutes authorized a higher-than-standard sentence on the basis of a factual finding <em>only if </em>the fact in question was a new fact\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a fact that did not constitute an element of the crime of conviction or an element of any more serious or additional crime.  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 7\xe2\x80\x938).  A judge applying those statutes could not even consider, much less impose, an exceptional sentence, unless he found facts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98other than those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the offense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Gore</em>, 143 Wash. 2d 288, 315\xe2\x80\x93316, 21 P.\xc2\xa03d 262, 277 (2001)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal sentencing statutes, however, offer a defendant no such fact-related assurance.  As long as \xe2\x80\x9cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), they permit a judge to depart from a Guidelines sentence based on facts that constitute elements of the crime (say, a bank robbery involving a threat to use a weapon, where the weapon in question is nerve gas).  Whether departure-triggering circumstances exist in a particular case is a matter for a court, not for Congress, to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, as far as the federal <em>statutes </em>are concerned, the federal system, unlike the state system at issue in <em>Blakely</em>, provides a defendant with no guarantee that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of factual elements will result in a sentence lower than the statutory maximum.  Rather, the statutes put a potential federal defendant on notice that a judge conceivably might sentence him anywhere within the range provided by <em>statute</em>\xe2\x80\x94regardless of the applicable Guidelines range.  See<em> Witte</em>, 515 U. S., at 399; see also Comment, Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94State Sentencing Guidelines, 118 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 333, 339\xe2\x80\x93340 (2004).  Hence as a practical matter, they grant a potential federal defendant less assurance of a lower Guidelines sentence than did the state statutes at issue in <em>Blakely</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These differences distinguish these cases from <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely.  </em>They offer a principled basis for refusing to extend <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule to these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961741">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING IN PART<br/>\nUNITED STATES V.

But which of those expectations was central<em> </em>to the congressional purpose is not hard to determine.  No headline describing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act) would have read \xe2\x80\x9cCongress reaffirms judge-based sentencing\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cCongress prescribes standardized sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court repeatedly acknowledges that the primary objective of the Act was to reduce sentencing disparity.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Inexplicably, however, the opinion concludes that the <em>manner</em> of achieving uniform sentences was more important to Congress than actually achieving uniformity\xe2\x80\x94that Congress was so attached to having <em>judges</em> determine \xe2\x80\x9creal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of bureaucratically prepared, hearsay-riddled presentence reports that it would rather lose the binding nature of the Guidelines than adhere to the old-fashioned process of having <em>juries</em> find the facts that expose a defendant to increased prison time.  See <em>ante,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 22.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s remedial choice is thus wonderfully ironic:  In order to rescue from nullification a statutory scheme designed to eliminate discretionary sentencing, it discards the provisions that eliminate discretionary sentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is the plain effect of the remedial majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to excise 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004).  See <em>ante,</em> at 16.  District judges will no longer be told they \xe2\x80\x9cshall impose a sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 within the range\xe2\x80\x9d established by the Guidelines.  \xc2\xa73553(b)(1).  Instead, under \xc2\xa73553(a), they will need only to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider\xe2\x80\x9d that range as one of many factors, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for the sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 to provide just punishment for the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(A) (main ed.), \xe2\x80\x9cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B), and \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the public from the further crimes of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(C).  The statute provides no order of priority among all those factors, but since the three just mentioned are the fundamental criteria governing penology, the statute\xe2\x80\x94absent the mandate of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94authorizes the judge to apply his own perceptions of just punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public even when these differ from the perceptions of the Commission members who drew up the Guidelines.  Since the Guidelines are not binding, in order to comply with the (oddly) surviving requirement that the court set forth \xe2\x80\x9cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described\xe2\x80\x9d in the Guidelines, \xc2\xa73553(c)(2), the sentencing judge need only state that \xe2\x80\x9cthis court does not believe that the punishment set forth in the Guidelines is appropriate for this sort of offense.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  That is to say, district courts have discretion to sentence anywhere within the ranges authorized by statute\xe2\x80\x94much as they were generally able to do before the Guidelines came into being.  To be sure, factor (6) is \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(6) (main ed.), but this would require a judge to adhere to the Guidelines only if all other judges had to adhere to the Guidelines (which they certainly do not, as the Court holds today) or if all other judges could at least be expected to adhere to the Guidelines (which they certainly cannot, given the notorious unpopularity of the Guidelines with many district judges).  Thus, logic compels the conclusion that the sentencing judge, after considering the recited factors (including the Guidelines), has full discretion, as full as what he possessed before the Act was passed, to sentence anywhere within the statutory range.  If the majority thought otherwise\xe2\x80\x94if it thought the Guidelines not only had to be \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered\xe2\x80\x9d (as the amputated statute requires) but had generally to be followed\xe2\x80\x94its opinion would surely say so.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As frustrating as this conclusion is to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of uniform sentencing, it at least establishes a clear and comprehensible regime\xe2\x80\x94essentially the regime that existed before the Act became effective.  That clarity is eliminated, however, by the remedial majority\xe2\x80\x99s surgery on 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73742 (main ed. and Supp. 2004), the provision governing appellate review of sentences.  Even the most casual reading of this section discloses that its purpose\xe2\x80\x94its <em>only </em>purpose\xe2\x80\x94is to enable courts of appeals to enforce conformity with the Guidelines.  All of the provisions of that section that impose a review obligation beyond what existed under prior law[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] are related to the district judge\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under the Guidelines.  If the Guidelines are no longer binding, one would think that the provision designed to ensure compliance with them would, in its totality, be inoperative.  The Court holds otherwise.  Like a black-robed Alexander cutting the Gordian knot, it simply severs the purpose of the review provisions from their text, holding that only subsection (e), which sets forth the determinations that the court of appeals must make, is inoperative, whereas all the rest of \xc2\xa73742 subsists\xe2\x80\x94including, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, subsection (f), entitled \xe2\x80\x9cDecision and disposition,\xe2\x80\x9d which <em>tracks</em> the determinations required by the severed subsection (e) and specifies <em>what disposition </em>each of those determinations is to produce.  This is rather like deleting the ingredients portion of a recipe and telling the cook to proceed with the preparation portion.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, appellate review of sentencing discretion has been limited to instances prescribed by statute.  Before the Guidelines, federal appellate courts had little experience reviewing sentences for anything but legal error.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]ell-established doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court said, \xe2\x80\x9cbars [appellate] review of the exercise of sentencing discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dorszynski</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/index.html">418 U. S. 424</a>, 443 (1974).  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce it is determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 431\xe2\x80\x93432 (citing cases).  When it established the Guidelines regime, Congress expressly provided for appellate review of sentences in specified circumstances, but the Court has been appropriately chary of aggrandizement, refusing to treat \xc2\xa73742 as a blank check to appellate courts.  Thus, in 1992, the Court recognized that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s grant of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>limited</em> appellate review of sentencing decisions \xe2\x80\xa6 did not alter a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 traditional deference to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its sentencing discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/193/index.html">503 U. S. 193</a>, 205 (emphasis added).  Notwithstanding \xc2\xa73742, much remained off-limits to the courts of appeals: \xe2\x80\x9cThe selection of the appropriate sentence from within the guideline range, as well as the decision to depart from the range in certain circumstances, are decisions that are left <em>solely</em> to the sentencing court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Similarly, in 1996, the Court took pains to note that the \xc2\xa73742 power to engage in \xe2\x80\x9climited appellate review\xe2\x80\x9d of Guidelines <em>departures</em> did not \xe2\x80\x9cvest in appellate courts wide-ranging authority over district court sentencing decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Koon</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/81/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/81/index.html">518 U. S. 81</a>, 97.  The Court repeated its caution that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he development of the guideline sentencing regime\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d did not allow appellate review \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98except to the extent specifically directed by statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Williams, supra,</em> at 205).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s remedial opinion does not even pretend to honor this principle that sentencing discretion is unreviewable except pursuant to specific statutory direction.  The discussion of appellate review begins with the declaration that, \xe2\x80\x9cdespite the absence of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 17 (citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73742(a) and (b)); and the opinion later announces that the standard of review for all such appeals is \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 18, 22.  This conflates different and distinct statutory authorizations of appeal and elides crucial differences in the statutory scope of review.  Section 3742 specifies four different kinds of appeal,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] setting forth for each the grounds of appeal permitted to the defendant and the Government (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73742(a) and (b)), the manner in which each ground should be considered (\xc2\xa73742(e)), and the permissible dispositions (\xc2\xa73742(f)).  There is no one-size-fits-all \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d review.  The power to review a sentence for reasonableness arises only when the sentencing court has departed from \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicable guideline range.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73742(f)(2); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Soltero-Lopez,</em> 11 F.\xc2\xa03d 18, 19 (CA1 1993) (Breyer, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he sentencing statutes \xe2\x80\xa6 provide [a defendant] with only a very narrow right of appeal\xe2\x80\x9d because the power \xe2\x80\x9cto set aside a departure that is \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d appears \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of other provisions that permit defendants to appeal only upward \xe2\x80\xa6 departures\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has expressly rejected the proposition that there may be a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry when a sentence is imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines.  See <em>Williams, supra,</em> at 201.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court claims that \xe2\x80\x9ca statute that does not <em>explicitly</em> set forth a standard of review may nonetheless do so <em>implicitly</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  Perhaps so.  But we have before us a statute that <em>does </em>explicitly set forth a standard of review.  The question is, when the Court has <em>severed </em>that standard of review (contained in \xc2\xa73742(e)), does it make any sense to look for some congressional \xe2\x80\x9cimplication\xe2\x80\x9d of a <em>different</em> standard of review in the remnants of the statute that the Court has left standing?  Only in Wonderland.  (This may explain in part why, as Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99s dissent correctly observes, <em>ante, </em>at 12, <em>none </em>of the numerous persons and organizations<em> </em>filing briefs as parties or <em>amici</em> in these cases\xe2\x80\x94all of whom filed this side of the looking-glass\xe2\x80\x94proposed, or I think even imagined, the remedial majority\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful disposition.)  Unsurprisingly, none of the three cases cited by the Court used the power of implication to fill a gap created by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own removal of an explicit standard.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s need to create a new, \xe2\x80\x9cimplied\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review\xe2\x80\x94however \xe2\x80\x9clinguistically\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfair,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 19\xe2\x80\x94amounts to a confession that it has exceeded its powers.  According to the \xe2\x80\x9cwell established\xe2\x80\x9d standard for severability, the unconstitutional part of a statute \xe2\x80\x9cmay be dropped if what is left is <em>fully operative</em> as a law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684 (1987) (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted).  Severance is not possible \xe2\x80\x9cif the balance of the legislation is incapable of functioning independently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s need to supplement the text that remains after severance suggests that it is engaged in \xe2\x80\x9credraft[ing] the statute\xe2\x80\x9d rather than just implementing the valid portions of it.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Treasury Employees,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/454/index.html">513 U. S. 454</a>, 479, and n.\xc2\xa026 (1995); see also<em> id.,</em> at 502, and n.\xc2\xa08 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting); <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/844/index.html">521 U. S. 844</a>, 884\xe2\x80\x93885 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that the Court ought to be inferring standards of review to stanch the bleeding created by its aggressive severance of \xc2\xa73742(e), its \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard is not, as it claims, consistent with the \xe2\x80\x9crelated statutory language\xe2\x80\x9d or with \xe2\x80\x9cappellate sentencing practice during the last two decades.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 18, 19.  As already noted, sentences within the Guidelines range have not previously been reviewed for reasonableness.  Indeed, the very concept of having a unitary standard of review for all kinds of appeals authorized by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73742(a) and (b) finds no support in statutory language or established practice of the last two decades.  Although a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard did appear in \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) until 2003, it never extended beyond review of deliberate departures from the Guidelines range.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(e)(3) (2000 ed.); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73742(f)(2)(A), (B) (prescribing how to dispose on appeal of a sentence that is \xe2\x80\x9coutside the applicable guideline range and is unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to the statistics cited by the Court, that standard applied to only 16.7% of federal sentencing appeals in 2002, see<em> ante,</em> at 19, but the Court would now have it apply across the board to all sentencing appeals, even to sentences within \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicable guideline range,\xe2\x80\x9d where there is no legal error or misapplication of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There can be no doubt that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s severability analysis has produced a scheme dramatically different from anything Congress has enacted since 1984.  Sentencing courts are told to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide just punishment\xe2\x80\x9d (among other things), and appellate courts are told to ensure that district judges are not \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The worst feature of the scheme is that no one knows\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps no one is meant to know\xe2\x80\x94how advisory Guidelines and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d review will function in practice.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of what it anticipates is positively Delphic:  \xe2\x80\x9cThese features of the remaining system \xe2\x80\xa6 continue to move sentencing in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.  We can find no feature of the remaining system that tends to hinder, rather than to further, these basic objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have suggested earlier, any system which held it <em>per se </em>unreasonable (and hence reversible) for a sentencing judge to reject the Guidelines is indistinguishable from the mandatory Guidelines system that the Court today holds unconstitutional.  But the remedial majority\xe2\x80\x99s gross exaggerations (it says that the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical standard of review\xe2\x80\x9d it prescribes is \xe2\x80\x9calready familiar to appellate courts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with appellate sentencing practice during the last two decades,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 18, 19)[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] may lead some courts of appeals to conclude\xe2\x80\x94may indeed be designed to lead courts of appeals to conclude\xe2\x80\x94that little has changed.  Bear in mind that one of the most significant features of the remedial majority\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d review is that it requires courts of appeals to evaluate each sentence <em>individually</em> for reasonableness, rather than apply the cookie-cutter standards of the mandatory Guidelines (within the correct Guidelines range, affirm; outside the range without adequate explanation, vacate and remand).  A court of appeals faced with this daunting prospect might seek refuge in the familiar and continue (as the remedial majority invites, though the merits majority forbids) the \xe2\x80\x9cappellate sentencing practice during the last two decades,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 19 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  At the other extreme, a court of appeals might handle the new workload by approving virtually any sentence within the statutory range that the sentencing court imposes, so long as the district judge goes through the appropriate formalities, such as expressing his consideration of and disagreement with the Guidelines sentence.  What I anticipate will happen is that \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d review will produce a discordant symphony of different standards, varying from court to court and judge to judge, giving the lie to the remedial majority\xe2\x80\x99s sanguine claim that \xe2\x80\x9cno feature\xe2\x80\x9d of its avant-garde Guidelines system will \xe2\x80\x9cten[d] to hinder\xe2\x80\x9d the avoidance of \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive sentencing disparities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 22.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> 542 U. S. ___ (2004), the four dissenting Justices accused the Court of ignoring \xe2\x80\x9cthe havoc it is about to wreak on trial courts across the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (slip op., at 12).  And that harsh assessment, of course, referred to just a temporary and unavoidable uncertainty, until the Court could get before it a case properly presenting the constitutionality of the mandatory Guidelines.  Today, the same Justices wreak havoc on federal district and appellate courts quite needlessly, and for the indefinite future.  Will appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d preserve <em>de facto</em> mandatory Guidelines by discouraging district courts from sentencing outside Guidelines ranges?  Will it simply add another layer of unfettered judicial discretion to the sentencing process?  Or will it be a mere formality, used by busy appellate judges only to ensure that busy district judges say all the right things when they explain how they have exercised their newly restored discretion?  Time may tell, but today\xe2\x80\x99s remedial majority will not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Part III of Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99s dissent relies in large part on legislative history.
