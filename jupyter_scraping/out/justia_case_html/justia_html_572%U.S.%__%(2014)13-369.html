(emphasis added).  This case, involving a heart-rate monitor used with exercise equipment, concerns the proper reading of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clarity and precision demand.  According to the Federal Circuit, a patent claim passes the \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb62 threshold so long as the claim is \xe2\x80\x9camenable to construction,\xe2\x80\x9d and the claim, as construed, is not \xe2\x80\x9cinsolubly ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  715 F.\xc2\xa03d 891, 898\xe2\x80\x93899 (2013).  We conclude that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s formulation, which tolerates some ambiguous claims but not others, does not satisfy the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definiteness requirement.  In place of the \xe2\x80\x9cinsolubly ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d standard, we hold that a patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification delineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.

Patent No. 5,337,753 (\xe2\x80\x99753 patent), issued to Dr. Gregory Lekhtman in 1994 and assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., concerns a heart-rate monitor for use during exercise.  Previous heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals).  The inaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different sort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated by an exerciser\xe2\x80\x99s skeletal muscles when, for example, she moves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her hand.  These EMG signals can \xe2\x80\x9cmask\xe2\x80\x9d ECG signals and thereby impede their detection.  App. 52, 147.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Dr. Lekhtman\xe2\x80\x99s invention claims to improve on prior art by eliminating that impediment.  The invention focuses on a key difference between EMG and ECG waveforms: while ECG signals detected from a user\xe2\x80\x99s left hand have a polarity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right hand,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] EMG signals from each hand have the same polar-ity.  The patented device works by measuring equalized EMG signals detected at each hand and then using circuitry to subtract the identical EMG signals from each other, thus filtering out the EMG interference.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As relevant here, the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent describes a heart-rate monitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user grips with both hands, such that each hand comes into contact with two electrodes, one \xe2\x80\x9clive\xe2\x80\x9d and one \xe2\x80\x9ccommon.\xe2\x80\x9d  The device is illustrated in figure 1 of the patent, id., at 41, reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Claim 1 of the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to this dispute, refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cheart rate monitor for use by a user in association with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 61.  The claim \xe2\x80\x9ccomprise[s],\xe2\x80\x9d among other elements, an \xe2\x80\x9celongate member\xe2\x80\x9d (cylindrical bar) with a display device; \xe2\x80\x9celectronic circuitry including a difference amplifier\xe2\x80\x9d; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a live electrode and a common electrode \xe2\x80\x9cmounted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in spaced relationship with each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  The claim sets forth additional elements, including that the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that each of the user\xe2\x80\x99s hands \xe2\x80\x9ccontact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d both electrodes on each side of the bar.  Id., at 62.  Further, the EMG signals detected by the two electrode pairs are to be \xe2\x80\x9cof substan-tially equal magnitude and phase\xe2\x80\x9d so that the difference amplifier will \xe2\x80\x9cproduce a substantially zero [EMG] signal\xe2\x80\x9d upon subtracting the signals from one another.

According to Biosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold exercise machines that included Biosig\xe2\x80\x99s patented technology, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after acquiring the StairMaster brand.  In 2004, based on these allegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit against Nautilus in the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        With Biosig\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U.\xc2\xa0S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent.  The reexamination proceedings centered on whether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious by prior art\xe2\x80\x94principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an inventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a heart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a difference amplifier.  Endeavoring to distinguish the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from Dr. Lekhtman.  The declaration attested, among other things, that the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent sufficiently informed a person skilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes so as \xe2\x80\x9cto produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and right hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 160.  Although the electrodes\xe2\x80\x99 design variables\xe2\x80\x94including spacing, shape, size, and material\xe2\x80\x94cannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr. Lekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a \xe2\x80\x9ctrial and error\xe2\x80\x9d process of equalization.  This would entail experimentation with different electrode configurations in order to optimize EMG signal cancellation.  Id., at 155\xe2\x80\x93156, 158.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  In 2010, the PTO issued a determination confirming the patentability of the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit, which the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prejudice while PTO reexamination was underway.  In 2011, the District Court conducted a hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims, see Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370 (1996)\n (claim construction is a matter of law reserved for court decision), including the claim term \xe2\x80\x9cin spaced relationship with each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to Biosig, that \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship\xe2\x80\x9d referred to the distance between the live electrode and the common electrode in each electrode pair.  Nautilus, seizing on Biosig\xe2\x80\x99s submissions to the PTO during the reexamination, maintained that the \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship\xe2\x80\x9d must be a distance \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than the width of each electrode.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 245.  The District Court ultimately construed the term to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a defined relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on one side of the cylindrical bar and the same or a different defined relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,\xe2\x80\x9d without any reference to the electrodes\xe2\x80\x99 width.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a\xe2\x80\x9344a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nautilus moved for summary judgment, arguing that the term \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d as construed, was indefinite under \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb62.  The District Court granted the motion.  Those words, the District Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cdid not tell [the court] or anyone what precisely the space should be,\xe2\x80\x9d or even supply \xe2\x80\x9cany parameters\xe2\x80\x9d for determining the appropriate spacing.  Id., at 72a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded.  A claim is indefinite, the majority opinion stated, \xe2\x80\x9conly when it is \xe2\x80\x98not amenable to construction\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98insolubly ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  715 F.\xc2\xa03d 891, 898 (2013) (quoting Datamize, LLC v. Plumtree Software, Inc., 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 1342, 1347 (CA Fed. 2005)).  Under that standard, the majority determined, the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent survived indefiniteness review.  Considering first the \xe2\x80\x9cintrinsic evidence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the claim language, the specification, and the prosecution history\xe2\x80\x94the majority discerned \xe2\x80\x9ccertain inherent parameters of the claimed apparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to understand the metes and bounds of \xe2\x80\x98spaced relationship.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  715 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 899.  These sources of meaning, the majority explained, make plain that the distance separating the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be greater than the width of a user\xe2\x80\x99s hands\xe2\x80\x9d; that is so \xe2\x80\x9cbecause claim 1 requires the live and common electrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two distinct points of a hand.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Furthermore, the major-ity noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cinfinitesimally small, effectively merging the live and common electrodes into a single electrode with one detection point.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The claim\xe2\x80\x99s functional provisions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional light on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  Surveying the record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority concluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could attain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing EMG signals by adjusting design variables, including spacing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the majority\xe2\x80\x99s result employing \xe2\x80\x9ca more limited analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 905.  Judge Schall accepted the majority\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the definiteness standard, under which claims amenable to construction are nonetheless indefinite when \xe2\x80\x9cthe construction remains insolubly ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Schall maintained, was sufficiently clear: the term means \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a fixed spatial relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode\xe2\x80\x9d on each side of the cylindrical bar.  Ibid.  Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the intrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.  But, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] a functional linkage between the \xe2\x80\x98spaced relationship\xe2\x80\x99 limitation and the removal of EMG signals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 906.  Other limitations of the claim, in his view, and not the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98spaced relationship\xe2\x80\x99 limitation itself,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cincluded a functional requirement to remove EMG signals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and now vacate and remand.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although the parties here disagree on the dispositive question\xe2\x80\x94does the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent withstand definiteness scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94they are in accord on several aspects of the \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb62 inquiry.  First, definiteness is to be evaluated from the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art.  See, e.g., General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp.,\n\n304 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364,\n371 (1938)\n.  See also \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb61 (patent\xe2\x80\x99s specification \xe2\x80\x9cshall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Second, in assessing definiteness, claims are to be read in light of the patent\xe2\x80\x99s specification and prosecution history.  See, e.g., United States v. Adams,\n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 39\n\xe2\x80\x9349 (1966) (specification); Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.,\n\n535 U. S. 722,\n741 (2002)\n (prosecution history).  Third, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]efiniteness is measured from the viewpoint of a person skilled in [the] art at the time the patent was filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 55 (emphasis added).  See generally E. Manzo, Patent Claim Construction in the Federal Circuit \xc2\xa70.2, p.\xc2\xa09 (2014) (\xe2\x80\x9cPatent claims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. should be construed from an objective perspective of a [skilled artisan], based on what the applicant actually claimed, disclosed, and stated during the application process.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties differ, however, in their articulations of just how much imprecision \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb62 tolerates.  In Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 view, a patent is invalid when a claim is \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous, such that readers could reasonably interpret the claim\xe2\x80\x99s scope differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 37.  Biosig and the Solicitor General would require only that the patent provide reasonable notice of the scope of the claimed invention.

On the one hand, the definiteness requirement must take into account the inherent limitations of language.  See ibid.  Some modicum of uncertainty, the Court has recognized, is the \xe2\x80\x9cprice of ensuring the appropriate incentives for innovation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 732.  One must bear in mind, moreover, that patents are \xe2\x80\x9cnot addressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather to those skilled in the relevant art.  Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co.,\n\n185 U.\xc2\xa0S. 403,\n437 (1902)\n (also stating that \xe2\x80\x9cany description which is sufficient to apprise [steel manufacturers] in the language of the art of the definite feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning to others of what the patent claims as a monopoly, is sufficiently definite to sustain the patent\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At the same time, a patent must be precise enough to afford clear notice of what is claimed, thereby \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98appris[ing] the public of what is still open to them.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Markman, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373 (quoting McClain v.

Binney &amp; Smith Co.,\n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228,\n236 (1942)\n.  And absent a meaningful definiteness check, we are told, patent applicants face powerful incentives to inject ambigu-ity into their claims.  See Brief for Petitioner 30\xe2\x80\x9332 (citing patent treatises and drafting guides).  See also Federal Trade Commission, The Evolving IP Marketplace: Aligning Patent Notice and Remedies With Competition 85 (2011) (quoting testimony that patent system fosters \xe2\x80\x9can incentive to be as vague and ambiguous as you can with your claims\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdefer clarity at all costs\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Eliminating that temptation is in order, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe patent drafter is in the best position to resolve the ambiguity in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. patent claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v.

Cognizant of the competing concerns, we read \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb62 to require that a patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims, viewed in light of the specification and prosecution history, inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.  The definiteness requirement, so understood, mandates clarity, while recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable.  The standard we adopt accords with opinions of this Court stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe certainty which the law requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard to their subject-matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minerals Separation, Ltd. v.

It cannot be sufficient that a court can ascribe some meaning to a patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims; the definiteness inquiry trains on the understanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent application, not that of a court viewing matters post\xc2\xa0hoc.  To tolerate imprecision just short of that rendering a claim \xe2\x80\x9cinsolubly ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d would diminish the definiteness requirement\xe2\x80\x99s public-notice function and foster the innovation-discouraging \xe2\x80\x9czone of uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d United Carbon, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236, against which this Court has warned.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Appreciating that \xe2\x80\x9cterms like \xe2\x80\x98insolubly ambiguous\xe2\x80\x99 may not be felicitous,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 34, Biosig argues the phrase is a shorthand label for a more probing inquiry that the Federal Circuit applies in practice.  The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s fuller explications of the term \xe2\x80\x9cinsolubly ambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d we recognize, may come closer to tracking the statutory prescription.  See, e.g., 715 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 898 (case below) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f reasonable efforts at claim construction result in a definition that does not provide sufficient particularity and clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the claim, the claim is insolubly ambiguous and invalid for indefiniteness.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But although this Court does not \xe2\x80\x9cmicromanag[e] the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s particular word choice\xe2\x80\x9d in applying patent-law doctrines, we must ensure that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test is at least \xe2\x80\x9cprobative of the essential inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co.,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 17,\n40 (1997)\n.  Falling short in that regard, the expressions \xe2\x80\x9cinsolubly ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9camenable to construction\xe2\x80\x9d permeate the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s recent decisions concerning \xc2\xa7112, \xc2\xb62\xe2\x80\x99s requirement.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  We agree with Nautilus and its amici that such terminology can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without a reliable compass.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Both here and in the courts below, the parties have advanced conflicting arguments as to the definiteness of the claims in the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent.  Nautilus maintains that the claim term \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship\xe2\x80\x9d is open to multiple interpretations reflecting markedly different understandings of the patent\xe2\x80\x99s scope, as exemplified by the disagreement among the members of the Federal Circuit panel.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  Biosig responds that \xe2\x80\x9cspaced relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d read in light of the specification and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings, delineates the permissible spacing with sufficient precision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \xe2\x80\x9c[M]indful that we are a court of review, not of first view,\xe2\x80\x9d Cutter v.

As we have explained, the Federal Circuit invoked a standard more amorphous than the statutory definiteness requirement allows.  We therefore follow our ordinary practice of remanding so that the Court of Appeals can reconsider, under the proper standard, whether the relevant claims in the \xe2\x80\x99753 patent are sufficiently definite.  See, e.g., Johnson v. California,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 499,\n515 (2005)\n; Gasperini v.
