New Orleans, 98 U.S.  381 (1878)</h3><p><b>United States v. New Orleans</b></p><p><b>98 U.S. 381</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>1. The legislative branch of the government has the exclusive power of taxation, but may delegate it to municipal corporations.</p>\n<p>2. When such corporations are created, the power of taxation is vested in them as an essential attribute for all the purposes of their existence, unless its exercise be in express terms prohibited.</p>\n<p>3. When, in order to execute a public work, they have been vested with authority to borrow money or incur an obligation, they have the power to levy a tax to raise revenue wherewith to pay the money or discharge the obligation, without any special mention that such power is granted.</p>\n<p>4. A limitation imposed by statute upon them, restraining them from creating any indebtedness without providing at the same time for the payment of principal and interest, will not control a subsequent statute which, without prescribing such limitation, authorizes them to incur a special obligation.</p>\n<p>5. Bonds of the City of New Orleans, issued upon a subscription to the stock of a railroad company under an ordinance which declared that the stock "should remain forever pledged for the payment of the bonds," are an absolute obligation of the city, the ordinance creating only a pledge of the stock by way of collateral security for their payment.</p>\n<p>6. The indebtedness of a city is conclusively established by a judgment recovered against it in a court of competent jurisdiction, and in enforcing payment, the plaintiff is not restricted to any particular property or revenues, or subject to any conditions, unless such judgment so provides. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 98 U. S. 382</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This was a petition presented in April, 1876, by Morris Ranger, the relator, for a writ of mandamus to compel the City of New Orleans to pay three judgments.  The petition alleges that he had recovered them in the circuit court of the United States for an amount exceeding in the aggregate $59,000 against the city, on its bonds and coupons issued under the provisions of Acts of the Legislature of Louisiana, passed on the 15th of March, 1854, and designated as Nos. 108 and 109, that executions had been issued upon the judgments and returned unsatisfied, and that there was no property belonging to the city subject to seizure thereon.</p>\n<p>It also alleges that in June, 1870, the city had sold eighty thousand shares of stock of the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad Company which it held for the sum of $320,000, and that by the Act No. 109, of 1854, these shares were forever pledged for the payment of the bonds issued under its provisions; that the city should therefore be compelled to pay out of their proceeds so much of the judgments as appears on the face of the records to have been rendered upon the bonds, or in case their payment cannot be enforced in this way, that it should be compelled to levy and collect a tax for that purpose and also a tax to pay so much of the judgments as was rendered upon bonds and coupons issued under the Act No. 108, of 1854, but that the mayor and administrators, who represent and exercise the powers of the city, refuse to pay the judgments out of any funds in their possession or under their control or to levy a tax for their payment.  The relator therefore prays the court to order them to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not be issued compelling them to apply the proceeds and to levy a tax as mentioned.</p>\n<p>The order to show cause was accordingly issued, and the city authorities appeared and filed an answer to the petition in which they admitted the recovery of a judgment by the relator -- speaking of the three judgments as one -- the issue of executions thereon, and their return unsatisfied, the sale of the eighty thousand shares of the capital stock of the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad Company for $320,000, and the receipt of the money by their predecessors, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 98 U. S. 383</a></p><p> and set up as a defense to the prayer of the petition that the judgment was recovered upon certain bonds issued by the city to that company under the Act of March 15, 1854, No. 109, making no mention of the Act of No. 108; that no tax for the payment of the principal of the bonds is directed to be levied by that act or any other act of the legislature; that, as respects the interest on the bonds, provision is made for its payment out of the back taxes due to the city, and inserted in its budget for 1876; and that the proceeds arising from the sale of the stock of the railroad company are not in the treasury of the city or under their control, having been used and expended by their predecessors.  They therefore prayed that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p>The relator demurred to this answer.  The court overruled the demurrer and refused the writ, and from its judgment the case is brought to this Court.</p>\n<p>The City of New Orleans was incorporated under the name of "the Mayor, Aldermen, and inhabitants of the City of New Orleans," by an Act of the legislature approved Feb. 17, 1805, the sixth section of which provides:</p>\n<p>"The said mayor and city council (aldermen) shall have power to raise by tax, in such a manner as to them may seem proper, upon the real and personal estate within said city, such sum or sums of money as may be necessary to supply any deficiency for the lighting, cleansing, paving, and watering the streets of said city, for supporting the city watch, the levee of the river, the prisons, workhouses, and other public buildings, and for such other purposes as the police and good government of the said city may require."</p>\n<p>An Act approved March 8, 1836, amending that act constituted in effect a new charter, and divided the city "into three separate sections, each with distinct municipal powers."</p>\n<p>The fourth section provided:</p>\n<p>"Each of said municipalities shall possess separate corporate rights, and are hereby declared to be distinct corporations, and shall possess generally such rights, powers, and capacities as are usually incident to municipal corporations, . . . and in general </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 98 U.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 98 U. S. 392</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The judge of the circuit court accompanied the judgment with an opinion giving the reasons of his decision, which were substantially those stated in the answer of the city, that the statute authorizing the issue of the bonds, upon which the judgments were recovered, made no provision for levying a tax to pay the principal, but intended that it should be paid out of the stock of the railroad company and its revenues, and that the proceeds from the sale of the stock had been already expended by the predecessors of the present city authorities.  The court, adopting the view of the city authorities as to the construction of the statute and the supposed intention of the legislature, proceeded on the principle that the power of taxation belongs exclusively to the legislative branch of the government, and that the judiciary cannot direct a tax to be levied when none is authorized by the legislature, and that the issuing of a mandamus to apply the proceeds received from the sale of the stock would be a futile proceeding, they having been previously used for other purposes.  A writ, said the court, could not issue commanding the performance of an admitted impossibility.</p>\n<p>The position that the power of taxation belongs exclusively to the legislative branch of the government no one will controvert.  Under our system, it is lodged nowhere else.  But it is a power that may be delegated by the legislature to municipal corporations, which are merely instrumentalities of the state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 98 U. S. 393</a></p><p> for the better administration of the government in matters of local concern.  When such a corporation is created, the power of taxation is vested in it as an essential attribute, for all the purposes of its existence, unless its exercise be in express terms prohibited.  For the accomplishment of those purposes, its authorities, however limited the corporation, must have the power to raise money and control its expenditure.  In a city even of small extent, they have to provide for the preservation of peace, good order, and health, and the execution of such measures as conduce to the general good of its citizens, such as the opening and repairing of streets, the construction of sidewalks, sewers, and drains, the introduction of water, and the establishment of a fire and police department.  In a city like New Orleans, situated on a navigable stream or on a harbor of a lake or sea, their powers are usually enlarged so as to embrace the building of wharves and docks or levees for the benefit of commerce, and they may extend also to the construction of roads leading to it, or the contributing of aid towards their construction.  The number and variety of works which may be authorized, having a general regard to the welfare of the city or of its people, are mere matters of legislative discretion.  All of them require for their execution considerable expenditures of money.  Their authorization without providing the means for such expenditures would be an idle and futile proceeding.  Their authorization therefore implies and carries with it the power to adopt the ordinary means employed by such bodies to raise funds for their execution, unless such funds are otherwise provided.  And the ordinary means in such cases is taxation.  A municipality without the power of taxation would be a body without life, incapable of acting, and serving no useful purpose.</p>\n<p>For the same reason, when authority to borrow money or incur an obligation in order to execute a public work is conferred upon a municipal corporation, the power to levy a tax for its payment or the discharge of the obligation accompanies it, and this too without any special mention that such power is granted.  This arises from the fact that such corporations seldom possess -- so seldom, indeed, as to be exceptional -- any means to discharge their pecuniary obligations except by taxation.  "It is therefore to be inferred," as observed by this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 98 U. S. 394</a></p><p> Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/655/case.html#660">Loan Association v. Topeka,</a></span></em> 20 Wall. 660,</p>\n<p>"that when the legislature of a state authorizes a county or city to contract a debt by bond, it intends to authorize it to levy such taxes as are necessary to pay the debt unless there is in the act itself, or in some general statute, a limitation upon the power of taxation which repels such an inference."</p>\n<p>The doctrine here stated is asserted by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in <em>Commonwealth v. Commissioners of Allegheny County,</em> 37 Pa. 277.  That county was authorized by an act of the legislature to subscribe to the capital stock of a railroad company and to issue its bonds in payment thereof.  The interest on them being unpaid, a writ of mandamus was applied for to compel the commissioners of the county to make provision to pay it.  The return of the officers set up, among other objections to the writ, that the act authorizing the subscription and issue of the bonds provided no means of payment either of the principal or interest.  To this defense the court said:</p>\n<p>"The act of 1843 authorized subscriptions by certain counties to be made as \'fully as any individual could do,\' without prescribing more precisely the terms.  But by the fifth section of the Act of April 18, 1843, counties subscribing are authorized to borrow money to pay for such subscriptions.  We have decided that bonds or certificates of loan issued by a municipal corporation is an ordinary and appropriate mode of borrowing money, and the act of 1853 expressly authorized the issue of such securities.  The subscriptions were accordingly made, and the bonds issued.  Thus was lawful debt incurred by the county, and as no other than the ordinary mode of extinguishing it, or of paying the interest thereon, was provided, it follows, of course, that the ordinary mode of raising the means must be resorted to -- namely to provide for it in the annual assessment of taxes for county purposes."</p>\n<p>Again, in the same case, the court said:</p>\n<p>"In the next place it is averred that there is no authority to levy a tax for the payment of the interest by the county.  We have already treated of this, and said that the authority to create the debt implies an obligation to pay it, and when no special mode of doing so is provided, it is also implied that it is to be done in the ordinary way -- by the levy and collection of taxes. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 98 U. S. 395</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In numerous cases similar language is found in opinions of the state courts, not required, perhaps, to decide the point in judgment therein, but showing a recognition of the doctrine stated.  Thus in <em>Lowell v. Boston,</em> 111 Mass. 460, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in speaking of bonds which the legislature had authorized the City of Boston to issue in order to raise funds to be loaned to individuals to aid them in rebuilding that portion of the city which was burned in the great fire of November, 1872, said:</p>\n<p>"The issue of bonds by the city, whatever provision may be made for their redemption, involves the possible and not improbable consequence of a necessity to provide for their payment by the city.  The right to incur the obligation implies the right to raise money by taxation for payment of the bonds, or what is equivalent, the right to levy a tax for the purposes for which the fund is to be raised by means of the bonds so authorized."</p>\n<p>To the same purport is the language of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in <em>Hasbrouck v. Milwaukee,</em> 25 Wis. 122.  And in the recent case of <em>Parsons v. City of Charleston,</em> in the United States circuit court, the Chief Justice gave emphatic affirmation to the doctrine.  Hughes 282.  Indeed it is always to be assumed in the absence of clear restrictive provisions that when the legislature grants to a city the power to create a debt, it intends that the city shall pay it and that the payment shall not be left to its caprice or pleasure.  When, therefore, a power to contract a debt is conferred, it must be held that a corresponding power of providing for its payment is also conferred.  The latter is implied in the grant of the former, and such implication cannot be overcome except by express words excluding it.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the indebtedness of the City of New Orleans is conclusively established by the judgments recovered.  The validity of the bonds upon which they were rendered is not now open to question.  Nor is the payment of the judgments restricted to any species of property or revenues, or subject to any conditions.  The indebtedness is absolute.  If there were any question originally as to a limitation of the means by which the bonds were to be paid, it is cut off from consideration now by the judgments.  If a limitation existed, it should have been insisted upon when the suits on the bonds were pending, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 98 U. S. 396</a></p><p> and continued in the judgments.  The fact that none is thus continued is conclusive on this application that none existed.</p>\n<p>If the question were an open one, our conclusion would be the same.  The act of 1854 provided that the railroad company should issue to the city certificates of stock for an amount equal to the amount of bonds received, and that the stock should remain "forever pledged for the redemption of said bonds."  It is plain that this language was intended only to create a statutory pledge by way of collateral security for the payment of the bonds.  It does not import that the holders of the bonds were to be thereby precluded from looking to the city or that they were obliged to have recourse in the first instance to the pledge.  The city, by the terms of the bonds, was primarily liable, and nothing in the language of the act in any respect affects this primary liability.  The bondholder is not compelled to look to the security, but may proceed directly against the city without regard to it.  Besides, as was justly observed by counsel, if we could seek the intention of the legislature from other considerations than the words of the statute, it would be still plainer that no such construction could be given to its language.  The object of issuing the bonds for the stock was to aid the company in obtaining funds to build its road.  If the stock had been available, the bonds would not have been needed; the stock would have been sold.  But it was not available, and it is difficult to believe that the bonds would have been any more so if their payment had been limited to the revenues and proceeds of the stock.  The proposal of such a scheme for raising money would not have indicated much wisdom on the part of the legislature; to have assented to it would have indicated less on the part of the bondholders.  And even if the bondholders had been required to look for payment of the bonds only to the revenues and proceeds of the stock, it comes with bad grace from the city, not to say evinces an insensibility to its obligations, to allege exemption from liability after its authorities have sold the stock and diverted the proceeds to other uses.</p>\n<p>This construction is not affected, as contended by counsel, by the statutes of 1852 and 1853 restraining cities and towns from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 98 U. S. 397</a></p><p> creating any indebtedness without providing at the same time for the payment of the principal and interest.  Those statutes were not limitations on the power of the legislature to authorize the creation of debts by cities upon other conditions.  It does not follow that because it was deemed expedient, as a general rule, to prohibit cities and towns from incurring debts on their own motion without making provision for their payment, that the legislature might not authorize the incurring of a particular obligation without such provision.  And it will be found upon examination that the act of 1854 prescribed the details of the ordinance which should be passed by the city in the execution of the authority conferred, and that the ordinance passed conformed to them.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/575/case.html">Butz v. Muscatine,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 575; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/364/case.html">Amey v. Allegheny,</a></span></em> 24 How. 364; <em>Commonwealth v.

Perrysburg,</em> 4 Ohio St. 472.</p>\n<p>There is nothing, therefore, in the positions of counsel to impair the validity of the bonds upon which the judgments were recovered if we were at liberty to consider them on this application.  But, as already said, the judgments are conclusive upon this point.  Owing the debt, the city has the power to levy a tax for its payment.  By its charter, in force when the bonds were issued, it was invested, in express terms, "with all the powers, rights, privileges, and immunities incident to a municipal corporation and necessary for the proper government of the same."</p>\n<p>As already said, the power of taxation is a power incident to such a corporation, and may be exercised for all the purposes authorized by its charter or subsequent legislation.  Whatever the legislature empowers the corporation to do is presumably for its benefit, and may, in "the proper government of the same," be done.  Having the power to levy a tax for the payment of the judgments of the relator, it was the duty of the city, through its authorities, to exercise the power.  The payment was not a matter resting in its pleasure, but a duty which it owed to the creditor.  Having neglected this duty, the case was one in which a mandamus should have been issued to enforce its performance.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/376/case.html">Knox County v.
