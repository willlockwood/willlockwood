Rent-A-Center filed a motion, under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73, and to compel arbitration, \xc2\xa74, based on the arbitration agreement (Agreement) Jackson signed as a condition of his employment.  Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that the Agreement was unenforceable in that it was unconscionable under Nevada law.  The District Court granted Rent-A-Center\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 2 of the FAA places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U. S. 440</a>, 443, and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms, <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U.

Here, the Agreement included two relevant arbitration provisions: it provided for arbitration of all disputes arising out of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s employment, including discrimination claims, and it gave the \xe2\x80\x9cArbitrator \xe2\x80\xa6 exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the [Agreement\xe2\x80\x99s] enforceability \xe2\x80\xa6 including \xe2\x80\xa6 any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rent-A-Center seeks enforcement of the second provision, which delegates to the arbitrator the \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d question of enforceability.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Howsam</em> v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/79/index.html">537 U. S. 79</a>, 83\xe2\x80\x9385.  The court must enforce the delegation provision under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 unless it is unenforceable under \xc2\xa72.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0There are two types of validity challenges under \xc2\xa72: one \xe2\x80\x9cchallenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he other challenges the contract as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckeye, supra</em>, at 444.  Only the first is relevant to a court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of an arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x99s enforceability, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/395/index.html">388 U. S. 395</a>, 403\xe2\x80\x93404, because under \xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9can arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckeye, supra</em>, at 445.  That does not mean that agreements to arbitrate are unassailable.  If a party challenges the validity under \xc2\xa72 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with the agreement under \xc2\xa74.  That is no less true when the precise agreement to arbitrate is itself part of a larger arbitration agreement.  Because here the agreement to arbitrate enforceability (the delegation provision) is severable from the remainder of the Agreement, unless Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, it must be treated as valid under \xc2\xa72 and enforced under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.  In his brief to this Court he raised a challenge to the delegation provision for the first time, but that is too late and will not be considered.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x9316, a district court may decide a claim that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable, where the agreement explicitly assigns that decision to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 1, 2007, the respondent here, Antonio Jackson, filed an employment-discrimination suit under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71977, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981, against his former employer in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.  The defendant and petitioner here, Rent-A-Center, West, Inc., filed a motion under the FAA to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73, and to compel arbitration, \xc2\xa74.  Rent-A-Center argued that the Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims (Agreement), which Jackson signed on February 24, 2003 as a condition of his employment there, precluded Jackson from pursuing his claims in court.  The Agreement provided for arbitration of all \xe2\x80\x9cpast, present or future\xe2\x80\x9d disputes arising out of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s employment with Rent-A-Center, including \xe2\x80\x9cclaims for discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cclaims for violation of any federal . . . law.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  It also provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 34.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe arbitration agreement in question is clearly unenforceable in that it is unconscionable\xe2\x80\x9d under Nevada law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 40.  Rent-A-Center responded that Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionability claim was not properly before the court because Jackson had expressly agreed that the arbitrator would have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute about the enforceability of the Agreement.  It also disputed the merits of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionability claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted Rent-A-Center\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the proceedings and to compel arbitration.  The court found that the Agreement \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cclearly and unmistakenly <em>[sic]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement is enforceable, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. (quoting <em>Howsam</em> v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/79/index.html"></a><a href="/us/537/79/index.html">537 U. S. 79</a>, 83 (2002)), and, because Jackson challenged the validity of the Agreement <em>as a whole</em>, the issue was for the arbitrator, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a (citing <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/440/index.html">546 U. S. 440</a>, 444\xe2\x80\x93445 (2006)).  The court noted that even if it were to examine the merits of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionability claims, it would have rejected the claim that the agreement to split arbitration fees was substantively unconscionable under Nevada law.  It did not address Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s procedural or other substantive unconscionability arguments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without oral argument, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.  581 F.\xc2\xa03d 912 (2009).  The court reversed on the question of who (the court or arbitrator) had the authority to decide whether the Agreement is enforceable.  It noted that \xe2\x80\x9cJackson does not dispute that the language of the Agreement clearly assigns the arbitrability determination to the arbitrator,\xe2\x80\x9d but held that where \xe2\x80\x9ca party challenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to the agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 917.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s alternative conclusion that the fee-sharing provision was not substantively unconscionable and remanded for consideration of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s other unconscionability arguments.  <em>Id.</em>, at 919\xe2\x80\x93920, and n.\xc2\xa03.  Judge Hall dissented on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of the arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x99s validity should have gone to the arbitrator, as the parties \xe2\x80\x98clearly and unmistakably provide[d]\xe2\x80\x99 in their agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 921.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 558 U.

Section 2, the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary substantive provision of the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Mercury Constr.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe FAA thereby places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,  <em>Buckeye</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 443, and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms, <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U. S. 468</a>, 478 (1989).  Like other contracts, however, they may be invalidated by \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casarotto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/681/index.html">517 U.

Under \xc2\xa73, a party may apply to a federal court for a stay of the trial of an action \xe2\x80\x9cupon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa74, a party \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d by the failure of another party \xe2\x80\x9cto arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d may petition a federal court \xe2\x80\x9cfor an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d order arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cupon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Agreement here contains multiple \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9csettle by arbitration a controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72.  Two are relevant to our discussion.  First, the section titled \xe2\x80\x9cClaims Covered By The Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d provides for arbitration of all \xe2\x80\x9cpast, present or future\xe2\x80\x9d disputes arising out of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s employment with Rent-A-Center.  App. 29.  Second, the section titled \xe2\x80\x9cArbitration Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Arbitrator . . . shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 32, 34.  The current \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d between the parties is whether the Agreement is unconscionable.  It is the second provision, which delegates resolution of that controversy to the arbitrator, that Rent-A-Center seeks to enforce.  Adopting the terminology used by the parties, we will refer to it as the delegation provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate threshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.  We have recognized that parties can agree to arbitrate \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d questions of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrability,\xe2\x80\x9d such as whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agreement covers a particular controversy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Howsam</em>, 537 U. S., at 83\xe2\x80\x9385; <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.</em> v. <em>Bazzle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/444/index.html">539 U. S. 444</a>, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion).  This line of cases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kaplan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/938/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/938/index.html">514 U. S. 938</a>, 943 (1995).  An agreement to arbitrate a gateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent agreement the party seeking arbitration asks the federal court to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other.  The additional agreement is valid under \xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\xe2\x80\x9d and federal courts can enforce the agreement by staying federal litigation under \xc2\xa73 and compelling arbitration under \xc2\xa74.  The question before us, then, is whether the delegation provision is valid under \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two types of validity challenges under \xc2\xa72: \xe2\x80\x9cOne type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement (<em>e.g.</em>, the agreement was fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s provisions renders the whole contract invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at 444.  In a line of cases neither party has asked us to overrule, we held that only the first type of challenge is relevant to a court\xe2\x80\x99s determination whether the arbitration agreement at issue is enforceable.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em> v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/395/index.html"></a><a href="/us/388/395/index.html">388 U. S. 395</a>, 403\xe2\x80\x93404 (1967); <em>Buckeye</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 444\xe2\x80\x93446; <em>Preston</em> v. <em>Ferrer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/346/index.html">552 U. S. 346</a>, 353\xe2\x80\x93354 (2008).  That is because \xc2\xa72 states that a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto settle by arbitration a controversy\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\xe2\x80\x9d <em>without mention</em> of the validity of the contract in which it is contained.  Thus, a party\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to another provision of the contract, or to the contract as a whole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a specific agreement to arbitrate.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at 445; see also <em>id.</em>, at 447 (the severability rule is based on \xc2\xa72).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But that agreements to arbitrate are severable does not mean that they are unassailable.  If a party challenges the validity under \xc2\xa72 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with that agreement under \xc2\xa74.  In <em>Prima Paint</em>, for example, if the claim had been \xe2\x80\x9cfraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,\xe2\x80\x9d then the court would have considered it.  388 U. S., at 403\xe2\x80\x93404.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial challenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would be to elevate it over other forms of contract,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 404, n.\xc2\xa012.  In some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the contract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the same basis as applied only to the severable agreement to arbitrate.  Thus, in an employment contract many elements of alleged unconscionability applicable to the entire contract (outrageously low wages, for example) would not affect the agreement to arbitrate alone.  But even where that is not the case\xe2\x80\x94as in <em>Prima Paint</em> itself, where the alleged fraud that induced the whole contract equally induced the agreement to arbitrate which was part of that contract\xe2\x80\x94we nonetheless require the basis of challenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to arbitrate before the court will intervene.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72, that Rent-A-Center asks us to enforce is the delegation provision\xe2\x80\x94the provision that gave the arbitrator \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this Agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 34.  The \xe2\x80\x9cremainder of the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckeye</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 445, is the rest of the agreement to arbitrate claims arising out of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s employment with Rent-A-Center.  To be sure this case differs from <em>Prima Paint</em>, <em>Buckeye</em>, and <em>Preston</em>, in that the arbitration provisions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained in contracts unrelated to arbitration\xe2\x80\x94contracts for consulting services, see <em>Prima Paint</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 397, check-cashing services, see <em>Buckeye</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 442, and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal management\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctalent agent\xe2\x80\x9d services, see <em>Preston</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 352.  In this case, the underlying contract is itself an arbitration agreement.  But that makes no difference.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Application of the severability rule does not depend on the substance of the remainder of the contract.  Section 2 operates on the specific \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9csettle by arbitration a controversy\xe2\x80\x9d that the party seeks to enforce.  Accordingly, unless Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, we must treat it as valid under \xc2\xa72, and must enforce it under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4, leaving any challenge to the validity of the Agreement as a whole for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.  Nowhere in his opposition to Rent-A-Center\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel arbitration did he even mention the delegation provision.  See App. 39\xe2\x80\x9347.  Rent-A-Center noted this fact in its reply: \xe2\x80\x9c[Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s response] fails to rebut or otherwise address in any way [Rent-A-Center\xe2\x80\x99s] argument that the Arbitrator must decide [Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s] challenge to\nthe enforceability of the Agreement.  <em>Thus, [Rent-A-Center\xe2\x80\x99s] argument is uncontested.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 50 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The arguments Jackson made in his response to Rent-A-Center\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel arbitration support this conclusion.  Jackson stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>entire agreement</em> seems drawn to provide [Rent-A-Center] with undue advantages should an employment-related dispute arise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (emphasis added).  At one point, he argued that the limitations on discovery \xe2\x80\x9cfurther suppor[t] [his] contention that the <em>arbitration agreement as a whole</em> is substantively unconscionable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  And before this Court, Jackson describes his challenge in the District Court as follows: He \xe2\x80\x9copposed the motion to compel on the ground that the <em>entire arbitration agreement</em>, including the delegation clause, was unconscionable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 55 (emphasis added).  That is an accurate description of his filings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As required to make out a claim of unconscionability under Nevada law, see 581 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 919, he contended that the Agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.  It was procedurally unconscionable, he argued, because it \xe2\x80\x9cwas imposed as a condition of employment and was non-negotiable.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 41.  But we need not consider that claim because none of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s substantive unconscionability challenges was specific to the delegation provision.  First, he argued that the Agreement\xe2\x80\x99s coverage was one sided in that it required arbitration of claims an employee was likely to bring\xe2\x80\x94contract, tort, discrimination, and statutory claims\xe2\x80\x94but did not require arbitration of claims Rent-A-Center was likely to bring\xe2\x80\x94intellectual property, unfair competition, and trade secrets claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  This one-sided-coverage argument clearly did not go to the validity of the delegation provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s other two substantive unconscionability arguments assailed arbitration procedures called for by the contract\xe2\x80\x94the fee-splitting arrangement and the limitations on discovery\xe2\x80\x94procedures that were to be used during arbitration under <em>both </em>the agreement to arbitrate employment-related disputes <em>and</em> the delegation provision.  It may be that had Jackson challenged the delegation provision by arguing that these common procedures <em>as applied </em>to the delegation provision rendered <em>that provision</em> unconscionable, the challenge should have been considered by the court.  To make such a claim based on the discovery procedures, Jackson would have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes the arbitration of his claim that the Agreement is unenforceable to be unconscionable.  That would be, of course, a much more difficult argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders arbitration of his factbound employment-discrimination claim unconscionable.  Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting arrangement may be more difficult to establish for the arbitration of enforceability than for arbitration of more complex and fact-related aspects of the alleged employment discrimination.  Jackson, however, did not make any arguments specific to the delegation provision; he argued that the fee-sharing and discovery procedures rendered the <em>entire</em> Agreement invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Ninth Circuit confirms that he did not contest the validity of the delegation provision in particular.  His brief noted the existence of the delegation provision, Brief for Appellant in No. 07\xe2\x80\x9316164, p. 3, but his unconscionability arguments made no mention of it, <em>id.</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x937.  He also repeated the arguments he had made before the District Court, see <em>supra</em>, at 9, that the \xe2\x80\x9centire agreement\xe2\x80\x9d favors Rent-A-Center and that the limitations on discovery further his \xe2\x80\x9ccontention that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Appellant 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Finally, he repeated the argument made in his District Court filings, that under state law the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from the arbitration agreement, see <em>id.</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The point of this argument, of course, is that the Agreement <em>as a whole</em> is unconscionable under state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson repeated that argument before this Court.  At oral argument, counsel stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are certain elements of the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which would render the <em>entire arbitration agreement</em> unconscionable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (emphasis added).  And again, he stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that under Nevada law render the <em>entire agreement</em> unconscionable \xe2\x80\xa6 , and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Court is to rely on.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In his brief to this Court, Jackson made the contention, not mentioned below, that the delegation provision itself is substantively unconscionable because the <em>quid pro quo</em> he was supposed to receive for it\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cin exchange for initially allowing an arbitrator to decide certain gateway questions,\xe2\x80\x9d he would receive \xe2\x80\x9cplenary post-arbitration judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was eliminated by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent holding in <em>Hall Street Associates, L.

We have treated this holding as a severability rule: When a party challenges a contract, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not specifically its arbitration provisions, those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/440/index.html">546 U.

In this case we are concerned with the first of these categories: whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement.  This is an issue the FAA assigns to the courts.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Section 2 of the FAA dictates that covered arbitration agreements \xe2\x80\x9cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]uch grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d which relate to contract validity and formation, include the claim at issue in this case, unconscionability.  See <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casarotto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/681/index.html">517 U. S. 681</a>, 687 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two different lines of cases bear on the issue of <em>who </em>decides a question of arbitrability respecting validity, such as whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.  Although this issue, as a gateway matter, is typically for the court, we have explained that such an issue can be delegated to the arbitrator in some circumstances.  When the parties have purportedly done so, courts must examine two distinct rules to decide whether the delegation is valid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first line of cases looks to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  In <em>AT&amp;T Technologies</em>, we stated that \xe2\x80\x9cquestion[s] of arbitrability\xe2\x80\x9d may be delegated to the arbitrator, so long as the delegation is clear and unmistakable.  475 U. S., at 649.  We reaffirmed this rule, and added some nuance, in <em>First Options</em>.  Against the background presumption that questions of arbitrability go to the court, we stated that federal courts should \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally\xe2\x80\x9d apply \xe2\x80\x9cordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts\xe2\x80\x9d to assess \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter (including arbitrability).\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U. S., at 944.  But, we added, a more rigorous standard applies when the inquiry is whether the parties have \xe2\x80\x9cagreed to arbitrate arbitrability\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cCourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that they did so.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).<em> </em> Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous opinion for the Court described this standard as a type of \xe2\x80\x9crevers[e]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]\xe2\x80\x94one in favor of a judicial, rather than an arbitral, forum.  <em>Id.</em>, at 945.  Clear and unmistakable \xe2\x80\x9cevidence\xe2\x80\x9d of agreement to arbitrate arbitrability might include, as was urged in <em>First Options</em>, a course of conduct demonstrating assent,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] <em>id.</em>, at 946, or, as is urged in this case, an express agreement to do so.  In any event, whether such evidence exists is a matter for the court to determine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second line of cases bearing on who decides the validity of an arbitration agreement, as the Court explains, involves the <em>Prima Paint</em> rule.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  That rule recognizes two types of validity challenges.  One type challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself, on a ground arising from an infirmity in that agreement.  The other challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement tangentially\xe2\x80\x94via a claim that the entire contract (of which the arbitration agreement is but a part) is invalid for some reason.  See <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at 444.  Under <em>Prima Paint</em>, a challenge of the first type goes to the court; a challenge of the second type goes to the arbitrator.  See 388 U. S., at 403\xe2\x80\x93404; see also <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at 444\xe2\x80\x93445.  The <em>Prima Paint</em> rule is akin to a pleading standard, whereby a party seeking to challenge the validity of an arbitration agreement must expressly say so in order to get his dispute into court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, questions related to the validity of an arbitration agreement are usually matters for a court to resolve before it refers a dispute to arbitration.  But questions of arbitrability may go to the arbitrator in two instances: (1) when the parties have demonstrated, clearly and unmistakably, that it is their intent to do so; or (2) when the validity of an arbitration agreement depends exclusively on the validity of the substantive contract of which it is a part.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">II</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We might have resolved this case by simply applying the <em>First Options</em> rule:<em> </em>Does the arbitration agreement at issue \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and unmistakably\xe2\x80\x9d evince petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s intent to submit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator?[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The answer to that question is no.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable undermines any suggestion that he \xe2\x80\x9cclearly\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunmistakably\xe2\x80\x9d assented to submit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7208, Comment <em>d</em> (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9c[G]ross inequality of bargaining power, together with terms unreasonably favorable to the stronger party, may confirm indications that the transaction involved elements of deception or compulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no meaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact assent or appear to assent to the unfair terms\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>American Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wolens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/219/index.html">513 U.

This case well illustrates the point: If respondent\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionability claim is correct\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, if the terms of the agreement are so one-sided and the process of its making so unfair\xe2\x80\x94it would contravene the existence of clear and unmistakable assent to arbitrate the very question petitioner now seeks to arbitrate.  Accordingly, it is necessary for the court to resolve the merits of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionability claim in order to decide whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement under \xc2\xa72.  Otherwise, that section\xe2\x80\x99s preservation of revocation issues for the Court would be meaningless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is, in essence, how I understand the Court of Appeals to have decided the issue below.  See 581 F.\xc2\xa03d 912, 917 (CA9 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e hold that where, as here, a party challenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to the agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court\xe2\x80\x9d).  I would therefore affirm its judgment, leaving, as it did, the merits of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionability claim for the District Court to resolve on remand.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than apply <em>First Options</em>, the Court takes us down a different path, one neither briefed by the parties nor relied upon by the Court of Appeals.  In applying <em>Prima Paint</em>, the Court has unwisely extended a \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic\xe2\x80\x9d and likely erroneous decision.  388 U. S., at 407 (Black, J., dissenting).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained at the outset, see <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x937, this case lies at a seeming crossroads in our arbitration jurisprudence.  It implicates cases such as <em>First Options</em>, which address whether the parties intended to delegate questions of arbitrability, and also those cases, such as<em> Prima Paint</em>, which address the severability of a presumptively valid arbitration agreement from a potentially invalid contract.  The question of \xe2\x80\x9cWho decides?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94arbitrator or court\xe2\x80\x94animates both lines of cases, but they are driven by different concerns.  In cases like <em>First Options</em>, we are concerned with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intentions.  In cases like <em>Prima Paint</em>, we are concerned with <em>how</em> the parties challenge the validity of the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the <em>Prima Paint </em>inquiry, recall, we consider whether the parties are actually challenging the validity of the arbitration<em> </em>agreement, or whether they are challenging, more generally, the contract within which an arbitration clause is nested.  In the latter circumstance, we assume there is no infirmity <em>per se</em> with the arbitration agreement, <em>i.e.</em>, there are no grounds for revocation of the arbitration agreement itself under \xc2\xa72 of the FAA.  Accordingly, we commit the parties\xe2\x80\x99 general contract dispute to the arbitrator, as agreed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The claim in <em>Prima Paint </em>was that one party would not have agreed to contract with the other for services had it known the second party was insolvent (a fact known but not disclosed at the time of contracting).  388 U. S., at 398.  There was, therefore, allegedly fraud in the inducement of the contract\xe2\x80\x94a contract which also delegated disputes to an arbitrator.  Despite the fact that the claim raised would have, if successful, rendered the embedded arbitration clause void, the Court held that the merits of the dispute were for the arbitrator, so long as the claim of \xe2\x80\x9cfraud in the inducement\xe2\x80\x9d did not go to validity of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the arbitration clause</em> itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 403 (emphasis added).  Because, in <em>Prima Paint</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cno claim ha[d] been advanced by Prima Paint that [respondent] fraudulently induced it to enter into the agreement to arbitrate,\xe2\x80\x9d and because the arbitration agreement was broad enough to cover the dispute, the arbitration agreement was enforceable with respect to the controversy at hand.  <em>Id.</em>, at 406.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Prima Paint</em> rule has been denominated as one related to severability.  Our opinion in <em>Buckeye</em>, set out these guidelines:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.  Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  546 U. S., at 445\xe2\x80\x93446.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhether the general contract defense renders the entire agreement void or voidable is irrelevant.  <em>Id.</em>, at 446.  All that matters is whether the party seeking to present the issue to a court has brought a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Preston</em> v. <em>Ferrer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/346/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/346/index.html">552 U. S. 346</a>, 354 (2008), \xe2\x80\x9cto the validity of the \xe2\x80\xa6 arbitration clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S.,<em> </em>at 449.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Prima Paint </em>and its progeny allow a court to pluck from a potentially invalid <em>contract</em> a potentially valid <em>arbitration agreement</em>.  Today the Court adds a new layer of severability\xe2\x80\x94something akin to Russian nesting dolls\xe2\x80\x94into the mix: Courts may now pluck from a potentially invalid <em>arbitration agreement</em> even narrower provisions that refer particular arbitrability disputes to an arbitrator.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  I do not think an agreement to arbitrate can ever manifest a clear and unmistakable intent to arbitrate its own validity.  But even assuming otherwise, I certainly would not hold that the <em>Prima Paint </em>rule extends this far.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, a general revocation challenge to a standalone arbitration agreement is, invariably, a challenge to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98making\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the arbitration agreement itself, <em>Prima Paint</em>, 388 U. S., at 403, and therefore, under <em>Prima Paint</em>, must be decided by the court.  A claim of procedural unconscionability aims to undermine the formation of the arbitration agreement, much like a claim of unconscionability aims to undermine the clear-and-unmistakable-intent requirement necessary for a valid delegation of a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete\xe2\x80\x9d challenge to the validity of the arbitration agreement itself, <em>Preston</em>, 552 U. S., at 354.  Moreover, because we are dealing in this case with a challenge to an independently executed arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x94rather than a clause contained in a contract related to another subject matter\xe2\x80\x94any challenge to the contract itself is also, necessarily, a challenge to the arbitration agreement.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  They are one and the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, reads the delegation clause as a distinct mini-arbitration agreement divisible from the contract in which it resides\xe2\x80\x94which just so happens also to be an arbitration agreement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Although the Court simply declares that it \xe2\x80\x9cmakes no difference\xe2\x80\x9d that the underlying subject matter of the agreement is itself an arbitration agreement, <em>ante</em>, at 7, that proposition does not follow from\xe2\x80\x94rather it is at odds with\xe2\x80\x94<em>Prima Paint</em>\xe2\x80\x99s severability rule. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Had the parties in this case executed only one contract, on two sheets of paper\xe2\x80\x94one sheet with employment terms, and a second with arbitration terms\xe2\x80\x94the contract would look much like the one in <em>Buckeye</em>.  There would be some substantive terms, followed by some arbitration terms, including what we now call a delegation clause\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a sentence or two assigning to the arbitrator any disputes related to the validity of the arbitration provision.  See <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at 442.  If respondent then came into court claiming that the contract was illegal as a whole for some reason unrelated to the arbitration provision, the <em>Prima Paint</em> rule would apply, and such a general challenge to the subject matter of the contract would go to the arbitrator.  Such a challenge would not call into question the making of the arbitration agreement or its invalidity <em>per se</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before today, however, if respondent instead raised a challenge specific to \xe2\x80\x9cthe validity of the agreement to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, that the agreement to arbitrate was void under state law\xe2\x80\x94the challenge would have gone to the court.  That is what <em>Buckeye</em> says.  See 546 U. S., at 444.  But the Court now declares that <em>Prima Paint</em>\xe2\x80\x99s pleading rule requires more: A party must lodge a challenge with even greater specificity than what would have satisfied the <em>Prima Paint</em> Court.  A claim that an <em>entire</em> arbitration agreement is invalid will not go to the court unless the party challenges the<em> particular sentences</em> that delegate such claims to the arbitrator, on some contract ground that is particular and unique to those sentences.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would seem the Court reads <em>Prima Paint</em> to require, as a matter of course, infinite layers of severability: We must always pluck from an arbitration agreement the specific delegation mechanism that would\xe2\x80\x94but for present judicial review\xe2\x80\x94commend the matter to arbitration, even if this delegation clause is but one sentence within one paragraph within a standalone agreement.  And, most importantly, the party must identify this one sentence and lodge a specific challenge to its validity.  Otherwise, he will be bound to pursue his validity claim in arbitration.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if limited to separately executed arbitration agreements, however, such an infinite severability rule is divorced from the underlying rationale of <em>Prima Paint</em>.  The notion that a party may be bound by an arbitration clause in a contract that is nevertheless invalid may be difficult for any lawyer\xe2\x80\x94or any person\xe2\x80\x94to accept, but this is the law of <em>Prima Paint</em>.  It reflects a judgment that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98national policy favoring arbitration,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Preston</em>, 552 U. S., at 353, outweighs the interest in preserving a judicial forum for questions of arbitrability\xe2\x80\x94<em>but only when questions of arbitrability are bound up in an underlying dispute</em>.  <em>Prima Paint</em>, 388 U. S., at 404.  When the two are so bound up, there is actually no gateway matter at all: The question \xe2\x80\x9cWho decides\xe2\x80\x9d is the entire ball game.  Were a court to decide the fraudulent inducement question in <em>Prima Paint</em>, in order to decide the antecedent question of the validity of the included arbitration agreement, then it would also, necessarily, decide the merits of the underlying dispute.  Same, too, for the question of illegality in <em>Buckeye;</em> on its way to deciding the arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x99s validity, the court would have to decide whether the contract was illegal, and in so doing, it would decide the merits of the entire dispute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, however, resolution of the unconscionability question will have no bearing on the merits of the underlying employment dispute.  It will only, as a preliminary matter, resolve who should decide the merits of that dispute.  Resolution of the unconscionability question will, however, decide whether the arbitration agreement <em>itself </em>is \xe2\x80\x9cvalid\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9csuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  As <em>Prima Paint</em> recognizes, the FAA commits those gateway matters, specific to the arbitration agreement, to the court.  388 U. S., at 403\xe2\x80\x93404.  Indeed, it is clear that the present controversy over whether the arbitration agreement is unconscionable is <em>itself</em> <em>severable</em> from the merits of the underlying dispute, which involves a claim of employment discrimination.  This is true for all gateway matters, and for this reason <em>Prima Paint</em> has no application in this case.  </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I may have to accept the \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic\xe2\x80\x9d holding in <em>Prima Paint</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 407 (Black, J., dissenting),<em> </em>I most certainly do not accept the Court\xe2\x80\x99s even more fantastic reasoning today.
