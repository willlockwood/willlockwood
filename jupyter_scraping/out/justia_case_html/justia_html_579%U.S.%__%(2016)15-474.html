Williams was the chief executive officer of Star Scientific, a Virginia-based company that had developed Anatabloc, a nutritional supplement made from anatabine, a compound found in tobacco.  Star Scientific hoped that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s public universities would perform research studies on anatabine, and Williams wanted Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in obtaining those studies.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">To convict the McDonnells, the Government was required to show that Governor McDonnell committed (or agreed to commit) an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in exchange for the loans and gifts.  An \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\xe2\x80\x99s official capacity, or in such official\xe2\x80\x99s place of trust or profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).  According to the Government, Governor McDonnell committed at least five \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9carranging meetings\xe2\x80\x9d for Williams with other Virginia officials to discuss Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s product, \xe2\x80\x9chosting\xe2\x80\x9d events for Star Scientific at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion, and \xe2\x80\x9ccontacting other government officials\xe2\x80\x9d concerning the research studies.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The case was tried before a jury.  The District Court instructed the jury that \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cacts that a public official customarily performs,\xe2\x80\x9d including acts \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of longer-term goals\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 69\xe2\x80\x9370.  Governor McDonnell requested that the court further instruct the jury that \xe2\x80\x9cmerely arranging a meeting, attending an event, hosting a reception, or making a speech are not, standing alone, \xe2\x80\x98official acts,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but the District Court declined to give that instruction.  792 F.\xc2\xa03d 478, 513 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The jury convicted Governor McDonnell.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Governor McDonnell moved to vacate his convictions on the ground that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in the jury instructions was erroneous.  He also moved for acquittal, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to convict him, and that the Hobbs Act and honest services statute were unconstitutionally vague.  The District Court denied the motions, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0An \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d is a decision or action on a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  That question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power, and must also be something specific and focused that is \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d before a public official.  To qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d the public official must make a decision or take an action on that question or matter, or agree to do so.  Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event\xe2\x80\x94without more\xe2\x80\x94does not fit that definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Government argues that the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses nearly any activity by a public official concerning any subject, including a broad policy issue such as Virginia economic development.  Governor McDonnell, in contrast, contends that statutory context compels a more circumscribed reading.  Taking into account text, precedent, and constitutional concerns, the Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading and adopts a more bounded interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Section 201(a)(3) sets forth two requirements for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, the Government must identify a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cmay at any time be pending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d before a public official.  Second, the Government must prove that the public official made a decision or took an action \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d or agreed to do so.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The first inquiry is whether a typical meeting, call, or event is itself a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  The terms \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csuit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d connote a formal exercise of governmental power, such as a lawsuit, hearing, or administrative determination.  Although it may be difficult to define the precise reach of those terms, a typical meeting, call, or event does not qualify.  \xe2\x80\x9cQuestion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d could be defined more broadly, but under the familiar interpretive canon <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, a \xe2\x80\x9cword is known by the company it keeps.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jarecki</i> v. <i>G.\xc2\xa0D. Searle &amp; Co.</i>,\n\n367 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303\n.  Because a typical meeting, call, or event is not of the same stripe as a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee, it does not count as a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).  That more limited reading also comports with the presumption \xe2\x80\x9cthat statutory language is not superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Murphy</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 291\n, n.\xc2\xa01.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Because a typical meeting, call, or event is not itself a question or matter, the next step is to determine whether arranging a meeting, contacting another official, or hosting an event may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision or action\xe2\x80\x9d <i>on </i>a different question or matter.  That first requires the Court to establish what counts as a question or matter in this case.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Section 201(a)(3) states that the question or matter must be \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cany public official.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cPending\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d suggest something that is relatively circumscribed\xe2\x80\x94the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda, tracked for progress, and then checked off as complete.  \xe2\x80\x9cMay <i>by law</i> be brought\xe2\x80\x9d conveys something within the specific duties of an official\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Although the District Court determined that the relevant matter in this case could be considered at a much higher level of generality as \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia business and economic development,\xe2\x80\x9d Supp. App. 88, the pertinent matter must instead be more focused and concrete.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Fourth Circuit identified at least three such questions or matters: (1) whether researchers at Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s state universities would initiate a study of Anatabloc; (2) whether Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Tobacco Commission would allocate grant money for studying anatabine; and (3) whether Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s health plan for state employees would cover Anatabloc.  The Court agrees that those qualify as questions or matters under \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0The question remains whether merely setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling another official qualifies as a decision or action on any of those three questions or matters.  It is apparent from <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal.</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398\n, that the answer is no.  Something more is required: \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) specifies that the public official must make a decision or take an action <i>on</i> the question or matter, or agree to do so.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">For example, a decision or action to initiate a research study would qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  A public official may also make a decision or take an action by using his official position to exert pressure on <i>another</i> official to perform an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d or by using his official position to provide advice to another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d by another official.  A public official is not required to actually make a decision or take an action on a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d; it is enough that he agree to do so.  Setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling an official (or agreeing to do so) merely to talk about a research study or to gather additional information, however, does not qualify as a decision or action on the pending question of whether to initiate the study.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s expansive interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d would raise significant constitutional concerns.  Conscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents, contact other officials on their behalf, and include them in events all the time.  Representative government assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act appropriately on their concerns.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position could cast a pall of potential prosecution over these relationships.  This concern is substantial, as recognized by White House counsel from every administration from that of President Reagan to President Obama, as well as two bipartisan groups of former state attorneys general.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation also raises due process and federalism concerns.  Pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jury instructions were erroneous, and the jury may have convicted Governor McDonnell for conduct that is not unlawful.  Because the errors in the jury instructions are not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court vacates Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The jury instructions lacked important qualifications, rendering them significantly overinclusive.  First, they did not adequately explain to the jury how to identify the pertinent \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is possible the jury thought that a typical meeting, call, or event was itself a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  If so, the jury could have convicted Governor McDonnell without finding that he committed or agreed to commit an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d as properly defined.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Second, the instructions did not inform the jury that the \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d must be more specific and focused than a broad policy objective.  As a result, the jury could have thought that the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d was something as nebulous as Virginia economic development, and convicted Governor McDonnell on that basis.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Third, the District Court did not instruct the jury that to convict Governor McDonnell, it had to find that he made a decision or took an action\xe2\x80\x94or agreed to do so\xe2\x80\x94on the identified \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d as properly defined.  At trial, several of Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s subordinates testified that he asked them to attend a meeting, not that he expected them to do anything other than that.  If that testimony reflects what Governor McDonnell agreed to do at the time he accepted the loans and gifts from Williams, then he did not agree to make a decision or take an action on any of the three questions or matters described by the Fourth Circuit.  Pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Governor McDonnell raises two additional claims.  First, he argues that the honest services statute and the Hobbs Act are unconstitutionally vague.  The Court rejects that claim.  For purposes of this case, the parties defined those statutes with reference to \xc2\xa7201 of the federal bribery statute.  Because the Court interprets the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) in a way that avoids the vagueness concerns raised by Governor McDonnell, it declines to invalidate those statutes under the facts here.  Second, Governor McDonnell argues that there is insufficient evidence that he committed an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d or agreed to do so.  Because the parties have not had an opportunity to address that question in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court leaves it for the Court of Appeals to resolve in the first instance.

The charges related to the acceptance by the McDonnells of $175,000 in loans, gifts, and other benefits from Virginia businessman Jonnie Williams, while Governor McDonnell was in office.  Williams was the chief executive officer of Star Scientific, a Virginia-based company that had developed a nutritional supplement made from anatabine, a compound found in tobacco.

The parties did not agree, however, on what counts as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government alleged in the indictment, and maintains on appeal, that Governor McDonnell committed at least five \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those acts included \xe2\x80\x9carranging meetings\xe2\x80\x9d for Williams with other Virginia officials to discuss Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s product, \xe2\x80\x9chosting\xe2\x80\x9d events for Star Scientific at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion, and \xe2\x80\x9ccontacting other government officials\xe2\x80\x9d concerning studies of anatabine.  Supp. App. 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  The Government also argued more broadly that these activities constituted \xe2\x80\x9cofficial action\xe2\x80\x9d because they related to Vir-ginia business development, a priority of Governor Mc-Donnell\xe2\x80\x99s administration.  Governor McDonnell contends that merely setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or contacting an official\xe2\x80\x94without more\xe2\x80\x94does not count as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At trial, the District Court instructed the jury according to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad understanding of what constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d and the jury convicted both Governor and Mrs. McDonnell on the bribery charges.

His campaign slogan was \xe2\x80\x9cBob\xe2\x80\x99s for Jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d and his focus in office was on promoting business in Virginia.  As Governor, McDonnell spoke about economic development in Virginia \xe2\x80\x9con a daily basis\xe2\x80\x9d and attended numerous \xe2\x80\x9cevents, ribbon cuttings,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplant facility openings.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 4093, 5241.  He also referred thousands of constituents to meetings with members of his staff and other government officials.

Williams was the CEO of Star Scientific, a Virginia-based company that developed and marketed Anatabloc, a nutritional supplement made from anatabine, a compound found in tobacco.  Star Scientific hoped to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval of Anatabloc as an anti-inflammatory drug.  An important step in securing that approval was initiating independent research studies on the health benefits of anatabine.  Star Scientific hoped Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s public universities would undertake such studies, pursuant to a grant from Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Tobacco Commission.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Governor McDonnell first met Williams in 2009, when Williams offered McDonnell transportation on his private airplane to assist with McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s election campaign.  Shortly after the election, Williams had dinner with Governor and Mrs. McDonnell at a restaurant in New York.  The conversation turned to Mrs. McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s search for a dress for the inauguration, which led Williams to offer to purchase a gown for her.  Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s counsel later instructed Williams not to buy the dress, and Mrs. McDonnell told Williams that she would take a rain check.  <i>Id.</i>, at 2203\xe2\x80\x932209.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In October 2010, Governor McDonnell and Williams met again on Williams\xe2\x80\x99s plane.

Governor McDonnell agreed to introduce Williams to Dr. William Hazel, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary of Health and Human Resources.

Shortly before the event, Williams took Mrs. McDonnell on a shopping trip and bought her $20,000 worth of designer clothing.  The McDonnells later had Williams over for dinner at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion, where they discussed research studies on Anatabloc.  <i>Id.</i>, at 6560.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two days after that dinner, Williams had an article about Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s research e-mailed to Mrs. McDonnell, which she forwarded to her husband.  Less than an hour later, Governor McDonnell texted his sister to discuss the financial situation of certain rental properties they owned in Virginia Beach.  Governor McDonnell also e-mailed his daughter to ask about expenses for her upcoming wedding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next day, Williams returned to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion for a meeting with Mrs. McDonnell.  At the meeting, Mrs. McDonnell described the family\xe2\x80\x99s financial problems, including their struggling rental properties in Virginia Beach and their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s wedding expenses.  Mrs. McDonnell, who had experience selling nutritional supplements, told Williams that she had a background in the area and could help him with Anatabloc.

According to Williams, Governor McDonnell thanked him for his help.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Governor McDonnell testified, in contrast, that he did not know about the loan at the time, and that when he learned of it he was upset that Mrs. McDonnell had requested the loan from Williams.  <i>Id.,</i> at 6095\xe2\x80\x936096.  Three days after the meeting between Williams and Mrs. McDonnell, Governor McDonnell directed his assistant to forward the article on Star Scientific to Dr. Hazel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In June 2011, Williams sent Mrs. McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff a letter containing a proposed research protocol for the Anatabloc studies.  The letter was addressed to Governor McDonnell, and it suggested that the Governor \xe2\x80\x9cuse the attached protocol to initiate the \xe2\x80\x98Virginia Study\xe2\x80\x99 of Anatabloc at the Medical College of Virginia and the University of Virginia School of Medicine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 2254.  Governor McDonnell gave the letter to Dr. Hazel.  <i>Id.,</i> at 6121\xe2\x80\x936122.  Williams testified at trial that he did not \xe2\x80\x9crecall any response\xe2\x80\x9d to the letter.  <i>Id.,</i> at 2256.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In July 2011, the McDonnell family visited Williams\xe2\x80\x99s vacation home for the weekend, and Governor McDonnell borrowed Williams\xe2\x80\x99s Ferrari while there.  Shortly thereafter, Governor McDonnell asked Dr. Hazel to send an aide to a meeting with Williams and Mrs. McDonnell to discuss research studies on Anatabloc.  The aide later testified that she did not feel pressured by Governor or Mrs. McDonnell to do \xe2\x80\x9canything other than have the meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Williams did not ask anything of her at the meeting.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3075.  After the meeting, the aide sent Williams a \xe2\x80\x9cpolite blow-off\xe2\x80\x9d e-mail.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3081.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At a subsequent meeting at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion, Mrs. McDonnell admired Williams\xe2\x80\x99s Rolex and mentioned that she wanted to get one for Governor McDonnell.  Williams asked if Mrs. McDonnell wanted him to purchase a Rolex for the Governor, and Mrs. McDonnell responded, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that would be nice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 2274.  Williams did so, and Mrs. McDonnell later gave the Rolex to Governor McDonnell as a Christmas present.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In August 2011, the McDonnells hosted a lunch event for Star Scientific at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion.  According to Williams, the purpose of the event was to launch Anatabloc.  See <i>id.</i>, at 2278.  According to Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s gubernatorial counsel, however, it was just lunch.  See <i>id.</i>, at 3229\xe2\x80\x933231.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The guest list for the event included researchers at the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University.  During the event, Star Scientific distributed free samples of Anatabloc, in addition to eight $25,000 checks that researchers could use in preparing grant proposals for studying Anatabloc.  Governor McDonnell asked researchers at the event whether they thought \xe2\x80\x9cthere was some scientific validity\xe2\x80\x9d to Anatabloc and \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not there was any reason to explore this further.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3344.  He also asked whether this could \xe2\x80\x9cbe something good for the Commonwealth, particularly as it relates to economy or job creation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  When Williams asked Governor McDonnell whether he would support funding for the research studies, Governor McDonnell \xe2\x80\x9cvery politely\xe2\x80\x9d replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have limited decision-making power in this area.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3927.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In January 2012, Mrs. McDonnell asked Williams for an additional loan for the Virginia Beach rental properties, and Williams agreed.  On February 3, Governor McDonnell followed up on that conversation by calling Williams to discuss a $50,000 loan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Several days later, Williams complained to Mrs. McDonnell that the Virginia universities were not returning Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s calls.  She passed Williams\xe2\x80\x99s complaint on to the Governor.  While Mrs. McDonnell was driving with Governor McDonnell, she also e-mailed Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, stating that the Governor \xe2\x80\x9cwants to know why nothing has developed\xe2\x80\x9d with the research studies after Williams had provided the eight $25,000 checks for preparing grant proposals, and that the Governor \xe2\x80\x9cwants to get this going\xe2\x80\x9d at the universities.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3214, 4931.  According to Governor McDonnell, how-ever, Mrs. McDonnell acted without his knowledge or per-mission, and he never made the statements she attributed to him.  <i>Id.,</i> at 6306\xe2\x80\x936308.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On February 16, Governor McDonnell e-mailed Williams to check on the status of documents related to the $50,000 loan.  A few minutes later, Governor McDonnell e-mailed his counsel stating, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease see me about Anatabloc issues at VCU and UVA.  Thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3217.  Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s counsel replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWill do.  We need to be careful with this issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The next day, Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s counsel called Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s lobbyist in order to \xe2\x80\x9cchange the expectations\xe2\x80\x9d of Star Scientific regarding the involvement of the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Office in the studies.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3219.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the end of February, Governor McDonnell hosted a healthcare industry reception at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion, which Williams attended.  Mrs. McDonnell also invited a number of guests recommended by Williams, including researchers at the Virginia universities.  Governor McDonnell was present, but did not mention Star Scientific, Williams, or Anatabloc during the event.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3671\xe2\x80\x933672.  That same day, Governor McDonnell and Williams spoke about the $50,000 loan, and Williams loaned the money to the McDonnells shortly thereafter.  <i>Id.,</i> at 2306, 2353.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In March 2012, Governor McDonnell met with Lisa Hicks-Thomas, the Virginia Secretary of Administration, and Sara Wilson, the Director of the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s health plan for state employees.  At that time, Governor McDonnell was taking Anatabloc several times a day.  He took a pill during the meeting, and told Hicks-Thomas and Wilson that the pills \xe2\x80\x9cwere working well for him\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwould be good for\xe2\x80\x9d state employees.  <i>Id.</i>, at 4227.  Hicks-Thomas recalled Governor McDonnell asking them to meet with a representative from Star Scientific; Wilson had no such recollection.  <i>Id.</i>, at 4219, 4227.  After the discussion with Governor McDonnell, Hicks-Thomas and Wilson looked up Anatabloc on the Internet, but they did not set up a meeting with Star Scientific or conduct any other follow-up.  <i>Id.</i>, at 4220, 4230.  It is undisputed that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s health plan for state employees does not cover nutritional supplements such as Anatabloc.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In May 2012, Governor McDonnell requested an additional $20,000 loan, which Williams provided.  Throughout this period, Williams also paid for several rounds of golf for Governor McDonnell and his children, took the McDonnells on a weekend trip, and gave $10,000 as a wedding gift to one of the McDonnells\xe2\x80\x99 daughters.  In total, Williams gave the McDonnells over $175,000 in gifts and loans.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In January 2014, Governor McDonnell was indicted for accepting payments, loans, gifts, and other things of value from Williams and Star Scientific in exchange for \xe2\x80\x9cperforming official actions on an as-needed basis, as opportunities arose, to legitimize, promote, and obtain research studies for Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s products.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 46.  The charges against him comprised one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, three counts of honest services fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act extortion, six counts of Hobbs Act extortion, and two counts of making a false statement.  See 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71343, 1349 (honest services fraud); \xc2\xa71951(a) (Hobbs Act extortion); \xc2\xa71014 (false statement).  Mrs. McDonnell was indicted on similar charges, plus obstructing official proceedings, based on her alleged involvement in the scheme.  See \xc2\xa71512(c)(2) (obstruction).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The theory underlying both the honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges was that Governor McDonnell had accepted bribes from Williams.  See <i>Skilling</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358,\n404 (2010)\n (construing honest services fraud to forbid \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Evans</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 255,\n260,\n269 (1992)\n (construing Hobbs Act extortion to include \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98taking a bribe\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The parties agreed that they would define honest services fraud with reference to the federal bribery statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201.  That statute makes it a crime for \xe2\x80\x9ca public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly\xe2\x80\x9d to demand, seek, receive, accept, or agree \xe2\x80\x9cto receive or accept anything of value\xe2\x80\x9d in return for being \xe2\x80\x9cinfluenced in the performance of any official act.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201(b)(2).  An \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\xe2\x80\x99s official capacity, or in such official\xe2\x80\x99s place of trust or profit.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The parties also agreed that obtaining a \xe2\x80\x9cthing of value .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. knowing that the thing of value was given in return for official action\xe2\x80\x9d was an element of Hobbs Act extortion, and that they would use the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d found in the federal bribery statute to define \xe2\x80\x9cofficial action\xe2\x80\x9d under the Hobbs Act.  792 F.\xc2\xa03d 478, 505 (CA4 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a result of all this, the Government was required to prove that Governor McDonnell committed or agreed to commit an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in exchange for the loans and gifts from Williams.  See <i>Evans</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 268 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe offense is completed at the time when the public official receives a payment in return for his agreement to perform specific official acts; fulfillment of the <i>quid pro quo </i>is not an element of the offense\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government alleged that Governor McDonnell had committed at least five \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">(1) \xe2\x80\x9carranging meetings for [Williams] with Virginia government officials, who were subordinates of the Governor, to discuss and promote Anatabloc\xe2\x80\x9d;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">(2) \xe2\x80\x9chosting, and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. attending, events at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion designed to encourage Virginia university researchers to initiate studies of anatabine and to promote Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s products to doctors for referral to their patients\xe2\x80\x9d;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">(3) \xe2\x80\x9ccontacting other government officials in the [Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Office] as part of an effort to encourage Vir-ginia state research universities to initiate studies of anatabine\xe2\x80\x9d;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">(4) \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s products and facilitating its relationships with Virginia government officials by allowing [Williams] to invite individuals important to Star Scientific\xe2\x80\x99s business to exclusive events at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion\xe2\x80\x9d; and</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">(5) \xe2\x80\x9crecommending that senior government officials in the [Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Office] meet with Star Scientific executives to discuss ways that the company\xe2\x80\x99s products could lower healthcare costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 47\xe2\x80\x9348(indictment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The case proceeded to a jury trial, which lasted five weeks.  Pursuant to an immunity agreement, Williams testified that he had given the gifts and loans to the McDonnells to obtain the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chelp with the testing\xe2\x80\x9d of Anatabloc at Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s medical schools.  App. 2234.  Governor McDonnell acknowledged that he had requested loans and accepted gifts from Williams.  He testified, however, that setting up meetings with government officials was something he did \xe2\x80\x9cliterally thousands of times\xe2\x80\x9d as Governor, and that he did not expect his staff \xe2\x80\x9cto do anything other than to meet\xe2\x80\x9d with Williams.  <i>Id.</i>, at 6042.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Several state officials testified that they had discussed Anatabloc with Williams or Governor McDonnell, but had not taken any action to further the research studies.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3739\xe2\x80\x933750 (Dr. Hazel), 3075\xe2\x80\x933077 (aide to Dr. Hazel), 4218\xe2\x80\x934220 (Sara Wilson), 4230\xe2\x80\x934231 (Lisa Hicks-Thomas).  A UVA employee in the university research office, who had never spoken with the Governor about Anatabloc, testified that she wrote a pro/con list concerning research studies on Anatabloc.  The first \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d was the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]erception to Governor that UVA would like to work with local companies,\xe2\x80\x9d and the first \xe2\x80\x9ccon\xe2\x80\x9d was the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]olitical pressure from Governor and impact on future UVA requests from the Governor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 4321, 4323 (Sharon Krueger).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Following closing arguments, the District Court instructed the jury that to convict Governor McDonnell it must find that he agreed \xe2\x80\x9cto accept a thing of value in exchange for official action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 68.  The court described the five alleged \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in the indictment, which involved arranging meetings, hosting events, and contacting other government officials.  The court then quoted the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x94as the Government had requested\xe2\x80\x94advised the jury that the term encompassed \xe2\x80\x9cacts that a public official customarily performs,\xe2\x80\x9d including acts \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of longer-term goals\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 69\xe2\x80\x9370.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Governor McDonnell had requested the court to further instruct the jury that the \xe2\x80\x9cfact that an activity is a routine activity, or a \xe2\x80\x98settled practice,\xe2\x80\x99 of an office-holder does not alone make it an \xe2\x80\x98official act,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cmerely arranging a meeting, attending an event, hosting a reception, or making a speech are not, standing alone, \xe2\x80\x98official acts,\xe2\x80\x99 even if they are settled practices of the official,\xe2\x80\x9d because they \xe2\x80\x9care not decisions on matters pending before the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 513 (internal quotation marks omitted).  He also asked the court to explain to the jury that an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d must intend to or \xe2\x80\x9cin fact influence a specific official decision the government actually makes\xe2\x80\x94such as awarding a contract, hiring a government em-ployee, issuing a license, passing a law, or implementing a regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a.  The District Court declined to give Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s proposed instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury convicted Governor McDonnell on the honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges, but acquitted him on the false statement charges.  Mrs. McDonnell was also convicted on most of the charges against her.  Although the Government requested a sentence of at least ten years for Governor McDonnell, the District Court sentenced him to two years in prison.  Mrs. McDonnell received a one-year sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Following the verdict, Governor McDonnell moved to vacate his convictions on the ground that the jury instructions \xe2\x80\x9cwere legally erroneous because they (i) allowed the jury to convict [him] on an erroneous understanding of \xe2\x80\x98official act,\xe2\x80\x99 and (ii) allowed a conviction on the theory that [he] accepted things of value that were given for future unspecified action.\xe2\x80\x9d  64 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 783, 787 (ED Va. 2014).  The District Court denied the motion.  <i>Id.,</i> at 802.  In addition, Governor McDonnell moved for acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to convict him, and that the Hobbs Act and honest services statute were unconstitutionally vague.

Mrs. McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s separate appeal remains pending before the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The issue in this case is the proper interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 201(a)(3) defines an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\xe2\x80\x99s official capacity, or in such official\xe2\x80\x99s place of trust or profit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to the Government, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress used intentionally broad language\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) to embrace \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any </i>decision or action, on <i>any </i>question or matter, that may at <i>any time</i> be pending, or which may by law be brought before <i>any</i> public official, in such official\xe2\x80\x99s official capac-ity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (Government\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis; alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Government concludes that the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d therefore encompasses nearly any activity by a public official.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d specifically includes arranging a meeting, contacting another public official, or hosting an event\xe2\x80\x94without more\xe2\x80\x94concerning any subject, including a broad policy issue such as Vir-ginia economic development.  <i>Id.,</i> at 47\xe2\x80\x9349; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Governor McDonnell, in contrast, contends that statu-tory context compels a more circumscribed reading, limiting \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts\xe2\x80\x9d to those acts that \xe2\x80\x9cdirect[\xc2\xa0] a particular resolution of a specific governmental decision,\xe2\x80\x9d or that pressure another official to do so.  Brief for Petitioner 44, 51.  He also claims that \xe2\x80\x9cvague corruption laws\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xc2\xa7201 implicate serious constitutional concerns, militating \xe2\x80\x9cin favor of a narrow, cautious reading of these criminal statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 21.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Taking into account the text of the statute, the precedent of this Court, and the constitutional concerns raised by Governor McDonnell, we reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) and adopt a more bounded interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under that interpretation, setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) sets forth two requirements for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d: First, the Government must identify a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cmay at any time be pending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d before a public official.  Second, the Government must prove that the public official made a decision or took an action \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x9d that question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy, or agreed to do so.  The issue here is whether arranging a meeting, contacting another official, or hosting an event\xe2\x80\x94without more\xe2\x80\x94can be a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d and if not, whether it can be a decision or action on a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first inquiry is whether a typical meeting, call, or event is itself a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government argues that nearly any activity by a public official qualifies as a question or matter\xe2\x80\x94from workaday functions, such as the typical call, meeting, or event, to the broadest issues the government confronts, such as fostering economic development.  We conclude, however, that the terms \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d do not sweep so broadly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The last four words in that list\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csuit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94connote a formal exercise of governmental power, such as a lawsuit, hearing, or administrative determination.

Al-though it may be difficult to define the precise reach of those terms, it seems clear that a typical meeting, telephone call, or event arranged by a public official does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But what about a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d?  A \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d could mean any \xe2\x80\x9csubject or aspect that is in dispute, open for discussion, or to be inquired into,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9csubject\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cinterest or relevance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1394, 1863 (1961).  If those meanings were adopted, a typical meeting, call, or event would qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d may also be interpreted more narrowly, however, as \xe2\x80\x9ca subject or point of debate or a proposition being or to be voted on in a meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a question \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the senate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 1863.

While \xe2\x80\x9cnot an inescapable rule,\xe2\x80\x9d this canon \xe2\x80\x9cis often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  For example, in <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561 (1995)\n, a statute defined the word \xe2\x80\x9cprospectus\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cprospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, letter, or communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 573\xe2\x80\x93574 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We held that although the word \xe2\x80\x9ccommunication\xe2\x80\x9d could in the abstract mean any type of communication, \xe2\x80\x9cit is apparent that the list refers to documents of wide dissemination,\xe2\x80\x9d and that inclusion \xe2\x80\x9cof the term \xe2\x80\x98communication\xe2\x80\x99 in that list suggests that it too refers to a public communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 575.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying that same approach here, we conclude that a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d must be similar in nature to a \xe2\x80\x9ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because a typical meeting, call, or event arranged by a public official is not of the same stripe as a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee, it does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That more limited reading also comports with the presumption \xe2\x80\x9cthat statutory language is not superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arlington Central School Dist.

If \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d were as unlimited in scope as the Government argues, the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d would serve no role in the statute\xe2\x80\x94every \xe2\x80\x9ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d would also be a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under a more confined interpretation, however, \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d may be understood to refer to a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a \xe2\x80\x9ccause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d but that does not necessarily fall into one of those prescribed categories.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because a typical meeting, call, or event is not itself a question or matter, the next step is to determine whether arranging a meeting, contacting another official, or hosting an event may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision or action\xe2\x80\x9d <i>on </i>a different question or matter.  That requires us to first establish what counts as a question or matter in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to the requirements we have described, \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) states that the question or matter must be \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cany public official.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cPending\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d suggest something that is relatively circumscribed\xe2\x80\x94the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda, tracked for progress, and then checked off as complete.  In particular, \xe2\x80\x9cmay <i>by law</i> be brought\xe2\x80\x9d conveys something within the specific duties of an official\xe2\x80\x99s position\xe2\x80\x94the function conferred by the authority of his office.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d conveys that the matter may be pending either before the public official who is performing the official act, or before another public official.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court, however, determined that the relevant matter in this case could be considered at a much higher level of generality as \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia business and economic development,\xe2\x80\x9d or\xe2\x80\x94as it was often put to the jury\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBob\xe2\x80\x99s for Jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 88; see, <i>e.g., </i>App. 1775, 2858, 2912, 3733.  Economic development is not naturally described as a matter \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d before a public official\xe2\x80\x94or something that may be brought \xe2\x80\x9cby law\xe2\x80\x9d before him\xe2\x80\x94any more than \xe2\x80\x9cjustice\xe2\x80\x9d is pending or may be brought by law before a judge, or \xe2\x80\x9cnational security\xe2\x80\x9d is pending or may be brought by law before an officer of the Armed Forces.  Under \xc2\xa7201(a)(3), the pertinent \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d must be more focused and concrete.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For its part, the Fourth Circuit found at least three questions or matters at issue in this case: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether researchers at any of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s state universities would initiate a study of Anatabloc\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the state-created Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9callocate grant money for the study of anatabine\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the health insurance plan for state employees in Virginia would include Anatabloc as a covered drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 515\xe2\x80\x93516.  We agree that those qualify as questions or matters under \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).  Each is focused and concrete, and each involves a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit, administrative determination, or hearing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question remains whether\xe2\x80\x94as the Government argues\xe2\x80\x94merely setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling another official qualifies as a decision or action on any of those three questions or matters.  Although the word \xe2\x80\x9cdecision,\xe2\x80\x9d and especially the word \xe2\x80\x9caction,\xe2\x80\x9d could be read expansively to support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, our opinion in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal.</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398 (1999)\n, rejects that interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Sun-Diamond</i>, the Court stated that it was not an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7201 for the President to host a championship sports team at the White House, the Secretary of Education to visit a high school, or the Secretary of Agriculture to deliver a speech to \xe2\x80\x9cfarmers concerning various matters of USDA policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 407.  We recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary of Agriculture <i>always</i> has before him or in prospect matters that affect farmers, just as the President always has before him or in prospect matters that affect college and professional sports, and the Secretary of Education matters that affect high schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But we concluded that the existence of such pending matters was not enough to find that any action related to them constituted an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  It was possible to avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cabsurdities\xe2\x80\x9d of convicting individuals on corruption charges for engaging in such conduct, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>through the definition of that term</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> i.e.</i>,<i> </i>by adopting a more limited definition of<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 408.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is apparent from <i>Sun-Diamond</i> that hosting an event, meeting with other officials, or speaking with interested parties is not, standing alone, a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision or action\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3), even if the event, meeting, or speech is related to a pending question or matter.  Instead, something more is required: \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) specifies that the public official must make a decision or take an action <i>on</i> that question or matter, or agree to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For example, a decision or action to initiate a research study\xe2\x80\x94or a decision or action on a qualifying step, such as narrowing down the list of potential research topics\xe2\x80\x94would qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  A public official may also make a decision or take an action on a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d by using his official position to exert pressure on <i>another </i>official to perform an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  In addition, if a public official uses his official position to provide advice to another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d by another official, that too can qualify as a decision or action for purposes of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Birdsall</i>,\n\n233 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223,\n234 (1914)\n (finding \xe2\x80\x9cofficial action\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of subordinates where their superiors \xe2\x80\x9cwould necessarily rely largely upon the reports and advice of subordinates .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. who were more directly acquainted with\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cfacts and circumstances of particular cases\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, a public official is not required to actually make a decision or take an action on a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d; it is enough that the official agree to do so.  See <i>Evans</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 268.  The agreement need not be explicit, and the public official need not specify the means that he will use to perform his end of the bargain.  Nor must the public official in fact intend to perform the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as he agrees to do so.  A jury could, for example, conclude that an agreement was reached if the evidence shows that the public official received a thing of value knowing that it was given with the expectation that the official would perform an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in return.  See<i> ibid.</i>  It is up to the jury, under the facts of the case, to determine whether the public official agreed to perform an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the alleged <i>quid pro quo</i>.  The jury may consider a broad range of pertinent evidence, including the nature of the transaction, to answer that question.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling an official (or agreeing to do so) merely to talk about a research study or to gather additional information, however, does not qualify as a decision or action on the pending question of whether to initiate the study.  Simply expressing support for the research study at a meeting, event, or call\xe2\x80\x94or sending a subordinate to such a meeting, event, or call\xe2\x80\x94similarly does not qualify as a decision or action on the study, as long as the public official does not intend to exert pressure on another official or provide advice, knowing or intending such advice to form the basis for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Otherwise, if every action somehow related to the research study were an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d the requirement that the public official make a decision or take an action on<i> </i>that study, or agree to do so, would be meaningless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, this is not to say that setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or making a phone call is always an innocent act, or is irrelevant, in cases like this one.  If an official sets up a meeting, hosts an event, or makes a phone call on a question or matter that is or could be pending before another official, that could serve as evidence of an agreement to take an official act.  A jury could conclude, for example, that the official was attempting to pressure or advise another official on a pending matter.  And if the official agreed to exert that pressure or give that advice in exchange for a thing of value, that would be illegal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government relies on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Birdsall</i> to support a more expansive interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d but <i>Birdsall</i> is fully consistent with our reading of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3).  We held in <i>Birdsall</i> that \xe2\x80\x9cofficial action\xe2\x80\x9d could be established by custom rather than \xe2\x80\x9cby statute\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca written rule or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d and need not be a formal part of an official\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process.  233 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 230\xe2\x80\x93231.  That does not mean, however, that every decision or action customarily performed by a public official\xe2\x80\x94such as the myriad decisions to refer a constituent to another official\xe2\x80\x94counts as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9cofficial action\xe2\x80\x9d at issue in <i>Birdsall </i>was \xe2\x80\x9cadvis[ing] the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, contrary to the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d that the facts of the case warranted granting leniency to certain defendants convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully selling liquor to Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 227\xe2\x80\x93230.  That \xe2\x80\x9cdecision or action\xe2\x80\x9d fits neatly within our understanding of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3): It reflected a decision or action to advise another official <i>on</i> the pending question whether to grant leniency.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d is a decision or action on a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee.  It must also be something specific and focused that is \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought\xe2\x80\x9d before a public official.  To qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d the public official must make a decision or take an action on that \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d or agree to do so.  That decision or action may include using his official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d or to advise another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d by another official.  Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so)\xe2\x80\x94without more\xe2\x80\x94does not fit that definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to being inconsistent with both text and precedent, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s expansive interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d would raise significant constitutional concerns.  Section 201 prohibits <i>quid pro quo </i>corruption\xe2\x80\x94the exchange of a thing of value for an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, nearly anything a public official accepts\xe2\x80\x94from a campaign contribution to lunch\xe2\x80\x94counts as a <i>quid</i>; and nearly anything a public official does\xe2\x80\x94from arranging a meeting to inviting a guest to an event\xe2\x80\x94counts as a <i>quo</i>.  See Brief for United States 14, 27; Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\xe2\x80\x9335, 44\xe2\x80\x9346.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But conscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents, contact other officials on their behalf, and include them in events all the time.  The basic compact underlying representative government <i>assumes </i>that public officials will hear from their constituents and act appropriately on their concerns\xe2\x80\x94whether it is the union official worried about a plant closing or the homeowners who wonder why it took five days to restore power to their neighborhood after a storm.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position could cast a pall of potential prosecution over these relationships if the union had given a campaign contribution in the past or the homeowners invited the official to join them on their annual outing to the ballgame.  Officials might wonder whether they could respond to even the most commonplace requests for assistance, and citizens with legitimate concerns might shrink from participating in democratic discourse.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This concern is substantial.  White House counsel who worked in every administration from that of President Reagan to President Obama warn that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbreathtaking expansion of public-corruption law would likely chill federal officials\xe2\x80\x99 interactions with the people they serve and thus damage their ability effectively to perform their duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Former Federal Officials as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6.

But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legal interpretation is not confined to cases involving extravagant gifts or large sums of money, and we cannotconstrue a criminal statute on the assumption that the Government will \xe2\x80\x9cuse it responsibly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Stevens</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460,\n480 (2010)\n.

Under the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98standardless sweep\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, <i>Kolender</i> v. <i>Lawson</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352,\n358 (1983)\n, public officials could be subject to prosecution, without fair notice, for the most prosaic interactions.  \xe2\x80\x9cInvoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison\xe2\x80\x9d for up to 15 years raises the serious concern that the provision \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not comport with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).  Our more constrained interpretation of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) avoids this \xe2\x80\x9cvagueness shoal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Skilling</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position also raises significant federalism concerns.  A State defines itself as a sovereign through \xe2\x80\x9cthe structure of its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452,\n460 (1991)\n.  That includes the prerogative to regulate the permissible scope of interactions between state officials and their constituents.  Here, where a more limited interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d is supported by both text and precedent, we decline to \xe2\x80\x9cconstrue the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting standards\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cgood government for local and state officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McNally</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350,\n360 (1987)\n; see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Enmons</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 396\n\xe2\x80\x93411 (1973) (rejecting a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad concept of extortion\xe2\x80\x9d that would lead to \xe2\x80\x9can unprecedented incursion into the criminal jurisdiction of the States\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Governor McDonnell argues that his convictions must be vacated because the jury was improperly instructed on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) of the federal bribery statute.  According to Governor McDonnell, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9crefused to convey any meaningful limits on \xe2\x80\x98official act,\xe2\x80\x99 giving an instruction that allowed the jury to convict [him] for lawful conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 51.  We agree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury instructions included the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial action,\xe2\x80\x9d and further defined the term to include \xe2\x80\x9cactions that have been clearly established by settled practice as part of a public official\xe2\x80\x99s position, even if the action was not taken pursuant to responsibilities explicitly assigned by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 69\xe2\x80\x9370.  The instructions also stated that \xe2\x80\x9cofficial actions may include acts that a public official customarily performs,\xe2\x80\x9d including acts \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of longer-term goals\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 70.  In light of our interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts,\xe2\x80\x9d those instructions lacked important qualifications, rendering them significantly overinclusive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the instructions did not adequately explain to the jury how to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  As noted, the Fourth Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government presented evidence of three questions or matters\xe2\x80\x9d: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether researchers at any of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s state universities would initiate a study of Anatabloc\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the state-created Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9callocate grant money for the study of anatabine\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the health insurance plan for state employees in Virginia would include Anatabloc as a covered drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 515\xe2\x80\x93516.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions is that they provided no assurance that the jury reached its verdict after finding those questions or matters.  The testimony at trial described how Governor McDonnell set up meetings, contacted other officials, and hosted events.  It is possible the jury thought that a typical meeting, call, or event was itself a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  If so, the jury could have convicted Governor McDonnell without finding that he committedor agreed to commit an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d as properly defined.  To prevent this problem, the District Court should have instructed the jury that it must identify a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d involving the formal exercise of governmental power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the instructions did not inform the jury that the \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d must be more specific and focused than a broad policy objective.  The Government told the jury in its closing argument that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever it was\xe2\x80\x9d Governor McDonnell had done, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all official action.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 263a\xe2\x80\x93264a.  Based on that remark, and the repeated references to \xe2\x80\x9cBob\xe2\x80\x99s for Jobs\xe2\x80\x9d at trial, the jury could have thought that the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d was something as nebulous as \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia business and economic development,\xe2\x80\x9d as the District Court itself concluded.  Supp. App. 87\xe2\x80\x9388 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe alleged official actions in this case were within the range of actions on questions, matters, or causes pending before McDonnell as Governor as multiple witnesses testified that Virginia business and economic development was a top priority in McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s administration\xe2\x80\x9d).  To avoid that misconception, the District Court should have instructed the jury that the pertinent \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d must be something specific and focused that is \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay by law be brought before any public official,\xe2\x80\x9d such as the question whether to initiate the research studies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the District Court did not instruct the jury that to convict Governor McDonnell, it had to find that he made a decision or took an action\xe2\x80\x94or agreed to do so\xe2\x80\x94<i>on</i> the identified \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d as we have construed that requirement.  At trial, several of Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s subordinates testified that he asked them to attend a meeting, not that he expected them to do anything other than that.  See, <i>e.g., </i>App. 3075, 3739\xe2\x80\x933740, 4220.  If that testimony reflects what Governor McDonnell agreed to do at the time he accepted the loans and gifts from Williams, then he did not agree to make a decision or take an action on any of the three questions or matters described by the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury may have disbelieved that testimony or found other evidence that Governor McDonnell agreed to exert pressure on those officials to initiate the research studies or add Anatabloc to the state health plan, but it is also possible that the jury convicted Governor McDonnell without finding that he agreed to make a decision or take an action on a properly defined \xe2\x80\x9cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  To forestall that possibility, the District Court should have instructed the jury that merely arranging a meeting or hosting an event to discuss a matter does not count as a decision or action on<i> </i>that matter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because the jury was not correctly instructed on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d it may have convicted Governor McDonnell for conduct that is not unlawful.  For that reason, we cannot conclude that the errors in the jury instructions were \xe2\x80\x9charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Neder </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n16 (1999)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  We accordingly vacate Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Governor McDonnell raises two additional claims.  First, he argues that the charges against him must be dismissed because the honest services statute and the Hobbs Act are unconstitutionally vague.  See Brief for Petitioner 58\xe2\x80\x9361.  We reject that claim.  For purposes of this case, the parties defined honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion with reference to \xc2\xa7201 of the federal bribery statute.  Because we have interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) in a way that avoids the vagueness concerns raised by Governor McDonnell, we decline to invalidate those statutes under the facts here.  See <i>Skilling</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 403 (seeking \xe2\x80\x9cto construe, not condemn, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactments\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Governor McDonnell argues that the charges must be dismissed because there is insufficient evidence that he committed an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d or that he agreed to do so.  Brief for Petitioner 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Because the parties have not had an opportunity to address that question in light of the interpretation of \xc2\xa7201(a)(3) adopted by this Court, we leave it for the Court of Appeals to resolve in the first instance.  If the court below determines that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to convict Governor McDonnell of committing or agreeing to commit an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act,\xe2\x80\x9d his case may be set for a new trial.  If the court instead determines that the evidence is insufficient, the charges against him must be dismissed.  We express no view on that question.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that.  But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns.  It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.  A more limited interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
