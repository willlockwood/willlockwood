He also is serving sentences for various other crimes, including rape, robbery, and escape.  At the Hawaii State Prison outside Honolulu, respondent was classified as a maximum security risk and placed in the maximum control unit.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Antone Olim is the Administrator of the Hawaii State Prison.  The other petitioners constituted a prison "Program Committee."  On August 2, 1976, the Committee held hearings to determine the reasons for a breakdown in discipline and the failure of certain programs within the prison\'s maximum control unit.  Inmates of the unit appeared at these hearings.  The Committee singled out respondent and another inmate as troublemakers.  On August 5, respondent received notice that the Committee, at a hearing to be held on August 10, would review his correctional program to determine whether his classification within the system should be changed and whether he should be transferred to another Hawaii facility or to a mainland institution. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 461 U. S. 241</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The August 10 hearing was conducted by the same persons who had presided over the hearings on August 2.  Respondent retained counsel to represent him.  The Committee recommended that respondent\'s classification as a maximum security risk be continued and that he be transferred to a prison on the mainland.  He received the following explanation from the Committee:</p>\n<p>"The Program Committee, having reviewed your entire file, your testimony and arguments by your counsel, concluded that your control classification remains at Maximum.  You are still considered a security risk in view of your escapes and subsequent convictions for serious felonies.  The Committee noted the progress you made in vocational training and your expressed desire to continue in this endeavor.  However, your relationship with staff, who reported that you threaten and intimidate them, raises grave concerns regarding your potential for further disruptive and violent behavior.  Since there is no other Maximum security prison in Hawaii which can offer you the correctional programs you require, and you cannot remain at [the maximum control unit] because of impending construction of a new facility, the Program Committee recommends your transfer to an institution on the mainland."</p>\n<p>App. 7-8.  Petitioner Olim, as Administrator, accepted the Committee\'s recommendation, and a few days later respondent was transferred to Folsom State Prison in California.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Rule IV of the Supplementary Rules and Regulations of the Corrections Division, Department of Social Services and Housing, State of Hawaii, approved in June, 1976, recites that the inmate classification process is not concerned with punishment.  Rather, it is intended to promote the best interests </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 461 U. S. 242</a></p><p> of the inmate, the State, and the prison community. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Paragraph 3 of Rule IV requires a hearing prior to a prison transfer involving "a grievous loss to the inmate," which the Rule defines "generally" as "a serious loss to a reasonable man."  App. 21. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Administrator, under  \xef\xbf\xbd 2 of the Rule, is required to establish "an impartial Program Committee" to conduct such a hearing, the Committee to be "composed of at least three members who were not actively involved in the process by which the inmate . . . was brought before the Committee."  App. 20.  Under \xef\xbf\xbd 3, the Committee must give the inmate written notice of the hearing, permit him, with certain stated exceptions, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, afford him an opportunity to be heard, and apprise him of the Committee\'s findings.  App. 21-24. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Committee is directed to make a recommendation to the Administrator, who then decides what action to take:</p>\n<p>"[The Administrator] may, as the final decisionmaker:"</p>\n<p>"(a) Affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, the recommendation; or"</p>\n<p>"(b) hold in abeyance any action he believes jeopardizes the safety, security, or welfare of the staff, inmate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 461 U. S. 243</a></p><p> . . . other inmates . . . , institution, or community and refer the matter back to the Program Committee for further study and recommendation."</p>\n<p>Rule IV, \xef\xbf\xbd 3d(3), App. 24.  The regulations contain no standards governing the Administrator\'s exercise of his discretion.  <em>See Lono v. Ariyoshi,</em> 63 Haw. 138, 144-145, 621 P.2d 976, 980-981 (1981).</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 against petitioners as the state officials who caused his transfer.  He alleged that he had been denied procedural due process because the Committee that recommended his transfer consisted of the same persons who had initiated the hearing, this being in specific violation of Rule IV, \xef\xbf\xbd 2, and because the Committee was biased against him.  The United States District Court for the District of Hawaii dismissed the complaint, holding that the Hawaii regulations governing prison transfers do not create a substantive liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  459 F.Supp. 473 (1978). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a divided vote, reversed. 664 F.2d 708 (1981).  It held that Hawaii had created a constitutionally protected liberty interest by promulgating Rule IV.  In so doing, the court declined to follow cases from other Courts of Appeals holding that certain procedures mandated by prison transfer regulations do not create a liberty interest.  <em>See, e.g., Cofone v. Manson,</em> 594 F.2d 934 (CA2 1979); <em>Lombardo v. Meachum,</em> 548 F.2d 13 (CA1 1977).  The court reasoned that Rule IV gives Hawaii prisoners a justifiable expectation that they will not be transferred to the mainland absent a hearing, before an impartial committee, concerning the facts alleged in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 461 U. S. 244</a></p><p> prehearing notice. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Because the Court of Appeals\' decision created a conflict among the Circuits, and because the case presents the further question whether the Due Process Clause in and of itself protects against interstate prison transfers, we granted certiorari.  456 U.S. 1005 (1982).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Meachum v. Fano,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html">427 U. S. 215</a></span> (176), and <em>Montanye v. Haymes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/236/case.html">427 U. S. 236</a></span> (1976), this Court held that an intrastate prison transfer does not directly implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In <em>Meachum,</em> inmates at a Massachusetts medium security prison had been transferred to a maximum security prison in that Commonwealth.  In <em>Montanye,</em> a companion case, an inmate had been. transferred from one maximum security New York prison to another as punishment for a breach of prison rules.  This Court rejected</p>\n<p>"the notion that <em>any</em> grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause."</p>\n<p><em>Meachum,</em> 427 U.S. at 224 (emphasis in original).  It went on to state:</p>\n<p>"The initial decision to assign the convict to a particular institution is not subject to audit under the Due Process Clause, although the degree of confinement in one prison may be quite different from that in another.  The conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant\'s liberty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 461 U. S. 245</a></p><p> interest to empower the State to confine him in <em>any</em> of its prisons."</p>\n<p>"Neither, in our view, does the Due Process Clause, in and of itself, protect a duly convicted prisoner against transfer from one institution to another within the state prison system.  Confinement in any of the State\'s institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 224-225 (emphasis in original).  The Court observed that, although prisoners retain a residuum of liberty, <em>see Wolff v. McDonnell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html">418 U. S. 539</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html#555">418 U. S. 555</a></span>-556 (1974), a holding that</p>\n<p>"<em>any</em> substantial deprivation imposed by prison authorities triggers the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would subject to judicial review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison administrators, rather than of the federal courts."</p>\n<p>427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#225">427 U. S. 225</a></span> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Applying the <em>Meachum</em> and <em>Montanye</em> principles in <em>Vitek v. Jones,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html">445 U. S. 480</a></span> (1980), this Court held that the transfer of an inmate from a prison to a mental hospital did implicate a liberty interest.  Placement in the mental hospital was "not within the range of conditions of confinement to which a prison sentence subjects an individual," because it brought about "consequences . . . qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html#493">445 U. S. 493</a></span>.  Respondent argues that the same is true of confinement of a Hawaii prisoner on the mainland, and that <em>Vitek</em> therefore controls.</p>\n<p>We do not agree.  Just as an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a State, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular State. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Often, confinement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 461 U. S. 246</a></p><p> in the inmate\'s home State will not be possible.  A person convicted of a federal crime in a State without a federal correctional facility usually will serve his sentence in another State.  Overcrowding and the need to separate particular prisoners may necessitate interstate transfers.  For any number of reasons, a State may lack prison facilities capable of providing appropriate correctional programs for all offenders.</p>\n<p>Statutes and interstate agreements recognize that, from time to time, it is necessary to transfer inmates to prisons in other States.  On the federal level, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5003(a) authorizes the Attorney General to contract with a State for the transfer of a state prisoner to a federal prison, whether in that State or another.  <em>See Howe v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/473/case.html">452 U. S. 473</a></span> (1981). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Title 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4002 (1976 ed. and Supp. V) permits the Attorney General to contract with any State for the placement of a federal prisoner in state custody for up to three years.  Neither statute requires that the prisoner remain in the State in which he was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p>On the state level, many States have statutes providing for the transfer of a state prisoner to a federal prison, <em>e.g.,</em> Haw. Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 353-18 (1976), or another State\'s prison, <em>e.g.,</em> Alaska Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 33.30.100 (1982).  Corrections compacts between States, implemented by statutes, authorize incarceration of a prisoner of one State in another State\'s prison.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 11189 (West 1382) (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); \xc2\xa7 11190 (codifying Western Interstate Corrections Compact); Conn.Gen.Stat. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 461 U. S. 247</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 18-102 (1981) (codifying New England Interstate Corrections Compact); \xc2\xa7 18-106 (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); Haw. Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 355-1 (1976) (codifying Western Interstate Corrections Compact); Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 20-701 (1979) (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); Ky.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 196.610 (1982) (same). And prison regulations such as Hawaii\'s Rule IV anticipate that inmates sometimes will be transferred to prisons in other States.</p>\n<p>In short, it is neither unreasonable nor unusual for an inmate to serve practically his entire sentence in a State other than the one in which he was convicted and sentenced, or to be transferred to an out-of-state prison after serving a portion of his sentence in his home State.  Confinement in another State, unlike confinement in a mental institution, is "within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose."  <em>Meachum,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#225">427 U. S. 225</a></span>. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Even when, as here, the transfer involves long distances and an ocean crossing, the confinement remains within constitutional limits.  The difference between such a transfer and an intrastate or interstate transfer of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 461 U. S. 248</a></p><p> shorter distance is a matter of degree, not of kind, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and <em>Meachum</em> instructs that "the determining factor is the nature of the interest involved, rather than its weight."  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#224">427 U. S. 224</a></span>.  The reasoning of <em>Meachum</em> and <em>Montanye</em> compels the conclusion that an interstate prison transfer, including one from Hawaii to California, does not deprive an inmate of any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in and of itself.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that Hawaii\'s prison regulations create a constitutionally protected liberty interest.  In <em>Meachum,</em> however, the State had</p>\n<p>"conferred no right on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 461 U. S. 249</a></p><p> prisoner to remain in the prison to which he was initially assigned, defeasible only upon proof of specific acts of misconduct,"</p>\n<p>427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#226">427 U. S. 226</a></span>, and "ha[d] not represented that transfers [would] occur only on the occurrence of certain events," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#228">427 U. S. 228</a></span>.  Because the State had retained "discretion to transfer [the prisoner] for whatever reason or for no reason at all," <em>ibid.,</em> the Court found that the State had not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest.  Similarly, because the state law at issue in <em>Montanye</em> "impose[d] no conditions on the discretionary power to transfer," 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/236/case.html#243">427 U. S. 243</a></span>, there was no basis for invoking the protections of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p>These cases demonstrate that a State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion.  An inmate must show "that particularized standards or criteria guide the State\'s decisionmakers."  <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html">452 U. S. 458</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html#467">452 U. S. 467</a></span> (1981) (BRENNAN, J., concurring).  If the decisionmaker is not "required to base its decisions on objective and defined criteria," but instead "can deny the requested relief for any constitutionally permissible reason or for no reason at all," <em>ibid.,</em> the State has not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html#466">452 U. S. 466</a></span>-467 (opinion of the Court); <em>see also Vitek v. Jones,</em> 445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html#488">445 U. S. 488</a></span>-491 (summarizing cases).</p>\n<p>Hawaii\'s prison regulations place no substantive limitations on official discretion, and thus create no liberty interest entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause.  As Rule IV itself makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of Hawaii has held in <em>Lono v. Ariyoshi,</em> 63 Haw. at 144-145, 621 P.2d at 980-981, the prison Administrator\'s discretion to transfer an inmate is completely unfettered.  No standards govern or restrict the Administrator\'s determination.  Because the Administrator is the only decisionmaker under Rule IV, we need not decide whether the introductory paragraph </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 461 U. S. 250</a></p><p> of Rule IV, <em>see</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra,</em> places any substantive limitations on the purely advisory Program Committee. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thus erred in attributing significance to the fact that the prison regulations require a particular kind of hearing before the Administrator can exercise his unfettered discretion. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently stated in <em>Shango v.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Process is not an end in itself.  Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.  <em>See generally</em> Simon, Liberty and Property in the Supreme Court:  A Defense of <em>Roth</em> and <em>Perry,</em> 71 Calif.L.Rev. 146, 186 (1983).

It never inflicts punishment; on the contrary, even the imposition of a stricter classification is intended to be in the best interests of the individual, the State, and the community.

App. 25.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent also had alleged that the transfer violated the Hawaii Constitution and state regulations and statutes.  In light of its dismissal of respondent\'s federal claims, the District Court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over these state law claims.  459 F.Supp. at 476.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Several months before the Court of Appeals handed down its decision, the Supreme Court of Hawaii had held that, because Hawaii\'s prison regulations do not limit the Administrator\'s discretion to transfer prisoners to the mainland, they do not create any liberty interest.  <em>Lono v. Ariyoshi,</em> 63 Haw. 138, 621 P.2d 976 (1981).  In a petition for rehearing in the present case, petitioners directed the Ninth Circuit\'s attention to the <em>Lono</em> decision.  <em>See</em> 664 F.2d at 714.  The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that the Hawaii court\'s interpretation of the regulations was not different from its own; the Hawaii court merely had reached a different result on the "federal question."

The Court in <em>Montanye</em> took note that among the hardships that may result from a prison transfer are separation of the inmate from home and family, separation from inmate friends, placement in a new and possibly hostile environment, difficulty in making contact with counsel, and interruption of educational and rehabilitative programs.  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/236/case.html#241">427 U. S. 241</a></span>, n. 4.  These are the same hardships respondent faces as a result of his transfer from Hawaii to California.</p>\n<p>Respondent attempts to analogize his transfer to banishment in the English sense of "beyond the seas," arguing that banishment surely is not within the range of confinement justified by his sentence.  But respondent in no sense has been banished; his conviction, not the transfer, deprived him of his right freely to inhabit the State.  The fact that his confinement takes place outside Hawaii is merely a fortuitous consequence of the fact that he must be confined, not an additional element of his punishment.  <em>See Girouard v. Hogan,</em> 135 Vt., at 449-450, 378 A.2d at 106-107.  Moreover, respondent has not been exiled; he remains within the United States.</p>\n<p>In essence, respondent\'s banishment argument simply restates his claim that a transfer from Hawaii to the mainland is different in kind from other transfers.  As has been shown in the text, however, respondent\'s transfer was authorized by his conviction.  A conviction, whether in Hawaii, Alaska, or one of the contiguous 48 States, empowers the State to confine the inmate in any penal institution in any State unless there is state law to the contrary or the reason for confining the inmate in a particular institution is itself constitutionally impermissible.  <em>See Montanye,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/236/case.html#242">427 U.

The answer depends in part on a comparison of "the treatment of the particular prisoner with the customary, habitual treatment of the population of the prison as a whole."  <em>Hewitt v.

S. 486</a></span> (1983) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  This principle was established in our decision in <em>Vitek,</em> which held that the transfer of an inmate from a prison to a mental hospital implicated a liberty interest because it brought about "consequences . . . qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime."  445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html#493">445 U.

Because a significant qualitative change in the conditions of confinement is not "within the range of conditions of confinement to which a prison sentence subjects an individual," <em>ibid.,</em> such a change implicates a prisoner\'s protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt that the transfer of Wakinekona from a Hawaii prison to a prison in California represents a substantial qualitative change in the conditions of his confinement.  In addition to being incarcerated, which is the ordinary consequence of a criminal conviction and sentence, Wakinekona has in effect been banished from his home, a punishment historically considered to be "among the severest."

As a practical matter, Wakinekona may be entirely cut off from his only contacts with the outside world, just as if he had been imprisoned in an institution which prohibited visits by outsiders.  Surely the isolation imposed on him by the transfer is far more drastic than that which normally accompanies imprisonment.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the Court that <em>Meachum v.

S. 248</a></span>.  Both cases involved transfers of prisoners between institutions located within the same State in which they were convicted, and the Court expressly phrased its holdings in terms of <em>intra</em>state transfers. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Both decisions rested on the premise that no liberty interest is implicated by an initial decision to place a prisoner in one institution in the State rather than another.  <em>See Meachum, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#224">427 U.

On the basis of that premise, the Court concluded that the subsequent transfer of a prisoner to a different facility within the State likewise implicates no liberty interest.  In this case, however, we cannot assume that a State\'s initial placement of an individual in a prison far removed from his family and residence would raise no due process questions.  None of our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 461 U. S. 254</a></p><p> prior decisions has indicated that such a decision would be immune from scrutiny under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p>Actual experience simply does not bear out the Court\'s assumptions that interstate transfers are routine and that it is "not unusual" for a prisoner "to serve practically his entire sentence in a State other than the one in which he was convicted and sentenced."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html#247">461 U.

In Hawaii, less than three percent of the state prisoners were transferred to prisons in other jurisdictions in 1979, and, on a nationwide basis, less than one percent of the prisoners held in state institutions were transferred to other jurisdictions.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Measured against these norms, Wakinekona\'s transfer to a California prison represents a punishment "qualitively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime."  <em>Vitek v.

This Court\'s prior decisions establish that a liberty interest </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 461 U.

State laws that impose substantive criteria which limit or guide the discretion of officials have been held to create a protected liberty interest.  <em>See, e.g., Hewitt v.

Rule IV establishes a scheme under which inmates are classified upon initial placement in an institution, and must subsequently be reclassified before they can be transferred to another institution.  Under the Rule, the standard for classifying inmates is their "optimum placement within the Corrections Division" in light of the "best interests of the individual, the State, and the community." [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In classifying inmates, the Program </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 461 U. S. 256</a></p><p> Committee may not consider punitive aims.

In <em>Hewitt,</em> an inmate contended that his confinement in administrative custody implicated an interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  State law provided that a prison official could place inmates in administrative custody "upon his assessment of the situation and the need for control," or "where it has been determined that there is a threat of a serious disturbance, or a serious threat to the individual or others," and mandated certain procedures such as notice and a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 461 U.

[<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  This Court construed the phrases "<em>the need for control,\' or `the threat of a serious disturbance,\'" as "substantive predicates" which restricted official discretion.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#472">459 U.

These restrictions, in combination with the mandatory procedural safeguards, "deman[ded] a conclusion that the State has created a protected liberty interest."  <em>Ibid.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Rule IV is not distinguishable in any meaningful respect from the provisions at issue in <em>Helms.</em>  The procedural requirements contained in Rule IV are, if anything, far more elaborate than those involved in <em>Helms,</em> and are likewise couched in "language of an unmistakably mandatory character." <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#471">459 U. S. 471</a></span>.   Moreover, Rule IV, to no less an extent than the state law at issue in <em>Helms,</em> imposes substantive criteria restricting official discretion.  In <em>Helms,</em> this Court held that a statutory phrase.such as "the need for control" constituted a limitation on the discretion of prison officials to place inmates in administrative custody.  In my view, Rule IV, which states that transfers are intended to ensure an inmate\'s "optimum placement" in accordance with considerations which include "his changing needs [and] the resources and facilities available to the Corrections Division," also restricts official discretion in ordering transfers. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that, even if the Program Committee does not have unlimited discretion in making recommendations for classifications and transfers, this cannot give rise to a state-created liberty interest, because the prison Administrator retains "completely unfettered" "discretion to transfer </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 461 U. S. 258</a></p><p> an inmate," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html#249">461 U. S. 249</a></span>.  I disagree.  Rule IV, \xef\xbf\xbd 3(d)(3), provides for review by the prison Administrator of recommendations forwarded to him by the Program Committee. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Even if this provision must be construed as authorizing the Administrator to transfer a prisoner for wholly arbitrary reasons, [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] that mere possibility does not defeat the protectible expectation otherwise created by Hawaii\'s reclassification and transfer scheme that transfers will take place only if required to ensure an inmate\'s optimum placement.  In <em>Helms,</em> a prison regulation also left open the possibility that the Superintendent could decide, for any reason or no reason at all, whether an inmate should be confined in administrative custody. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  This Court nevertheless held that the state scheme as a whole created an interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#471">459 U. S. 471</a></span>-472.  <em>Helms</em> thus necessarily rejects the view that state laws which impose substantive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 461 U. S. 259</a></p><p> limitations and elaborate procedural requirements on official conduct create no liberty interest solely because there remains the possibility that an official will act in an arbitrary manner at the end of the process.

It never inflicts punishment; on the contrary, even the imposition of a stricter classification is intended to be in the best interests of the individual, the State, and the community.
