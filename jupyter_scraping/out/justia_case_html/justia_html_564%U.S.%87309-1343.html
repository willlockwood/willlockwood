McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre), manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and operates.  Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction.  Nicastro\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional claim was based on three primary facts:\xc2\xa0A U. S. distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre\xe2\x80\x99s machines in this country; J. McIntyre officials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jersey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey.  The State Supreme Court held that New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause so long as the manufacturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to sales in any of the States.  Invoking this \xe2\x80\x9cstream-of-commerce\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/102/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/102/index.html">480 U. S. 102</a>.  Applying its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">201 N. J. 48, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d 575, reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, concluded that because J. McIntyre never engaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of the State\xe2\x80\x99s laws, New Jersey is without power to adjudge the company\xe2\x80\x99s rights and liabilities, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Due process protects the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power.  A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign \xe2\x80\x9csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \xe2\x80\x98traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>International Shoe Co.</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/310/index.html">326 U. S. 310</a>, 316.  Freeform fundamental fairness notions divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered without authority into law.  As a general rule, the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hanson</em> v. <em>Denckla</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/235/index.html">357 U. S. 235</a>, 253.  In cases like this one, it is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with \xe2\x80\x9cfair play and substantial justice\xe2\x80\x9d notions.  No \xe2\x80\x9cstream-of-commerce\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine can displace that general rule for products-liability cases. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left open in <em>Asahi.  </em>The imprecision arising from <em>Asahi</em>, for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the \xe2\x80\x9cstream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  That concept, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utilities.  It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.  A defendant\xe2\x80\x99s placement of goods into commerce \xe2\x80\x9cwith the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State\xe2\x80\x9d may indicate purposeful availment.  <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> v. <em>Woodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/286/index.html"></a><a href="/us/444/286/index.html">444 U. S. 286</a>, 298.  But that does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.  The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hanson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 253.  In <em>Asahi</em>, Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence (joined by three other Justices) discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction.  480 U. S., at 117.  However, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s lead opinion (also for four Justices) stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xe2\x80\x98substantial connection\xe2\x80\x99 between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 112.  Since <em>Asahi,</em> the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions.  But Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent with Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Asahi</em> opinion.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.  The company had no office in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State.  Indeed, the trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with the State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up there.  Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered his jurisdictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Alito, agreed that the New Jersey Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment must be reversed, but concluded that because this case does not present issues arising from recent changes in commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without fully considering modern-day consequences.  Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Based on the record, respondent Nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer).  The three primary facts the state high court relied on do not satisfy due process.  None of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents finds that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here, is sufficient.  See <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> v. <em>Woodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/286/index.html"></a><a href="/us/444/286/index.html">444 U. S. 286</a>; <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/102/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/102/index.html">480 U. S. 102</a>.  Here, the relevant facts show no \xe2\x80\x9cregular \xe2\x80\xa6 flow\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cregular course\xe2\x80\x9d of sales in New Jersey, <em>id.,</em> at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <em>id.,</em> at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); and there is no \xe2\x80\x9csomething more,\xe2\x80\x9d such as special state-related design, advertising, advice, or marketing, <em>id.,</em> at 111, 112 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.), that would warrant the assertion of jurisdiction.  Nicastro has shown no specific effort by the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.  And he has not otherwise shown that the British Manufacturer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d within New Jersey, or that it delivered its goods in the stream of commerce \xe2\x80\x9cwith the expectation that they will be purchased\xe2\x80\x9d by New Jersey users.  <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra</em>, at 297\xe2\x80\x93298.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer would not go further.  Because the incident at issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.  At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.  Insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.

The rules and standards for determining when a State does or does not have jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left open in <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/102/index.html">480 U. S. 102</a> (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part on <em>Asahi</em>, held that New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as the manufacturer \xe2\x80\x9cknows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nicastro </em>v.<em> McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd.</em>, 201 N.\xc2\xa0J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d 575, 591, 592 (2010).  Applying that test, the court concluded that a British manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That decision cannot be sustained.  Although the New Jersey Supreme Court issued an extensive opinion with care-ful attention to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases and to its own pre-cedent, the \xe2\x80\x9cstream of commerce\xe2\x80\x9d metaphor carried the decision far afield.  Due process protects the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power.  As a general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hanson</em> v. <em>Denckla</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/235/index.html">357 U. S. 235</a>, 253 (1958).  There may be exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an intentional tort.  But the general rule is applicable in this products-liability case, and the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cstream-of-commerce\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine cannot displace it.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arises from a products-liability suit filed in New Jersey state court.  Robert Nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre).  The accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was manufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorporated and operates.  The question here is whether the New Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwithstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the State or shipped them there.  Nicastro was a plaintiff in the New Jersey trial court and is the respondent here; J. McIntyre was a defendant and is now the petitioner.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro\xe2\x80\x99s counsel stressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s as-sertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29<f f="Times New Roman">\xe2\x80\x93<f f="Century Schoolbook">30.</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIntyre\xe2\x80\x99s machines in the United States.  J. McIntyre itself did not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond the U. S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the distributor was under J. McIntyre\xe2\x80\x99s control.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conventions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. Mc-Intyre\xe2\x80\x99s machines alongside the distributor.  The conventions took place in various States, but never in New \nJersey.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, no more than four machines (the record suggests only one, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a), including the machine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this suit, ended up in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to these facts emphasized by petitioner, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held both United States and European patents on its recycling technology.  201 N.\xc2\xa0J., at 55, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 579.  It also noted that the U. S. distributor \xe2\x80\x9cstructured [its] adver-tising and sales efforts in accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d J. McIntyre\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdirection and guidance whenever possible,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cat least some of the machines were sold on consignment to\xe2\x80\x9d the distributor.  <em>Id.</em>, at 55, 56, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdiction over petitioner without contravention of the Due Process Clause.  Jurisdiction was proper, in that court\xe2\x80\x99s view, because the injury occurred in New Jersey; because petitioner knew or reasonably should have known \xe2\x80\x9cthat its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states\xe2\x80\x9d; and because petitioner failed to \xe2\x80\x9ctake some reasonable step to prevent the distribution of its prod-ucts in this State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 77, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 592.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the New Jersey Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding and its account of what it called \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he stream-of-commerce doctrine of jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 80, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 594, were incorrect, however.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Asahi </em>decision may be responsible in part for that court\xe2\x80\x99s error regarding the stream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity to provide greater clarity.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Due Process Clause protects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to be deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise of lawful power.  Cf. <em>Giaccio</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/399/index.html">382 U. S. 399</a>, 403 (1966) (The Clause \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[s] a person against having the Government impose burdens upon him except in accordance with the valid laws of the land\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is no less true with respect to the power of a sovereign to resolve disputes through judicial process than with respect to the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for those within its sphere.  See <em>Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Citizens for Bet-ter Environment</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/index.html">523 U. S. 83</a>, 94 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cJurisdiction is power to declare the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a general rule, neither statute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the State.  Cf. <em>Burnham</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/604/index.html">495 U. S. 604</a>, 608\xe2\x80\x93609 (1990) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (invoking \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase <em>coram non judice,</em> \xe2\x80\x98before a person not a judge\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94meaning, in effect, that the proceeding \nin question was not a <em>judicial</em> proceeding because lawful judicial authority was not present, and could therefore not yield a <em>judgment</em>\xe2\x80\x9d)</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign \xe2\x80\x9csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \xe2\x80\x98traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>International Shoe Co.</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/310/index.html">326 U. S. 310</a>, 316 (1945) (quoting<em> Milliken</em> v. <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/311/457/index.html">311 U. S. 457</a>, 463 (1940)).  Freeform notions of fundamental fairness divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered in the absence of authority into law.  As a general rule, the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hanson</em>, 357 U. S., at 253, though in some cases, as with an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall within the State\xe2\x80\x99s authority by reason of his attempt to obstruct its laws.  In products-liability cases like this one, it is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A person may submit to a State\xe2\x80\x99s authority in a number of ways.  There is, of course, explicit consent.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>In-surance Corp. of Ireland</em> v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/694/index.html">456 U. S. 694</a>, 703 (1982).  Presence within a State at the time suit commences through service of process is another example.  See <em>Burnham</em>, <em>supra</em>.  Citizenship or domicile\xe2\x80\x94or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place of business for corporations\xe2\x80\x94also indicates general submission to a State\xe2\x80\x99s powers.  <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <em>post</em>, p. __.  Each of these examples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State.  Cf. <em>Burger King Corp.</em> v. <em>Rudzewicz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/index.html">471 U. S. 462</a>, 476 (1985).  These examples support exercise of the general jurisdiction of the State\xe2\x80\x99s courts and allow the State to resolve both matters that originate within the State and those based on activities and events elsewhere.  <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A.</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/408/index.html">466 U. S. 408</a>, 414, and n. 9 (1984).  By contrast, those who live or operate primarily outside a State have a due process right not to be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is also a more limited form of submission to a State\xe2\x80\x99s authority for disputes that \xe2\x80\x9carise out of or are con-nected with the activities within the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>International Shoe Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 319.  Where a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and \nprotections of its laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hanson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 253, it submits to the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to the extent that power is exercised in connection with the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s activities touching on the State.  In other words, submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cin a suit arising out of or related to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Helicopteros</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 414, n.\xc2\xa08; see also <em>Goodyear</em>, <em>post</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The imprecision arising from <em>Asahi</em>, for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the \xe2\x80\x9cstream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  The stream of commerce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utility.  It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.  This Court has stated that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s placing goods into the stream of commerce \xe2\x80\x9cwith the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State\xe2\x80\x9d may indicate purposeful availment.  <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> v. <em>Woodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/286/index.html">444 U. S. 286</a>, 298 (1980) (finding that expectation lacking).  But that statement does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.  It merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the \nforum\xe2\x80\x94itself an unexceptional proposition\xe2\x80\x94as where man-ufacturers or distributors \xe2\x80\x9cseek to serve\xe2\x80\x9d a given State\xe2\x80\x99s market.  <em>Id.</em>, at 295.  The principal inquiry in cases of \nthis sort is whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s activities manifest \nan intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.  In other words, the defendant must \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avai[l] it-self of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hanson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 253; <em>Insurance Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 704\xe2\x80\x93705 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Sometimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than its agents.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s transmission of goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Asahi</em>, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Justices outlined a different approach.  It discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of considerations of fairness and foreseeability.  As that concurrence contended, \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce [without more] is consistent with the Due Process Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 U. S., at 117 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  It was the premise of the concurring opinion that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to anticipate suit renders the assertion of jurisdiction fair.  In this way, the opinion made foreseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The standard set forth in Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence was rejected in an opinion written by Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor; but the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the assent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court.  That opinion stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98substantial connection\xe2\x80\x99 between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.  The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 112 (emphasis deleted; citations omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since <em>Asahi </em>was decided, the courts have sought to rec-oncile the competing opinions.  But Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s con-currence, advocating a rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents make clear that it is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions, not his expectations, that empower a State\xe2\x80\x99s courts to subject him to judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that jurisdiction is in the first instance \na question of authority rather than fairness explains, for example, why the principal opinion in <em>Burnham </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or fairness\xe2\x80\x9d of the rule that service of process within a State suffices to establish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign defendant.  495 U. S., at 621.  As that opinion explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he view developed early that each State had the power to hale before its courts any individual who could be found within its borders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 610.  Furthermore, were general fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdiction, a lack of purposeful availment might be excused where carefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise protect the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interests, or where the plaintiff would suffer substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign forum.  That such considerations have not been deemed controlling is instructive.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 294.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two principles are implicit in the foregoing.  First, per-sonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.  The question is whether a de-fendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct.  Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d for due process protects the individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to be subject only to lawful power.  <em>Insurance Corp.</em>, 456 U. S., at 702.  But whether a judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority to render it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second principle is a corollary of the first.  Because the United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States but not of any particular State.  This is consistent with the premises and unique genius of our Constitution.  Ours is \xe2\x80\x9ca legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>U. S. Term Limits, \nInc.</em> v. <em>Thornton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/779/index.html">514 U. S. 779</a>, 838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the requisite relationship with the United States Government but not with the government of any individual State.  That would be an exceptional case, however.  If the defendant is a domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are available and can exercise general jurisdiction.  And if another State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits that each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other States.  Furthermore, foreign corporations will often target or concentrate on particular States, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those forums.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be remembered, however, that although this case and <em>Asahi</em> both involve foreign manufacturers, the undesirable consequences of Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s approach are no less significant for domestic producers.  The owner of a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby distributor, for example, who might then distribute them to grocers across the country.  If foreseeability were the controlling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or any number of other States\xe2\x80\x99 courts without ever leaving town.  And the issue of foreseeability may itself be contested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction.  Jurisdictional rules should avoid these costs whenever possible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent with Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Asahi</em>, does not by itself resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will arise in particular cases.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and \nthe economic realities of the market the defendant seeks to serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition will, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that principle.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales efforts at the United States.  It may be that, assuming it were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the Congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appropriate courts.  That circumstance is not presented in this case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to address here any constitutional concerns that might be attendant to that exercise of power.  See <em>Asahi</em>, 480 U. S., at 113, n.  Nor is it necessary to determine what substantive law might apply were Congress to authorize jurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey.  See <em>Hanson</em>, 357 U. S., at 254 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe issue is personal jurisdiction, not choice of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  A sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s legislative authority to regulate conduct may present considerations different from those presented by its authority to subject a defendant to judgment in its courts.  Here the question concerns the authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise ju-risdiction, so it is petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s purposeful contacts with New Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are relevant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.  Recall that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim of jurisdiction centers on three facts: The distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre\xe2\x80\x99s machines in the United States; J. McIntyre officials attended trade shows in several States but not in New Jersey; and up to four machines ended up in New Jersey.  The British manufacturer had no office in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State.  Indeed, after discovery the trial court found that the \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short of the machine in question ending up in this state.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a.  These facts may reveal an intent to serve the U. S. market, but they do not show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is notable that the New Jersey Supreme Court appears to agree, for it could \xe2\x80\x9cnot find that J. McIntyre had a presence or minimum contacts in this State\xe2\x80\x94in any jurisprudential sense\xe2\x80\x94that would justify a New Jersey court to exercise jurisdiction in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  201 N.\xc2\xa0J., at 61, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 582.  The court nonetheless held that petitioner could be sued in New Jersey based on a \xe2\x80\x9cstream-of-commerce theory of jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As discussed, however, the stream-of-commerce metaphor cannot supersede either the mandate of the Due Process Clause or the limits on judicial authority that Clause ensures.  The New Jersey Supreme Court also cited \xe2\x80\x9csignificant policy reasons\xe2\x80\x9d to justify its holding, including the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrong interest in protecting its citizens from defective products.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 75, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 590.  That interest is doubtless strong, but the Constitution commands restraint before discarding liberty in the name of expediency.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Due process protects petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s right to be subject only to lawful authority.  At no time did petitioner engage in any activities in New Jersey that reveal an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of its laws.  New Jersey is without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of J. McIntyre, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.

I do not doubt that there have been many recent changes in commerce and communication, many of which are not anticipated by our precedents.  But this case does not present any of those issues.  So I think it unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without full consideration of the modern-day consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by our precedents.  Based on the facts found by the New Jersey courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm that manufactures scrap-metal machines in Great Britain and sells them through an independent distributor in the United States (American Distributor).  On that basis, I agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer, the Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on three primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient \xe2\x80\x9ccontacts\xe2\x80\x9d with New Jersey, thereby making it funda-\nmentally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its courts: (1) The American Distributor on one occasion sold and shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer, namely, Mr. Nicastro\xe2\x80\x99s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the British Manufacturer permitted, indeed wanted, its independent American Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in America willing to buy them; and (3) representatives of the British Manufacturer attended trade shows in \xe2\x80\x9csuch cities as Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San Diego, and San Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 54\xe2\x80\x9355, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 578\xe2\x80\x93579.  In my view, these facts do not provide contacts between the British firm and the State of New Jersey constitutionally sufficient to support New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here, is sufficient.  Rather, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous holdings suggest the contrary.  The Court has held that a single sale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product to a different State (where the accident takes place) is not a sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. See <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> v. <em>Woodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/286/index.html">444 U. S. 286</a> (1980).  And the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly suggested that a single sale of a product in a State does not constitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places his goods in the stream of commerce, fully aware (and hoping) that such a sale will take place.  See <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/102/index.html">480 U. S. 102</a>, 111, 112 (1987) (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (requiring \xe2\x80\x9csomething more\xe2\x80\x9d than simply placing \xe2\x80\x9ca product\ninto the stream of commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d even if defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cawar[e]\xe2\x80\x9d\nthat the stream \xe2\x80\x9cmay or will sweep the product into the forum State\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (jurisdiction should lie where a sale in a State is part of \xe2\x80\x9cthe regular and anticipated flow\xe2\x80\x9d of commerce into the State, but not where that sale is only an \xe2\x80\x9cedd[y],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, an isolated occurrence); <em>id.,</em> at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (indicating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe volume, the value, and the hazardous character\xe2\x80\x9d of a good may affect the jurisdictional inquiry and emphasizing Asahi\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cregular course of dealing\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the relevant facts found by the New Jersey Supreme Court show no \xe2\x80\x9cregular \xe2\x80\xa6 flow\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cregular course\xe2\x80\x9d of sales in New Jersey; and there is no \xe2\x80\x9csomething more,\xe2\x80\x9d such as special state-related design, advertising, advice, marketing, or anything else.  Mr. Nicastro, who here bears the burden of proving jurisdiction, has shown no specific effort by the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.  He has introduced no list of potential New Jersey customers who might, for example, have regularly attended trade shows.  And he has not otherwise shown that the British Manufacturer \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities\xe2\x80\x9d within New Jersey, or that it de-livered its goods in the stream of commerce \xe2\x80\x9cwith the expectation that they will be purchased\xe2\x80\x9d by New Jersey users.  <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra</em>, at 297\xe2\x80\x93298 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There may well have been other facts that Mr. Nicastro could have demonstrated in support of jurisdiction.  And the dissent considers some of those facts.  See <em>post</em>, at 3 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (describing the size and scope\nof New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s scrap-metal business).  But the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction, and here I would take the facts precisely as the New Jersey Supreme Court stated them.  <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland</em> v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/694/index.html">456 U.

Because the incident at issue in this case does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality seems to state strict rules that limit jurisdiction where a defendant does not \xe2\x80\x9cinten[d] to submit to the power of a sovereign\xe2\x80\x9d and cannot \xe2\x80\x9cbe said to have targeted the forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  But what do those standards mean when a company targets the world by selling products from its Web site?  And does it matter if, instead of shipping the products directly, a company consigns the products through an intermediary (say, Amazon.com) who then receives and fulfills the orders?  And what if the company markets its products through popup advertisements that it knows will be viewed in a forum?  Those issues have serious commercial consequences but are totally absent in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But though I do not agree with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly strict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the absolute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court and urged by respondent and his <em>amici</em>.  Under that view, a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products-liability action so long as it \xe2\x80\x9cknows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that <em>might</em> lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.\xe2\x80\x9d  201 N.\xc2\xa0J., at 76\xe2\x80\x9377, 987 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 592 (emphasis added).  In the context of this case, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, to adopt this view would abandon the heretofore accepted inquiry of whether, focusing upon the relationship between \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant, the <em>forum, </em>and the litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d it is fair, in light of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts <em>with that forum</em>, to subject the defendant to suit there.  <em>Shaffer</em> v. <em>Heitner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/186/index.html">433 U. S. 186</a>, 204 (1977) (emphasis added).  It would ordinarily rest jurisdiction instead upon no more than the occurrence of a product-based accident in the forum State.  But this Court has rejected the notion that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s amenability to suit \xe2\x80\x9ctravel[s] with the chattel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>, 444 U. S., at 296.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another, I cannot reconcile so automatic a rule\nwith the constitutional demand for \xe2\x80\x9cminimum contacts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefu[l] avail[ment],\xe2\x80\x9d each of which rest upon a particular notion of defendant-focused fairness.  <em>Id.,</em> at 291, 297 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A rule like the New Jersey Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s would permit every State to assert jurisdiction in a products-liability suit against any domestic manufacturer who sells its products (made anywhere in the United States) to a national distributor, no matter how large or small the manufacturer, no matter how distant the forum, and no matter how few the number of items that end up in the particular forum at issue.  What might appear fair in the case of a large manufacturer which specifically seeks, or expects, an equal-sized distributor to sell its product in a distant State might seem unfair in the case of a small manufacturer (say, an Appalachian potter) who sells his product (cups and saucers) exclusively to a large distributor, who resells a single item (a coffee mug) to a buyer from a distant State (Hawaii).  I know too little about the range of these or in-between possibilities to abandon in favor of the more absolute rule what has previously been this Court\xe2\x80\x99s less absolute approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the fact that the defendant is a foreign, rather than a domestic, manufacturer makes the basic fairness\nof an absolute rule yet more uncertain.  I am again less certain than is the New Jersey Supreme Court that the nature of international commerce has changed so sig-\nnificantly as to require a new approach to personal\njurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may be that a larger firm can readily \xe2\x80\x9calleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, severing its connection with the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 297.  But manufacturers come in many shapes and sizes.  It may be fundamentally unfair to require a small Egyptian shirt maker, a Brazilian manufacturing cooperative, or a Kenyan coffee farmer, selling its products through international distributors, to respond to products-liability tort suits in virtually every State in the United States, even those in respect to which the foreign firm has no connection at all but the sale of a single (allegedly defective) good.  And a rule like the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests would require every product manufacturer, large or small, selling to American distributors to understand not only the tort law of every State, but also the wide variance in the way courts within different States apply that law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Tort Trials and Verdicts in Large Counties, 2001, p.\xc2\xa011 (reporting percentage of plaintiff winners in tort trials among 46 populous counties, ranging from 17.9% (Worcester, Mass.) to 69.1% (Milwaukee, Wis.)).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a minimum, I would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.  Insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.  Cf.

But, all things considered, it prefers to avoid products liability litigation in the United States.  To that end, it engages a U. S. distributor to ship its machines stateside.

Notably, McIntyre America was concerned about U. S. litigation involving McIntyre UK products, in which the distributor had been named as a defendant.  McIntyre UK counseled McIntyre America to respond personally to the litigation, but reassured its distributor that \xe2\x80\x9cthe product was built and designed by McIntyre Machinery in the UK and the buck stops here\xe2\x80\x94if there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with the machine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 129a\xe2\x80\x93130a.  Answering jurisdictional interrogatories, McIntyre UK stated that it had been named as a defendant in lawsuits in Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and West Virginia.  <em>Id.</em>, at 98a, 108a.  And in correspondence with McIntyre America, McIntyre UK noted that the manufacturer had products liability insurance coverage.  <em>Id.</em>, at 129a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the years, McIntyre America distributed several McIntyre UK products to U. S. customers, including, in addition to the 640 Shear, McIntyre UK\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNiagara\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTardis\xe2\x80\x9d systems, wire strippers, and can machines.  <em>Id.</em>, at 123a\xe2\x80\x93128a.  In promoting McIntyre UK\xe2\x80\x99s products at conventions and demonstration sites and in trade journal advertisements, McIntyre America looked to McIntyre UK for direction and guidance.  <em>Ibid.</em>  To achieve McIntyre UK\xe2\x80\x99s objective, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cto sell [its] machines to customers throughout the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 399 N.\xc2\xa0J.

He alleges that McIntyre UK\xe2\x80\x99s shear machine was defectively designed or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury to him at his workplace.  The machine arrived in Nicastro\xe2\x80\x99s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously, but as a result of the U. S. connections and distribution system that McIntyre UK deliberately arranged.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  On what sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory authority could the place of Nicastro\xe2\x80\x99s injury within the United States be deemed off limits for his products liability claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the United States (including all the States that constitute the Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few points on which there should be no genuine debate bear statement at the outset.  First, all agree, Mc-Intyre UK surely is not subject to general (all-purpose) jurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country corporation is hardly \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in New Jersey.  See <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 9\xe2\x80\x9313.  The question, rather, is one of specific jurisdiction, which turns on an \xe2\x80\x9caffiliatio[n] between the forum and the underlying controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Goodyear Dunlop, post,</em> at 2<em> </em>(quoting von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren &amp; Trautman); internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Goodyear Dunlop, post, </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of adjudicatory authority among States of the United States is present in this case.  New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous product caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not tread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any sister State.  Indeed, among States of the United States, the State in which the injury occurred would seem most suitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim.  See <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> v. <em>Woodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/286/index.html">444 U. S. 286</a>, 297 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to develop a market for a product in several States, it is reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cto subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective [product] has there been the source of injury\xe2\x80\x9d); 28 U.

As the Court clarified in <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland</em> v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/694/index.html">456 U. S. 694</a> (1982):</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe restriction on state sovereign power described in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 must be seen as ultimately a function of the individual liberty interest preserved by the Due Process Clause.  That Clause is the only source of the personal jurisdiction requirement and the Clause itself makes no mention of federalism concerns.  Furthermore, if the federalism concept operated as an independent restriction on the sovereign power of the court, it would not be possible to waive the personal jurisdiction requirement:  Individual actions cannot change the powers of sovereignty, although the individual can subject himself to powers from which he may otherwise be protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 703, n.\xc2\xa010.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>Shaffer</em> v. <em>Heitner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/186/index.html">433 U.

They have held, instead, that it would undermine principles of fundamental fairness to insulate the foreign manufacturer from accountability in court at the place within the United States where the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s products caused injury.

McIntyre contends otherwise, citing <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>, and <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/102/index.html">480 U. S. 102</a> (1987).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>concerned a New York car dealership that sold solely in the New York market, and\na New York distributor who supplied retailers in three States only: New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey.  444 U. S., at 289.  New York residents had purchased an Audi from the New York dealer and were driving the new vehicle through Oklahoma en route to Arizona.  On the road in Oklahoma, another car struck the Audi in the rear, causing a fire which severely burned the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s occupants.  <em>Id.</em>, at 288.  Rejecting the Oklahoma courts\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of jurisdiction over the New York dealer and distributor, this Court observed that the defendants had done nothing to serve the market for cars in Oklahoma.  <em>Id.</em>, at 295\xe2\x80\x93298.  Jurisdiction, the Court held, could not be based on the <em>customer\xe2\x80\x99s</em> unilateral act of driving the vehicle to Oklahoma.  <em>Id.</em>, at 298; see <em>Asahi</em>, 480 U. S., at 109 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (<em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>\xe2\x80\x9crejected the as-\nsertion that a <em>consumer\xe2\x80\x99s </em>unilateral act of bringing the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s product into the forum State was a sufficient\nconstitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the\ndefendant\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>did not object to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma courts and the U. S. importer abandoned its initially stated objection.  444 U. S., at 288, and n.\xc2\xa03.  And most relevant here, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion indicates that an objection to jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national distributor would have been unavailing.  To reiterate, the Court said in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em> that, when a manufacturer or distributor aims to sell its product to customers in several States, it is reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cto subject it to suit in [any] one of those States if its allegedly defective [product] has there been the source of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 297.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Asahi </em>arose out of a motorcycle accident in California.  Plaintiff, a California resident injured in the accident, sued the Taiwanese manufacturer of the motorcycle\xe2\x80\x99s tire tubes, claiming that defects in its product caused the accident.  The tube manufacturer cross-claimed against Asahi, the Japanese maker of the valve assembly, and Asahi contested the California courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  By the time the case reached this Court, the injured plaintiff\nhad settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the Taiwanese company against the Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer remained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision was not a close call.  The Court had before it a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and\na foreign defendant, the Japanese valve-assembly maker, and the indemnification dispute concerned a transaction between those parties that occurred abroad.  All agreed on the bottom line: The Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer was not reasonably brought into the California courts to litigate a dispute with another foreign party over a transaction that took place outside the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the confines of the controversy, the dueling opinions of Justice Brennan and Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor were hardly necessary.  How the Court would have \xe2\x80\x9cestimate[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 the inconveniences,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>International Shoe</em>, 326 U. S., at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted), had the injured Californian originally sued Asahi is a debatable question.  Would this Court have given the same weight to the burdens on the foreign defendant had those been counterbalanced by the burdens litigating in Japan imposed on the local California plaintiff?  Cf. <em>Calder</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/783/index.html">465 U. S. 783</a>, 788 (1984) (a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum \xe2\x80\x9cmay be so manifold as to permit jurisdiction when it would not exist in their absence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Asahi, unlike McIntyre UK, did not itself seek out customers in the United States, it engaged no distributor to promote its wares here, it appeared at no tradeshows in the United States, and, of course, it had no Web site advertising its products to the world.  Moreover, Asahi was a component-part manufacturer with \xe2\x80\x9clittle control over the final destination of its products once they were delivered into the stream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>A. Uberti</em>, 181 Ariz., at 572, 892 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1361.

Of particular note, within the European Union, in which the United Kingdom is a participant, the jurisdiction New Jersey would have exercised is not at all exceptional.  The European Regulation on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments provides for the exercise of specific jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cin matters relating to tort \xe2\x80\xa6 in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Council Reg. 44/2001, Art. 5, 2001 O.\xc2\xa0J.

See <em>id.,</em> at 100a\xe2\x80\x93101a.  McIntyre did allow that McIntyre America \xe2\x80\x9cmay have resold products it purchased from [McIntyre UK] to a buyer in New Jersey,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 117a, but said it kept no record of the ultimate destination of machines it shipped to its distributor, <em>ibid.</em>  A private investigator engaged by Nicastro found at least one McIntyre UK machine, of unspecified type, in use in New Jersey.  <em>Id.</em>, at 140a\xe2\x80\x93144a.  But McIntyre UK objected that the investigator\xe2\x80\x99s report was \xe2\x80\x9cunsworn and based upon hearsay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 10.  Moreover, McIntyre UK maintained, no evidence showed that the machine the investigator found in New Jersey had been \xe2\x80\x9csold into [that State].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Compare Brilmayer, Rights, Fairness, and Choice of Law, 98 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1277, 1304\xe2\x80\x931306 (1989) (hereinafter Brilmayer) (criticizing as circular jurisdictional theories founded on \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubmission to state authority\xe2\x80\x9d), Perdue, Personal Jurisdiction and the Beetle in\nthe Box, 32 Boston College L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 529, 536\xe2\x80\x93544 (1991) (same), with<em> </em>Trangsrud, The Federal Common Law of Personal Jurisdiction, 57 Geo.

In other words, McIntyre UK might be compelled to bear the burden of traveling to New Jersey and defending itself there under New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s products liability law, but would be entitled to federal adjudication of Nicastro\xe2\x80\x99s state-law claim.
