Sir-I take the liberty to inclose a copy of the clerk\'s entry of the case \'Ex parte Martha Bradstreet,\' and to ask if you dissented from the order of the court in the case. I shall be obliged by the return of the paper. I am your obedient servant, RICHARD PETERS, Reporter, &amp;c. Mr JUSTICE BALDWIN. Philadelphia, 21st July 1832. Sir-In the case Ex parte Bradstreet v. Cooper et al., on the motion by Mr Jones for a mandamus to the district court of the northern district of New York, I dissented from the order of the court in the following respects. </p><p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> In ordering the suits to be reinstated. </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Requiring the court to permit amendments to be made. The ground of my dissent was, that a mandamus was not a proper remedy, that the dismission of a suit for want of jurisdiction was final judgment, on which a writ of error could be brought; but that the supreme court had no power to issue a mandamus in such a case, the judgment being strictly a judicial act, and that though an appellate court could direct amendments, it could only do so when a case was before them by writ of error or appeal. It was stated in the affidavit that the court had actually rendered a judgment of dismission for the want of jurisdiction, but that there was no entry of it on the record, and that the judge had neglected or refused an application to direct it to be done. I had no doubt that this was a proper case for a rule to show cause why a mandamus should not issue directing the entry of such judgment as had been rendered by the court, so as to give the plaintiff the benefit of a writ of error. My opinion was confined to this subject matter. The order of the court, of which you inclosed me a copy in your note of to-day, which is herewith returned, was not shown until to-day I was not aware of its extent until to day I was not aware of its extent on the last point, embracing matters not taken into consideration by me. Yours, &amp;c. HENRY BALDWIN. RICHARD PETERS, Esquire, Reporter of Supreme Court, </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
