[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case is whether \xc2\xa7 2805(a) is unconstitutional either because it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 424 U. S. 353</a></p><p> is an attempt to regulate immigration and naturalization or because it is preempted under the Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, of the Constitution, by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101 <em>et seq.,</em> the comprehensive federal statutory scheme for regulation of immigration and naturalization.</p>\n<p>Petitioners, who are migrant farmworkers, brought this action pursuant to \xc2\xa7 2805(c) against respondent farm labor contractors in California Superior Court.  The complaint alleged that respondents had refused petitioners continued employment due to a surplus of labor resulting from respondents\' knowing employment, in violation of \xc2\xa7 2805(a), of aliens not lawfully admitted to residence in the United States.  Petitioners sought reinstatement and a permanent injunction against respondents\' willful employment of illegal aliens. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Superior Court, in an unreported opinion, dismissed the complaint, holding</p>\n<p>"that Labor Code 2805 is unconstitutional . . .

The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, affirmed, 40 Cal.App.3d 976, 115 Cal.Rptr. 444 (1974).  The Court of Appeal held that \xc2\xa7 2805(a) is an attempt to regulate the conditions for admission of foreign nationals, and therefore unconstitutional because, "in the area of immigration and naturalization, congressional power is exclusive."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 424 U.

[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Court of Appeal further indicated that state regulatory power over this subject matter was foreclosed when Congress, "as an incident of national sovereignty," enacted the INA as a comprehensive scheme governing all aspects of immigration and naturalization, including the employment of aliens, and "specifically and intentionally declined to add sanctions on employers to its control mechanism."  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Supreme Court of California denied review.  We granted certiorari 422 U.S. 1040 (1975).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Power to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/48/283/case.html">48 U. S. </a></span></em> 7 How. 283 (1849); <em>Henderson v. Mayor of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/259/case.html">92 U. S. 259</a></span> (1876); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/275/case.html">Chy Lung v. Freeman,</a></span></em> 92 U.S. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 424 U.

But the Court has never held that every state enactment which in any way deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration, and thus <em>per se</em> preempted by this constitutional power, whether latent or exercised.  For example, <em>Takahashi v. Fish &amp; Game Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/410/case.html">334 U. S. 410</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/410/case.html#415">334 U. S. 415</a></span>-422 (1948), and <em>Graham v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/365/case.html">403 U. S. 365</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/365/case.html#372">403 U. S. 372</a></span>-373 (1971), cited a line of cases that upheld certain discriminatory state treatment of aliens lawfully within the United States.  Although the "doctrinal foundations" of the cited cases, which generally arose under the Equal Protection Clause, <em>e.g., Clarke v. Deckebach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/392/case.html">274 U. S. 392</a></span> (1927), "were undermined in <em>Takahashi,</em>" <em>see In re Griffiths,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/717/case.html">413 U. S. 717</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/717/case.html#718">413 U. S. 718</a></span>-722 (1973); <em>Graham v. Richardson, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/365/case.html#372">403 U. S. 372</a></span>-375, they remain authority that, standing alone, the fact that aliens are the subject of a state statute does not render it a regulation of immigration, which is essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country, and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain.  Indeed, there would have been no need, in cases such as <em>Graham, Takahashi,</em> or <em>Hines v. Davidowitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html">312 U. S. 52</a></span> (1941), even to discuss the relevant congressional enactments in finding preemption of state regulation if all state regulation of aliens was <em>ipso facto</em> regulation of immigration, for the existence <em>vel non</em> of federal regulation is wholly irrelevant if the Constitution of its own force requires preemption of such state regulation.  In this case, California has sought to strengthen its economy by adopting federal standards in imposing criminal sanctions against state employers who knowingly employ aliens who have no federal right to employment within the country; even if such local regulation has some purely speculative and indirect impact on immigration, it does not thereby become </p><p><a class="page-number" name="356">Page 424 U. S. 356</a></p><p> a constitutionally proscribed regulation of immigration that Congress itself would be powerless to authorize or approve.  Thus, absent congressional action, \xc2\xa7 2805 would not be an invalid state incursion on federal power.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even when the Constitution does not itself commit exclusive power to regulate a particular field to the Federal Government, there are situations in which state regulation, although harmonious with federal regulation, must nevertheless be invalidated under the Supremacy Clause.  As we stated in <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U. S. 142</a></span> (1963):</p>\n<p>"[F]ederal regulation . . . should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive reasons either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained."</p>\n<p>In this case, we cannot conclude that preemption is required either because "the nature of the . . . subject matter [regulation of employment of illegal aliens] permits no other conclusion," or because "Congress has unmistakably so ordained" that result.</p>\n<p>States possess broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the State.  Child labor laws, minimum and other wage laws, laws affecting occupational health and safety, and workmen\'s compensation laws are only a few examples.  California\'s attempt in \xc2\xa7 2805(a) to prohibit the knowing employment by California employers of persons not entitled to lawful residence in the United States, let alone to work here, is certainly within the mainstream of such police power regulation.  Employment of illegal aliens in times of high unemployment deprives citizens and legally admitted aliens of jobs; acceptance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 424 U. S. 357</a></p><p> by illegal aliens of jobs on substandard terms as to wages and working conditions can seriously depress wage scales and working conditions of citizens and legally admitted aliens; and employment of illegal aliens under such conditions can diminish the effectiveness of labor unions.  These local problems are particularly acute in California in light of the significant influx into that State of illegal aliens from neighboring Mexico.  In attempting to protect California\'s fiscal interests and lawfully resident labor force from the deleterious effects on its economy resulting from the employment of illegal aliens, \xc2\xa7 2805(a) focuses directly upon these essentially local problems, and is tailored to combat effectively the perceived evils.</p>\n<p>Of course, even state regulation designed to protect vital state interests must give way to paramount federal legislation.  But we will not presume that Congress, in enacting the INA, intended to oust state authority to regulate the employment relationship covered by \xc2\xa7 2805(a) in a manner consistent with pertinent federal laws.  Only a demonstration that complete ouster of state power -- including state power to promulgate laws not in conflict with federal laws -- was "<em>the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\'" would justify that conclusion.  <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers v. Paul, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#146">373 U. S. 146</a></span>, quoting <em>Rice v.

They fail to point out, and an independent review does not reveal, any specific indication in either the wording or the legislative history of the INA that Congress intended to preclude even harmonious state regulation touching on aliens in general, or the employment of illegal aliens in particular.

The central concern of the INA is with the terms and conditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country.  The comprehensiveness of the INA scheme for regulation of immigration and naturalization, without more, cannot be said to draw in the employment of illegal aliens as "plainly within . . . [that] central aim of federal regulation."  <em>San Diego Unions v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that comprehensiveness of legislation governing entry and stay of aliens was to be expected in light of the nature and complexity of the subject.  As the Court said in another legislative context:</p>\n<p>"Given the complexity of the matter addressed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 424 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>It is true that a proviso to 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1324, making it a felony to harbor illegal entrants, provides that "employment (including the usual and normal practices incident to employment) shall not be deemed to constitute harboring."  But this is, at best, evidence of a peripheral concern with employment of illegal entrants, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and <em>San Diego Unions v.

Section 2044(b) authorizes revocation of the certificate of registration of any farm labor contractor found to have employed "an alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or who has not been authorized by the Attorney General to accept employment."  Section 2045(f) prohibits farm labor contractors from employing "an alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or who has not been authorized by the Attorney General to accept employment." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Of particular significance to our inquiry </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 424 U.

Although concerned only with agricultural employment, the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act is thus persuasive evidence that the INA should not be taken as legislation by Congress expressing its judgment to have uniform federal regulations in matters affecting employment of illegal aliens, and therefore barring state legislation such as \xc2\xa7 2805(a). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Hines v. Davidowitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html">312 U.

Although both cases relied on the comprehensiveness of the federal regulatory schemes in finding preemptive intent, both federal statutes were in the specific field which the States were attempting to regulate, while here there is no indication that Congress intended to preclude state law in the area of employment regulation.  And <em>Nelson</em> stated that, even in the face of the general immigration laws, States would have the right</p>\n<p>"to enforce their sedition laws at times when the Federal Government has not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 424 U.

Moreover, in neither <em>Hines</em> nor <em>Nelson</em> was there affirmative evidence, as here, that Congress sanctioned concurrent state legislation on the subject covered by the challenged state law.  Furthermore, to the extent those cases were based on the predominance of federal interest in the fields of immigration and foreign affairs, there would not appear to be a similar federal interest in a situation in which the state law is fashioned to remedy local problems, and operates only on local employers, and only with respect to individuals whom the Federal Government has already declared cannot work in this country.  Finally, the Pennsylvania statutes in <em>Hines</em> and <em>Nelson</em> imposed burdens on aliens lawfully within the country that created conflicts with various federal laws.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>There remains the question whether, although the INA contemplates some room for state legislation, \xc2\xa7 2805(a) is nevertheless unconstitutional because it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress" in enacting the INA.  <em>Hines v.

We do not think that we can address that inquiry upon the record before us.  The Court of Appeal did not reach the question in light of its decision, today reversed, that Congress had completely barred state action in the field of employment of illegal aliens.  Accordingly, there are questions of construction of \xc2\xa7 2805(a) to be settled by the California courts before a determination is appropriate whether, as construed, \xc2\xa7 2805(a) "can be enforced without impairing the federal superintendence of the field" covered by the INA.  373 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U.

In its application, does the statute prevent employment of aliens who, although "not entitled to lawful residence in the United States," may, under federal law, be permitted to work here?  Petitioners conceded at oral argument that, on its face, \xc2\xa7 2805(a) would apply to such aliens, and thus unconstitutionally conflict with federal law.  They point, however, to the limiting construction given \xc2\xa7 2805(a) in administrative regulations promulgated by the California Director of Industrial Relations.  California Administrative Code, Title 8, part 1, c. 8, art. 1, \xc2\xa7 16209 (1972), defines an alien "entitled to lawful residence" as follows:</p>\n<p>"An alien entitled to lawful residence shall mean any non-citizen of the United States who is in possession of a Form I-151, Alien Registration Receipt Card, or any other document issued by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service which authorizes him to work."</p>\n<p><em>Dolores Canning Co. v. Howard,</em> 40 Cal.App.3d 673, 677 n. 3, 115 Cal.Rptr, 435, 436 n. 3 (1974).  Whether these regulations were before the Superior Court in this case does not appear, and the Court of Appeal found \xc2\xa7 2805(a) unconstitutional without addressing whether it conflicts with federal law.
