No other cases can be brought here in this mode, and the case in the record is of neither class.  It must come here, if at all, upon writ of error.</p>\n<p>The appeal must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p>* <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/4/22/case.html">Blaine v.
