CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Appellee Orito was charged in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin with a violation of 18 U.S.C.  1462 [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] in that he did</p>\n<p>"knowingly transport and carry in interstate commerce from San Francisco . . . to Milwaukee . . . by means of a common carrier, that is, Trans-World Airlines and North Central Airlines, copies of [specified] obscene, lewd, lascivious, and filthy materials. . . ."</p>\n<p>The materials specified included some 83 reels of film, with as many as eight to 10 copies of some of the films.  Appellee moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute violated his First and Ninth Amendment rights. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The District Court granted his motion, holding that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad, since it failed to distinguish between "public" and "non-public" transportation of obscene material.  The District Court interpreted this Court\'s decisions in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html">381 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965); <em>Redrup v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/767/case.html">386 U. S. 767</a></span> (1967); and <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span> (1969), to establish </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 413 U. S. 141</a></p><p> the proposition that "non-public transportation" of obscene material was constitutionally protected. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the District Court held the statute void on its face for overbreadth, it is not clear whether the statute was held to be overbroad because it covered transportation intended solely for the private use of the transporter, or because, regardless of the intended use of the material, the statute extended to "private carriage" or "nonpublic" transportation which, in itself, involved no risk of exposure to children or unwilling adults.  The United States brought this direct appeal under former 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 (1964 ed.) now amended, Pub.L. 91644, \xc2\xa7 14(a), 84 Stat. 1890.  <em>See United States v. Spector,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/169/case.html">343 U.

S. 171</a></span> (1952).</p>\n<p>The District Court erred in striking down 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1462 and dismissing appellee\'s indictment on these "privacy" grounds.  The essence of appellee\'s contentions is that <em>Stanley</em> has firmly established the right to possess obscene material in the privacy of the home, and that this creates a correlative right to receive it, transport it, or distribute it.  We have rejected that reasoning.  This case was decided by the District Court before our decisions in <em>United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/363/case.html">402 U. S. 363</a></span> (1971), and <em>United States v. Reidel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/351/case.html">402 U. S. 351</a></span> (1971).  Those holdings negate the idea that some zone of constitutionally protected privacy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 413 U.

That the transporter has an abstract proprietary power to shield the obscene material from all others and to guard the material with the same privacy as in the home is not controlling.  Congress may regulate on the basis of the natural tendency of material in the home being kept private and the contrary tendency once material leaves that area, regardless of a transporter\'s professed intent.  Congress could reasonably determine such regulation to be necessary to effect permissible federal control of interstate commerce in obscene material, based as that regulation is on a legislatively determined risk of ultimate exposure to juveniles or to the public and the harm that exposure </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 413 U.

S. 321</a></span>, it was held that Congress might pass a law punishing the transmission of lottery tickets from one State to another, in order to prevent the carriage of those tickets to be sold in other States and thus demoralize, through a spread of the gambling habit, individuals who were likely to purchase. . . .  In <em>Hoke v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/227/308/case.html">227 U. S. 308</a></span> and <em>Caminetti v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/242/470/case.html">242 U. S. 470</a></span>, the so-called White Slave Traffic Act, which was construed to punish any person engaged in enticing a woman from one State to another for immoral ends, whether for commercial purposes or otherwise, was valid because it was intended to prevent the use of interstate commerce to facilitate prostitution or concubinage, and other forms of immorality. . . .  In <em>Weber v. Freed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/239/325/case.html">239 U. S. 325</a></span>, it was held that Congress had power to prohibit the importation of pictorial representations of prize fights designed for public exhibition, because of the demoralizing effect of such exhibitions in the State of destination."</p>\n<p><em>Books v.

S. 432</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/267/432/case.html#436">267 U. S. 436</a></span>-437 (1925).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>We held in <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span>, that an individual reading or examining "obscene" materials in the privacy of his home is protected against state prosecution by reason of the First Amendment made applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth.  We said:</p>\n<p>"These are the rights that appellant is asserting in the case before us.  He is asserting the right to read or observe what he pleases -- the right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home.  He is asserting the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of his library.  Georgia contends that appellant does not have these rights, that there are certain types of materials that the individual may not read or even possess.  Georgia justifies this assertion by arguing that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 413 U. S. 146</a></p><p> films in the present case are obscene.  But we think that mere categorization of these films as \'obscene\' is insufficient justification for such a drastic invasion of personal liberties guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity, we do not think they reach into the privacy of one\'s own home.  If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.  Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men\'s minds."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#565">394 U. S. 565</a></span>.</p>\n<p>By that reasoning, a person who reads an "obscene" book on an airline or bus or train is protected.  So is he who carries an "obscene" book in his pocket during a journey for his intended personal enjoyment.  So is he who carries the book in his baggage or has a trucking company move his household effects to a new residence.  Yet 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1462 <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/139/case.html">*</a></span> makes such interstate carriage unlawful.  Appellee therefore moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that \xc2\xa7 1462 is so broad as to cover "obscene" material designed for personal use.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted the motion, holding that \xc2\xa7 1462 was overbroad and in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>The conclusion is too obvious for argument, unless we are to overrule <em>Stanley.</em>  I would abide by <em>Stanley</em> and affirm the judgment dismissing the indictment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 413 U. S. 147</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We noted probable jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1462, which makes it a federal offense to</p>\n<p>"[bring] into the United States, or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or knowingly [use] any express company or other common carrier, for carriage in interstate or foreign commerce -- (a) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character."</p>\n<p>Appellee was charged in a one-count indictment with having knowingly transported in interstate commerce over 80 reels of allegedly obscene motion picture film.  Relying primarily on our decision in <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span> (1969), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin dismissed the indictment, holding the statute unconstitutional on its face:</p>\n<p>"To prevent the pandering of obscene materials or its exposure to children or to unwilling adults, the government has a substantial and valid interest to bar the non-private transportation of such materials.  However, the statute which is now before the court does not so delimit the government\'s prerogatives; on its face, it forbids the transportation of obscene materials.  Thus, it applies to non-public transportation in the absence of a special governmental interest.  The statute is thus overbroad, in violation of the first and ninth amendments, and is therefore unconstitutional."</p>\n<p>338 F.Supp. 308, 311 (ED Wis.1970).  Under the view expressed in my dissent today in <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#73">413 U. S. 73</a></span>, it is clear that the statute before us cannot stand.  Whatever the extent of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 413 U. S. 148</a></p><p> the Federal Government\'s power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.  <em>See</em> my dissent in <em>Miller v. California, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U. S. 47</a></span>.  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>"Whoever brings into the United States, or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or knowingly uses any express company or other common carrier, for carriage in interstate or foreign commerce -- "</p>\n<p>"(a) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
