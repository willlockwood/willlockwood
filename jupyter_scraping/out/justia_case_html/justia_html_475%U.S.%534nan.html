The School District took no appeal, but complied with the judgment and allowed the students\' club to conduct the meetings as requested.

We conclude that, although the School Board itself had a sufficient stake in the outcome of the litigation to appeal, an individual Board member cannot invoke the Board\'s interest in the case to confer standing upon himself.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In September 1981 a group of high school students in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, formed a club called "Petros" for the purpose of promoting "spiritual growth and positive attitudes in the lives of its members."  App. 46.  The group asked the Principal of the high school for permission to meet on school premises during student activity periods scheduled during the regular schoolday on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  The Principal allowed Petros to hold an organizational meeting that was attended by approximately 45 students.  At that meeting, passages of scripture were read and some students prayed.  There is no evidence that any students, or parents, expressed any opposition or concern about future meetings of Petros.  The Principal nevertheless advised the group that they could not hold any further meetings until he had discussed the matter with the School Superintendent.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 475 U. S. 537</a></p><p> The Superintendent, in turn, advised the students that he would respond to their written request for recognition after he received "competent legal advice [from the School District\'s Solicitor] as to the propriety of approving establishment of the proposed prayer club" on school premises.  <em>Id.</em> at 42.</p>\n<p>On November 16, 1981, the Principal and the Superintendent met with representatives of Petros and advised them that, "based on the Solicitor\'s legal opinion, their request must be denied."  563 F.Supp. 697, 701 (MD Pa.1983).  The legal opinion is not a part of the record; nor does the record contain any evidence that the Principal, the Superintendent, or any other person except the Solicitor had voiced any opposition to the proposed meetings by Petros.  Indeed, Petros was informed that it could meet off school premises, and "would be given released time during the activity period" if it could secure "a location and an adult supervisor, preferably a clergyman" for their meetings.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The students thereafter wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Williamsport Area School Board appealing the Superintendent\'s decision.  At a meeting held January 19, 1982, the Board upheld the Superintendent\'s decision and "denied the appeal on the basis of the Solicitor\'s opinion."  <em>Ibid.</em> (citations omitted).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>On June 2, 1982, 10 of the students filed suit in the United States District Court against the Williamsport Area School District, the 9 members of the School Board, the Superintendent of the District, and the Principal of the high school.  Although there is a general allegation in the first paragraph of the complaint that the action was brought against the defendants "in their individual and official capacities," App. 13, the specific allegation concerning each of the named members of the Board was in this form:  "John C. Youngman, Jr., is a member of the Williamsport Area School Board and is sued in that capacity," <em>id.</em> at 16.  The complaint alleged that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 475 U. S. 538</a></p><p> defendants\' refusal to recognize Petros and to allow it to meet on the same basis as other student groups because of its religious activities violated the First Amendment.  The complaint prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>One answer was filed on behalf of all the defendants.  Although they admitted most of the material allegations of the complaint, they alleged that they had</p>\n<p>"requested and received in writing an opinion from the school district solicitor and legal counsel that it would be unlawful, improper and unconstitutional to recognize said group as a student organization."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 33.</p>\n<p>After plaintiffs completed their discovery (defendants took no depositions), the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment supported by affidavits, the deposition testimony, and statements of material fact not in dispute.  On November 9, 1982, the District Court entered an order finding that the record was incomplete.  It thereupon directed the parties to submit affidavits or other documentation concerning</p>\n<p>"the exact nature of the activity period, the type of activities or clubs that have been, and would be, approved, and what proposed groups, if any, have been denied approval."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 101.  After that additional information was supplied, and after the case had been fully briefed, the District Court, on May 12, 1983, filed a detailed and carefully written opinion in which it stated:</p>\n<p>"Presently before the court are the parties\' cross-motions for summary judgment. . . .  Although the case presents only a question of law, this is not to say that the facts are unimportant.  On the contrary, the undisputed facts are of paramount importance to the resolution of the legal question presented in this case.  A slight change in the facts could very well have dictated a contrary decision."</p>\n<p>"After carefully reviewing those facts, and after giving full consideration to all pertinent legal authority, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 475 U. S. 539</a></p><p> the court concludes that, because the defendant school district is not constitutionally required to deny the plaintiffs the opportunity to meet, by doing so solely on constitutional grounds, it has impermissibly burdened their free-speech rights.  Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of the plaintiffs."</p>\n<p>563 F.Supp. at 699-700.  The final order entered by the District Court was a ruling "in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants on plaintiffs\' freedom of speech claim." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  No injunction was entered, and no relief was granted against any defendant in his individual capacity.  The District Court, in effect, merely held that the Board\'s attorney was incorrect in his legal advice.</p>\n<p>The School District did not challenge the judgment of the District Court in any way.  It made no motion for a stay, and took no appeal.  Instead, it decided to comply with the judgment and to allow Petros to conduct the meetings it had requested.</p>\n<p>However, John C. Youngman, Jr., who was then still a member of the Board, did file a timely notice of appeal. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the Court of Appeals, no one raised any question about Mr. Youngman\'s standing to appeal.  The court did note that all of the original plaintiffs had graduated from high school, but it granted a motion to add additional plaintiffs who were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 475 U. S. 540</a></p><p> currently enrolled students in order to prevent the case from becoming moot.  741 F.2d 538, 542, n. 4 (CA3 1984).  Neither the majority nor the dissenting opinion even mentioned Mr. Youngman.</p>\n<p>After repeatedly stressing "the crucial role which the particular facts play in every first amendment analysis," <em>id.</em> at 541-542, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the majority of the Court of Appeals held</p>\n<p>"that the particular circumstances disclosed by this record and present at the Williamsport Area High School lead to the inexorable conclusion that the constitutional balance of interests tilts against permitting the Petros activity to be conducted within the school as a general activity program,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 561.</p>\n<p>In dissent, Judge Adams suggested that the majority had implicitly adopted a <em>per se</em> rule because of its concern about "the possibility of unconstitutional extensions of the Williamsport arrangement elsewhere," instead of performing the "more difficult adjudicative task [of carefully sifting the facts] on a case-by-case basis."  <em>Id.</em> at 569.</p>\n<p>The importance of the question presented by the students\' petition for certiorari persuaded us that the case merited plenary review.  469 U.S. 1206 (1985).  After granting certiorari, however, we noticed that neither the Board nor any of the defendants except Mr. Youngman opposed the students\' position, and that only Mr. Youngman had challenged the District Court\'s judgment by invoking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.  We therefore find it necessary to answer the question whether Mr. Youngman had a sufficient </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 475 U. S. 541</a></p><p> stake in the outcome of the litigation to support appellate jurisdiction.  The parties and the <em>amici</em> have identified three different capacities in which Mr. Youngman may have had standing to appeal -- as an individual, as a member of the Board, and as a parent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before considering each of the standing theories, it is appropriate to restate certain basic principles that limit the power of every federal court.  Federal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction; they have only the power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress pursuant thereto.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">5 U. S. </a></span> Madison,</em> 1 Cranch 137,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html#173">5 U. S. 173</a></span>-180 (1803).  For that reason, every federal appellate court has a special obligation to "satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review," even though the parties are prepared to concede it.  <em>Mitchell v. Maurer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/237/case.html">293 U. S. 237</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/237/case.html#244">293 U. S. 244</a></span> (1934).  <em>See Juidice v. Vail,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/327/case.html">430 U. S. 327</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/327/case.html#331">430 U. S. 331</a></span>-332 (1977) (standing).</p>\n<p>"And if the record discloses that the lower court was without jurisdiction, this court will notice the defect, although the parties make no contention concerning it.  [When the lower federal court] lack[s] jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal, not of the merits but merely for the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in entertaining the suit."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Corrick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/435/case.html">298 U. S. 435</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/435/case.html#440">298 U. S. 440</a></span> (1936) (footnotes omitted). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>This obligation to notice defects in a court of appeals\' subject matter jurisdiction assumes a special importance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 475 U. S. 542</a></p><p> when a constitutional question is presented.  In such cases, we have strictly adhered to the standing requirements to ensure that our deliberations will have the benefit of adversary presentation and a full development of the relevant facts. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Thus, as we emphasized in <em>Valley Forge Christian College v.

It tends to assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.  The \'standing\' requirement serves other purposes.  Because it assures an actual factual setting in which the litigant asserts a claim of injury in fact, a court may decide the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 475 U.

There is, however, nothing else in the complaint, or in the record on which the District Court\'s judgment was based, to support the suggestion that relief was sought against any School Board member in his or her <em>individual</em> capacity.  Certainly the District Court\'s judgment granted no such relief.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra.</em>  Accordingly, to paraphrase our holding in <em>Brandon v.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Thus, even if one were amenable to the dissent\'s unprecedented (and unexplained) suggestion that the principle governing determination of subject matter jurisdiction should be relaxed on appeal, the proposed exception for litigants who were "proper part[ies]" in the District Court, <em>post,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/case.html#552">475 U.

Tacitly conceding Mr. Youngman\'s lack of standing on these two bases, the dissent instead would confer standing on Mr. Youngman as a parent -- a capacity in which he plainly was not a party in the District Court, and to which, therefore, the dissent\'s reasoning does not apply.  Having </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 475 U.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 24(a), (c).  No such pleading was filed in either of the courts below.  It is particularly important to observe these requirements in cases in which the interest of the litigant seeking to appeal diverges from the interest of the party to the suit.  In this case, Mr. Youngman\'s interest as a parent was not necessarily parallel to the interest of the School Board.  For although the record plainly demonstrates that the School Board was interested in obeying the law -- it dutifully followed its lawyer\'s advice when he concluded that group worship conducted on school premises would violate the Establishment Clause -- it also decided not to appeal the District Court\'s contrary ruling, and the record does not indicate that the Board disfavored (or favored) groups such as Petros.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join JUSTICE STEVENS\' opinion for the Court.  I write separately to emphasize that the parties cannot, contrary to the contention of the Solicitor General and THE CHIEF JUSTICE, invoke the Article III jurisdiction of this Court through a belated nontestimonial statement by Mr. Youngman that he is a parent of a child in the Williamsport Area High School.</p>\n<p>This lawsuit on appeal was <em>not</em> "the same dispute between the same parties," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/case.html#551">475 U. S. 551</a></span>, as the one conducted in the District Court.  The dispute litigated in the District Court was one between certain students wishing to conduct prayer group activities as part of an official school activity period, on the one hand, and a School Board that refused them permission to do so, on the other.  Mr. Youngman participated in that lawsuit only as a member of the School Board, sued in his official capacity.  The real party in interest in that lawsuit was the Board.  <em>Kentucky v. Graham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/159/case.html">473 U.

That controversy ended with the entry of the District Court judgment; the School Board, voting 8-1 with Mr. Youngman in the minority, abandoned its earlier position and agreed to allow plaintiffs to conduct the prayer group activities they sought.  There was therefore nothing left to litigate between those parties.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit sought to be litigated on appeal is a different one.  This dispute, under THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'s theory, is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 475 U. S. 550</a></p><p> one between Mr. Youngman, asserting that he is a parent of a child in the Williamsport Area High School whose First Amendment rights would be infringed by his attendance at a school whose activities impermissibly advance religion, on the one hand, and students seeking to conduct prayer group activities, on the other.  The School Board itself is nowhere to be found.  I do not contest that Mr. Youngman could pursue this dispute on appeal had he intervened in the lawsuit in his capacity as a parent.  Absent such intervention, it is conceivable that Mr. Youngman might bottom his standing to raise such an argument on facts in the record setting out his status as a parent.  There are, however, no such facts anywhere in the extensive record in this case.  There is not one word in the <em>record</em> indicating that Mr. Youngman is a father at all.  Nor did Mr. Youngman claim such status in his notice of appeal.  App. 166.</p>\n<p>In fact, the brief for respondent filed in this Court suggests that Mr. Youngman did <em>not</em> have a child in the Williamsport Area High School when he filed his notice of appeal from the District Court\'s decision on June 10, 1983.  Benjamin Youngman, rather, apparently is claimed to have begun studying at that school several months later, in the fall of 1983.  Brief for Respondent Youngman 6, and n. 3.  Assertions in the parties\' briefs are not part of the record for purposes of determining our jurisdiction.  This discrepancy, however, illustrates the wisdom of our long-established rule requiring that the facts supporting our Article III jurisdiction "appea[r] affirmatively from the record."  <em>King Bridge Co. v.

Because respondent Youngman had standing to appeal, however, I would reach the merits of this dispute and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Mr. Youngman is a parent of a student at Williamsport High School; as a matter of conscience, he is opposed to prayer activities on school premises during school hours.  As this Court has repeatedly held, parents have standing to challenge conditions in public schools that their children attend.  <em>See Engel v. Vitale,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/421/case.html">370 U. S. 421</a></span> (1962); <em>Zorach v. Clauson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html">343 U. S. 306</a></span> (1952).  The Court\'s principal objection to Youngman\'s standing as a parent stems from his failure</p>\n<p>"to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court\'s remedial powers."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/case.html#545">475 U. S. 545</a></span>-547, and n. 8 (quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U.

It is, of course, perfectly sensible to impose such pleading burdens upon the plaintiff who initiates the litigation.  These burdens, however, need not be placed upon a properly named defendant, like Mr. Youngman, who seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.  Once the jurisdiction of the district court over a particular dispute is established, it seems clear that the same dispute between the same parties will remain within the Article III powers of the courts on appeal.  To be sure, we require that the case or controversy requirement be met throughout the course of the litigation.  But the method for determining whether the case or controversy exists and the burdens placed on the parties should not, indeed cannot, be the same on appeal as in the district court.  At the district court stage, the facts required by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 475 U. S. 552</a></p><p> <em>Warth, supra,</em> should normally appear on the face of the complaint.  At the appellate stage, however, the "complaining party" does not allege any facts, but merely identifies himself as a party to the case in the district court and challenges the validity of that decision.  Only if the appellant\'s standing is challenged must he allege facts sufficient to convince the court of appeals that he is a proper party to pursue the appeal.  Here, petitioners not only failed to challenge Youngman\'s standing before the Court of Appeals, they also conceded that, had they challenged Youngman\'s standing, he would have satisfied the <em>Warth</em> standing test. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>I would reach the issue the Court granted certiorari to address:  whether the Establishment Clause requires a public high school to prevent a student-initiated, student-led group from meeting during an extracurricular activity period.</p>\n<p>The Establishment Clause prohibits Congress and, through the Fourteenth Amendment, the States from passing any law "respecting an establishment of religion."  As we have observed on other occasions, the precise contours of this prohibition remain unclear.  But it is common ground that nothing in the Establishment Clause requires the State to suppress a person\'s speech merely because the <em>content</em> of the speech is religious in character.  In <em>McDaniel v. Paty,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/618/case.html">435 U. S. 618</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/618/case.html#641">435 U. S. 641</a></span> (1978), JUSTICE BRENNAN emphasized in his opinion concurring in the judgment that</p>\n<p>"[t]he Establishment Clause does not license government to treat religion and those who teach or practice it, simply by virtue of their status as such, as subversive of American ideals and therefore subject to unique disabilities."</p>\n<p>And more recently, in <em>Widmar v. Vincent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/case.html">454 U. S. 263</a></span> (1981), we held that the Establishment Clause did not justify a university\'s content-based exclusion of religious speech from a forum generally open to student groups. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 475 U. S. 553</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Widmar</em> clearly controls the resolution of this case.  Petros is a student-initiated and student-1ed group seeking the same forum available to other student extracurricular activity groups.  The students would have been allowed to meet to discuss moral philosophy or Marxism, to practice French, or to play chess; but, since they chose to worship, the school decided that it could not allow the group to meet without violating the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals agreed that the Establishment Clause prohibited Petros from meeting on school premises because to allow it to meet could have been misinterpreted by other students as active state support of religion.  Under that analysis, because an individual\'s discussion of religious beliefs may be confused by others as being that of the State, both must be viewed as the same.  Yet the several commands of the First Amendment require vision capable of distinguishing between <em>state</em> establishment of religion, which is prohibited by the Establishment Clause, and <em>individual</em> participation and advocacy of religion, which, far from being prohibited by the Establishment Clause, is affirmatively protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment.  If the latter two commands are to retain any vitality, utterly unproven, subjective impressions of some hypothetical students should not be allowed to transform <em>individual</em> expression of religious belief into <em>state</em> advancement of religion.</p>\n<p>No one would contend that the State would be authorized to dismantle a church erected by private persons on private property because overwhelming evidence showed that other members of the community <em>thought</em> the church was owned and operated by the State.  That the "primary effect" of state inaction might turn out to advance the cause of organized religion has no bearing upon the threshold question of whether the challenged activity is conducted by the State or by individuals. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 475 U. S. 554</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Establishment Clause mandates state neutrality, not hostility, toward religion.  As Justice Black stated for the Court in <em>Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#18">330 U. S. 18</a></span> (1947), the First Amendment</p>\n<p>"requires the state to be neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers; it does not require the state to be their adversary.  State power is no more to be used so as to handicap religions than it is to favor them."</p>\n<p>In <em>Zorach v. Clauson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html">343 U. S. 306</a></span> (1952), the Court upheld a state law allowing schools to release students, during school hours, so that they could receive religious instruction elsewhere.  Although the State did not compel students to go to religious classes, the program undoubtedly advanced the cause of religion.  Justice Douglas, writing for the Court, eloquently rejected the suggestion that the program thereby violated the Establishment Clause:</p>\n<p>"We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.  We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses.  We make room for as wide a variety of beliefs and creeds as the spiritual needs of man deem necessary.  We sponsor an attitude on the part of government that shows no partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal of its dogma.  When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.  To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html#313">343 U. S. 313</a></span>-314.</p>\n<p>By granting the student prayer group equal access to the student activity forum, the order of the District Court "follows the best of our traditions," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html#314">343 U.

Although I would have reached this issue on the merits, it is appropriate that the Court, by vacating the judgment of the Court of Appeals, restores the sound analysis and judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that respondent Youngman has standing to appeal, and also agree with much of his dissenting opinion.  I write briefly to say that, on its merits, this case is controlled by <em>Widmar v. Vincent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/case.html">454 U. S. 263</a></span> (1981).</p>\n<p>As in that case, respondent School District simply had "created a forum generally open for use by student groups."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/case.html#267">454 U. S. 267</a></span>.  The School District provided 30-minute periods on Tuesdays and Thursdays for high school students to meet in groups in separate school rooms for extracurricular activities, including discussion or debate on any subject of their choosing.  A religious group was formed for reading passages of scripture and for prayer.  Although there were no complaints by students, faculty, or parents, on the basis of a legal opinion, the Principal advised the group that it could not meet during these periods.  As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes in his dissent, this is "a student-initiated and student-led group seeking the same forum available to other student extracurricular activity groups."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/case.html#553">475 U. S. 553</a></span>.  At the time of this suit, there was a total of 25 identified groups, each organized by students.  All of these groups were free to discuss any subject other than a religious one.</p>\n<p>In <em>Widmar,</em> under essentially the same circumstances, we held that the University of Missouri at Kansas City had</p>\n<p>"discriminated against student groups and speakers based on their desire to use a generally open forum to engage in religious worship and discussion.  These are forms of speech and association protected by the First Amendment."</p>\n<p>454 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/case.html#269">454 U. S. 269</a></span>.  The only arguable distinction between <em>Widmar</em> and this case is that <em>Widmar</em> involved university students, while the groups here are composed of high school </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 475 U. S. 556</a></p><p> students.  We did note in <em>Widmar</em> that university students are "less impressionable than younger students, and should be able to appreciate that the University\'s policy is one of neutrality toward religion."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/case.html#274">454 U. S. 274</a></span>, n. 14.  Other decisions, however, have recognized that the First Amendment rights of speech and association extend also to high school students.  <em>See, e.g., Board of Education v. Pico,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/853/case.html">457 U. S. 853</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/853/case.html#864">457 U.

I do not believe -- particularly in this age of massive media information -- that the few years\' difference in age between high school and college students justifies departing from <em>Widmar.</em>  I accordingly dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
