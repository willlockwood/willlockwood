CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>The act of assembly of Virginia is copied almost literally from the English statute of 8 and 9 W, III, c. 11.  The case in 6 Mod. is a decision expressly upon that statute, and is precisely in point, that the defendant upon the <em>scire facias</em> can only plead what the intestate could have pleaded, and that it is not to be considered as a proceeding against the representative of the deceased, but a continuance of the original action.</p>\n<p>The plea is such as could not have been pleaded in the original action, and is therefore bad.</p>\n<p>The judgment must be</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and the cause remanded for the defendant to plead to the original action if he should think proper.</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/10/183/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>To a question by E. J. Lee, THE CHIEF JUSTICE answered that if the plaintiff in error should obtain a judgment in the court below, it will of course be with costs.  So in all cases of reversal, if this Court direct the court below to enter judgment for the plaintiff in error, the court below will, of course, enter the judgment with the costs of that court.</p>\n<p>* The court below considered this case as coming within the act of Congress, vol. 1, p 71, \xc2\xa7 31 passed 24 September, 1789, which authorizes the court "to render judgment for or against the executor or administrator, as the case may require."  It does not appear whether that act was taken into consideration by this Court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
