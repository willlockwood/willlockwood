Respondent made statements that implicated him in the crime that the agent sought to solve.  Respondent claims that the statements should be inadmissible because he had not been given <em>Miranda</em> warnings by the agent.  We hold that the statements are admissible.  <em>Miranda</em> warnings are not required when the suspect is unaware that he is speaking to a law enforcement officer, and gives a voluntary statement.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In November, 1984, Richard Stephenson was murdered in a suburb of East St. Louis, Illinois.  The murder remained unsolved until March, 1986, when one Donald Charlton told police that he had learned about a homicide from a fellow inmate at the Graham Correctional Facility, where Charlton had been serving a sentence for burglary.  The fellow inmate was Lloyd Perkins, who is the respondent here.  Charlton told police that, while at Graham, he had befriended respondent, who told him in detail about a murder that respondent had committed in East St. Louis.  On hearing Charlton\'s account, the police recognized details of the Stephenson murder that were not well known, and so they treated Charlton\'s story as a credible one.</p>\n<p>By the time the police heard Charlton\'s account, respondent had been released from Graham, but police traced him to a jail in Montgomery County, Illinois, where he was being held pending trial on a charge of aggravated battery, unrelated to the Stephenson murder.  The police wanted to investigate further respondent\'s connection to the Stephenson murder, but feared that the use of an eavesdropping device would prove impracticable and unsafe.  They decided instead to place an undercover agent in the cellblock with respondent and Charlton.  The plan was for Charlton and undercover </p><p><a class="page-number" name="295">Page 496 U. S. 295</a></p><p> agent John Parisi to pose as escapees from a work release program who had been arrested in the course of a burglary.  Parisi and Charlton were instructed to engage respondent in casual conversation and report anything he said about the Stephenson murder.</p>\n<p>Parisi, using the alias "Vito Bianco," and Charlton, both clothed in jail garb, were placed in the cellblock with respondent at the Montgomery County jail.  The cellblock consisted of 12 separate cells that opened onto a common room.  Respondent greeted Charlton who, after a brief conversation with respondent, introduced Parisi by his alias.  Parisi told respondent that he "wasn\'t going to do any more time," and suggested that the three of them escape.  Respondent replied that the Montgomery County jail was "rinky-dink," and that they could "break out."  The trio met in respondent\'s cell later that evening, after the other inmates were asleep, to refine their plan.  Respondent said that his girlfriend could smuggle in a pistol.  Charlton said "Hey, I\'m not a murderer, I\'m a burglar.  That\'s your guys\' profession."  After telling Charlton that he would be responsible for any murder that occurred, Parisi asked respondent if he had ever "done" anybody.  Respondent said that he had, and proceeded to describe at length the events of the Stephenson murder.  Parisi and respondent then engaged in some casual conversation before respondent went to sleep.  Parisi did not give respondent <em>Miranda</em> warnings before the conversations.</p>\n<p>Respondent was charged with the Stephenson murder.  Before trial, he moved to suppress the statements made to Parisi in the jail.  The trial court granted the motion to suppress, and the State appealed.  The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), prohibits all undercover contacts with incarcerated suspects which are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 493 U.S. 808 (1989), to decide whether an undercover law enforcement officer must give </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 496 U. S. 296</a></p><p> <em>Miranda</em> warnings to an incarcerated suspect before asking him questions that may elicit an incriminating response.  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra,</em> the Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prohibits admitting statements given by a suspect during "custodial interrogation" without a prior warning.  Custodial interrogation means "questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody. . . ."  <em>Id.,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#444">384 U. S. 444</a></span>.  The warning mandated by <em>Miranda</em> was meant to preserve the privilege during "incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#445">384 U. S. 445</a></span>.  That atmosphere is said to generate</p>\n<p>"inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\'s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#467">384 U.

Coercion is determined from the perspective of the suspect.  <em>Rhode Island v. Innis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html">446 U. S. 291</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html#301">446 U. S. 301</a></span> (1980); <em>Berkemer v.

When a suspect considers himself in the company of cellmates and not officers, the coercive atmosphere is lacking.  <em>Miranda,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#449">384 U. S. 449</a></span>("The <em>principal psychological factor contributing to a successful interrogation is privacy -- being alone with the person under interrogation\'"); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#445">384 U. S. 445</a></span>.  There is no empirical basis for the assumption that a suspect speaking to those whom he assumes are not officers will feel compelled to speak by the fear </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 496 U. S. 297</a></em></p><p><em> of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of more lenient treatment should he confess.\n</em></p>\n<p>It is the premise of <em>Miranda</em> that the danger of coercion results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation.  We reject the argument that <em>Miranda</em> warnings are required whenever a suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses with someone who happens to be a government agent.  Questioning by captors, who appear to control the suspect\'s fate, may create mutually reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will weaken the suspect\'s will, but where a suspect does not know that he is conversing with a government agent, these pressures do not exist.  The State Court here mistakenly assumed that, because the suspect was in custody, no undercover questioning could take place.  When the suspect has no reason to think that the listeners have official power over him, it should not be assumed that his words are motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.  "[W]hen the agent carries neither badge nor gun and wears not <em>police blue,\' but the same prison gray" as the suspect, there is no "interplay between police interrogation and police custody."  Kamisar, <em>Brewer v. Williams, Massiah</em> and <em>Miranda:</em>  What is "Interrogation"?  When Does it Matter?, 67 Geo.L.J. 1, 67, 63 (1978).\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Miranda</em> forbids coercion, not mere strategic deception by taking advantage of a suspect\'s misplaced trust in one he supposes to be a fellow prisoner.  As we recognized in <em>Miranda,</em></p>\n<p>"[c]onfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement.  Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#478">384 U. S. 478</a></span>.  Ploys to mislead a suspect or lull him into a false sense of security that do not rise to the level of compulsion or coercion to speak are not within <em>Miranda\'s</em> concerns.  <em>Cf. Oregon v. Mathiason,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/492/case.html">429 U. S. 492</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/492/case.html#495">429 U. S. 495</a></span>-496 (1977) (per curiam); <em>Moran v. Burbine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html">475 U. S. 412</a></span> (1986) (where police fail to inform suspect of attorney\'s efforts to reach him, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 496 U. S. 298</a></p><p> neither <em>Miranda</em> nor Fifth Amendment require suppression of prearraignment confession after voluntary waiver).</p>\n<p><em>Miranda</em> was not meant to protect suspects from boasting about their criminal activities in front of persons whom they believe to be their cellmates.  This case is illustrative.  Respondent had no reason to feel that undercover agent Parisi had any legal authority to force him to answer questions or that Parisi could affect respondent\'s future treatment.  Respondent viewed the cellmate-agent as an equal, and showed no hint of being intimidated by the atmosphere of the jail.  In recounting the details of the Stephenson murder, respondent was motivated solely by the desire to impress his fellow inmates.  He spoke at his own peril.</p>\n<p>The tactic employed here to elicit a voluntary confession from a suspect does not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause.  We held in <em>Hoffa v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/293/case.html">385 U. S. 293</a></span> (1966), that placing an undercover agent near a suspect in order to gather incriminating information was permissible under the Fifth Amendment.  In <em>Hoffa,</em> while petitioner Hoffa was on trial, he met often with one Partin, who, unbeknownst to Hoffa, was cooperating with law enforcement officials.  Partin reported to officials that Hoffa had divulged his attempts to bribe jury members.  We approved using Hoffa\'s statements at his subsequent trial for jury tampering, on the rationale that "no claim ha[d] been or could [have been] made that [Hoffa\'s] incriminating statements were the product of any sort of coercion, legal or factual."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/293/case.html#304">385 U. S. 304</a></span>.  In addition, we found that the fact that Partin had fooled Hoffa into thinking that Partin was a sympathetic colleague did not affect the voluntariness of the statements.  <em>Ibid.  Cf. Oregon v. Mathiason, supra,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/492/case.html#495">429 U.

The only difference between this case and <em>Hoffa</em> is that the suspect here was incarcerated, but </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 496 U. S. 299</a></p><p> detention, whether or not for the crime in question, does not warrant a presumption that the use of an undercover agent to speak with an incarcerated suspect makes any confession thus obtained involuntary.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <em>Mathis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/1/case.html">391 U. S. 1</a></span> (1968), is distinguishable.  In <em>Mathis,</em> an inmate in a state prison was interviewed by an Internal Revenue Service agent about possible tax violations.  No <em>Miranda</em> warning was given before questioning.  The Court held that the suspect\'s incriminating statements were not admissible at his subsequent trial on tax fraud charges.  The suspect in <em>Mathis</em> was aware that the agent was a government official, investigating the possibility of noncompliance with the tax laws.  The case before us now is different.  Where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a government agent, there is no reason to assume the possibility that the suspect might feel coerced.  (The bare fact of custody may not in every instance require a warning, even when the suspect is aware that he is speaking to an official, but we do not have occasion to explore that issue here.)</p>\n<p>This Court\'s Sixth Amendment decisions in <em>Massiah v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/case.html">377 U. S. 201</a></span> (1964), <em>United States v.

Moulton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/159/case.html">474 U. S. 159</a></span> (1985), also do not avail respondent.  We held in those cases that the government may not use an undercover agent to circumvent the Sixth Amendment right to counsel once a suspect has been charged with the crime.  After charges have been filed, the Sixth Amendment prevents the government from interfering with the accused\'s right to counsel.  <em>Moulton, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/159/case.html#176">474 U. S. 176</a></span>.  In the instant case, no charges had been filed on the subject of the interrogation, and our Sixth Amendment precedents are not applicable.</p>\n<p>Respondent can seek no help from his argument that a bright-line rule for the application of <em>Miranda</em> is desirable.  Law enforcement officers will have little difficulty putting into practice our holding that undercover agents need not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 496 U. S. 300</a></p><p> give <em>Miranda</em> warnings to incarcerated suspects.  The use of undercover agents is a recognized law enforcement technique, often employed in the prison context to detect violence against correctional officials or inmates as well as for the purposes served here.  The interests protected by <em>Miranda</em> are not implicated in these cases, and the warnings are not required to safeguard the constitutional rights of inmates who make voluntary statements to undercover agents.</p>\n<p>We hold that an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fellow inmate need not give <em>Miranda</em> warnings to an incarcerated suspect before asking questions that may elicit an incriminating response.  The statements at issue in this case were voluntary, and there is no federal obstacle to their admissibility at trial.  We now reverse and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>Justice BRENNAN, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), does not require suppression of a statement made by an incarcerated suspect to an undercover agent.  Although I do not subscribe to the majority\'s characterization of <em>Miranda</em> in its entirety, I do agree that, when a suspect does not know that his questioner is a police agent, such questioning does not amount to "interrogation" in an "inherently coercive" environment so as to require application of <em>Miranda.</em>  Since the only issue raised at this stage of the litigation is the applicability of <em>Miranda,</em><l=>* I concur in the judgment of the Court. </l=></p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 496 U.

The police devised a ruse to lure respondent into incriminating himself when he was in jail on an unrelated charge.

The State is in a unique position to exploit this vulnerability because it has virtually complete control over the suspect\'s environment.  Thus, the State can ensure that a suspect is barraged with questions from an undercover agent until the suspect confesses.  <em>Cf. Mincey v.

Because Lloyd Perkins received no <em>Miranda</em> warnings before he was subjected to custodial interrogation, his confession was not admissible.</p>\n<p>The Court reaches the contrary conclusion by fashioning an exception to the <em>Miranda</em> rule that applies whenever "an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fellow inmate . . . ask[s] questions that may elicit an incriminating response" from an incarcerated suspect.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/292/case.html#300">496 U.

This exception is inconsistent with the rationale supporting <em>Miranda,</em> and allows police officers intentionally to take advantage of suspects unaware of their constitutional rights.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p>The Court does not dispute that the police officer here conducted a custodial interrogation of a criminal suspect.  Perkins was incarcerated in county jail during the questioning at issue here; under these circumstances, he was in custody as that term is defined in <em>Miranda.</em>  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#444">384 U.

The Solicitor General argues that Perkins was not in custody for purpose of <em>Miranda</em> because he was familiar with the custodial environment as a result of being in jail for two days and previously spending time in prison.  Brief for United States 11.  Perkins\' familiarity with confinement, however, does not transform his incarceration into some sort of noncustodial arrangement.  <em>Cf. Orozco v.

The officer\'s narration of the "conversation" at Perkins\' trial, however, reveals that it clearly was an interrogation.</p>\n<p>"[Agent:]  You ever do anyone?"</p>\n<p>"[Perkins:]  Yeah, once in East St. Louis, in a rich white neighborhood."</p>\n<p>"Informant:  I didn\'t know they had any rich white neighborhoods in East St. Louis."</p>\n<p>"Perkins:  It wasn\'t in East St. Louis, it was by a race track in Fairview Heights. . . .

The police officer continued the inquiry, asking a series of questions designed to elicit specific information about the victim, the crime scene, the weapon, Perkins\' motive, and his actions during and after the shooting.  <em>Id.</em> at 50-52.  This interaction was not a "conversation"; Perkins, the officer, and the informant were not equal participants in a free-ranging discussion, with each man offering his views on different topics.  Rather, it was an interrogation:  Perkins was subjected to express questioning likely to evoke an incriminating response.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 496 U.

S. 300</a></span>-301 (1980).</p>\n<p>Because Perkins was interrogated by police while he was in custody, <em>Miranda</em> required that the officer inform him of his rights.  In rejecting that conclusion, the Court finds that "conversations" between undercover agents and suspects are devoid of the coercion inherent in stationhouse interrogations conducted by law enforcement officials who openly represent the State.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/292/case.html#296">496 U.

It dealt with any police tactics that may operate to compel a suspect in custody to make incriminating statements without full awareness of his constitutional rights.  <em>See Miranda, supra,</em>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#468">384 U.

The psychological pressures inherent in confinement increase the suspect\'s anxiety, making him likely to seek relief by talking with others.

D3 (prosecutors have found that prisoners often talk freely with fellow inmates).  The inmate is thus more susceptible to efforts by undercover agents to elicit information from him.  Similarly, where the suspect is incarcerated, the constant threat of physical danger peculiar to the prison environment may make him demonstrate his toughness to other inmates by recounting or inventing past violent acts.</p>\n<p>"Because the suspect\'s ability to select people with whom he can confide is completely within their control, the police have a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 496 U.

In this case, the police deceptively took advantage of Perkins\' psychological vulnerability by including him in a sham escape plot, a situation in which he would feel compelled to demonstrate his willingness to shoot a prison guard by revealing his past involvement in a murder.  <em>See</em> App. 49 (agent stressed that a killing might be necessary in the escape and then asked Perkins if he had ever murdered someone).</p>\n<p>Thus, the pressures unique to custody allow the police to use deceptive interrogation tactics to compel a suspect to make an incriminating statement.  The compulsion is not eliminated by the suspect\'s ignorance of his interrogator\'s true identity.  The Court therefore need not inquire past the bare facts of custody and interrogation to determine whether <em>Miranda</em> warnings are required.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s adoption of an exception to the <em>Miranda</em> doctrine is incompatible with the principle, consistently applied by this Court, that the doctrine should remain simple and clear.  <em>See, e.g., Miranda, supra,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#441">384 U.

But the outer boundaries of the exception created by the Court are by no means clear.  Would <em>Miranda</em> be violated, for instance, if an undercover police officer beat a confession out of a suspect, but the suspect thought the officer was another prisoner who wanted the information for his own purposes?</p>\n<p>Even if <em>Miranda,</em> as interpreted by the Court, would not permit such obviously compelled confessions, the ramifications of today\'s opinion are still disturbing.  The exception carved out of the <em>Miranda</em> doctrine today may well result in a proliferation of departmental policies to encourage police officers to conduct interrogations of confined suspects through undercover agents, thereby circumventing the need to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  Indeed, if <em>Miranda</em> now requires a police officer to issue warnings only in those situations in which the suspect might feel compelled "to speak by the fear of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of more lenient treatment should he confess," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/292/case.html#296">496 U. S. 296</a></span>-297, presumably it allows custodial interrogation by an undercover officer posing as a member of the clergy or a suspect\'s defense attorney.  Although such abhorrent tricks would play on a suspect\'s need to confide in a trusted adviser, neither would cause the suspect to "think that the listeners have official power over him," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/292/case.html#297">496 U. S. 297</a></span>.  The Court\'s adoption of the "undercover agent" exception to the <em>Miranda</em> rule thus is necessarily also the adoption of a substantial loophole in our jurisprudence protecting suspects\' Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>I dissent.</p>\n<p>* As the case comes to us, it involves only the question whether <em>Miranda</em> applies to the questioning of an incarcerated suspect by an undercover agent.  Nothing in the Court\'s opinion suggests that, had respondent previously invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel or right to silence, his statements would be admissible.  If respondent had invoked either right, the inquiry would focus on whether he subsequently waived the particular right.  <em>See Edwards v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U. S. 477</a></span> (1981); <em>Michigan v.

Since respondent was in custody on an unrelated charge when he was questioned, he may be able to challenge the admission of these statements if he previously had invoked his <em>Miranda</em> rights with respect to that charge.  <em>See Arizona v.

S. 675</a></span> (1988); <em>Mosley, supra,</em> 423 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#104">423 U. S. 104</a></span>.  Similarly, if respondent had been formally charged on the unrelated charge and had invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, he may have a Sixth Amendment challenge to the admissibility of these statements.  <em>See Michigan v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html">475 U. S. 625</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html#629">475 U. S. 629</a></span>-636 (1986).  <em>Cf.
