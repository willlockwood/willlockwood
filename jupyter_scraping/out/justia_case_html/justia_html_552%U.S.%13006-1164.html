UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931164.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 6, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 8, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">In a Court of Federal Claims action, petitioner argued that various federal activities on land for which it held a mining lease amounted to an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold rights.  The Government initially asserted that the claims were untimely under the court of claims statute of limitations, but later effectively conceded that issue and won on the merits.  Although the Government did not raise timeliness on appeal, the Federal Circuit addressed the issue <em>sU. S.onte, </em>finding the action untimely.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The court of claims statute of limitations requires <em>sU. S.onte </em>consideration of a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness, despite the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of the issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court has long interpreted the statute as setting out a more absolute, \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d limitations period.  For example, in 1883, the Court concluded with regard to the current statute\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor that \xe2\x80\x9cit [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kendall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/123/index.html">107 U. S. 123</a>, 125\xe2\x80\x93126.  See also <em>Finn</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/123/227/index.html">123 U. S. 227</a>, and <em>Soriano</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/270/index.html">352 U. S. 270</a>.  That the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language has changed slightly since 1883 makes no difference here, for there has been no expression of congressional intent to change the underlying substantive law.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Thus, petitioner can succeed only by convincing the Court that it has overturned, or should overturn, its earlier precedent.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court did not do so in <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, where it applied equitable tolling to a limitations statute governing employment discrimination claims against the Government.  While the <em>Irwin Court</em> noted the similarity of that statute to the court of claims statute, the civil rights statute is unlike the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previously provided a definitive interpretation.  Moreover, the <em>Irwin </em>Court mentioned <em>Soriano, </em>which reflects the particular interpretive history of the court of claims statute, but said nothing about overturning it or any other case in that line.  Finally, just as an equitable tolling presumption could be rebutted by statutory language demonstrating Congress\xe2\x80\x99 contrary intent, it should be rebutted by a definitive earlier interpretation finding a similar congressional intent.  Language in <em>Franconia Associates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/129/index.html">536 U. S. 129</a>, 145, describing the court of claims statute as \xe2\x80\x9cunexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d and citing <em>Irwin</em> for the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s claims-accrual rule and adds little or nothing to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that <em>Irwin </em>overruled earlier cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0<em>Stare decisis </em>principles require rejection of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Court should overturn <em>Kendall, Finn, Soriano, </em>and related cases.  Any anomaly such old cases and <em>Irwin </em>together create is not critical, but simply reflects a different judicial assumption about the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to competing national interests.  Moreover, the earlier cases do not produce \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable\xe2\x80\x9d law, see, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U. S. 843</a>, 856.  <em>Stare decisis </em>in respect to statutory interpretation also has \xe2\x80\x9cspecial force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress, which \xe2\x80\x9cremains free to alter what [the Court has] done,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 172\xe2\x80\x93173, has long acquiesced in the interpretation given here.  Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimental reliance on the earlier cases, reexamination of well-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful.  Overturning a decision on the belief that it is no longer \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others, and such willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability.

We hold that the special statute of limitations governing the Court of Federal Claims requires that <em>sU. S.onte </em>consideration.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Company filed an action in the Court of Federal Claims in May 2002.  The complaint explained that petitioner held a 50-year mining lease on certain land.  And it asserted that various Environmental Protection Agency activities on that land (involving, <em>e.g.,</em> the building and moving of various fences) amounted to an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold rights.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government initially asserted that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s several claims were all untimely in light of the statute providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72501.  Later, however, the Government effectively conceded that certain claims were timely.  See App. 37a\xe2\x80\x9339a (Government\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial brief).   The Government subsequently won on the merits.  See 62 Fed. Cl. 556, 589 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner appealed the adverse judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  See 457 F.\xc2\xa03d 1345, 1346 (2006).  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief said nothing about the statute of limitations, but an <em>amicus </em>brief called the issue to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  See <em>id.,</em> at 1352.  The court considered itself obliged to address the limitations issue, and it held that the action was untimely.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1353\xe2\x80\x931360.  We subsequently agreed to consider whether the Court of Appeals was right to ignore the Government\xe2\x80\x99s  waiver and to decide the timeliness question.  550 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most statutes of limitations seek primarily to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kubrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/111/index.html">444 U. S. 111</a>, 117 (1979).  Thus, the law typically treats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the pleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeiture and waiver.  See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa08(c)(1), 12(b), 15(a); <em>Day</em> v. <em>McDonough</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/198/index.html">547 U. S. 198</a>, 202 (2006); <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 393 (1982).  Such statutes also typically permit courts to toll the limitations period in light of special equitable considerations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rotella</em> v. <em>Wood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/549/index.html">528 U. S. 549</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (2000); <em>Zipes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 393; see also <em>Cada </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp.</em>, 920 F.\xc2\xa02d 446, 450\xe2\x80\x93453 (CA7 1990).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some statutes of limitations, however, seek not so much to protect a defendant\'s case-specific interest in timeliness as to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as facilitating the administration of claims, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brockamp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/347/index.html">519 U. S. 347</a>, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (1997), limiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dalm</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/596/index.html">494 U. S. 596</a>, 609\xe2\x80\x93610 (1990), or promoting judicial efficiency, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, 551 U. S. ___ , ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2007) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  The Court has often read the time limits of these statutes as more absolute, say as requiring a court to decide a timeliness question despite a waiver, or as forbidding a court to consider whether certain equitable considerations warrant extending a limitations period.  See, <em>e.g., ibid.;</em> see also <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 514 (2006).  As convenient shorthand, the Court has sometimes referred to the time limits in such statutes as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 5).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has long interpreted the court of claims limitations statute as setting forth this second, more absolute, kind of limitations period.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Kendall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/123/index.html">107 U. S. 123</a> (1883), the Court applied a predecessor of the current 6-year bar to a claim that had first accrued in 1865 but that the plaintiff did not bring until 1872.  <em>Id.</em>, at 124; see also Act of Mar. 3, 1863, \xc2\xa710, 12 Stat. 767 (Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71069).  The plaintiff, a former Confederate States employee, had asked for equitable tolling on the ground that he had not been able to bring the suit until Congress, in 1868, lifted a previously imposed legal disability.  See 107 U. S., at 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  But the Court denied the request.  <em>Id.,</em> at 125\xe2\x80\x93126.  It did so not because it thought the equities ran against the plaintiff, but because the statute (with certain listed exceptions) did not permit tolling.  Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said the statute was \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction[al],\xe2\x80\x9d that it was not susceptible to judicial \xe2\x80\x9cengraft[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d of unlisted disabilities such as \xe2\x80\x9csickness, surprise, or inevitable accident,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>it [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four years later, in <em>Finn</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/123/227/index.html">123 U. S. 227</a> (1887), the Court found untimely a claim that had originally been filed with a Government agency, but which that agency had then voluntarily referred by statute to the Court of Claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 229\xe2\x80\x93230 (citing Act of June 25, 1868, \xc2\xa77, 15 Stat. 76\xe2\x80\x9377); see also Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71063\xe2\x80\x931065.  That Government reference, it might have been argued, amounted to a waiver by the Government of any limitations-based defense.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lippitt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/100/663/index.html">100 U. S. 663</a>, 669 (1880) (reserving the question of the time bar\xe2\x80\x99s application in such circumstances).  The Court nonetheless held that the long (over 10-year) delay between the time the claim accrued and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s filing of the claim before the agency made the suit untimely.  <em>Finn</em>, 123 U. S., at 232.  And as to any argument of Government waiver or abandonment of the time-bar defense, Justice Harlan, again writing for the Court, said that the ordinary legal principle that \xe2\x80\x9climitation \xe2\x80\xa6 is a defence [that a defendant] must plead \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>has no application to suits in the Court of Claims against the United States.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em> <em>Id.</em> at 232\xe2\x80\x93233<em> </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the years, the Court has reiterated in various contexts this or similar views about the more absolute nature of the court of claims limitations statute.  See <em>Soriano</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/270/index.html"></a><a href="/us/352/270/index.html">352 U.

The only arguably pertinent linguistic change took place during the 1948 recodification of Title 28.  See \xc2\xa72501, 62 Stat. 976.  Prior to 1948, the statute said that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very claim \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>cognizable by </em>the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d unless filed within six years of the time it first accrues. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71069 (emphasis added); see also Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \xc2\xa7156, 36 Stat. 1139 (reenacting the statute without any significant changes).  Now, it says that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very claim of which\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Federal Claims \xe2\x80\x9c<em>has jurisdiction </em>shall be barred\xe2\x80\x9d unless filed within six years of the time it first accrues.  28 U.

We can find no such expression of intent here.  The two linguistic forms (\xe2\x80\x9ccognizable by\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9chas jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d) mean about the same thing.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary<em> </em>991 (4th ed. 1951) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority by which courts and judicial officers take <em>cognizance of</em> and decide cases\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); see also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1038 (3d ed. 1933) (similarly using the term \xe2\x80\x9ccognizance\xe2\x80\x9d to define \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor have we found any suggestion in the Reviser\xe2\x80\x99s Notes or anywhere else that Congress intended to change the prior meaning.  See Rep.

Thus, it is not surprising that nearly a decade <em>after </em>the revision, the Court, citing <em>Kendall, </em>again repeated that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period was \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction[al]\xe2\x80\x9d and not susceptible to equitable tolling.

It is true, as petitioner points out, that in <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a> (1990), we adopted \xe2\x80\x9ca more general rule\xe2\x80\x9d to replace our prior ad\xc2\xa0hoc<em> </em>approach for determining whether a Government-related statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  It is also true that <em>Irwin</em>, using that presumption, found equitable tolling applicable to a statute of limitations governing employment discrimination claims against the Government.  See <em>id.,</em> at 96; see also 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c) (1988 ed.).  And the Court noted that this civil rights statute was linguistically similar<em> </em>to the court of claims statute at issue here.  See <em>Irwin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 94\xe2\x80\x9395.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But these few swallows cannot make petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s summer.  That is because <em>Irwin </em>dealt with a different limitations statute.  That statute, while similar to the present statute in language, is unlike the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previously provided a definitive interpretation.  Moreover, the Court, while mentioning a case that reflects the particular interpretive history of the court of claims statute, namely<em> Soriano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/270/index.html"></a><a href="/us/352/270/index.html">352 U. S. 270</a><em>, </em>says nothing at all about overturning that<em> </em>or any other case in that line.  See<em> </em>498 U. S., at 94\xe2\x80\x9395.   Courts do not normally overturn a long line of earlier cases without mentioning the matter.  Indeed, <em>Irwin\n</em>recognized that it was announcing a general prospective rule, see <em>id.,</em> at 95, which does not imply revisiting past precedents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, <em>Irwin</em> adopted a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>rebuttable </em>presumption\xe2\x80\x9d of equitable tolling.  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  That presumption seeks to produce a set of statutory interpretations that will more accurately reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely meaning in the mine run of instances where it enacted a Government-related statute of limitations.  But the word \xe2\x80\x9crebuttable\xe2\x80\x9d means that the presumption is not conclusive.  Specific statutory language, for example, could rebut the presumption by demonstrating Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to the contrary.  And if so, a definitive earlier interpretation of the statute, finding a similar congressional intent, should offer a similarly sufficient rebuttal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner adds that in<em> Franconia Associates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/129/index.html">536 U. S. 129</a> (2002), we explicitly considered the court of claims limitations statute, we described the statute as \xe2\x80\x9cunexceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d and we cited <em>Irwin </em>for the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S.<em>,</em> at 145 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But we did all of this in the context of rejecting an argument by the Government that the court of claims statute embodies a special, earlier-than-normal, rule as to when a claim first accrues.  <em>Id.</em>, at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.  The quoted language thus refers only to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s claims-accrual rule and adds little or nothing to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that <em>Irwin </em>overruled our earlier cases\xe2\x80\x94a contention that we have just rejected.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument must therefore come down to an invitation now to reject or to overturn <em>Kendall, Finn, Soriano</em>,<em> </em>and related cases.<em> </em>In support, petitioner can claim that <em>Irwin </em>and <em>Franconia </em>represent a turn in the course of the law and can argue essentially as follows:  The law now requires courts, when they interpret statutes setting forth limitations periods in respect to actions against the Government, to place greater weight upon the equitable importance of treating the Government like other litigants and less weight upon the special governmental interest in protecting public funds.  Cf. <em>Irwin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  The older interpretations treated these interests differently.  Those older cases have consequently become anomalous. The Government is unlikely to have relied significantly upon those earlier cases.  Hence the Court should now overrule them.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Basic principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>however,<em> </em>require us to reject this argument.  Any anomaly the old cases and <em>Irwin </em>together create is not critical; at most, it reflects a different judicial assumption about the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to competing legitimate interests.  Moreover, the earlier cases lead, at worst, to different interpretations of different, but similarly worded, statutes; they do not produce \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable\xe2\x80\x9d law.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U. S. 843</a>, 856 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>California</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/490/index.html">495 U. S. 490</a>, 499 (1990).  Further, <em>stare decisis </em>in respect to statutory interpretation has \xe2\x80\x9cspecial force,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cCongress remains free to alter what we have done.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 172\xe2\x80\x93173 (1989); see also <em>Watson</em> v. <em>United States</em>,<em> ante</em>, at 8. Additionally, Congress has long acquiesced in the interpretation we have given.  See<em> ibid.;</em> <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 23 (2005). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimental reliance on our earlier cases, our reexamination of well-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful. Justice Brandeis once observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burnet</em> v. <em>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/393/index.html">285 U. S. 393</a>, 406 (1932) (dissenting opinion).  To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others.  And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability.

Most significantly, in <em>Franconia Associates </em>v.<em> United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/536/129/index.html">536 U. S. 129</a>, 145 (2002), we affirmed, in the context of 28 U.

Although the Government is correct that the question presented by <em>Franconia </em>was when a claim accrued under \xc2\xa72501, our reliance on <em>Irwin</em> undermines the majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that <em>Irwin </em>has no bearing on statutes that have previously been the subject of judicial construction.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority points out quite rightly, <em>ante, </em>at 8, that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special force\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in statutory cases.

But the doctrine should not prevent us from acknowledging when we have already overruled a prior case, even if we failed to say so explicitly at the time.  In <em>Rasul </em>v.<em> Bush, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/466/index.html">542 U.

S. 270</a> (1957), would, as the Court concedes, see <em>ante</em>, at 8, \xe2\x80\x9cachieve a uniform interpretation of similar statutory language,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em> v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/477/index.html">490 U. S. 477</a>, 484 (1989).  Second, we have recognized the propriety of revisiting a decision when \xe2\x80\x9cintervening development of the law\xe2\x80\x9d has \xe2\x80\x9cremoved or weakened [its] conceptual underpinnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patterson</em>, 491 U. S., at 173.  <em>Irwin </em>and <em>Franconia</em>\xe2\x80\x94not to mention our recent efforts to apply the term \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d with greater precision, see, <em>e.g., Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 515\xe2\x80\x93516 (2006)\xe2\x80\x94have left no tenable basis for <em>Kendall</em> and its progeny. <em> </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Third, it is altogether appropriate to overrule a precedent that has become \xe2\x80\x9ca positive detriment to coherence and consistency in the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patterson</em>, 491 U. S., at 173.  The inconsistency between the <em>Kendall</em> line and <em>Irwin</em> is a source of both theoretical incoherence and practical confusion.  For example, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72401(a) contains a time limit materially identical to the one in \xc2\xa72501.  Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether \xc2\xa72401(a)\xe2\x80\x99s limit is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare <em>Center for Biological Diversity </em>v. <em>Hamilton</em>, 453 F.\xc2\xa03d 1331, 1334 (CA11 2006) <em>(per curiam)</em>, with <em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center </em>v. <em>Shalala</em>, 125 F.\xc2\xa03d 765, 770 (CA9 1997).  See also <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Federal Aviation Admin.</em>, 353 F.\xc2\xa03d 1006, 1013, n.\xc2\xa07 (CADC 2004) (recognizing that <em>Irwin</em> may have undermined Circuit precedent holding that \xc2\xa72401(a) is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision hardly assists lower courts endeavoring to answer this question.  While holding that the language in \xc2\xa72501 is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court also implies that <em>Irwin</em> governs the interpretation of all statutes we have not yet construed\xe2\x80\x94including, presumably, the identically worded \xc2\xa72401.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, as the Court implicitly concedes, see <em>ante</em>, at 8,<em> </em>the strongest reason to adhere to precedent provides no support for the <em>Kendall</em>-<em>Finn</em>-<em>Soriano</em> line.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Stare decisis </em>has added force when the legislature, in the public sphere, and citizens, in the private realm, have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>South Carolina Public Railways Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/197/index.html">502 U. S. 197</a>, 202 (1991).  The Government, however, makes no claim that either private citizens or Congress have relied upon the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d status of \xc2\xa72501.  There are thus strong reasons to abandon\xe2\x80\x94and notably slim reasons to adhere to\xe2\x80\x94the anachronistic interpretation of \xc2\xa72501 adopted in <em>Kendall</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several times, in recent Terms, the Court has discarded statutory decisions rendered infirm by what a majority considered to be better informed opinion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. </em> v. <em>PSKS, Inc.</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 28) (overruling <em>Dr. Miles Medical Co.</em> v. <em>John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/220/373/index.html">220 U. S. 373</a> (1911)); <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, 551 U.

In light of these overrulings, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to adhere to <em>Kendall</em>, <em>Finn</em>, and <em>Soriano</em>\xe2\x80\x94while offering nothing to justify their reasoning or results\xe2\x80\x94is, to say the least, perplexing.  After today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, one will need a crystal ball to predict when this Court will reject, and when it will cling to, its prior decisions interpreting legislative texts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would reverse the judgment rendered by the Federal Circuit majority.  In accord with dissenting Judge Newman, I would hold that the Court of Appeals had no warrant to declare the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s action time barred.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
