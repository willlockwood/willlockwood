JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to spell out from the record in this case the decision of any question arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Neither in the pleadings nor in the opinions is there a direct reference to any special provision of the federal Constitution.  It is true that, after the decision by the Court of Appeals, an affidavit was filed by one of the counsel for plaintiffs in error in support of a petition for a rehearing stating that, in the brief as well as upon the oral argument in that court, a federal question (describing it) had been presented and discussed, which petition was denied by the Court of Appeals in these words:  "Ordered, that the said motion be and the same hereby is denied, with ten dollars costs, no federal question having been raised in this Court."</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to determine whether this, of itself, is sufficient to give jurisdiction to this Court.  The language of the Court of Appeals may be construed as denying that any such matter was brought to its attention as stated in the affidavit, or as holding that it presented no federal question.  <em>Mallett v.

The general assembly shall pass no special act conferring corporate powers."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 2.  Corporations may be formed under general laws, but all such laws may, from time to time, be altered or repealed."</p>\n<p>By \xc2\xa7 3235, 2 Bates\' Ann.

After the death of the testator, and on March 19, 1902, the general assembly of the State of Ohio passed an act (Laws 1902, p. 61), the first section of which is as follows:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 1.  Whenever, by the last will and testament of any person which has heretofore been, or shall hereafter be, duly admitted testament of any person which has heretofore been, or shall hereafter be, duly admitted may devise or bequeath, his or her property, or any portion thereof, for charitable uses within this state, or for the establishment and maintenance of any industrial or educational within this state, or for the establishment and maintenance of any industrial or educational in any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 214 U.

Thereafter the Andrews Institute for Girls was incorporated, containing, as required by \xc2\xa7 2, the will of the testator.  Now it is contended by counsel for the plaintiffs in error that this act was a special act, conferring corporate powers, and that therefore it and the incorporation made under it was in conflict with the Constitution of Ohio.  It is not suggested that there has been any decision of the courts of Ohio in reference to the validity of the act or subsequent incorporation of the Andrews Institute, but it is insisted that it is so obvious that the act is a special act, conferring corporate powers, inasmuch as the terms of the will of an individual are the basis of the act and the incorporation, that the courts of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 214 U. S. 31</a></p><p> New York could not have given force and effect to the prohibitions of the Constitution of Ohio.  Nevertheless, whether rightly or wrongly, the New York courts held that there was no violation of the Constitution of Ohio, the Court of Appeals saying in its opinion:</p>\n<p>"At the death of the testator, the general statutes of Ohio provided that corporations might be formed for any purpose for which individuals might lawfully associate themselves, except for carrying on professional business.  2 Bates\' Ann. Ohio Statutes (6th ed.), p. 1836."</p>\n<p>"Subsequent to the death of the testator, and in March, 1902, an act was passed by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio entitled, \'An Act to Provide for the Administration of Charitable Trusts in Certain cases.\'  If we assume that such act was passed to aid in the incorporation of the Andrews Institute for Girls, it is not necessarily, unconstitutional for that reason.  It is not an uncommon thing in any state for questions to arise making it desirable or perhaps necessary for further general legislation to enable persons interested to carry out desired and desirable measures.  The fact that such further general statute is passed to aid a particular person for the time being does not make the act a special, as distinguished from a general, one.  Whether an act, general in form, is a mere device to evade a wholesome constitutional provision is largely dependent upon the special circumstances of each case.  If the act relates to persons, places, and things as a class, and is neither local nor temporary, the mere fact that its practical effect is special and private does not necessarily prove that it violates constitutional provisions against special legislation.  <em>Matter of N.Y.El.

It is unnecessary to hold that there was no error in the ruling of the Court of Appeals.  It is enough for the purposes of this case to hold that that court did not question the validity of any provision of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and did not sustain any act or incorporation which it held to be in conflict with such provision.  At most, there was simply a matter of error, and not a repudiation of the obligations of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>We do not see that any provision of the federal Constitution has been violated, and the writ of error is</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE did not hear the arguments and took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<p>* In this case, the New York court held:  whether an act general in form is a mere device to evade a wholesome constitutional provision [against special acts conferring corporate powers] is largely dependent upon the special circumstances.
