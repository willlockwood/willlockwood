A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1112">Page 454 U.S. 1110 , 1112</a></p><p> the Fifth Circuit reversed in part. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/623/1060/">623 F.2d 1060</a> (1980). It held that under the first clause of 1985(2)-that part of the statute applicable to interference with federal, as opposed to state, court proceedings-there is no requirement of discriminatory animus and that the scope of the term " attended" includes the filing of a complaint in federal court. A petition for rehearing en banc was granted and a severely divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court. CA 5, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/648/340/">648 F.2d 340</a> (1981). </p><p> By a vote of 11 to 10,3 the court held that the language of the statute is not as important as its history. Thus, the fact that the phrase "equal protection of the laws" is included in the second, but not the first, part of 1985(2) is not as relevant to the proper interpretation of the statute as is the fact that all of 1985(2) is derived from the Ku Klux Act of 1871. Relying in part on this Court\'s decision in Griffin v. Breckenridge, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html">403 U.S. 88</a>d 338 (1971), the majority held that an action under 1985(2) must allege a racial or class-based animus. The dissent argued both that Griffin was inapplicable because it dealt only with 1985(3) and that the intent of the Ku Klux Act of 1871 was broader than the majority suggested : "A major concern was restoration of civil authority and preservation of orderly government, including federal court ability to proceed without improper interference." 648 F.2d, at 350. In their view, the second clause of 1985(2) included the equal protection language because Congress was concerned about the constitutional source of its power to create federal jurisdiction over state torts or crimes. Because Congress had no similar concern over its authority to protect federal-court proceedings, there was no reason for a similar limitation on the first part of the statute. </p><p> This dispute over the scope of 1985(2) has divided not only the judges of the Fifth Circuit, but various other Federal Courts of Appeals as well. The argument of the dissent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1113">Page 454 U.S. 1110 , 1113</a></p><p> below was derived largely from McCord v. Bailey, 204 U.S.App.D.C. 334, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/636/606/">636 F.2d 606</a> (1980). That court held that "a class-based, invidiously discriminatory intent is [not] an element of a cause of action under the first clause of section 1985(2)." Id., at 342, 636 F.2d, at 614. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Brawer v. Horowitz, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/535/830/">535 F.2d 830</a>, 840 (1976): </p><p> "The first half of 1985(2) aims at conspiracies the object of which is intimidation of or retaliation against parties or witnesses . . . in any court of the United States. The federal nexus, then is not the class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus required by the second half of the subsection, but the connection of the proscribed activities to a federal court." </p><p> On the other hand, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agrees with the position taken by the Fifth Circuit in this case: "the racial or class-based discrimination rationale expressed by the Supreme Court in Griffin v. Breckenridge, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html">403 U.S. 88</a>, 101-102 [, 1797-1798 (1971) ], applies equally to [ 1985(2) ]." Jones v. United States, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/536/269/">536 F.2d 269</a>, 271 (1976). </p><p> In order to settle this conflict in the Circuits over the scope of a federal remedy for interference with the federal judicial process, I would grant the petition and set the case for plenary consideration. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Besides McDuffy, the defendants included IFS and all its members. </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> The District Court certified a class only with respect to the claim for injunctive relief. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> Judge Clark concurred in the majority\'s decision, but stated that it was not necessary to reach this issue. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a> An alternative ground for the decision below was the majority\'s reversal of the panel\'s holding that the filing of a complaint in federal district court falls within the scope of the term "attending" as used in the statute. The fact that the Court of Appeals could have relied solely on this ground to reverse the panel decision does not mitigate the precedential effect of its holding that invidious discrimination must be alleged to state a cause of action under 1985(2), nor does it lessen the conflict in the Circuits:</p><ul>"It does not make a reason given for a conclusion in a case obiter dictum that it is only one of two reasons given for the same conclusion . . . . we can not hold that the use of the section in the opinion is not to be regarded as authority except by directly reversing the decision in that case on that point." Richmond Co. v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/275/331/case.html#340">275 U.S. 331, 340</a>, 196 (1928).</ul> <p> See also Massachusetts v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/611/case.html#623">333 U.S. 611, 623</a>, 754 (1948); United States v. Title Ins. Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/472/case.html#486">265 U.S. 472, 486</a>, 623 (1924); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Mason City &amp; Fort Dodge R. Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/199/160/case.html#166">199 U.S. 160, 166</a>, 20 (1905). In any case, the intended scope of the term "attending" can only be determined by reviewing the same legislative history as is involved in resolving the question of whether an action under 1985(2) must allege class-based discrimination. Because these two questions are so related, I would grant review of petitioner\'s second question as well: Whether the term "attending" includes the filing of a claim in federal court. I would not, however, grant review of petitioner\'s third question: Whether offshore workers constitute a "discrete class" for equal protection purposes. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
