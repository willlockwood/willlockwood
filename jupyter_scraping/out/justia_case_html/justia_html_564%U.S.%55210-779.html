IMS HEALTH INC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERMONT, et\xc2\xa0al. <em>v</em>. IMS HEALTH INC. et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 10\xe2\x80\x93779.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 26, 2011\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 23, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through a process called \xe2\x80\x9cdetailing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pharmacies receive \xe2\x80\x9cprescriber-identifying information\xe2\x80\x9d when processing prescriptions and sell the information to \xe2\x80\x9cdata miners,\xe2\x80\x9d who produce reports on prescriber behavior and lease their reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers.  \xe2\x80\x9cDetailers\xe2\x80\x9d employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers then use the reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales to doctors.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s Prescription Confidentiality Law provides that, absent the prescriber\xe2\x80\x99s consent, prescriber-identifying information may not be sold by pharmacies and similar entities, disclosed by those entities for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa74631(d).  The prohibitions are subject to exceptions that permit the prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used for a number of purposes, <em>e.g., </em>\xe2\x80\x9chealth care research.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74631(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, Vermont data miners and an association of brand-name drug manufacturers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials (hereinafter Vermont), contending that \xc2\xa74631(d) violates their rights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa74631(d) unconstitutionally burdens the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without adequate justification.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute, which imposes content- and speaker-based burdens on protected expression, is subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0On its face, the law enacts a content- and speaker-based restriction on the sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying information.  The law first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the content of a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  It then bars pharmacies from disclosing the information when recipient speakers will use that information for marketing.  Finally, it prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from using the information for marketing.  The statute thus disfavors marketing, <em>i.e., </em>speech with a particular content, as well as particular speakers<em>, i.e.</em>, detailers engaged in marketing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers.  <em>Cincinnati</em> v. <em>Discovery Network, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/410/index.html">507 U. S. 410</a>, 426; <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a>, 658.  Yet the law allows prescriber-identifying information to be purchased, acquired, and used for other types of speech and by other speakers.  The record and formal legislative findings of purpose confirm that \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes an aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in particular detailers who promote brand-name drugs.  In practical operation, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9cgoes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em>\xc2\xa0v.\xc2\xa0<em>St. Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/377/index.html">505 U. S. 377</a>, 391.  Heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Vermont errs in arguing that heightened scrutiny is unwarranted.  The State contends that its law is a mere commercial regulation.  Far from having only an incidental effect on speech, however, \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the identity of the speaker.  The State next argues that, because prescriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a legal mandate, \xc2\xa74631(d) is akin to a restriction on access to government-held information.  That argument finds some support in <em>Los Angeles Police Dept.</em> v. <em>United Reporting Publishing Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/32/index.html">528 U. S. 32</a>, but that case is distinguishable.  Vermont has imposed a restriction on access to information in private hands.  <em>United Reporting </em>reserved that situation\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e., </em>\xe2\x80\x9ca case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 40.  In addition, the <em>United Reporting</em> plaintiff was presumed to have suffered no personal First Amendment injury, while respondents claim that \xc2\xa74631(d) burdens their own speech.  That circumstance warrants heightened scrutiny.  Vermont also argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales, transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct, not speech.  However, the creation and dissemination of information are speech for First Amendment purposes.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bartnicki</em> v. <em>Vopper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/514/index.html">532 U. S. 514</a>, 527.  There is no need to consider Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s request for an exception to that rule.  Section 4631(d) imposes a speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applying heightened scrutiny, even assuming that prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s justifications for \xc2\xa74631(d) do not withstand heightened scrutiny.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The outcome here is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/173/index.html">527 U. S. 173</a>, 184.  To sustain \xc2\xa74631(d)\xe2\x80\x99s targeted, content-based burden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.  See <em>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/469/index.html">492 U. S. 469</a>, 480\xe2\x80\x93481.  Vermont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical privacy, including physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and (2) is integral to the achievement of the policy objectives of improving public health and reducing healthcare costs.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Assuming that physicians have an interest in keeping their prescription decisions confidential, \xc2\xa74631(d) is not drawn to serve that interest.  Pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any reason except for marketing.  Vermont might have addressed physician confidentiality through \xe2\x80\x9ca more coherent policy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Greater New Orleans Broadcasting</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 195, such as allowing the information\xe2\x80\x99s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow and well-justified circumstances.  But it did not. Given the information\xe2\x80\x99s widespread availability and many permissible uses, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot justify the burdens that \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes on protected expression.  It is true that doctors can forgo the law\xe2\x80\x99s advantages by consenting to the sale, disclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.  But the State has offered only a contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will allow the information to be used by those speakers whose message the State supports.  Cf. <em>Rowan</em> v. <em>Post Office Dept.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/728/index.html">397 U. S. 728</a>.  Respondents suggest a further defect lies in \xc2\xa74631(d)\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of applicability absent an individual election to the contrary.  Reliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy measure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.  Vermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary to avoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with detailers.  Cf. <em>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N.\xc2\xa0Y., Inc.</em> v. <em>Village of Stratton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/150/index.html">536 U. S. 150</a>, 168.  Vermont further argues that detailers\xe2\x80\x99 use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor-patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment decisions.  But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions, it can do so only because it is persuasive.  Fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0While Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s goals of lowering the costs of medical services and promoting public health may be proper, \xc2\xa74631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way.  Vermont seeks to achieve those objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> by diminishing detailers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to influence prescription decisions.  But<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information\xe2\x80\x9d cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.  <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Western States Medical Center</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/357/index.html">535 U. S. 357</a>, 374.  That precept applies with full force when the audience\xe2\x80\x94here, prescribing physicians\xe2\x80\x94consists of \xe2\x80\x9csophisticated and experienced\xe2\x80\x9d consumers.  <em>Edenfield</em> v. <em>Fane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/761/index.html">507 U. S. 761</a>, 775.  The instant law\xe2\x80\x99s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find detailing instructive.  Vermont may be displeased that detailers with prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand-name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction.  Vermont nowhere contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within the meaning of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment precedents.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in burdening detailers\xe2\x80\x99 speech thus turns on nothing more than a difference of opinion.

Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa74631 (Supp. 2010).  Subject to certain exceptions, the information may not be sold, disclosed by pharmacies for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufacturers.  Vermont argues that its prohibitions safeguard medical privacy and diminish the likelihood that marketing will lead to prescription decisions not in the best interests of patients or the State.  It can be assumed that these interests are significant.  Speech in aid of pharmaceutical marketing, however, is a form of expression protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  As a consequence, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute must be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny.  The law cannot satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through a process called \xe2\x80\x9cdetailing.\xe2\x80\x9d  This often in-\nvolves a scheduled visit to a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office to persuade\nthe doctor to prescribe a particular pharmaceutical.  Detailers bring drug samples as well as medical studies\nthat explain the \xe2\x80\x9cdetails\xe2\x80\x9d and potential advantages of various prescription drugs.  Interested physicians listen, ask questions, and receive followup data.  Salespersons can be more effective when they know the background and purchasing preferences of their clientele, and pharmaceutical salespersons are no exception.  Knowledge of a physi-\ncian\xe2\x80\x99s prescription practices\xe2\x80\x94called \xe2\x80\x9cprescriber-identifying\n information\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94enables a detailer better to ascertain which doctors are likely to be interested in a particular drug and how best to present a particular sales message.  Detailing is an expensive undertaking, so pharmaceutical companies most often use it to promote high-profit brand-name drugs protected by patent.  Once a brand-name drug\xe2\x80\x99s patent expires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives are manufactured and sold.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pharmacies, as a matter of business routine and federal law, receive prescriber-identifying information when processing prescriptions.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7353(b); see also\nVt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 9.1 (2009); Rule 9.2.  Many pharmacies sell this information to \xe2\x80\x9cdata miners,\xe2\x80\x9d firms that analyze prescriber-identifying information and produce reports on prescriber behavior.  Data miners lease these reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers subject to nondisclosure agreements.  Detailers, who represent the manufacturers, then use the reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription Confidentiality Law.  The measure is also referred to as Act 80.  It has several components.  The central provision of the present case is \xc2\xa74631(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA health insurer, a self-insured employer, an electronic transmission intermediary, a pharmacy, or other similar entity shall not sell, license, or exchange\nfor value regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable information, nor permit the use of\nregulated records containing prescriber-identifiable information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers shall not use prescriber-identifiable information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe quoted provision has three component parts.  The provision begins by prohibiting pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from selling prescriber-identifying information, absent the prescriber\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  The parties here dispute whether this clause applies to all sales or only to sales for marketing.  The provision then goes on to prohibit pharmacies, health insurers, and similar enti-\nties from allowing prescriber-identifying information to be used for marketing, unless the prescriber consents.  This prohibition in effect bars pharmacies from disclosing the information for marketing purposes.  Finally, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence bars pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers from using prescriber-identifying information for marketing, again absent the prescriber\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  The Vermont attorney general may pursue civil remedies against violators.  \xc2\xa74631(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Separate statutory provisions elaborate the scope of the prohibitions set out in \xc2\xa74631(d).  \xe2\x80\x9cMarketing\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to include \xe2\x80\x9cadvertising, promotion, or any activity\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cused to influence sales or the market share of a prescription drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74631(b)(5).  Section 4631(c)(1) further provides that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Health must allow \xe2\x80\x9ca prescriber to give consent for his or her identifying information to be used for the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d identified in \xc2\xa74631(d).  Finally, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions on sale, disclosure, and use are subject to a list of exceptions.  For example, prescriber-identifying information may be disseminated or used for \xe2\x80\x9chealth care research\xe2\x80\x9d; to enforce \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance\xe2\x80\x9d with health insurance formularies, or preferred drug lists; for \xe2\x80\x9ccare management educational communications provided to\xe2\x80\x9d patients on such matters as \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment options\xe2\x80\x9d; for law enforcement operations; and for purposes \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74631(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Act 80 also authorized funds for an \xe2\x80\x9cevidence-based pre-scription drug education program\xe2\x80\x9d designed to provide doctors and others with \xe2\x80\x9cinformation and education on\nthe therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescription\ndrugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74622(a)(1).  An express aim of the program is\nto advise prescribers \xe2\x80\x9cabout commonly used brand-name drugs for which the patent has expired\xe2\x80\x9d or will soon expire.  \xc2\xa74622(a)(2).  Similar efforts to promote the use of generic pharmaceuticals are sometimes referred to as \xe2\x80\x9ccounter-detailing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 211; see also <em>IMS Health Inc. </em>v. <em>Ayotte</em>, 550 F.\xc2\xa03d 42, 91 (CA1 2008) (Lipez, J., concurring and dissenting).  The counterdetailer\xe2\x80\x99s recommended substitute may be an older, less expensive drug and not a bioequivalent of the brand-name drug the physician might otherwise prescribe.  Like the pharmaceutical manufacturers whose efforts they hope to resist, counterdetailers in some States use prescriber-identifying information to increase their effectiveness.  States themselves may supply the prescriber-identifying information used in these programs.  See App. 313; <em>id.</em>, at 375 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e use the data given to us by the State of Pennsylvania \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0to figure out which physicians to talk to\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id</em>., at 427\xe2\x80\x93429 (Director of the Office of Vermont Health Access explaining that the office collects prescriber-identifying information but \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not at this point in time have a counterdetailing or detailing effort\xe2\x80\x9d).  As first enacted, Act 80 also required detailers to provide information about alternative treatment options.  The Vermont Legislature, however, later repealed that provision.  2008 Vt. Laws No. 89, \xc2\xa73.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Act 80 was accompanied by legislative findings.  Vt. Acts No. 80, \xc2\xa71.  Vermont found, for example, that the \xe2\x80\x9cgoals of marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals\nof the state\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cmarketplace for ideas on medicine safety and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that\n brand-name companies invest in expensive pharmaceutical marketing campaigns to doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(3), (4).  Detailing, in the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s view, caused doctors to make decisions based on \xe2\x80\x9cincomplete and biased information.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(4).  Because they \xe2\x80\x9care unable to take the time to research the quickly changing pharmaceutical market,\xe2\x80\x9d Vermont doctors \xe2\x80\x9crely on information provided by pharmaceutical representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(13).  The legislature further found that detailing increases the cost of health care and health insurance, \xc2\xa71(15); encourages hasty and excessive reliance on brand-name drugs, before the profession has observed their effectiveness as compared with older and less expensive generic alternatives, \xc2\xa71(7); and fosters disruptive and repeated marketing visits tantamount to harassment, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(27)\xe2\x80\x93(28).  The legislative findings further noted that use of prescriber-identifying information \xe2\x80\x9cincrease[s] the effect of detailing programs\xe2\x80\x9d\nby allowing detailers to target their visits to particular doctors.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(23)\xe2\x80\x93(26).  Use of prescriber-identifying data also helps detailers shape their messages by \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring\xe2\x80\x9d their\n\xe2\x80\x9cpresentations to individual prescriber styles, preferences, and attitudes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(25).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case involves two consolidated suits.  One was brought by three Vermont data miners, the other\nby an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers that produce brand-name drugs.  These entities are the respondents here.  Contending that \xc2\xa74631(d) violates their First Amendment rights as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, the respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the petitioners, the Attorney General and other officials of the State of Vermont.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Vermont denied relief.  631 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 434 (2009).  The District Court found that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only paying customers of the data vendor industry\xe2\x80\x9d and that, because detailing unpatented generic drugs is not \xe2\x80\x9ccost-effective,\xe2\x80\x9d pharmaceutical sales representatives \xe2\x80\x9cdetail only branded drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 451, 442.  As the District Court further con-\ncluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s determination that [prescriber-identifying] data is an effective marketing tool that enables detailers to increase sales of new drugs is supported in the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 451.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded.  It held that \xc2\xa74631(d) violates the First Amendment by burdening the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without an adequate justification.  630 F.\xc2\xa03d 263.  Judge Livingston dissented.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision of the Second Circuit is in conflict with de-\ncisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit concerning similar legislation enacted by Maine and New Hampshire.  See <em>IMS Health Inc.</em> v. <em>Mills</em>, 616 F.\xc2\xa03d 7 (CA1 2010) (Maine); <em>Ayotte</em>, <em>supra</em> (New Hamp-\nshire).  Recognizing a division of authority regarding the constitutionality of state statutes, this Court granted certiorari.  562 U. S. __ (2011).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The beginning point is the text of \xc2\xa74631(d).  In the pro-\nceedings below, Vermont stated that the first sentence\nof \xc2\xa74631(d) prohibits pharmacies and other regulated entities from selling or disseminating prescriber-identifying information for marketing.  The information, in other words, could be sold or given away for purposes other than marketing.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals accepted the State\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  See 630 F.\xc2\xa03d,\nat 276.  At oral argument in this Court, however, the\nState for the first time advanced an alternative reading of \xc2\xa74631(d)\xe2\x80\x94namely, that pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities may not sell prescriber-identifying information for any purpose, subject to the statutory exceptions set out at \xc2\xa74631(e).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  It might be argued that the State\xe2\x80\x99s newfound interpretation comes too late in the day.  See <em>Sprietsma</em> v. <em>Mercury Marine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/51/index.html">537 U. S. 51</a>, 56, n.\xc2\xa04 (2002) (waiver); <em>New Hampshire</em> v. <em>Maine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/742/index.html">532 U. S. 742</a>, 749 (2001) (judicial estoppel).  The respondents, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals were entitled to rely on the State\xe2\x80\x99s plausible interpretation of the law it is charged with enforcing.  For the State to change its position is particularly troubling in a First Amendment case, where plaintiffs have a special interest in obtaining a prompt adjudication of their rights, despite potential ambiguities of state law.  See<em> Houston</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/index.html">482 U. S. 451</a>, 467\xe2\x80\x93468, and n.\xc2\xa017 (1987); <em>Zwickler</em> v. <em>Koota</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/index.html">389 U. S. 241</a>, 252 (1967).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, \xc2\xa74631(d) cannot be sustained even under the interpretation the State now adopts.  As a consequence this Court can assume that the opening clause of \xc2\xa74631(d) prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from selling prescriber-identifying information, subject to the statutory exceptions set out at \xc2\xa74631(e).  Under that reading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or academic researchers, see \xc2\xa74631(e)(1), but not, for example, to pharmaceutical marketers.  There is no dispute as to the remainder of \xc2\xa74631(d).  It prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from disclosing or otherwise allowing prescriber-identifying information to be used for marketing.  And it bars pharmaceutical manufacturers and detailers from using the information for marketing.  The questions now are whether \xc2\xa74631(d) must be tested by heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so, whether the State can justify the law.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its face, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law enacts content- and speaker-based restrictions on the sale, disclosure, and use of\nprescriber-identifying information.  The provision first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the\ncontent of a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  For example, those who wish to engage in certain \xe2\x80\x9ceducational communications,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74631(e)(4), may purchase the information.  The measure then bars any disclosure when recipient speakers will use the information for marketing.  Finally, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from using the information for marketing.  The statute thus disfavors marketing, that is, speech with a particular content.  More than that, the statute disfavors specific speakers, namely pharmaceutical manufacturers.  As a result of these content- and speaker-based rules, detailers cannot obtain prescriber-identifying information, even though the information may be purchased or acquired by other speakers with diverse purposes and viewpoints.  Detailers are likewise barred from using the information for marketing, even though the information may be used by a wide range of other speakers.  For example, it appears that Vermont could supply academic organizations with prescriber-identifying information to use in countering the messages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and in promoting the prescription of generic drugs.  But \xc2\xa74631(d) leaves detailers no means of purchasing, acquiring, or using prescriber-identifying information.  The law on its face burdens disfavored speech by disfavored speakers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any doubt that \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes an aimed, content-based burden on detailers is dispelled by the record and by formal legislative findings.  As the District Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only paying customers of the data vendor industry\xe2\x80\x9d; and the almost invariable rule is that detailing by pharmaceutical manufacturers is in support of brand-name drugs.  631 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 451.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law thus has the effect of preventing detailers\xe2\x80\x94and only detailers\xe2\x80\x94from communicating with physicians in an effective and informative manner.  Cf. <em>Edenfield</em> v. <em>Fane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/761/index.html">507 U. S. 761</a>, 766 (1993) (explaining the \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable value\xe2\x80\x9d of in-person solicitation).  Formal legislative findings accompanying \xc2\xa74631(d) confirm that the law\xe2\x80\x99s express purpose and practical effect are to diminish the effectiveness of marketing by manufacturers of brand-name drugs.  Just as the \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable effect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d a statute\xe2\x80\x99s stated purposes may also be considered.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/index.html">391 U. S. 367</a>, 384 (1968).  Here, the Vermont Legislature explained that detailers, in\nparticular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey messages that \xe2\x80\x9care often in conflict with the goals of the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  2007 Vt. No. 80, \xc2\xa71(3).  The legislature designed \xc2\xa74631(d) to target those speakers and their messages for disfavored treatment.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn its practical operation,\xe2\x80\x9d Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9cgoes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em>\xc2\xa0v.\xc2\xa0<em>St. Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/377/index.html">505 U. S. 377</a>, 391 (1992).<em> </em> Given the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s expressed statement of purpose, it is apparent that \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes burdens that are based on the content\nof speech and that are aimed at a particular viewpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Act 80 is designed to impose a specific, content-based burden on protected expression.  It follows that heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted.  See <em>Cincinnati</em> v. <em>Discovery Network, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/410/index.html">507 U.

A government bent on frustrating an impending demonstration might pass a law demanding two years\xe2\x80\x99 notice before the issuance of parade permits.

See <em>Discovery Network</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 429\xe2\x80\x93430 (commercial speech restriction lacking a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral justification\xe2\x80\x9d was not content neutral).

That reality has great relevance in the fields of medicine and public health, where information can save lives.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because its law is a mere commercial regulation.  It is true that restrictions on protected expression are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more generally, on nonexpressive conduct.  It is also true that the First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing inciden-\ntal burdens on speech.  That is why a ban on race-based hiring may require employers to remove \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98White Applicants Only\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d signs, <em>Rumsfeld </em>v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/47/index.html">547 U.

S. 490</a>, 502 (1949).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes more than an incidental burden on protected expression.  Both on its face and in its practical operation, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the identity of the speaker.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.<em> </em>While the burdened speech results from an economic motive, so too does a great deal of vital expression.  See <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/index.html">421 U. S. 809</a>, 818 (1975); <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 266 (1964); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>United Foods, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/405/index.html">533 U. S. 405</a>, 410\xe2\x80\x93411 (2001) (applying \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d where speech effects were not incidental and noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthose whose business and livelihood depend in some way upon the product involved no doubt deem First Amendment protection to be just as important for them as it is for other discrete, little noticed groups\xe2\x80\x9d).  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law does not simply have an effect on speech, but is directed at certain content and is aimed at particular speakers.  The Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s Social Statics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lochner </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a>, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  It does enact the<em> </em>First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont further argues that \xc2\xa74631(d) regulates not speech but simply access to information.  Prescriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a legal mandate, the State argues, and so could be considered a kind of governmental information.  This argument finds some support in <em>Los Angeles Police Dept.</em> v. <em>United Reporting Publishing Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/32/index.html">528 U. S. 32</a> (1999), where the Court held that a plaintiff could not raise a facial challenge to a content-based restriction on access to government-\nheld information.  Because no private party faced a\nthreat of legal punishment, the Court characterized the law at issue as \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more than a governmental denial of access to information in its possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 40.  Under those circumstances the special reasons for permitting First Amendment plaintiffs to invoke the rights of others did not apply.  <em>Id.</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  Having found that the plaintiff could not raise a facial challenge, the Court remanded for consideration of an as-applied challenge.  <em>Id</em>., at 41.  <em>United Reporting </em>is thus a case about the availability of facial challenges.  The Court did not rule on the merits of any First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>United Reporting </em>is distinguishable in at least two respects.  First, Vermont has imposed a restriction on access to information in private hands.  This confronts the Court with a point reserved, and a situation not addressed, in <em>United Reporting</em>.  Here, unlike in <em>United Reporting</em>, we do have<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9ca case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 40.  The difference is significant.  An individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak is implicated when information he or she possesses is subjected to \xe2\x80\x9crestraints on the way in which the information might be used\xe2\x80\x9d or disseminated.  <em>Seattle Times Co.</em> v. <em>Rhinehart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/20/index.html">467 U. S. 20</a>, 32 (1984); see also <em>Bartnicki</em> v. <em>Vopper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/514/index.html">532 U. S. 514</a>, 527 (2001); <em>Florida Star</em> v. <em>B.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0F.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/524/index.html">491 U. S. 524</a> (1989); <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/713/index.html">403 U. S. 713</a> (1971) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  In <em>Seattle Times</em>, this Court applied heightened judicial scrutiny before sustaining a trial court order prohibiting a newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of information it learned through coercive discovery.  It is true that the respondents here, unlike the newspaper in <em>Seattle Times</em>, do not themselves possess information whose disclosure has been curtailed.  That information, however, is in the hands of pharmacies and other private entities.  There is no question that the \xe2\x80\x9cthreat of prosecution \xe2\x80\xa6 hangs over their heads.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United Reporting</em>, 528 U. S., at 41.  For that reason <em>United Reporting</em> does not bar respondents\xe2\x80\x99 facial challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>United Reporting</em> is distinguishable for a second and even more important reason.  The plaintiff in <em>United Reporting </em>had neither \xe2\x80\x9cattempt[ed] to qualify\xe2\x80\x9d for access to the government\xe2\x80\x99s information nor presented an as-applied claim in this Court.  <em>Id</em>., at 40.  As a result, the Court assumed that the plaintiff had not suffered a personal First Amendment injury and could prevail only by invoking the rights of others through a facial challenge.  Here, by contrast, the respondents claim\xe2\x80\x94with good reason\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa74631(d) burdens their own speech.  That argument finds support in the separate writings in <em>United Reporting</em>, which were joined by eight Justices.  All of those writings recognized that restrictions on the disclosure of government-held information can facilitate or burden the expression of potential recipients and so transgress the First Amendment.  See <em>id</em>., at 42 (Scalia, J., concurring) (suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9ca restriction upon access that <em>allows </em>access to the press \xe2\x80\xa6 but at the same time <em>denies</em> access to persons who wish to use the information for certain speech purposes, is in reality a restriction upon speech\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 43 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe provision of [government] information is a kind of subsidy to people who wish to speak\xe2\x80\x9d about certain subjects, \xe2\x80\x9cand once a State decides to make such a benefit available to the public, there are no doubt limits to its freedom to decide how that benefit will be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 46 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (concluding that, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the State\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination is based on its desire to prevent the information from being used for constitutionally protected purposes, [i]t must assume the burden of justifying its conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law imposes a content- and speaker-based burden on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 own speech.  That consideration provides a separate basis for distinguishing <em>United Reporting</em> and requires heightened judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State also contends that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted in this case because sales, transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct, not speech.  Consistent with that submission, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has characterized prescriber-identifying information as a mere \xe2\x80\x9ccommodity\xe2\x80\x9d with no greater entitlement to First Amend-\nment protection than \xe2\x80\x9cbeef jerky.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ayotte</em>, 550 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  In contrast the courts below concluded that a prohibition on the sale of prescriber-identifying information is a content-based rule akin to a ban on the sale of cookbooks, laboratory results, or train schedules.  See 630 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 271\xe2\x80\x93272 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment protects even dry information, devoid of advocacy, political relevance, or artistic expression\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); 631 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 445 (\xe2\x80\x9cA restriction on disclosure is a regulation of speech, and the \xe2\x80\x98sale\xe2\x80\x99 of [information] is simply disclosure for profit\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has held that the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bartnicki</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 527 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the acts of \xe2\x80\x98disclosing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98publishing\xe2\x80\x99 information do not constitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall within that category, as distinct from the category of expressive conduct\xe2\x80\x9d (some internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Rubin</em> v. <em>Coors Brewing Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/476/index.html">514 U. S. 476</a>, 481 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cinformation on beer labels\xe2\x80\x9d is speech); <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc.</em> v. <em>Greenmoss Builders, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/749/index.html">472 U. S. 749</a>, 759 (1985) (plurality opinion) (credit report is \xe2\x80\x9cspeech\xe2\x80\x9d).  Facts, after all, are the beginning point for much of the speech that is most essential to advance human knowledge and to conduct human affairs.  There is thus a\nstrong argument that prescriber-identifying information is speech for First Amendment purposes.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State asks for an exception to the rule that information is speech, but there is no need to consider that request in this case.  The State has imposed content- and speaker-based restrictions on the availability and use of prescriber-identifying information.  So long as they do not engage in marketing, many speakers can obtain and use the information.  But detailers cannot.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute could be compared with a law prohibiting trade magazines from purchasing or using ink.  Cf. <em>Minneapolis Star</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/575/index.html"></a><a href="/us/460/575/index.html">460 U. S. 575</a>.  Like that hypothetical law, \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes a speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify application of heightened scrutiny.  As a consequence, this case can be resolved even assuming, as the State argues, that prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the ordinary case it is all but dispositive to conclude that a law is content-based and, in practice, viewpoint-discriminatory.  See <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em>, 505 U. S., at 382 (\xe2\x80\x9cContent-based regulations are presumptively invalid\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 391\xe2\x80\x93392.<em> </em>The State argues that a different analysis applies here because, assuming \xc2\xa74631(d) burdens speech at all, it at most burdens only commercial speech.  As in previous cases, however, the outcome is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/173/index.html">527 U. S. 173</a>, 184 (1999).  For the same reason there is no need to determine whether all speech hampered by \xc2\xa74631(d) is commercial, as our cases have used that term.  Cf. <em>Board of Trustees\nof State Univ. of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/469/index.html">492 U. S. 469</a>, 474 (1989)\n(discussing whether \xe2\x80\x9cpure speech and commercial speech\xe2\x80\x9d were inextricably intertwined, so that \xe2\x80\x9cthe entirety must \xe2\x80\xa6 be classified as noncommercial\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the State\xe2\x80\x99s burden to justify its content-based law as consistent with the First Amendment.  <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Western States Medical Center</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/357/index.html">535 U. S. 357</a>, 373 (2002).  To sustain the targeted, content-based burden \xc2\xa74631(d) imposes on protected expression, the State must show at least that the statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.  See <em>Fox</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 480\xe2\x80\x93481; <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/index.html">447 U. S. 557</a>, 566 (1980).  There must be a \xe2\x80\x9cfit between the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fox</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 480 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As in other contexts, these standards ensure not only that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests are proportional to the result-\ning burdens placed on speech but also that the law does not seek to suppress a disfavored message.  See <em>Turner Broadcasting</em>, 512 U. S., at 662\xe2\x80\x93663.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted justifications for \xc2\xa74631(d) come under two general headings.  First, the State contends that its law is necessary to protect medical privacy, including physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship.  Second, the State argues that \xc2\xa74631(d) is integral to the achievement of policy objectives\xe2\x80\x94namely, improved public health and reduced healthcare costs.  Neither justification withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont argues that its physicians have a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation\xe2\x80\x9d that their prescriber-identifying information \xe2\x80\x9cwill not be used for purposes other than \xe2\x80\xa6 filling and processing\xe2\x80\x9d prescriptions.  See 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80, \xc2\xa71(29).  It may be assumed that, for many reasons, physicians have an interest in keeping their prescription decisions confidential.  But \xc2\xa74631(d) is not drawn to serve that interest.  Under Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law, pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any rea-\nson save one: They must not allow the information to\nbe used for marketing.  Exceptions further allow pharmacies to sell prescriber-identifying information for certain purposes, including \xe2\x80\x9chealth care research.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74631(e).  And the measure permits insurers, researchers, journalists,\nthe State itself, and others to use the information.  See \xc2\xa74631(d); cf. App. 370\xe2\x80\x93372; <em>id</em>., at 211.  All but conceding that \xc2\xa74631(d) does not in itself advance confidentiality interests, the State suggests that other laws might impose separate bars on the disclosure of prescriber-identifying information.  See Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 20.1.  But the potential effectiveness of other measures cannot justify the distinctive set of prohibitions and sanctions imposed by \xc2\xa74631(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the State could have addressed physician confidentiality through \xe2\x80\x9ca more coherent policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Greater New Orleans Broadcasting</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 195; see also <em>Discovery Network</em>, 507 U. S., at 428.  For instance, the State might have advanced its asserted privacy interest by allowing the information\xe2\x80\x99s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow and well-justified circumstances.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71320d\xe2\x80\x932; 45 CFR pts. 160 and 164 (2010).  A statute of that type would present quite a different case than the one presented here.  But the State did not enact\na statute with that purpose or design.  Instead, Vermont made prescriber-identifying information available to an almost limitless audience.  The explicit structure of the statute allows the information to be studied and used by all but a narrow class of disfavored speakers.  Given the information\xe2\x80\x99s widespread availability and many permissible uses, the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in physician confidentiality does not justify the burden that \xc2\xa74631(d) places on protected expression.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State points out that it allows doctors to forgo the advantages of \xc2\xa74631(d) by consenting to the sale, disclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.  See \xc2\xa74631(c)(1).  It is true that private decisionmaking can avoid governmental partiality and thus insulate privacy measures from First Amendment challenge.  See <em>Rowan</em> v. <em>Post Office Dept.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/728/index.html">397 U. S. 728</a> (1970); cf. <em>Bolger</em> v. <em>Youngs Drug Products Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/60/index.html">463 U. S. 60</a>, 72 (1983).  But that principle is inapposite here.  Vermont has given its doctors a contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow your prescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will allow your information to be used by those speakers whose message the State supports.  Section 4631(d) may offer a limited degree of privacy, but only on terms favorable to the speech the State prefers.  Cf. <em>Rowan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 734, 737, 739, n.\xc2\xa06 (sustaining a law that allowed private parties to make \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunlimited,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreviewable\xe2\x80\x9d choices regarding their own privacy).  This is not to say that all privacy measures must avoid content-based rules.  Here, however, the State has conditioned privacy on acceptance of a content-based rule that is not drawn to serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest.  To obtain the limited privacy allowed by \xc2\xa74631(d), Vermont physicians are forced to acquiesce in the State\xe2\x80\x99s goal of burdening disfavored speech by disfavored speakers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents suggest that a further defect of \xc2\xa74631(d) lies in its presumption of applicability absent a physician\xe2\x80\x99s election to the contrary.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law might burden less speech if it came into operation only after an individual choice, but a revision to that effect would not necessarily save \xc2\xa74631(d).  Even reliance on a prior election would not suffice, for instance, if available categories of coverage by design favored speakers of one political persuasion over another.  Rules that burden protected expression may not be sustained when the options provided by the State are too narrow to advance legitimate interests or too broad to protect speech.  As already explained, \xc2\xa74631(d) permits extensive use of prescriber-identifying information and so does not advance the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in physician confidentiality.  The limited range of available privacy options instead reflects the State\xe2\x80\x99s impermissible purpose to burden disfavored speech.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s argument accordingly fails, even if the availability and scope of private election might be relevant in other contexts, as when the statute\xe2\x80\x99s design is unrelated to any purpose to advance a preferred message.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State also contends that \xc2\xa74631(d) protects doctors from \xe2\x80\x9charassing sales behaviors.\xe2\x80\x9d  2007 Vt. Laws No. 80, \xc2\xa71(28).  \xe2\x80\x9cSome doctors in Vermont are experiencing an undesired increase in the aggressiveness of pharmaceutical sales representatives,\xe2\x80\x9d the Vermont Legislature found, \xe2\x80\x9cand a few have reported that they felt coerced and harassed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(20).  It is doubtful that concern for \xe2\x80\x9ca few\xe2\x80\x9d physicians who may have \xe2\x80\x9cfelt coerced and harassed\xe2\x80\x9d by pharmaceutical marketers can sustain a broad content-based rule like \xc2\xa74631(d).  Many are those who must endure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of freedom.  See <em>Erznoznik</em> v. <em>Jacksonville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/index.html">422 U. S. 205</a>, 210\xe2\x80\x93211 (1975); <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/index.html">403 U. S. 15</a>, 21 (1971).  In any event the State offers no explanation why remedies other than content-based rules would be inadequate.  See <em>44 Liquormart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Rhode Island</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/484/index.html">517 U. S. 484</a>, 503 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.).  Physicians can, and often do, simply decline to meet with detailers, including detailers who use prescriber-identifying information.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 180, 333\xe2\x80\x93334.  Doctors who wish to forgo detailing altogether are free to give \xe2\x80\x9cNo Solicitation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNo Detailing\xe2\x80\x9d instructions to their office managers or to receptionists at their places of work.  Personal privacy even in one\xe2\x80\x99s own home receives \xe2\x80\x9cample protection\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9cresident\xe2\x80\x99s unquestioned right to refuse to engage in conversation with unwelcome visitors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N.\xc2\xa0Y., Inc.</em> v. <em>Village of Stratton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/150/index.html">536 U.

A physician\xe2\x80\x99s office is no more private and is entitled to no greater protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont argues that detailers\xe2\x80\x99 use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor-patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment decisions.  According to the State, \xe2\x80\x9cunwanted pressure occurs\xe2\x80\x9d when doctors learn that their prescription decisions are being \xe2\x80\x9cmonitored\xe2\x80\x9d by detailers.  2007 Vt. Laws No. 80, \xc2\xa71(27).  Some physicians accuse detailers of \xe2\x80\x9cspying\xe2\x80\x9d or of engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cunderhanded\xe2\x80\x9d conduct in order to \xe2\x80\x9csubvert\xe2\x80\x9d prescription decisions.  App. 336, 380, 407\xe2\x80\x93408; see also <em>id.</em>, at 326\xe2\x80\x93328.  And Vermont claims that detailing makes people \xe2\x80\x9canxious\xe2\x80\x9d about whether doctors have their patients\xe2\x80\x99 best interests at heart.  <em>Id</em>., at 327.  But the State does not explain why detailers\xe2\x80\x99 use of prescriber-identifying information is more likely to prompt these objections than many other uses permitted by \xc2\xa74631(d).  In any event, this asserted interest is contrary to basic First Amendment principles.  Speech remains protected even when it may \xe2\x80\x9cstir people to action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmove them to tears,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinflict great pain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15).  The more benign and, many would say, beneficial speech of pharmaceutical marketing is also entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  If pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions, it does so because doctors find it persuasive.  Absent circumstances far from those presented here, the fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it.  <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/444/index.html">395 U. S. 444</a>, 447 (1969) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State contends that \xc2\xa74631(d) advances impor-\ntant public policy goals by lowering the costs of medical services and promoting public health.  If prescriber-identifying information were available for use by detailers, the State contends, then detailing would be effective in promoting brand-name drugs that are more expensive and less safe than generic alternatives.  This logic is set out at length in the legislative findings accompanying \xc2\xa74631(d).  Yet at oral argument here, the State declined to acknowledge that \xc2\xa74631(d)\xe2\x80\x99s objective purpose and practical effect were to inhibit detailing and alter doctors\xe2\x80\x99 prescription decisions.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\xe2\x80\x936.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to embrace its own legislature\xe2\x80\x99s rationale reflects the vulnerability of its position.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s stated policy goals may be proper, \xc2\xa74631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way.  As the Court of Appeals noted, the \xe2\x80\x9cstate\xe2\x80\x99s own explanation of how\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74631(d) \xe2\x80\x9cadvances its interests cannot be said to be direct.\xe2\x80\x9d  630 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 277.  The State seeks to achieve its policy objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers\xe2\x80\x94that is, by diminishing detailers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to influence prescription decisions.  Those who seek to censor or burden free expression often assert that disfavored speech has adverse effects.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cfear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information\xe2\x80\x9d cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.  <em>Thompson</em>, 535 U. S., at 374; see also <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</em> v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/748/index.html">425 U. S. 748</a>, 769\xe2\x80\x93770 (1976).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>44 Liquormart</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 503 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also <em>Linmark Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Willingboro</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/85/index.html">431 U. S. 85</a>, 97 (1977).  These precepts apply with full force when the audience, in this\ncase prescribing physicians, consists of \xe2\x80\x9csophisticated and experienced\xe2\x80\x9d consumers.  <em>Edenfield</em>, 507 U. S., at 775.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s legislative findings acknowledge, the prem-\nise of \xc2\xa74631(d) is that the force of speech can justify\nthe government\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to stifle it.  Indeed the State defends the law by insisting that \xe2\x80\x9cpharmaceutical marketing has a strong influence on doctors\xe2\x80\x99 prescribing practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  This reasoning is incompatible with the First Amendment.  In an attempt to reverse a disfavored trend in public opinion, a State could not ban campaigning with slogans, picketing with signs, or marching during the daytime.  Likewise the State may not seek to remove a popular but disfavored product from the marketplace by prohibiting truthful, nonmisleading advertisements that contain impressive endorsements or catchy jingles.  That the State finds expression too persuasive does not permit it to quiet the speech or to burden its messengers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defect in Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law is made clear by the fact that many listeners find detailing instructive.  Indeed the record demonstrates that some Vermont doctors view targeted detailing based on prescriber-identifying information as \xe2\x80\x9cvery helpful\xe2\x80\x9d because it allows detailers to shape their messages to each doctor\xe2\x80\x99s practice.  App. 274; see also <em>id.</em>, at 181, 218, 271\xe2\x80\x93272.  Even the United States, which appeared here in support of Vermont, took care to dispute the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted view that the dangers\nof [n]ew drugs outweigh their benefits to patients.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 24, n.\xc2\xa04.  There are divergent views regarding detailing and the prescription\nof brand-name drugs.  Under the Constitution, resolution of\n that debate must result from free and uninhibited speech.  As one Vermont physician put it: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a saying in medicine, information is power.  And the more you know, or anyone knows, the better decisions can be made.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 279.  There are similar sayings in law, including that \xe2\x80\x9cinformation is not in itself harmful, that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that end is\nto open the channels of communication rather than to close them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginia Bd.</em>, 425 U. S., at 770.  The choice \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available\xe2\x80\x9d is one that \xe2\x80\x9cthe First Amendment makes for us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont may be displeased that detailers who use prescriber-identifying information are effective in promoting brand-name drugs.  The State can express that view through its own speech.  See <em>Linmark</em>, 431 U. S., at 97; cf. \xc2\xa74622(a)(1) (establishing a prescription drug educational program).  But a State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to persuade does not allow it to hamstring the opposition.  The State may not burden the speech of others in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.  Some of the ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth.  But the general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Edenfield</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 767.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that content-based restrictions on protected expression are sometimes permissible, and that principle applies to commercial speech.  Indeed the government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in protecting consumers from \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial harms\xe2\x80\x9d explains \xe2\x80\x9cwhy commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Discovery Network</em>, 507 U. S., at 426; see also <em>44 Liquormart</em>, 517 U. S., 502 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  The Court has noted, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9ca State may choose to regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others, because the risk of fraud \xe2\x80\xa6 is in its view greater there.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em>, 505 U.

Here, however, Vermont has not shown that its law has a neutral justification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State nowhere contends that detailing is false or misleading within the meaning of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment precedents.  See <em>Thompson</em>, 535 U. S., at 373. <em> </em>Nor does the State argue that the provision challenged here will prevent false or misleading speech.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (collecting regulations that the government might defend on this ground).  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turns on nothing more than a difference of opinion.  See <em>Bolger</em>, 463 U.

The text of \xc2\xa74631(d), associated legislative findings, and the record developed in the District Court establish that Vermont enacted its law for this end.  The State has burdened a form of protected expression that it found too persuasive.  At the same time, the State has left unburdened those speakers whose messages are in accord with its own views.

It deprives pharmaceutical and data-mining companies of data, collected pursuant to the government\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory mandate, that could help pharmaceutical companies create better sales messages.  In my view, this effect on expression is inextricably related to a lawful governmental effort to regulate a commercial enterprise.  The First Amendment does not require courts to apply a special \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review when reviewing such an effort.  And, in any event, the statute meets the First Amendment standard this Court has previously applied when the government seeks to regulate commercial speech.  For any or all of these reasons, the Court should uphold the statute as constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Vermont statute before us says pharmacies and certain other entities</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cshall not [1] sell \xe2\x80\xa6 regulated records containing\nprescriber-identifiable information, nor [2] permit the use of [such] records \xe2\x80\xa6 for marketing or promoting a prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vt.

The Court reviewed the lawfulness of the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s negative impact on the growers\xe2\x80\x99 freedom voluntarily to choose their own commercial messages \xe2\x80\x9cunder the standard appropriate for the review of economic regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 469.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case I would ask whether Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory provisions work harm to First Amendment interests that is disproportionate to their furtherance of legitimate regulatory objectives.

The far stricter, specially \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d First Amendment standards that the majority would apply to this instance of commercial regulation are out of place here.<em>  Ante</em>, at 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because many, perhaps most, activities of human beings living together in communities take place through speech, and because speech-related risks and offsetting justifications differ depending upon context, this Court has distinguished for First Amendment purposes among different contexts in which speech takes place.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2011) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  Thus, the First Amendment imposes tight constraints upon government efforts to restrict, <em>e.g.,</em> \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d political speech, while imposing looser constraints when the government seeks to restrict, <em>e.g.,</em> commercial speech, the speech of its own employees, or the regulation-related speech of a firm subject to a traditional regulatory program.  Compare <em>Boos</em> v. <em>Barry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/index.html">485 U. S. 312</a>, 321 (1988) (political speech), with <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec.

Without such a marketplace, the public could not freely choose a government pledged to implement policies that reflect the people\xe2\x80\x99s informed will.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, our cases make clear that the First Amendment offers considerably less protection to the maintenance of a free marketplace for goods and services.  See <em>Florida Bar</em> v. <em>Went For It, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/618/index.html">515 U.

Under that test, government laws and regulations may significantly restrict speech, as long as they also \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly advance\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d government interest that could not \xe2\x80\x9cbe served as well by a more limited restriction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Central Hudson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 564.

In doing so, the Court has taken account of the need in this area of law to defer significantly to legislative judgment\xe2\x80\x94as the Court has done in cases involving the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause.

Since ordinary regulatory programs can affect speech, particularly commercial speech, in myriad ways, to apply a \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d First Amendment standard of review whenever such a program burdens speech would transfer from legislatures to judges the primary power to weigh ends and to choose means, threatening to distort or undermine legitimate legislative ob-jectives.

S., at 589.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are several reasons why the Court should review Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9cunder the standard appropriate for the review of economic regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cunder a heightened standard appropriate for the review of First Amendment issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Glickman</em>, 521 U. S., at 469.  For one thing, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute neither forbids nor requires anyone to say anything, to engage in any form of symbolic speech, or to endorse any particular point of view, whether ideological or related to the sale of a product.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93470.  (And I here assume that <em>Central Hudson</em> might otherwise apply.  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.)</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the same First Amendment standards that apply to Vermont here would apply to similar regulatory actions taken by other States or by the Federal Government acting, for example, through Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation.  (And the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pre-empt state laws that interfere with existing or contemplated federal forms of regulation is here irrelevant.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirements form part of a tra-ditional, comprehensive regulatory regime.  Cf. <em>United Foods</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 411.  The pharmaceutical drug industry has been heavily regulated at least since 1906.  See Pure Food and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768.  Longstanding statutes and regulations require pharmaceutical companies to engage in complex drug testing to ensure that their drugs are both \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffective.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7355(b)(1), 355(d).  Only then can the drugs be marketed, at which point drug companies are subject to the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustive regulation of the content of drug labels and the manner in which drugs can be advertised and sold.  \xc2\xa7352(f)(2); 21 CFR pts. 201\xe2\x80\x93203 (2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute is directed toward information that exists only by virtue of government regulation.  Under federal law, certain drugs can be dispensed only by a pharmacist operating under the orders of a medical practitioner.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7353(b).  Vermont regulates the qualifications, the fitness, and the practices of pharmacists themselves, and requires pharmacies to maintain a \xe2\x80\x9cpatient record system\xe2\x80\x9d that, among other things, tracks who prescribed which drugs.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72041(a), 2022(14) (Supp. 2010); Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rules (Pharmacy Rules) 9.1, 9.24(e) (2009).  But for these regulations, pharmacies would have no way to know who had told customers to buy which drugs (as is the case when a doctor tells a patient to take a daily dose of aspirin).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regulators will often find it necessary to create tailored restrictions on the use of information subject to their regulatory jurisdiction.  A car dealership that obtains credit scores for customers who want car loans can be prohibited from using credit data to search for new customers.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681b (2006 ed. and Supp. III); cf. <em>Trans Union Corp. </em>v. <em>FTC</em>, 245 F.\xc2\xa03d 809, reh\xe2\x80\x99g denied, 267 F.\xc2\xa03d 1138 (CADC 2001).  Medical specialists who obtain medical records for their existing patients cannot purchase those records in order to identify new patients.  See 45 CFR \xc2\xa7164.508(a)(3) (2010).  Or, speaking hypothetically, a public utilities commission that directs local gas distributors to gather usage information for individual customers might permit the distributors to share the data with researchers (trying to lower energy costs) but forbid sales of the data to appliance manufacturers seeking to sell gas stoves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such regulatory actions are subject to judicial review, <em>e.g.,</em> for compliance with applicable statutes.  And they would normally be subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act to make certain they are not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A) (2006 ed.).  In an appropriate case, such review might be informed by First Amendment considerations.  But regulatory actions of the kind present here have not previously been thought to raise serious additional constitutional concerns under the First Amendment.  But cf. <em>Trans Union LLC</em> v. <em>FTC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/915/index.html">536 U. S. 915</a> (2002) (Kennedy, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (questioning ban on use of consumer credit reports for target marketing).  The ease with which one can point to actual or hypothet-ical examples with potentially adverse speech-related effects at least roughly comparable to those at issue here indicates the danger of applying a \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate\xe2\x80\x9d standard of First Amendment review where typical regulatory actions affect commercial speech (say, by withholding information that a commercial speaker might use to shape the content of a message).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, it is not surprising that, until today, this Court has <em>never</em> found that the <em>First Amendment</em> prohibits the government from restricting the use of information gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate\xe2\x80\x94whether the information rests in government files or has remained in the hands of the private firms that gathered it.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314.  Nor has this Court <em>ever</em> previously applied any form of \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny in any even roughly similar case.

It adds that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommercial speech is no exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,\nat 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  And the Court then emphasizes that this is a case involving both \xe2\x80\x9ccontent-based\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspeaker-based\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions.

And the absence of any such precedent is understandable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regulatory programs necessarily draw distinctions on the basis of content.  <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</em>, 425 U. S., at 761, 762 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a kind of commercial speech that lacks all First Amendment protection, \xe2\x80\xa6 it must be distinguished by its content\xe2\x80\x9d).  Electricity regulators, for example, oversee company statements, pronouncements, and proposals, but only about electricity.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Vt. Pub. Serv. Bd. Rules 3.100 (1983), 4.200 (1986), 5.200 (2004).  The Federal Reserve Board regulates the content of statements, advertising, loan proposals, and interest rate disclosures, but only when made by financial institutions.  See 12 CFR pts. 226, 230 (2011).  And the FDA oversees the form and content of labeling, advertising, and sales proposals of drugs, but not of furniture.  See 21 CFR pts. 201\xe2\x80\x93203.  Given the ubiquity of content-based regulatory categories, why should the \xe2\x80\x9ccontent-based\xe2\x80\x9d nature of typical regulation require courts (other things being equal) to grant legislators and regulators <em>less </em>deference?  Cf. <em>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/469/index.html">492 U.

An energy regulator, for example, might require the manu-facturers of home appliances to publicize ways to reduce energy consumption, while exempting producers of industrial equipment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 16 CFR pt. 305 (2011) (prescribing labeling requirements for certain home appliances); Nev. Admin. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7704.804, 704.808 (2010) (requiring utilities to provide consumers with information on conservation).  Or a trade regulator might forbid a particular firm to make the true claim that its cosmetic product contains \xe2\x80\x9ccleansing grains that scrub away dirt and ex-cess oil\xe2\x80\x9d unless it substantiates that claim with detailed backup testing, even though opponents of cosmetics use need not substantiate their claims.

Or the FDA might control in detail just what a pharmaceutical firm can, and cannot, tell potential purchasers about its products.  Such a firm, for example, could not suggest to a potential purchaser (say, a doctor) that he or she might put a pharmaceutical drug to an \xe2\x80\x9coff label\xe2\x80\x9d use, even if the manufacturer, in good faith and with considerable evidence, believes the drug will help.  All the while, a third party (say, a researcher) is free to tell the doctor not to use the drug for that purpose.

Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> 21 CFR pts. 201\xe2\x80\x93203.  Nor would it ease the task to limit its \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny to regulations that only affect certain speakers.  As the examples that I have set forth illustrate, many regulations affect only messages sent by a small class of regulated speakers, for example, electricity generators or natural gas pipelines.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also uses the words \xe2\x80\x9caimed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctargeted\xe2\x80\x9d when describing the relation of the statute to drug manufacturers.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, 9, 12, 16.  But, for the reasons just set forth, to require \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny on this basis is to require its application early and often when the State seeks to regulate industry.  Any statutory initiative stems from a legislative agenda.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Message to Congress, May 24, 1937, H.\xc2\xa0R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (request from President Franklin Roosevelt for legislation to ease the plight of factory workers).  Any administrative initiative stems from a regulatory agenda.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Exec. Order No. 12866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (1993) (specifying how to identify regulatory priorities and requiring agencies to prepare agendas).  The related statutes, regulations, programs, and initiatives almost always reflect a point of view, for example, of the Congress and the administration that enacted them and ultimately the voters.  And they often aim at, and target, particular firms that engage in practices about the merits of which the Government and the firms may disagree.  Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72, for example, which limits the truthful, nonmisleading speech of firms that, due to their market power, can affect the competitive landscape, is directly aimed at, and targeted at, monopolists.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the case law in this area reflects the need to ensure that the First Amendment protects the \xe2\x80\x9cmarketplace of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby facilitating the democratic creation of sound government policies without improperly hampering the ability of government to introduce an agenda, to implement its policies, and to favor them to the exclusion of contrary policies.  To apply \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny when the regulation of commercial activities (which often involve speech) is at issue is unnecessarily to undercut the latter constitutional goal.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s view of this case presents that risk.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, given the sheer quantity of regulatory initiatives that touch upon commercial messages, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s vision of its reviewing task threatens to return us to a happily bygone era when judges scrutinized legislation for its interference with economic liberty.  History shows that the power was much abused and resulted in the constitutionalization of economic theories preferred by individual jurists.  See <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html"></a><a href="/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a>, 75\xe2\x80\x9376 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  By inviting courts to scrutinize whether a State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate regulatory interests can be achieved in less restrictive ways whenever they touch (even indirectly) upon commercial speech, today\xe2\x80\x99s majority risks repeating the mistakes of the past in a manner not anticipated by our precedents.  See <em>Central Hudson</em>, 447 U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); cf. <em>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</em> v. <em>Rowan &amp; Nichols Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/573/index.html">310 U.

Whether Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory statute \xe2\x80\x9ctargets\xe2\x80\x9d drug companies (as opposed to affecting them unintentionally) must be beside the First Amendment point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This does not mean that economic regulation having some effect on speech is always lawful.  Courts typically review the lawfulness of statutes for rationality and of regulations (if federal) to make certain they are not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  And our valuable free-speech tradition may play an important role in such review.  But courts do not normally view these matters as requiring \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d First Amendment scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94and particularly not the un-forgiving brand of \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny employed by\nthe majority.  Because the imposition of \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny in such instances would significantly change the legislative/judicial balance, in a way that would significantly weaken the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate commerce and industry, I would not apply a \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d First Amendment standard of review in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the constitutional merits, I believe Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute survives application of <em>Central Hudson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cintermediate\xe2\x80\x9d commercial speech standard as well as any more limited \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic regulation\xe2\x80\x9d test.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute threatens only modest harm to commercial speech.  I agree that it withholds from pharmaceutical companies information that would help those entities create a more effective selling message.  But I cannot agree with the majority that the harm also involves unjustified discrimination in that it permits \xe2\x80\x9cpharmacies\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cshare prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any reason\xe2\x80\x9d (but marketing).  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  Whatever the First Amendment relevance of such discrimination, there is no evidence that it exists in Vermont.  The record contains no evidence that prescriber-identifying data is widely disseminated.  See App. 248, 255.  Cf. <em>Burson</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/191/index.html">504 U. S. 191</a>, 207 (1992) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cStates adopt laws to address the problems that confront them.

Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s Pharmacy Rules, for example, define \xe2\x80\x9cunprofessional conduct\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ivulging or revealing to unauthorized persons patient <em>or practitioner</em> information or the nature of professional pharmacy services rendered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 20.1(i) (emphasis added); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 21.  The statute reinforces this prohibition where pharmaceutical marketing is at issue.  And the exceptions that it creates are narrow and concern common and often essential uses of prescription data.  See Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa74631(e)(1) (pharmacy reimbursement, patient care management, health care research); \xc2\xa74631(e)(2) (drug dispensing); \xc2\xa74631(e)(3) (communications between prescriber and pharmacy); \xc2\xa74631(e)(4) (information to patients); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74631(e)(5)\xe2\x80\x93(6) (as otherwise provided by state or federal law).

The Court apparently means that the statute (1) prevents pharmaceutical companies from creating individualized messages that would help them sell their drugs more effectively, but (2) permits \xe2\x80\x9ccounterdetailing\xe2\x80\x9d programs, which often promote generic drugs, to create such messages using prescriber-identifying data.  I am willing to assume, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that this consequence would significantly increase the statute\xe2\x80\x99s negative impact upon commercial speech.  But cf. 21 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii) (FDA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfair balance\xe2\x80\x9d requirement); App. 193 (no similar FDA requirement for nondrug manufacturers).  The record before us, however, contains no evidentiary basis for the conclusion that any such individualized counterdetailing is widespread, or exists at all, in Vermont.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority points out, <em>ante</em>, at 4, that Act 80, of which \xc2\xa74631 was a part, also created an \xe2\x80\x9cevidence-based prescription drug education program,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the Vermont Department of Health, the Department of Vermont Health Access, and the University of Vermont, among others, work together \xe2\x80\x9cto provide information and education on the therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescription drugs\xe2\x80\x9d to health professionals responsible for prescribing and dispensing prescription drugs, Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa74622(a)(1).  See generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74621\xe2\x80\x934622.  But that program does<em> not</em> make use of prescriber-identifying data.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority cites testimony by two witnesses in support of its statement that \xe2\x80\x9cStates themselves may supply the prescriber-identifying information used in [counterdetailing] programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  One witness explained that academic detailers <em>in Pennsylvania</em> work with state health officials to identify physicians serving patients whose health care is likewise state provided.  App. 375.  The other, an IMS Health officer, observed that Vermont has its own multipayer database containing prescriber-identifying data, which <em>could</em> be used to talk to doctors about their prescription patterns and the lower costs associated with generics.  <em>Id.</em>, at 313.  But nothing in the record indicates that any \xe2\x80\x9ccounterdetailing\xe2\x80\x9d of this kind <em>has ever taken place</em> <em>in fact in Vermont</em>.  State-sponsored health care professionals sometimes meet with small groups of doctors to discuss best practices and generic drugs generally.  See University of Vermont, College of Medicine, Office of Primary Care, Vermont Academic Detailing Program (July 2010), http://www.med.uvm.edu/\nahec/downloads/VTAD_overview_2010.07.08.pdf (all Inter-net materials as visited June 21, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Nothing in Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute prohibits brand-name manufacturers from undertaking a similar effort.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that the only commercial-speech-related harm that the record shows this statute to have brought about is the one I have previously described: The withholding of information collected through a regulatory program, thereby preventing companies from shaping a commercial message they believe maximally effective.  The absence of precedent suggesting that this kind of harm\nis serious reinforces the conclusion that the harm here is modest at most.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legitimate state interests that the statute serves are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Central Hudson</em>, 447 U.

The fact that the Court normally exempts the regulation of \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdeceptive\xe2\x80\x9d information even from the rigors of its \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate\xe2\x80\x9d commercial speech scrutiny testifies to the importance of securing \xe2\x80\x9cunbiased information,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>44 Liquormart</em>, 517 U. S., at 501 (opinion of Stevens, J.); <em>Central Hudson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 563, as does the fact that the FDA sets forth as a federal regulatory goal the need to ensure a \xe2\x80\x9cfair balance\xe2\x80\x9d of information about marketed drugs, 21 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii).  As major payers in the health care system, health care spending is also of crucial state interest.  And this Court has affirmed the importance of maintaining \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d as an important public policy goal\xe2\x80\x94even in respect to information already disclosed to the public for particular purposes (but not others).  See <em>Department of Justice</em> v. <em>Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/749/index.html">489 U. S. 749</a>, 762\xe2\x80\x93771 (1989); see also Solove, A Taxonomy of Privacy, 154 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 477, 520\xe2\x80\x93522 (2006); cf. <em>NASA</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2011) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939) (discussing privacy interests in nondisclosure).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the record evidence is sufficient to permit a legislature to conclude that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly advances\xe2\x80\x9d each of these objectives.  The statute helps to focus sales discussions on an individual drug\xe2\x80\x99s safety, effectiveness, and cost, perhaps compared to other drugs (including generics).  These drug-related facts have everything to do with general information that drug manufacturers likely possess.  They have little, if anything, to do with the name or prior prescription practices of the particular doctor to whom a detailer is speaking.  Shaping a detailing message based on an individual doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prior prescription habits may help sell more of a particular manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s particular drugs.  But it does so by diverting attention from scientific research about a drug\xe2\x80\x99s safety and effectiveness, as well as its cost.  This diversion comes at the expense of public health and the State\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal\ninterests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont compiled a substantial legislative record to corroborate this line of reasoning.  See Testimony of Sean Flynn (Apr. 11, 2007), App. in No. 09\xe2\x80\x931913\xe2\x80\x93cv(L) etc. (CA2), p.

And it is the job of regulatory agencies and legislatures to make just these kinds of judgments.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to ensure a \xe2\x80\x9cfair balance\xe2\x80\x9d of information is no different from the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s similar requirement, see\n21 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii).  No one has yet suggested that substantial portions of federal drug regulation are unconstitutional.  Why then should we treat Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law differently?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record also adequately supports the State\xe2\x80\x99s privacy objective.  Regulatory rules in Vermont make clear that the confidentiality of an individual doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prescribing practices remains the norm.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Pharmacy Rule 8.7(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cPrescription and other patient health care information shall be secure from access by the public, and the information shall be kept confidential\xe2\x80\x9d); Pharmacy Rule 20.1(i) (forbidding disclosure of patient or prescriber information to \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized persons\xe2\x80\x9d without consent).  Exceptions to this norm are comparatively few.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ibid</em>. (identifying \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized persons\xe2\x80\x9d); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa74631(e); App. 248, 255 (indicating that prescriber-identifying data is not widely disseminated).  There is no indication that the State of Vermont, or others in the State, makes use of this information for counterdetailing efforts.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the data miners who sell information to those manufacturers would like to create (and did create) an additional exception, which means additional circulation of otherwise largely confi-dential information.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute closes that door.  At the same time, the statute permits doctors who wish\nto permit use of their prescribing practices to do so.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74631(c)\xe2\x80\x93(d).  For purposes of <em>Central Hudson</em>, this would seem sufficiently to show that the statute serves a meaningful interest in increasing the protection given to prescriber privacy.  See <em>Fox</em>, 492 U. S., at 480 (in commercial speech area, First Amendment requires \xe2\x80\x9ca fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Edge Broadcasting Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/418/index.html">509 U.

Closing the office door entirely has no similar tendency to lower costs (by focusing greater attention upon the comparative advantages and disadvantages of generic drug alternatives).  And it would not protect the confidentiality of information already released to, say, data miners.  In any event, physicians are unlikely to turn detailers away at the door, for those detailers, whether delivering a balanced or imbalanced message, are nonetheless providers of much useful information.

Respondents suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cVermont can simply inform physicians that pharmaceutical companies \xe2\x80\xa6 use prescription history information to communicate with doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America 48.  But how would that help serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes?  It would not create the \xe2\x80\x9cfair balance\xe2\x80\x9d of information in pharmaceutical marketing that the State, like the FDA, seeks.  Cf. <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/844/index.html">521 U. S. 844</a>, 874 (1997) (alternative must be \xe2\x80\x9cat least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve\xe2\x80\x9d).  Respondents also suggest policies requiring use of generic drugs or educating doctors about their benefits.  Brief for Respondent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America 54\xe2\x80\x9355.  Such programs have been in effect for some time in Vermont or other States, without indication that they have prevented the imbalanced sales tactics at which Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute takes aim.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Written Statement of Jerry Avorn &amp; Aaron Kesselheim, CA2 App. 4310; Doc. 414, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  And in any event, such laws do not help protect prescriber privacy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont has thus developed a record that sufficiently shows that its statute meaningfully furthers substantial state interests.  Neither the majority nor respondents suggests any equally effective \xe2\x80\x9cmore limited\xe2\x80\x9d restriction.  And the First Amendment harm that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute works is, at most, modest.  I consequently conclude that, even if we apply an \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate\xe2\x80\x9d test such as that in <em>Central Hudson, </em>this statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s third restriction, providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers\xe2\x80\x9d may not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>use</em> prescriber-identifiable information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents\xe2\x80\x9d?  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa74631(d) (emphasis added).  In principle, I should not reach this question.  That is because respondent pharmaceutical manufacturers, marketers, and data miners seek a declaratory judgment and injunction prohibiting the enforcement of this statute.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72201; App. 49\xe2\x80\x93128.  And they have neither shown nor claimed that they could obtain significant amounts of \xe2\x80\x9cprescriber-identifiable information\xe2\x80\x9d if the first two prohibitions are valid.  If, as\nI believe, the first two statutory prohibitions (related to selling and disclosing the information) are valid, then\nthe dispute about the validity of the third provision is\nnot \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98real and substantial\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98definite and concrete.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MedImmune, Inc.</em> v. <em>Genentech, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/118/index.html">549 U. S. 118</a>, 127 (2007) (quoting <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Haworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/index.html">300 U. S. 227</a>, 240\xe2\x80\x93241 (1937)) (Article III does not permit courts to entertain such disputes).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, strikes down all three provisions, and so I add that I disagree with the majority as to the constitutionality of the third restriction as well\xe2\x80\x94basically for the reasons I have already set out.  The prohibition against pharmaceutical firms using this prescriber-identifying information works no more than modest First Amendment harm; the prohibition is justified by the need to ensure unbiased sales presentations, prevent unnecessarily high drug costs, and protect the privacy of prescribing physicians.  There is no obvious equally effective, more limited alternative.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I believe that the statute before us satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate\xe2\x80\x9d standards this Court has applied to restrictions on commercial speech.  <em>A fortiori </em>it satisfies less demanding standards that are more appropriately applied in this kind of commercial regulatory case\xe2\x80\x94a case where the government seeks typical regulatory ends (lower drug prices, more balanced sales messages) through the use of ordinary regulatory means (limiting the commercial use\nof data gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate).  The speech-related consequences here are indirect, incidental, and entirely commercial.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches its conclusion through the use of important First Amendment categories\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccontent-based,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cspeaker-based,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but without taking full account of the regulatory context, the nature of the speech effects, the values these First Amendment categories seek to promote, and prior precedent.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x936, 9\xe2\x80\x9313, 17.  At best the Court opens a Pandora\xe2\x80\x99s Box of First Amendment challenges to many ordinary regulatory practices that may only incidentally affect a commercial message.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  At worst, it reawakens <em>Lochner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s pre-New Deal threat of substituting judicial for democratic decisionmaking where ordinary economic regulation is at issue.  See <em>Central Hudson</em>, 447 U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, whether we apply an ordinary commercial speech standard or a less demanding standard, I believe Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law is consistent with the First Amendment.  And with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
