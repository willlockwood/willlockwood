JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The degree of particularity or certainty necessary in pleas and notices is an ever-recurring question in judicial proceedings, and can never be effectually disposed of so long as new and varying circumstances may present the question in new aspects.</p>\n<p>The object of the rule is undoubtedly to enable the other party to make such answer or response to the matter set up in the plea or notice, either by way of pleading or of evidence, or such cross-examination of the witness of the party setting up the plea or notice as the facts of his case may enable him to do.  In other words, to apprise him fairly of what he may expect to meet under the plea or notice. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>In the case before us, in addition to the common law rules, Congress has, for the protection of patentees, made an enactment on the subject.  With the requirements of this statute the defendant has complied, so far as the names and  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="740">Page 76 U. S. 740</a></p><p> residence of the witnesses are concerned; but it is denied that he has been sufficiently specific as to the places where the use was to be shown.  It is said that it is not sufficient to name the city, but that the particular mill in which the invention had been used must be pointed out.  But we cannot take judicial notice how many or how few mills using stones may be in any particular locality.  In some town there may be but one.  Nor do we think that the party giving notice is bound to be so specific as to relieve the other from all inquiry or effort to investigate the facts.  If he fairly puts his adversary in the way that he may ascertain all that is necessary to his defense or answer, it is all that can be required, and he is not bound by his notice to impose an unnecessary and embarrassing restriction on his own right of producing proof of what he asserts.  We are all, therefore, of opinion that when, in addition to the particular town or city in which such large objects as millstones are used, the name and residence of the witness by whom that use is to be proved is also given, there is sufficient precision and certainty in the notice.
