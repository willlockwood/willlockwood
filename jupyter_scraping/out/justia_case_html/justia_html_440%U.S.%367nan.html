We granted certiorari in this case to resolve a conflict among state and lower federal courts regarding the proper application of our decision in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html">407 U. S. 25</a></span> (1972). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  436 U.S. 925.  Petitioner Scott was convicted of theft and fined $50 after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill.  His conviction was affirmed by the state intermediate appellate court, and then by the Supreme Court of Illinois, over Scott\'s contention that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution required that Illinois provide trial counsel to him at its expense.  Petitioner Scott was convicted of shoplifting merchandise valued at less than $150.  The applicable Illinois statute set the maximum penalty for such an offense at a $500 fine or one year in jail, or both. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The petitioner argues that a line of this Court\'s cases culminating in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, supra,</em> requires state provision of counsel whenever imprisonment is an authorized penalty. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 440 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Illinois rejected this contention, quoting the following language from <em>Argersinger:</em></p>\n<p>"We hold, therefore, that absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at his trial."</p>\n<p>407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#37">407 U. S. 37</a></span>.</p>\n<p>"Under the rule we announce today, every judge will know when the trial of a misdemeanor starts that no imprisonment may be imposed, even though local law permits it, unless the accused is represented by counsel.  He will have a measure of the seriousness and gravity of the offense, and therefore know when to name a lawyer to represent the accused before the trial starts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#40">407 U. S. 40</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Illinois went on to state that it was "not inclined to extend <em>Argersinger</em>" to the case where a defendant is charged with a statutory offense for which imprisonment upon conviction is authorized but not actually imposed upon the defendant.  68 Ill.2d 269, 272, 369 N.E.2d 881, 882 (1977).  We agree with the Supreme Court of Illinois that the Federal Constitution does not require a state trial court to appoint counsel for a criminal defendant such as petitioner, and we therefore affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p>In his petition for certiorari, petitioner referred to the issue in this case as "the question left open in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html">407 U. S. 25</a></span> (1972)."  Pet. for Cert. 5.  Whether this question was indeed "left open" in <em>Argersinger</em> depends upon whether one considers that opinion to be a point in a moving line or a holding that the States are required to go only so far in furnishing counsel to indigent defendants.  The Supreme Court of Illinois, in quoting the above language from <em>Argersinger,</em> clearly viewed the latter as <em>Argersinger\'s</em> holding.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 440 U. S. 370</a></p><p> Additional support for this proposition may be derived from the concluding paragraph of the opinion in that case:</p>\n<p>"The run of misdemeanors will not be affected by today\'s ruling.  But in those that end up in the actual deprivation of a person\'s liberty, the accused will receive the benefit of \'the guiding hand of counsel\' so necessary where one\'s liberty is in jeopardy."</p>\n<p>407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#40">407 U. S. 40</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, on the other hand, refers to language in the Court\'s opinion, responding to the opinion of MR. JUSTICE POWELL, which states that the Court</p>\n<p>"need not consider the requirements of the Sixth Amendment as regards the right to counsel where loss of liberty is not involved . . . for here petitioner was, in fact, sentenced to jail."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#37">407 U. S. 37</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There is considerable doubt that the Sixth Amendment itself, as originally drafted by the Framers of the Bill of Rights, contemplated any guarantee other than the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution in a federal court to employ a lawyer to assist in his defense.  W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in American Courts 27-30 (1955).  In <em>Powell v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html">287 U. S. 45</a></span> (1932), the Court held that Alabama was obligated to appoint counsel for the Scottsboro defendants, phrasing the inquiry as</p>\n<p>"whether the defendants were in substance denied the right of counsel, and if so, whether such denial infringes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html#52">287 U. S. 52</a></span>.  It concluded its opinion with the following language:</p>\n<p>"The United States, by statute, and every state in the Union, by express provision of law or by the determination of its courts, make it the duty of the trial judge, where the accused is unable to employ counsel, to appoint counsel for him.  In most states, the rule applies broadly to all criminal prosecutions; in others, it is limited to the more serious crimes, and in a very limited number, to capital cases.  A rule adopted with such unanimous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 440 U. S. 371</a></p><p> accord reflects, if it does not establish, the inherent right to have counsel appointed, at least in cases like the present, and lends convincing support to the conclusion we have reached as to the fundamental nature of that right."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html#73">287 U.

S. 455</a></span> (1942), held that not every indigent defendant accused in a state criminal prosecution was entitled to appointment of counsel.  A determination had to be made in each individual case whether failure to appoint counsel was a denial of fundamental fairness.  <em>Betts</em> was, in turn, overruled in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span> (1963).  In <em>Gideon, Betts</em> was described as holding</p>\n<p>"that a refusal to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant charged with a felony did not necessarily violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . ."</p>\n<p>372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html#339">372 U. S. 339</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Several Terms later, the Court held, in <em>Duncan v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/case.html">391 U. S. 145</a></span> (1968), that the right to jury trial in federal court guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court held, however:</p>\n<p>"It is doubtless true that there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision, and should not be subject to the Fourteenth Amendment jury trial requirement here applied to the States.  Crimes carrying possible penalties up to six months do not require a jury trial if they otherwise qualify as petty offenses. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/case.html#159">391 U. S. 159</a></span> (footnote omitted).  In <em>Baldwin v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/66/case.html">399 U. S. 66</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/66/case.html#69">399 U. S. 69</a></span> (1970), the controlling opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that "no offense can be deemed "petty" for purposes of the right to trial by jury where imprisonment for more than six months is authorized."</p>\n<p>In <em>Argersinger,</em> the State of Florida urged that a similar dichotomy be employed in the right-to-counsel area:  any offense punishable by less than six months in jail should not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 440 U. S. 372</a></p><p> require appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The <em>Argersinger</em> Court rejected this analogy, however, observing that "the right to trial by jury has a different genealogy, and is brigaded with a system of trial to a judge alone."  407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#29">407 U. S. 29</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The number of separate opinions in <em>Gideon, Duncan, Baldwin,</em> and <em>Argersinger</em> suggests that constitutional line drawing becomes more difficult as the reach of the Constitution is extended further, and as efforts are made to transpose lines from one area of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to another.  The process of incorporation creates special difficulties, for the state and federal contexts are often different, and application of the same principle may have ramifications distinct in degree and kind.  The range of human conduct regulated by state criminal laws is much broader than that of the federal criminal laws, particularly on the "petty" offense part of the spectrum.  As a matter of constitutional adjudication, we are, therefore, less willing to extrapolate an already extended line when, although the general nature of the principle sought to be applied is clear, its precise limits and their ramifications become less so.  We have now, in our decided cases, departed from the literal meaning of the Sixth Amendment.  And we cannot fall back on the common law as it existed prior to the enactment of that Amendment, since it perversely gave less in the way of right to counsel to accused felons than to those accused of misdemeanors.  <em>See Powell v. Alabama, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html#60">287 U. S. 60</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Argersinger,</em> the Court rejected arguments that social cost or a lack of available lawyers militated against its holding, in some part because it thought these arguments were factually incorrect.  407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#37">407 U. S. 37</a></span> n. 7.  But they were rejected in much larger part because of the Court\'s conclusion that incarceration was so severe a sanction that it should not be imposed as a result of a criminal trial unless an indigent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 440 U. S. 373</a></p><p> defendant had been offered appointed counsel to assist in his defense, regardless of the cost to the States implicit in such a rule.  The Court, in its opinion, repeatedly referred to trials "where an accused is deprived of his liberty," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#32">407 U. S. 32</a></span>, and to "a case that actually leads to imprisonment, even for a brief period," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#33">407 U. S. 33</a></span>.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in his opinion concurring in the result, also observed that "any deprivation of liberty is a serious matter."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#41">407 U. S. 41</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although the intentions of the <em>Argersinger</em> Court are not unmistakably clear from its opinion, we conclude today that <em>Argersinger</em> did indeed delimit the constitutional right to appointed counsel in state criminal proceedings. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Even were the matter <em>res nova,</em> we believe that the central premise of <em>Argersinger</em> -- that actual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment -- is eminently sound, and warrants adoption of actual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel.  <em>Argersinger</em> has proved reasonably workable, whereas any extension would create confusion and impose unpredictable, but necessarily substantial, costs on 50 quite diverse States. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We therefore hold that the Sixth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 440 U. S. 374</a></p><p> and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require only that no indigent criminal defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment unless the State has afforded him the right to assistance of appointed counsel in his defense.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is accordingly</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Compare, e.g., Potts v. Estelle,</em> 529 F.2d 450 (CA5 1976); <em>State ex rel. Winnie v. Harris,</em> 75 Wis.2d 547, 249 N.W.2d 791 (1977), <em>with Sweeten v. Sneddon,</em> 463 F.2d 713 (CA10 1972); <em>Rollins v.

Both the petitioner in that case and the Legal Aid Society of New York, as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argued that the right to appointed counsel should pertain in any case in which imprisonment was an authorized penalty for the underlying offense.

Respondent Florida and the <em>amici</em> States urged that the line be drawn as it had been in <em>Baldwin</em> for purposes of the jury trial guarantee.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondent in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin</em> 12.  The Solicitor General argued for .the standard that was finally adopted -- that of actual imprisonment.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Argersinger v.

That which exists suggests that the requirements of <em>Argersinger</em> have not proved to be unduly burdensome.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Ingraham, The Impact of <em>Argersinger</em> -- One Year Later, 8 Law &amp; Soc. Rev. 615 (1974).  That some Jurisdictions have had difficulty implementing <em>Argersinger</em> is certainly not an argument for extending it.  S. Krantz, C Smith, D. Rossman, P. Froyd &amp; J. Hoffman, Right to Counsel in Criminal Cases 1-18 (1976).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in my opinion in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html">407 U. S. 25</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#44">407 U. S. 44</a></span> (1972), I do not think the rule adopted by the Court in that case is required by the Constitution.  Moreover, the drawing of a line based on whether there is imprisonment (even for overnight) can have the practical effect of precluding provision of counsel in other types of cases in which conviction can have more serious consequences.  The <em>Argersinger</em> rule also tends to impair the proper functioning of the criminal justice system in that trial judges, in advance of hearing any evidence and before knowing anything about the case except the charge, all too often will be compelled to forgo the legislatively granted option to impose a sentence of imprisonment upon conviction.  Preserving this option by providing counsel often will be impossible or impracticable -- particularly in congested urban courts where scores of cases are heard in a single sitting, and in small and rural communities where lawyers may not be available.</p>\n<p>Despite my continuing reservations about the <em>Argersinger</em> rule, it was approved by the Court in the 1972 opinion and four Justices have reaffirmed it today.  It is important that this Court provide clear guidance to the hundreds of courts across the country that confront this problem daily.  Accordingly, and mindful of <em>stare decisis,</em> I join the opinion of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 440 U. S. 375</a></p><p> Court.  I do so, however, with the hope that, in due time, a majority will recognize that a more flexible rule is, consistent with due process and will better serve the cause of justice.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment provides:  "In <em>all criminal</em> prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence."  (Emphasis supplied.)  <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span> (1963), extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment and held that the right includes the right of the indigent to have counsel provided.  <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html">407 U. S. 25</a></span> (1972), held that the right recognized in <em>Gideon</em> extends to the trial of any offense for which a convicted defendant is likely to be incarcerated.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether the right to counsel extends to a person accused of an offense that, although punishable by incarceration, is actually punished only by a fine.  Petitioner Aubrey Scott was charged with theft in violation of Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 38, \xc2\xa7 16-1 (1969), an offense punishable by imprisonment for up to one year or by a fine of up to $500, or by both.  About four months before <em>Argersinger</em> was decided, Scott had a bench trial, without counsel, and without notice of entitlement to retain counsel or, if indigent, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] to have counsel provided.  He was found guilty as charged and sentenced to pay a $50 fine.</p>\n<p>The Court, in an opinion that, at best, ignores the basic principles of prior decisions, affirms Scott\'s conviction without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 440 U. S. 376</a></p><p> counsel because he was sentenced only to pay a fine.  In my view, the plain wording of the Sixth Amendment and the Court\'s precedents compel the conclusion that Scott\'s uncounseled conviction violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and should be reversed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion intimates that the Court\'s precedents ordaining the right to appointed counsel for indigent accuseds in state criminal proceedings fail to provide a principled basis for deciding this case.  That is demonstrably not so.  The principles developed in the relevant precedents are clear and sound.  The Court simply chooses to ignore them.</p>\n<p><em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em> held that, because representation by counsel in a criminal proceeding is "fundamental and essential to a fair trial," 372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html#342">372 U. S. 342</a></span>, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>\n<p>"[R]eason and reflection require us to recognize that, in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.  This seems to us to be an obvious truth.  Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of crime.  Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the public\'s interest in an orderly society.  Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their defenses.  That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries.  The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 440 U. S. 377</a></p><p> fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours.  From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law.  This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html#344">372 U. S. 344</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Earlier precedents had recognized that the assistance of appointed counsel was critical not only to equalize the sides in an adversary criminal process, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] but also to give substance to other constitutional and procedural protections afforded criminal defendants. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  <em>Gideon</em> established the right to appointed counsel for indigent accuseds as a categorical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 440 U. S. 378</a></p><p> requirement, making the Court\'s former case-by-case due process analysis, <em>cf. Betts v. Brady,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/455/case.html">316 U. S. 455</a></span> (1942), unnecessary in cases covered by its holding.  <em>Gideon</em> involved a felony prosecution, but that fact was not crucial to the decision; its reasoning extended, in the words of the Sixth Amendment, to "all criminal prosecutions." [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Argersinger v. Hamlin</em> took a cautious approach toward implementing the logical consequences of <em>Gideon\'s</em> rationale.  The petitioner in <em>Argersinger</em> had been sentenced to jail for 90 days after conviction -- at a trial without counsel -- of carrying a concealed weapon, a Florida offense carrying an authorized penalty of imprisonment for up to six months and a fine of up to $1,000.  The State, relying on <em>Duncan v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/case.html">391 U. S. 145</a></span> (1968), and <em>Baldwin v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/66/case.html">399 U. S. 66</a></span> (1970), urged that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, like the right to jury trial, should not apply to accuseds charged with "petty" offenses punishable by less than six months\' imprisonment.  But <em>Argersinger</em> refused to extend the "petty" offense limitation to the right to counsel.  The Court pointed out that the limitation was contrary to the express words of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantee its enumerated rights "[i]n all criminal prosecutions"; that the right to jury trial was the only Sixth Amendment right applicable to the States that had been held inapplicable to "petty offenses"; [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] that this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 440 U. S. 379</a></p><p> limitation had been based on historical considerations peculiar to the right to jury trial; [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  and that the right to counsel was more fundamentally related to the fairness of criminal prosecutions than the right to jury trial, and was, in fact, essential to the meaningful exercise of other Sixth Amendment protections. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Although its analysis, like that in <em>Gideon</em> and other earlier cases, suggested that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel should apply to all state criminal prosecutions, <em>Argersinger</em> held only that an indigent defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, even in petty offenses punishable by six months of incarceration or less, if he is likely to be sentenced to incarceration for any time if convicted.  The question of the right to counsel in cases in which incarceration was authorized but would not be imposed was expressly reserved. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my view, petitioner could prevail in this case without extending the right to counsel beyond what was assumed to exist in <em>Argersinger.</em>  Neither party in that case questioned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 440 U. S. 380</a></p><p> the existence of the right to counsel in trials involving "nonpetty" offenses punishable by more than six months in jail. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  The question the Court addressed was whether the right applied to some "petty" offenses to which the right to jury trial did not extend.  The Court\'s reasoning in applying the right to counsel in the case before it -- that the right to counsel is more fundamental to a fair proceeding than the right to jury trial and that the historical limitations on the jury trial right are irrelevant to the right to counsel -- certainly cannot support a standard for the right to counsel that is more restrictive than the standard for granting a right to jury trial.  As my Brother POWELL commented in his opinion concurring in the result in <em>Argersinger,</em> 407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/451/case.html#456">407 U. S. 456</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"It is clear that, wherever the right-to-counsel line is to be drawn, it must be drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed counsel in all cases in which there is a due process right to a jury trial."</p>\n<p><em>Argersinger</em> thus established a "two dimensional" test for the right to counsel:  the right attaches to any "nonpetty" offense punishable by more than six months in jail and in addition to any offense where actual incarceration is likely regardless of the maximum authorized penalty.  <em>See</em> Duke, The Right to Appointed Counsel:  <em>Argersinger</em> and Beyond, 12 Am.Crim.L.Rev. 601 (1975).</p>\n<p>The offense of "theft" with which Scott was charged is certainly not a "petty" one.  It is punishable by a sentence of up to one year in jail.  Unlike many traffic or other "regulatory" offenses, it carries the moral stigma associated with common law crimes traditionally recognized as indicative of moral depravity. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The State indicated at oral argument that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 440 U. S. 381</a></p><p> services of a professional prosecutor were considered essential to the prosecution of this offense.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; <em>cf. Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> 407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#49">407 U. S. 49</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring in result).  Likewise, nonindigent defendants charged with this offense would be well advised to hire the "best lawyers they can get." [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Scott\'s right to the assistance of appointed counsel is thus plainly mandated by the logic of the Court\'s prior cases, including Argersinger itself. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>But rather than decide consonant with the assumption in regard to nonpetty offenses that was both implicit and explicit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 440 U. S. 382</a></p><p> in <em>Argersinger,</em> the Court today retreats to the indefensible position that the <em>Argersinger</em> "actual imprisonment" standard is the only test for determining the boundary of the Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel in state misdemeanor cases, thus necessarily deciding that, in many cases (such as this one), a defendant will have no right to appointed counsel even when he has a constitutional right to a jury trial.  This is simply an intolerable result.  Not only is the "actual imprisonment" standard unprecedented as the exclusive test, but also the problems inherent in its application demonstrate the superiority of an "authorized imprisonment" standard that would require the appointment of counsel for indigents accused of any offense for which imprisonment for any time is authorized.</p>\n<p>First, the "authorized imprisonment" standard more faithfully implements the principles of the Sixth Amendment identified in <em>Gideon.</em>  The procedural rules established by state statutes are geared to the nature of the potential penalty for an offense, not to the actual penalty imposed in particular cases.  The authorized penalty is also a better predictor of the stigma and other collateral consequences that attach to conviction of an offense. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  With the exception of <em>Argersinger,</em> authorized penalties have been used consistently by this Court as the true measures of the seriousness of offenses.  <em>See, e.g., Baldwin v. New York,</em> 399 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/66/case.html#68">399 U. S. 68</a></span>-70; <em>Frank v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/147/case.html">395 U. S. 147</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/147/case.html#149">395 U. S. 149</a></span> (1969); <em>United States v. Moreland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/258/433/case.html">258 U. S. 433</a></span> (1922).  Imprisonment is a sanction particularly associated with criminal offenses; trials of offenses punishable by imprisonment accordingly possess the characteristics </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 440 U. S. 383</a></p><p> found by <em>Gideon</em> to require the appointment of counsel.  By contrast, the "actual imprisonment" standard, as the Court\'s opinion in this case demonstrates, denies the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions to accuseds who suffer the severe consequences of prosecution other than imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Second, the "authorized imprisonment" test presents no problems of administration.  It avoids the necessity for time-consuming consideration of the likely sentence in each individual case before trial and the attendant problems of inaccurate predictions, unequal treatment, and apparent and actual bias.  These problems with the "actual imprisonment" standard were suggested in my Brother POWELL\'s concurrence in <em>Argersinger,</em> 407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/551/case.html#555">407 U. S. 555</a></span>, which was echoed in scholarly criticism of that decision. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Petitioner emphasizes these defects, arguing with considerable force that implementation of the "actual imprisonment" standard must assuredly lead to violations of both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.  Brief for Petitioner 47-59.</p>\n<p>Finally, the "authorized imprisonment" test ensures that courts will not abrogate legislative judgments concerning the appropriate range of penalties to be considered for each offense.  Under the "actual imprisonment" standard,</p>\n<p>"[t]he judge will . . . be forced to decide in advance of trial -- and without hearing the evidence -- whether he will forgo entirely his judicial discretion to impose some sentence of imprisonment and abandon his responsibility to consider the full range of punishments established by the legislature.  His alternatives, assuming the availability </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 440 U. S. 384</a></p><p> of counsel, will be to appoint counsel and retain the discretion vested in him by law, or to abandon this discretion in advance and proceed  without counsel."</p>\n<p><em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#53">407 U. S. 53</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring in result).  The "authorized imprisonment" standard, on the other hand, respects the allocation of functions between legislatures and courts in the administration of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>The apparent reason for the Court\'s adoption of the "actual imprisonment" standard for all misdemeanors is concern for the economic burden that an "authorized imprisonment" standard might place on the States.  But, with all respect, that concern is both irrelevant and speculative.</p>\n<p>This Court\'s role in enforcing constitutional guarantees for criminal defendants cannot be made dependent on the budgetary decisions of state governments.  A unanimous Court made that clear in <em>Mayer v. Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/189/case.html">404 U. S. 189</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/189/case.html#196">404 U. S. 196</a></span>-197 (1971), in rejecting a proposed fiscal justification for providing free transcripts for appeals only when the appellant was subject to imprisonment:</p>\n<p>"This argument misconceives the principle of <em>Griffin [v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/351/12/case.html">351 U. S. 12</a></span> (1956)]. . . .   <em>Griffin</em> does not represent a balance between the needs of the accused and the interests of society; its principle is a flat prohibition against pricing indigent defendants out of as effective an appeal as would be available to others able to pay their own way.  The invidiousness of the discrimination that exists when criminal procedures are made available only to those who can pay is not erased by any differences in the sentences that may be imposed.  The State\'s fiscal interest is, therefore, irrelevant. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]"</p>\n<p>In any event, the extent of the alleged burden on the States is, as the Court admits, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/367/case.html#373">440 U. S. 373</a></span>-374, n. 5, speculative.  Although </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 440 U. S. 385</a></p><p> more persons are charged with misdemeanors punishable by incarceration than are charged with felonies, a smaller percentage of persons charged with misdemeanors qualify as indigent, and misdemeanor cases, as a rule, require far less attorney time. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Furthermore, public defender systems have proved economically feasible, and the establishment of such systems to replace appointment of private attorneys can keep costs at acceptable levels even when the number of cases requiring appointment of counsel increases dramatically. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] The public defender system alternative also answers the argument that an "authorized imprisonment" standard would clog the courts with inexperienced appointed counsel.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the strongest refutation of respondent\'s alarmist prophecies that an "authorized imprisonment" standard would wreak havoc on the States is that the standard has not produced that result in the substantial number of States that already provide counsel in all cases where imprisonment is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 440 U. S. 386</a></p><p> authorized -- States that include a large majority of the country\'s population and a great diversity of urban and rural environments. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  Moreover, of those States that do not yet </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 440 U. S. 387</a></p><p> provide counsel in all cases where any imprisonment is authorized, many provide counsel when periods of imprisonment longer than 30 days, [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>] 3 months, [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] or 6 months [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>] are authorized.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="388">Page 440 U. S. 388</a></p><p> In fact, Scott would be entitled to appointed counsel under the current laws of at least 33 States. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]</p>\n<p>It may well be that adoption by this Court of an "authorized imprisonment" standard would lead state and local governments to reexamine their criminal statutes.  A state legislature or local government might determine that it no longer desired to authorize incarceration for certain minor offenses in light of the expense of meeting the requirements of the Constitution.  In my view, this reexamination is long overdue. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  In any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 440 U. S. 389</a></p><p> event, the Court\'s "actual imprisonment" standard must inevitably lead the courts to make this reexamination, which plainly should more properly be a legislative responsibility.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion turns the reasoning of <em>Argersinger</em> on its head.  It restricts the right to counsel, perhaps the most fundamental Sixth Amendment right, [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>] more narrowly than the admittedly less fundamental right to jury trial. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]  The abstract pretext that</p>\n<p>"constitutional line drawing becomes more difficult as the reach of the Constitution is extended further, and as efforts are made to transpose lines from one area of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to another,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/367/case.html#372">440 U. S. 372</a></span>, cannot camouflage the anomalous result the Court reaches.  Today\'s decision reminds one of Mr. Justice Black\'s description of <em>Betts v. Brady:</em>  "an anachronism when handed down" that "ma[kes] an abrupt break with its own well considered precedents."  <em>Gideon v.
