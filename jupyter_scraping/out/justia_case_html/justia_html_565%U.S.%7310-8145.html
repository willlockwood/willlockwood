During state postconviction relief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by the eyewitness contradicting his testimony.  Smith argued that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v. Maryland, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n.  Brady held that due process bars a State from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt or punishment.  See id., at 87.  The state trial court rejected Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Brady requires that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s conviction be reversed. The State does not dispute that the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s statements were favorable to Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith.  Under Brady, evidence is material if there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d Cone v. Bell, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449\n\xe2\x80\x93470.  A \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d means that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to \xe2\x80\x9cundermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kyles v. Whitley, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419\n.  Evidence impeaching an eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s testimony may not be material if the State\xe2\x80\x99s other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict.  United States v. Agurs, \n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 97\n\xe2\x80\x93113, and n. 21.  Here, however, the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime, and the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements contradicted his testimony.  The eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s statements were plainly material, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose those statements to the defense thus violated Brady.

At Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith to the crime.  Boatner testified that he was socializing at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered the home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly thereafter began shooting, resulting in the death of five of Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s friends.  In court Boatner identified Smith as the first gunman to come through the door.  He claimed that he had been face to face with Smith during the initial moments of the robbery.  No other witnesses and no physical evidence implicated Smith in the crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree murder.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  State v. Smith, 797 So.\xc2\xa02d 193 (2001).  The Louisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this Court.  2001\xe2\x80\x932416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So.\xc2\xa02d 1189; \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1201 (2003)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith then sought postconviction relief in the state courts.  As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the police investigation of his case, including those of the lead investigator, Detective John Ronquillo.  Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes contain statements by Boatner that conflict with his testimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator.  The notes from the night of the murder state that Boatner \xe2\x80\x9ccould not . . . supply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic] they were black males.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 252\xe2\x80\x93253.  Ronquillo also made a handwritten account of a conversation he had with Boatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said he \xe2\x80\x9ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see faces\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 308.  And Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s typewritten report of that conversation states that Boatner told Ronquillo he \xe2\x80\x9ccould not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 259\xe2\x80\x93260.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing, inter alia, that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes violated this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Brady v. Maryland, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83 (1963)\n.  The state trial court rejected Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.  We granted certiorari, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder Brady, the State violates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to due process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt or punishment.  See 373 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 87.  The State does not dispute that Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s statements in Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes were fa- vorable to Smith and that those statements were not dis- closed to him.  The sole question before us is thus whether Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s statements were material to the determination of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9cevidence is \xe2\x80\x98material\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cone v. Bell, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449\n\xe2\x80\x93470 (2009).  A reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwould more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d only that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to \xe2\x80\x9cundermine[] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kyles v. Whitley, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419, \n434 (1995)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the State\xe2\x80\x99s other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict.  See United States v. Agurs, \n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 97\n\xe2\x80\x93113, and n. 21 (1976).  That is not the case here.  Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime.  And Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements directly contradict his testimony: Boatner told the jury that he had \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o doubt\xe2\x80\x9d that Smith was the gunman he stood \xe2\x80\x9cface to face\xe2\x80\x9d with on the night of the crime, but Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes show Boatner saying that he \xe2\x80\x9ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see faces\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 196, 200, 308.  Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements were plainly material.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State and the dissent advance various reasons why the jury might have discounted Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements.  They stress, for example, that Boatner made other remarks on the night of the murder indicating that he could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but not the others.  That merely leaves us to speculate about which of Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s contradictory declarations the jury would have believed.  The State also contends that Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s statements made five days after the crime can be explained by fear of retaliation.  Smith responds that the record contains no evidence of any such fear.  Again, the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument offers a reason that the jury could have disbelieved Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements, but gives us no confidence that it would have done so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe police files that Smith obtained in state postconviction proceedings contain other evidence that Smith contends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.  Because we hold that Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements alone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, we have no need to consider his arguments that the other undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under Brady.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963661">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x938145\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tJUAN SMITH, PETITIONER v.

Maryland, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83 (1963)\n, did not disclose that the eyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated shortly after the murders that he could not identify any of the perpetrators.  I respectfully dissent.  In my view, Smith has not shown a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury would have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.  United States v.

On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several friends gathered at Rebe Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home in New Or- leans.  Boatner and others were drinking and talking in the kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car without a muffler outside.  As Boatner opened the kitchen\xe2\x80\x99s outside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed their way through the door, demanding drugs and money.  Tr. 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (Dec. 5, 1995).  The first man though the door put a gun in Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s face and pushed him backwards.  Id., at 154\xe2\x80\x93155.  The men initially ordered Boatner and his friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand up.  At that time, the man who had been the first one through the door placed his gun under Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s chin.  Id., at 156\xe2\x80\x93157.  When Boatner asked what the men wanted him to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the head with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.  Id., at 157\xe2\x80\x93158.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a back bedroom, where she had been when the men entered the house.  As Espadron opened an inside door leading to the kitchen, a man with a \xe2\x80\x9ccovering\xe2\x80\x9d over his mouth pointed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor.  Id., at 70\xe2\x80\x9371.  Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back toward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened fire.  Id., at 71\xe2\x80\x9372, 159.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen the shooting was over, four people lay dead.  A fifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally wounded and died later at the hospital.  Of those originally gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner, who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first man\xe2\x80\x99s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who escaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had remained in a back bedroom during the shooting.  The police also found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.  Young was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the head.  Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never seen Young before, the police surmised that Young had been one of the perpetrators.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNew Orleans police officer Joseph Narcisse was a first responder to the scene of the shooting.  He testified at trial that he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the laceration to his head.  According to Narcisse, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Boatner\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995).  Narcisse further explained that Boatner \xe2\x80\x9chad a description\xe2\x80\x9d of the person that he saw, the details of which Narcisse could not recall.  Id., at 32.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDetective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the shootings, testified that Boatner had described the first man through the kitchen door as having a \xe2\x80\x9cshort-type haircut,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca lot of golds in his teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbrown-ski[n].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Id., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995).  Ronquillo further testified that Boatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that Boatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the man initially came through the door and again when Boatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun to his chin.  Id., at 117\xe2\x80\x93118.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRonquillo also testified that, during the four months following the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person photograph arrays of potential suspects\xe2\x80\x94only one of which contained a picture of Smith.  Id., at 89\xe2\x80\x93100.  Three weeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with one of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.  Ronquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the array had a \xe2\x80\x9csimilar haircut\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca similar expression on his face\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman that came into the house initially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,\xe2\x80\x9d but that  Boatner \xe2\x80\x9cwas positive this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 97; see also 5 Record 828.  A few months later, Ronquillo presented Boatner with the array that included a photograph of Smith.  Tr. 99\xe2\x80\x93101 (Dec. 5, 1995).  Ronquillo testified that Boatner identified Smith \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately,\xe2\x80\x9d stating, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98This is it.

Boatner also testified that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s hair at trial was \xe2\x80\x9cshaved on the sides\xe2\x80\x9d as it was during the crime, but that \xe2\x80\x9cthe top was a little bit lower\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the murders.

Id., at 154.  On cross-examination, Boatner testified that he had described the first man\xe2\x80\x99s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the police.

Following the conclusion of direct review, Smith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.  Smith argued that the State had failed to disclose various police notes revealing favorable evidence material to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  As relevant here, those items include pretrial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita Russell and Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial statement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; statements by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s fellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect Phillip Young.  After holding a 4-day evidentiary hearing, the postconviction judge\xe2\x80\x94who had also presided over Smith\xe2\x80\x99s 2-day trial\xe2\x80\x94denied Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Brady claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike the postconviction court below, I conclude that Smith is not entitled to a new trial under Brady. In my view, Smith has not established a reasonable probability that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have caused the jury to change its verdict.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith first identifies two undisclosed statements by Boatner, which the Court concludes are \xe2\x80\x9cplainly material.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3.

Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s typed summary of this note states that Boatner advised him that he \xe2\x80\x9ccould not identify any perpetrators of the murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 id., at 817.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith is correct that these undisclosed statements could have been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during cross-examination.  But the statements are not material for purposes of Brady because they cannot \xe2\x80\x9creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kyles, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435.  When weighed against the substantial evidence that Boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator, offered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occasions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed statements do not warrant a new trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s on-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpetrator at the scene.  Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner provided him with a description of the perpetrator that Boatner saw.  Narcisse\xe2\x80\x99s testimony thus corroborated Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony that he saw the first man and described him to police.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Narcisse\xe2\x80\x99s testimony also mitigated the impeachment value of Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s on-scene note by indicating that, although Boatner may have provided no detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner had described the first man to another officer.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes reflect that Boatner provided a description of the first perpetrator at the police station only a few hours after the shootings occurred.  Tr. 403 (Jan. 22, 2009).  Boatner was asked if he could \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 Record 866.  He responded: \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you about one, the one who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male with a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. about my complexion, brown skinned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  When asked, \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou say you  can\xe2\x80\x99t describe any of the other shooters besides the one who put the gun in your face after you opened the door,\xe2\x80\x9d Boatner replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In his brief, Smith cites this station house statement as an example of favorable, undisclosed evidence.  But this statement actually corroborates Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony that he saw and described the first perpetrator to police and that he did not get a good look at the other assailants.  Moreover, the description Boatner provided was consistent with Smith\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.  The Court completely ignores Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s station house statement, but our cases instruct us to evaluate \xe2\x80\x9cthe net effect of the evidence withheld by the State\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing materiality.  See Kyles, supra, at 421\xe2\x80\x93422.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe evidence not only shows that Boatner described the first perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the crime, but also that Boatner described him again three weeks later when he viewed a photograph array and eliminated a similar-looking individual.  The evidence before the jury further indicated that, several months after the crime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array, after evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month investigative period.  What is more, the reliability of Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court identification was extensively tested during cross-examination at Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  In particular, Boatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith\xe2\x80\x99s picture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect had tainted his identification.  Boatner did not waiver, responding, \xe2\x80\x9cI picked out the person I seen come in that house that held a gun to my head and under my chin and the person that was there when all my friends died.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 190 (Dec. 5, 1995).  That Boatner credibly rejected defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csuggestion\xe2\x80\x9d theory is supported by the fact that Boatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling\xe2\x80\x94whose photograph was included in a separate array shown to Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified Smith\xe2\x80\x94even though Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s picture was next to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s in the same newspaper article.  5 Record 833, 835.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen weighed against Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s repeated and consistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court identifications, Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s March 6 statement is also immaterial.  As an initial matter, Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s note of his March 6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contradiction that undercuts its impeachment value.  Although the note states that Boatner \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d it also states that Boatner \xe2\x80\x9cglanced at 1st one\xe2\x80\x94saw man\xe2\x80\x94through door.\xe2\x80\x9d  13 id., at 2515.  The latter part is consistent with Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s repeated statements that he only saw the first man through the door.  Moreover, the jury would have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s statement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five days after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators were still at large.  The jury would have considered Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony that, following the murders of his friends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleeping, quit his job, and began drinking heavily\xe2\x80\x94so much so that he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treatment and grief counseling.  Tr. 162\xe2\x80\x93163, 170\xe2\x80\x93171, 182 (Dec. 5, 1995).  Any impeachment value in the March 6 note would have been further mitigated by the fact that, as Ronquillo explained, \xe2\x80\x9con the night of the incident [Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he gave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s description.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009).  And, following his March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed numerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetrator, and ultimately identified him as Smith.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes of Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s on-scene and March 6 statements, it might have believed that Boatner could not identify any of the perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is insufficient to establish a Brady violation.  See Strickler v. Greene, \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 263, \n291 (1999)\n; see also Agurs, 427 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 109\xe2\x80\x93110 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not es- tablish \xe2\x80\x98materiality\xe2\x80\x99 in the constitutional sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, a \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burden is to establish a reasonable prob- ability of a different result.\xe2\x80\x9d  Strickler, supra, at 291.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInstead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable probability that Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements would have caused the jury to acquit, the Court improperly requires the State to show that the jury would have given Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements no weight.  See ante, at 3 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he State\xe2\x80\x99s argument offers a reason that the jury could have disbelieved Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements, but gives us no confidence that it would have done so\xe2\x80\x9d).  But Smith is not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury could have accorded some weight to Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statements.  Smith\xe2\x80\x99s burden is to show a reasonable probability that the jury would have accorded those statements sufficient weight to alter its verdict.  In light of the record as a whole\xe2\x80\x94which the Court declines to consider\xe2\x80\x94Smith has not carried that burden.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith also argues that statements by Shelita Russell and Dale Mims documented in Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s handwritten notes could have been used to impeach Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s identification of Smith because the statements indicate that the perpetrators were masked.  One undated note, which contains several entries about various aspects of the investigation, states, \xe2\x80\x9cfemale\xe2\x80\x94face down against cabinets\xe2\x80\x94conscious.\xe2\x80\x9d  On the next line, the note continues, \xe2\x80\x9csaid\xe2\x80\x94in kitchen saw people barge in\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x94black cloth across face\xe2\x80\x94first one through door\xe2\x80\x94[no further statement].\xe2\x80\x9d  13 Record 2556.  When cross-examined during the postconviction hearing about whether this note documented the statement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note was in his handwriting, but he testified that he never talked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was made, and that someone else could have relayed the information to him.  Tr. 415\xe2\x80\x93418 (Jan. 22, 2009).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  I will assume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it would have been admissible at Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial as a dying declaration of Russell.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But the note would have had minimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s assertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which the statement was made.  Officer Narcisse testified that Russell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in \xe2\x80\x9cbad condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995).  Similarly, Reg- inald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she was \xe2\x80\x9cwhining\xe2\x80\x9d and he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t catch nothing [t]hat she said.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995).  And, although Smith contends that the note says \xe2\x80\x9cexactly\xe2\x80\x9d that the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst person through the door had a black cloth across his face,\xe2\x80\x9d that is not how the note reads.

A note by Ronquillo states that Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home, \xe2\x80\x9call wearing mask[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2518.  Like Russell\xe2\x80\x99s purported statement, this statement has minimal impeachment value in light of the record.  Mims\xe2\x80\x99 undisclosed statement does not address whether some or all of the perpetrators were masked inside Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Moreover, had Mims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably would have testified, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that he was \xe2\x80\x9cpositive\xe2\x80\x9d that he only saw three perpetrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were masked.

Thus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but not all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that in no way undermines Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s consistent assertions that the only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith also contends that Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed note documenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary is material for purposes of Brady.  The note states that \xe2\x80\x9cLeary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM ammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders] was typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], \xe2\x80\x98Mac[-] 11\xe2\x80\x99 model type, semi automatic weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 Record 831.  According to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene \xe2\x80\x9cwas fired by one particular weapon, one 9-millimeter handgun,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an Intratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a \xe2\x80\x9chandgun.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith further argues that Leary\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial statement could have been used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution attempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that Shelita Russell\xe2\x80\x99s wounds could have been inflicted by a 9-millimeter \xe2\x80\x9chandgun,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by calling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under his chin was a 9-millimeter silver \xe2\x80\x9chand gun,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 157 (Dec. 5, 1995).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s contentions, Leary\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial statement does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.  Leary\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial statement is consistent with his and Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac11 pistol is a 9-millimeter handgun.  Smith concedes that such a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges.  Brief for Petitioner 48.  Moreover, a \xe2\x80\x9chandgun\xe2\x80\x9d is simply \xe2\x80\x9c[a] firearm that can be used with one hand,\xe2\x80\x9d American Heritage Dictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an Intratec or Mac-11 pistol can be used with one hand.  Smith nonetheless insists that, \xe2\x80\x9cas a colloquial matter, machine pistols of the Intratec or MAC-11 type would be considered automatic or semiautomatic weapons, rather than handguns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 18.

Moreover, Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial description of the silver or chrome \xe2\x80\x9chandgun\xe2\x80\x9d that the first man held was consistent with Leary\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon.

Because Leary\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial statement is neither impeaching nor exculpatory, Leary\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed statement cannot form the basis of a Brady violation.

Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an interview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which he described a conversation that he had with Trackling while in prison.  During that conversation, Trackling described the murders at Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home and stated that he had committed the crime along with \xe2\x80\x9cFat, Buckle, and a guy they call uh, Short Dog.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 841.

First, he points to the following comment by Rogers later during the interview: \xe2\x80\x9cThey call Contez Philip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog that\xe2\x80\x99s what they call him, they call Robert Home.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 845.  Smith suggests that Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 prior identification of \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cJuan [Smith]\xe2\x80\x9d was equivocal in light of his later statement that \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d was a man named \xe2\x80\x9cRobert Home.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 21.  Second, Smith asserts that disclosure of Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 interview would have led the defense and the jury to learn of Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 allegation\xe2\x80\x94made for the first time 10 years after Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial\xe2\x80\x94that the police had asked him to implicate Juan Smith as \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog,\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 284\xe2\x80\x93285 (Jan. 13, 2009).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNeither argument is persuasive.  If the jury had learned of Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 statement, it would have heard information directly inculpating Smith as \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog,\xe2\x80\x9d a perpetrator of the shootings.  Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 physical description of \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che[\xe2\x80\x99s] short[,] he[\xe2\x80\x99s] got golds going across his mouth[,] and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. he\xe2\x80\x99s like built,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 Record 844\xe2\x80\x93also corroborated Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s description of the first man through the door as having a \xe2\x80\x9cmouth full of gold\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cheavy\xe2\x80\x9d build.  Furthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information documented in Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s notes of Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 statement.  Those notes reflect Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s own interview with police on June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips, Bannister, and \xe2\x80\x9cJuan Smith\xe2\x80\x9d as the perpetrators of the murders at Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Id., at 832; see also id., at 854\xe2\x80\x93855.  Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s statement only strengthens the inculpatory nature of Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 interview.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther, the jury assuredly would not have believed Smith\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Rogers identified \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d as a man named \xe2\x80\x9cRobert Home.\xe2\x80\x9d  When this statement is taken in context, it appears that Rogers was describing the nickname\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHome\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x94of Robert Trackling, the \xe2\x80\x9cRobert\xe2\x80\x9d whom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his interview.  See id., at 839\xe2\x80\x93850.  Indeed, Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 phrase- ology, \xe2\x80\x9cthey call Robert Home,\xe2\x80\x9d was consistent with his pre- vious comments that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthey call Darnell Banister Fat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 845 (emphasis added).  Unsurprisingly, in the thousands of pages of  record material, I have not found, nor have the parties cited, a single reference to anyone named \xe2\x80\x9cRobert Home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the jury had heard Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 postconviction testimony that police asked him to implicate Smith and that Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s description of the murders did not include Smith, Tr. 284\xe2\x80\x93285 (Jan. 13, 2009), it would have weighed Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 allegation against Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s own statement to the police that Smith had participated in the murders at Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home, 5 Record 832.  The prosecution also would have called Smith\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Trinieze Smith, to testify that she believed her brother was known as \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog,\xe2\x80\x9d as she did at the postconviction hearing.  Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009).  On this record, the undisclosed statements by Rogers and Trackling actually strengthen rather than weaken confidence in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tE\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten note by Ronquillo documenting a statement by Phillip Young\xe2\x80\x94the man found injured at the scene and suspected of having participated in the crime\xe2\x80\x94is also material evidence warranting a new trial.  At trial, Ronquillo testified that he met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a result of permanent brain damage suffered in the shoot-  ings.  Id., at 102 (Dec. 5, 1995).  According to Ronquillo, Young \xe2\x80\x9cwas strapped to a chair.  He really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk, [h]e mumbled.  He could use his left hand, that was all.  He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk or anything.  He was fed through a tube by the people there.  He was in really bad shape.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  When asked whether Young was able to communicate with him \xe2\x80\x9cat all,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronquillo responded, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand anything that he was saying.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 103.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe undisclosed note from Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Young reads as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog/Bucko/Fats\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94Didn\xe2\x80\x99t shoot me\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94Not with me when went to house\xe2\x80\x94Yes\xe2\x80\x94one of people in house shot me\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94Not responsible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Posse\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Didn\xe2\x80\x99t drive to house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Posse\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Yes\xe2\x80\x94Knows names of perps\xe2\x80\x94Yes\xe2\x80\x94Drove in car\xe2\x80\x94Yes\xe2\x80\x94girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s car.\xe2\x80\x9d  13 Record 2568.

Brief for Petitioner 43.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYoung\xe2\x80\x99s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes (as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d and a member of the \xe2\x80\x9cCut Throat Posse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a concession would only have strengthened the inculpatory value of the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that Smith was the \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d who committed the murders at Espadron\xe2\x80\x99s home.  In any event, the exculpatory value of the note is minimal for several other reasons.  First, it is unclear whether Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s note reflects a statement by Young that the \xe2\x80\x9cPosse\xe2\x80\x9d was not responsible for shooting the victims or a statement that the \xe2\x80\x9cPosse\xe2\x80\x9d was not responsible for shooting Young.  Further, the statement that \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d and others were not with Young when he went to the house is certainly not a clear statement that \xe2\x80\x9cShort Dog\xe2\x80\x9d did not commit the murders, especially in light of evidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on the night of the murders.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Second, had the jury learned of Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s note, it would have presumably heard Ronquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that he was not even sure whether his note actually reflected statements by Young, given that Young \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cjumbled,\xe2\x80\x9d could only \xe2\x80\x9ckind of move his head,\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes would just sit and stare when Ronquillo asked a question.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Tr. 423\xe2\x80\x93424 (Jan. 22, 2009).  Accordingly, Ronquillo explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI never had hide nor hair actually of what [Young] said.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 423.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s note, of unclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop of doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communicated.  The jury also would have weighed this evidence against the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions and identifications and Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 and Trackling\xe2\x80\x99s statements, which corroborated Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s identification.  When all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it must be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question presented here is not whether a prudent prosecutor should have disclosed the information that Smith identifies.  Rather, the question is whether the cu- mulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case \xe2\x80\x9cput[s] the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kyles, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435.  When, as in this case, the Court departs from its usual practice of declining to review alleged misapplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consider all of the facts.  And, the Court certainly should not decline to review all of the facts on the assumption that the remainder of the record would only further support Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.  Ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSuch an assumption is incorrect.  Here, much of the record evidence confirms that, from the night of the murders through trial, Boatner consistently described\xe2\x80\x94with one understandable exception\xe2\x80\x94the first perpetrator through the door, that Boatner\xe2\x80\x99s description matched Smith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-court identifications implicating Smith.  Some of the undisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him at all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpa- tory value or because it actually inculpates him.  Because what remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment and exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the whole record, I must dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the State violated Brady.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was deemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he sufferedas a result of being shot.  1 Record 49.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGolds\xe2\x80\x9d are permanent or removable mouth jewelry, also referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cgrills.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Mouth Jewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p.\xc2\xa05, 2007 WLNR 2187080.

More importantly, Leary\xe2\x80\x99s statement suggests only that Bannister\xe2\x80\x99s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene, not that Leary did not consider an \xe2\x80\x9c[Intratec] or \xe2\x80\x98Mac[-]11\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d model type to be a handgun.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">9</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See 2 Dictionary of American Regional English 1064\xe2\x80\x931065, 1069 (F.

Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that no communication occurred.
