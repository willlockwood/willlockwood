JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>At issue in this case are two overlapping provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 442 U. S. 116</a></p><p> Act). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Both prohibit convicted felons from receiving firearms, but each authorizes different maximum penalties.  We must determine whether a defendant convicted of the offense carrying the greater penalty may be sentenced only under the more lenient provision when his conduct violates both statutes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent, a previously convicted felon, was found guilty of receiving a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 922(h). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The District Court sentenced him under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 924(a) to five years\' imprisonment, the maximum term authorized for violation of \xc2\xa7 922(h). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but, by a divided vote, remanded for resentencing.  581 F.2d 626 (CA7 1978).  The majority recognized that respondent had been indicted and convicted under \xc2\xa7 922(h), and that \xc2\xa7 924(a) permits five years\' imprisonment for such violations.  581 F.2d at 629.  However, noting that the substantive elements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 442 U. S. 117</a></p><p> of \xc2\xa7 922(h) and 18 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 1202(a) are identical as applied to a convicted felon who unlawfully receives a firearm, the court interpreted the Omnibus Act to allow no more than the 2-year maximum sentence provided by \xc2\xa7 1202(a).  581 F.2d at 629. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In so holding, the Court of Appeals relied on three principles of statutory construction.  Because, in its view, the "arguably contradict[ory]" penalty provisions for similar conduct and the "inconclusive" legislative history raised doubt whether Congress had intended the two penalty provisions to coexist, the court first applied the doctrine that ambiguities in criminal legislation are to be resolved in favor of the defendant.  <em>Id.</em> at 630.  Second, the court determined that, since \xc2\xa7 1202(a) was "Congress\' last word on the issue of penalty," it may have implicitly repealed the punishment provisions of \xc2\xa7 924(a).  581 F.2d at 630.  Acknowledging that the "first two principles cannot be applied to these facts without some difficulty," the majority also invoked the maxim that a court should, if possible, interpret a statute to avoid constitutional questions.  <em>Id.</em> at 630-631.  Here, the court reasoned, the "prosecutor\'s power to select one of two statutes that are identical except for their penalty provisions" implicated "important constitutional protections."  <em>Id.</em> at 631. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 442 U. S. 118</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The dissent found no basis in the Omnibus Act or its legislative history for engrafting the penalty provisions of \xc2\xa7 1202(a) onto \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 924(a).  581 F.2d at 638-639.  Relying on</p>\n<p>"the long line of cases . . . which hold that where an act may violate more than one criminal statute, the government may elect to prosecute under either, even if [the] defendant risks the harsher penalty, so long as the prosecutor does not discriminate against any class of defendants,"</p>\n<p>the dissent further concluded that the statutory scheme was constitutional.  <em>Id.</em> at 637.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 439 U.S. 1066 (1979), and now reverse the judgment vacating respondent\'s 5-year prison sentence.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court has previously noted the partial redundancy of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a), both as to the conduct they proscribe and the individuals they reach.  <em>See United States v. Bass,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html">404 U. S. 336</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html#341">404 U. S. 341</a></span>-343, and n. 9 (1971).  However, we find nothing in the language, structure, or legislative history of the Omnibus Act to suggest that, because of this overlap, a defendant convicted under \xc2\xa7 922(h) may be imprisoned for no more than the maximum term specified in \xc2\xa7 1202(a).  As we read the Act, each substantive statute, in conjunction with its own sentencing provision, operates independently of the other.</p>\n<p>Section 922(h), contained in Title IV of the Omnibus Act, prohibits four categories of individuals from receiving "any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce."  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em>  Persons who violate Title IV are subject to the penalties provided by \xc2\xa7 924(a), which authorizes a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to five years.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em>  Section 1202(a), located in Title VII of the Omnibus Act, forbids five categories of individuals from "receiv[ing], possess[ing], or transport[ing] in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm."  This same section authorizes a maximum fine of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 442 U. S. 119</a></p><p> $10,000 and imprisonment for not more than two years.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>While \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922 and 1202(a) both prohibit convicted felons such as petitioner from receiving firearms, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] each Title unambiguously specifies the penalties available to enforce its substantive proscriptions.  Section 924(a) applies without exception to "[w]hoever violates any provision" of Title IV, and \xc2\xa7 922(h) is patently such a provision.  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. ch. 44; 82 Stat. 226, 234; S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 20-25, 117 (1968).  Similarly, because Title VII\'s substantive prohibitions and penalties are both enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1202, its penalty scheme encompasses only criminal prosecutions brought under that provision.  On their face, these statutes thus establish that \xc2\xa7 924(a) alone delimits the appropriate punishment for violations of \xc2\xa7 922(h).</p>\n<p>That Congress intended to enact two independent gun control statutes, each fully enforceable on its own terms, is confirmed by the legislative history of the Omnibus Act.  Section 922(h) derived from \xc2\xa7 2(f) of the Federal Firearms Act of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 442 U. S. 120</a></p><p> 1938,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/42/case.html#52">442 U. S. 52</a></span> Stat. 1251, and \xc2\xa7 5 of that Act, 52 Stat. 1252, authorized the same maximum prison term as \xc2\xa7 924(a).  Title IV of the Omnibus Act merely recodified with some modification this "carefully constructed package of gun control legislation," which had been in existence for many years.  <em>Scarborough v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/563/case.html">431 U. S. 563</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/563/case.html#570">431 U. S. 570</a></span> (1977); <em>see United States v.

By contrast, Title VII was a "last-minute" floor amendment, "hastily passed, with little discussion, no hearings, and no report."  <em>United States v. Bass, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html#344">404 U. S. 344</a></span>, and n. 11; <em>see Scarborough v.

And the meager legislative debates involving that amendment demonstrate no intention to alter the terms of Title IV.  Immediately before the Senate passed Title VII, Senator Dodd inquired whether it would substitute for Title IV.  114 Cong.Rec. 14774 (1968).  Senator Long, the sponsor of the amendment, replied that \xc2\xa7 1202 would "take nothing from," but merely "add to," Title IV.  114 Cong.Rec. 14774 (1968).  Similarly, although Title VII received only passing mention in House discussions of the bill, Representative Machen made clear that the amendment would "complement . . . the gun control legislation contained in title IV."  <em>Id.</em> at 16286.  Had these legislators intended to preempt Title IV in cases of overlap, they presumably would not have indicated that the purpose of Title VII was to complement Title IV.  <em>See Scarborough v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/563/case.html#573">431 U. S. 573</a></span>. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 442 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>In construing \xc2\xa7 1202(a) to override the penalties authorized by \xc2\xa7 924(a), the Court of Appeals relied, we believe erroneously, on three principles of statutory interpretation.  First, the court invoked the well established doctrine that ambiguities in criminal statutes must be resolved in favor of lenity.  <em>E.g., Rewis v.

Although this principle of construction applies to sentencing as well as substantive provisions, <em>see Simpson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/6/case.html">435 U.

Respondent unquestionably violated \xc2\xa7 922(h), and \xc2\xa7 924(a) unquestionably permits five years\' imprisonment for such a violation.  That \xc2\xa7 1202(a) provides different penalties for essentially the same conduct is no justification for taking liberties with unequivocal statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 442 U.

By its express terms, \xc2\xa7 1202(a) limits its penalty scheme exclusively to convictions obtained under that provision.

S. 364</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals acknowledged this "settled rule" allowing prosecutorial choice.  581 F.2d at 632.  Nevertheless, relying on the dissenting opinion in <em>Berra v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/131/case.html">351 U. S. 131</a></span> (1956), [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] the court distinguished overlapping statutes with identical standards of proof from provisions that vary in some particular.  581 F.2d at 632-633.  In the court\'s view, when two statutes prohibit "exactly the same conduct," the prosecutor\'s "selection of which of two penalties to apply" would be "unfettered."  <em>Id.</em> at 633, and n. 11.  Because such prosecutorial discretion could produce "unequal justice," the court expressed doubt that this form of legislative redundancy was constitutional.  <em>Id.</em> at 631.  We find this analysis factually and legally unsound.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court of Appeals\' assertions, a prosecutor\'s discretion to choose between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a) is not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 442 U. S. 125</a></p><p> "unfettered."  Selectivity in the enforcement of criminal laws is, of course, subject to constitutional constraints. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  And a decision to proceed under \xc2\xa7 922(h) does not empower the Government to predetermine ultimate criminal sanctions.  Rather, it merely enables the sentencing judge to impose a longer prison sentence than \xc2\xa7 1202(a) would permit, and precludes him from imposing the greater fine authorized by \xc2\xa7 122(a).  More importantly, there is no appreciable difference between the discretion a prosecutor exercises when deciding whether to charge under one of two statutes with different elements and the discretion he exercises when choosing one of two statutes with identical elements.  In the former situation, once he determines that the proof will support conviction under either statute, his decision is indistinguishable from the one he faces in the latter context.  The prosecutor may be influenced by the penalties available upon conviction, but this fact, standing alone, does not give rise to a violation of the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause.  <em>Cf. Rosenberg v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/273/case.html#294">346 U. S. 294</a></span> (Clark, J., concurring); <em>Oyler v.

Just as a defendant has no constitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his indictment and prosecution, neither is he entitled to choose the penalty scheme under which he will be sentenced.  <em>See</em> U.S.Const., Art.

The provisions at issue plainly demarcate the range of penalties that prosecutors and judges may seek and impose.  In light of that specificity, the power that Congress has delegated to those officials is no broader than the authority they routinely exercise in enforcing the criminal laws.  Having informed the courts, prosecutors, and defendants of the permissible punishment alternatives available under each Title, Congress has fulfilled its duty.  <em>See United States v.

For example, a person who received a firearm while under indictment for murder would be subject to five years\' imprisonment, since only \xc2\xa7 922(h) includes those under indictment for a felony.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 922(h)(1).  If he received the firearm after his conviction, however, the term of imprisonment could not exceed two years.  Similarly, because \xc2\xa7 922(h) alone proscribes receipt of ammunition, a felon who obtained a single bullet could receive a 5-year sentence, while receipt of a firearm would be punishable by no more than two years\' imprisonment under \xc2\xa7 1202(a).  In addition, the Court of Appeals\' analysis leaves uncertain the result that would obtain if a sentencing judge wished to impose a maximum prison sentence and a maximum fine for conduct violative of both Titles.  The doctrine of lenity would suggest that the $5,000 maximum of \xc2\xa7 924(a) and the 2-year maximum of \xc2\xa7 1202(a) would apply.  However, if the doctrine of implied repeal controls, arguably the $10,000 fine authorized by \xc2\xa7 1202(a) could be imposed for a violation of \xc2\xa7 922(h).  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/114/case.html#122">442 U.
