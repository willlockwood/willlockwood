JUSTICE MATTHEWS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is now urged that the endorsement and delivery of the certificate of deposit, if void as a gift <em>mortis causa,</em> is nevertheless good as a will of personalty under the laws of Tennessee, and, passing the title as such, entitled the appellant to a decree for the payment of the money.</p>\n<p>But the conclusion is not justified by the assumption, for a will of personalty in Tennessee does not take effect until probate, Statutes of Tennessee, 1871, \xc2\xa7 2169; <em>Suggett v. Kitchell,</em> 6 Yerger 425; and until probate, and the appointment of an executor or an administrator <em>cum testamento annexo,</em> the title to the fund passes to the administrator appointed previously, as in case of intestacy, to whom the decree in this case awarded it.</p>\n<p><em>The petition is therefore denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
