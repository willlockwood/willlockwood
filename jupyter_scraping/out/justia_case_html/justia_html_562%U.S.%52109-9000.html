S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 or may assert the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons.  He claimed that a potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s uncle as the likely perpetrator.  In preparation for trial, the State tested some of the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and certain hair samples.  More than six years later, Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.  Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested biological evidence.  Both motions were denied.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article 64.03(a)(2), that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing.\xe2\x80\x9d  The CCA affirmed the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previously tested \xe2\x80\x9cthrough no fault\xe2\x80\x9d on his part.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief under \xc2\xa71983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District Attorney who has custody of the evidence that Skinner would like to have tested.  Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA testing he requested.  The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postconviction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not under \xc2\xa71983.  Adopting that recommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under \xc2\xa71983.

Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph alleging that the State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal \xe2\x80\x9cto release the biological evidence for testing \xe2\x80\xa6 deprived [him] of his liberty interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d His counsel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct or the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s decisions; instead, he challenges Texas\xe2\x80\x99 postconviction DNA statute \xe2\x80\x9cas construed\xe2\x80\x9d by the Texas courts.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine does not bar Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  This Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it takes its name, <em>Rooker</em> v. <em>Fidelity Trust Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/263/413/index.html">263 U. S. 413</a>, <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals</em> v. <em>Feldman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/462/index.html">460 U. S. 462</a>.  See <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Saudi Basic Industries Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/280/index.html">544 U. S. 280</a>.  Given \xe2\x80\x9cthe narrow ground\xe2\x80\x9d the doctrine occupies, <em>id.</em>, at 284, the Court has confined <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> \xe2\x80\x9cto cases \xe2\x80\xa6 brought by state-court losers \xe2\x80\xa6 inviting district court review and rejection of [a state court\xe2\x80\x99s] judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint encounters no<em> Rooker-Feldman </em>shoal.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf a federal plaintiff \xe2\x80\x98present[s] [an] independent claim,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the \xe2\x80\x9csame or a related question\xe2\x80\x9d was earlier aired between the parties in state court.  <em>Id.,</em> at 292\xe2\x80\x93293.  A state-court decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Feldman</em>, 460 U. S., at 487.  Because Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s federal case\xe2\x80\x94which challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute they authoritatively construed\xe2\x80\x94falls within the latter category, there was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Measured against this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior holdings, Skinner has properly invoked \xc2\xa71983.  This Court has several times considered when a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pursue a civil rights claim under \xc2\xa71983, and when habeas corpus is the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sole remedy.  The pathmarking decision, <em>Heck</em> v. <em>Humphrey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/477/index.html">512 U. S. 477</a>, concerned a state prisoner who brought a \xc2\xa71983 action for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.  This Court held that \xc2\xa71983 was not an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor would \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily imply\xe2\x80\x9d the invalidity of his conviction.  See <em>id.</em>, at 487.  In contrast, in <em>Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Dotson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/74/index.html">544 U. S. 74</a>, the Court held that prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under \xc2\xa71983, for they sought no \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction ordering \xe2\x80\xa6 immediate or speedier release into the community,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 82, and \xe2\x80\x9ca favorable judgment [would] not \xe2\x80\x98necessarily imply\xe2\x80\x99 the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Here, success in Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s suit for DNA testing would not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily imply\xe2\x80\x9d the invalidity of his conviction.  Test results might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevitable, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.  Switzer argues that, although Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s immediate aim is DNA testing, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought would not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce the custody level.  Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her<em> amici, </em>in the Circuits that currently allow \xc2\xa71983 claims for DNA testing, there has been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evidence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment.  The projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding DNA testing claims, for <em>Osborne</em> has rejected substantive due process as a basis for such claims.  More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits in order to prevent sportive federal-court filings.  Nor is there cause for concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a>.  <em>Brady, </em>which announced a constitutional requirement addressed to the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s conduct pretrial, proscribes withholding evidence \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable to an accused\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial to [his] guilt or to punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or inconclusive results, a successful <em>Brady </em>claim necessarily yields evidence undermining a conviction: <em>Brady </em>claims therefore rank within the traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of \xc2\xa71983.

Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we reaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate or speedier release\xe2\x80\x9d from confinement.  <em>Id.</em>, at 82.  Where the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim would not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily spell speedier release,\xe2\x80\x9d however, suit may be brought under \xc2\xa71983.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Adhering to our opinion in <em>Dotson</em>, we hold that a postconviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a \xc2\xa71983 action.  Success in the suit gains for the prisoner only access to the DNA evidence, which may prove exculpatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive.  In no event will a judgment that simply orders DNA tests \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 81.  We note, however, that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Osborne</em> severely limits the federal action a state prisoner may bring for DNA testing.  <em>Osborne </em>rejected the extension of substantive due process to this area, 557 U.

Busby was bludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons were stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the house Busby shared with Skinner.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skinner never denied his presence in the house when the killings occurred.  He claimed, however, that he was incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.  The potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at trial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal murders charged against him.  Skinner identified, as a likely perpetrator, Busby\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, Robert Donnell (now deceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and sexual abuse.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence.  <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State</em>, 956 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).  The CCA\xe2\x80\x99s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in detail:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAs they approached the house \xe2\x80\xa6 , the police noticed a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the front porch to the fence line.  There was a blood smear on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.  Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila\xe2\x80\x99s dead body on the living room floor\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. An ax handle stained with blood and hair was leaning against the couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag containing a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains on it was laying between the couch and the coffee\ntable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where [Busby\xe2\x80\x99s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds.  [The officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0A door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility room yielded further evidence.  [He] noticed a bloody handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the frame of this door.  He also noted a bloody handprint on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[When] police arrested [Skinner] \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 [t]hey found him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks and blood-stained blue jeans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 536.</p>\n<p align="left">\nInvestigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from Busby.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In preparation for trial, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State tested the blood on [Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s] clothing, blood and hair from a blanket that partially covered one of the victims, and hairs on one\nof the victim\xe2\x80\x99s back and cheeks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State</em>, 122 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).  The State also tested fingerprint evidence.  Some of this evidence\xe2\x80\x94including bloody palm prints in the room where one victim was killed\xe2\x80\x94implicated Skinner, but \xe2\x80\x9cfingerprints on a bag containing one of the knives\xe2\x80\x9d did not.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Items left untested included the knives found on the premises, the axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and additional hair samples.  See<em> ibid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuccessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.  See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Quarterman</em>, 576 F.\xc2\xa03d 214 (CA5 2009), cert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010).  He also pursued informal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence the police had collected at the scene of the crime.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2001, more than six years after Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, Texas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to gain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp. 2010).  To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner must meet one of two threshold criteria.  He may show that, at trial, testing either was \xe2\x80\x9cnot available\xe2\x80\x9d or was \xe2\x80\x9cavailable, but not technologically capable of providing probative results.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A).  Alternatively, he may show that the evidence was not previously tested \xe2\x80\x9cthrough no fault\xe2\x80\x9d on his part, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d require a postconviction order for testing.  Art. 64.01(b)(1)(B).  To grant a motion for postconviction testing, a court must make further findings, prime among them, the movant \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe [Article 64] request \xe2\x80\xa6 [was] not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 64.03(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court, first in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet untested biological evidence.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa03.  Both motions were denied.  Affirming the denial of Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s first motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demonstrate a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability \xe2\x80\xa6 that he would not have been \xe2\x80\xa6 convicted if the DNA test results were exculpatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State</em>, 122 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 813.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s second motion was bolstered by discovery he had obtained in the interim.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The CCA again affirmed the denial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground that Skinner failed to meet the \xe2\x80\x9cno fault\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State</em>, 293 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  During postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial counsel testified that he had not \xe2\x80\x9cask[ed] for testing because he was afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 202.  That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable trial strategy\xe2\x80\x9d that the court had no cause to second-guess.  <em>Id</em>., at 209.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief under \xc2\xa71983, naming as defendant respondent Lynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prosecuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner would like to have DNA tested.

Under the governing Circuit precedent, <em>Kutzner </em>v. <em>Montgomery County</em>, 303 F.\xc2\xa03d 339, the Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not under \xc2\xa71983.

Both cases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] filed suit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of that judgment.  Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the plaintiffs in <em>Rooker</em> and <em>Feldman</em> asked the District Court to overturn the injurious state-court judgment.  We held, in both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U.

There was, therefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s federal suit.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under \xc2\xa71983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sole remedy?  This Court has several times considered that question.  Pathmarking here is <em>Heck</em> v. <em>Humphrey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/477/index.html">512 U. S. 477</a> (1994).  Plaintiff in that litigation was a state prisoner serving time for manslaughter.  He brought a \xc2\xa71983 action for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.  Although the complaint in <em>Heck</em> sought monetary damages only, not release from confinement, we ruled that the plaintiff could not proceed under \xc2\xa71983.  Any award in his favor, we observed, would \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily imply\xe2\x80\x9d the invalidity of his conviction.  See <em>id.</em>, at 487.  When \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, \xc2\xa71983 is not an available remedy.  <em>Ibid. </em> \xe2\x80\x9cBut if . . . the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s action, even if successful, will <em>not</em> demonstrate the invalidity of [his conviction or sentence], the [\xc2\xa71983] action should be allowed to proceed \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We summarized the relevant case law most recently in Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Dotson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/74/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/74/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/74/index.html">544 U.

They could proceed under \xc2\xa71983, the Court held, for they sought no \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction ordering \xe2\x80\xa6 immediate or speedier release into the community,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 82, and \xe2\x80\x9ca favorable judgment [would] not \xe2\x80\x98necessarily imply the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ibid</em>.

Success in his suit for DNA testing would not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily imply\xe2\x80\x9d the invalidity of his conviction.  While test results might prove exculpatory, that outcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might further incriminate Skinner.  See <em>Nelson</em> v. <em>Campbell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/637/index.html">541 U.

The dissent echoes Switzer\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  See <em>post</em>, at 3.  Although Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>immediate</em> plea is simply for an order requiring DNA testing, his <em>ultimate </em>aim, Switzer urges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction.  It suffices to point out that Switzer has found no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available one, where the relief sought would \xe2\x80\x9cneither terminat[e] custody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from custody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dotson</em>, 544 U.

See Brief for National District Attorneys Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8.  In particular, they predict a proliferation of federal civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cseeking postconviction discovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 6.  These fears, shared by the dissent, <em>post</em>, at 6, are unwarranted.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Circuits that currently allow \xc2\xa71983 claims for DNA testing, see <em>supra</em>, at 1, no evidence tendered by Switzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall.  The projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding DNA testing claims, for <em>Osborne</em> has rejected substantive due process as a basis for such claims.  See<em> supra</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321\xe2\x80\x9366, Congress has placed a series of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to prevent sportive filings in federal court.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, PLRA \xc2\xa7803(d) (adding 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e to create new procedures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under \xc2\xa71983); PLRA \xc2\xa7804(a)(3) (adding 28 U.

To establish that a <em>Brady </em>violation undermines a conviction, a convicted defendant must make each of three showings: (1) the evidence at issue is \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) the State suppressed the evidence, \xe2\x80\x9ceither willfully or inadvertently\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice \xe2\x80\xa6 ensued.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickler</em> v. <em>Greene</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/263/index.html">527 U.

See <em>Strickler</em>, 527 U. S., at 296.

But this Court has never purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of \xc2\xa71983. Cf.<em> id.</em>, at 482.  Rather, we have evaluated each claim as it has come before us, reasoning from first principles and our prior decisions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Preiser</em> v. <em>Rodriguez</em>, the Court began with the undisputed proposition that a state prisoner may not use \xc2\xa71983 to \xe2\x80\x9cchalleng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on federal constitutional grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  411 U. S., at 489.  This included attacks on the trial procedures.  See <em>id.</em>, at 486 (\xe2\x80\x9cden[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  From there, the Court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate release from [physical] confinement or the shortening of its duration\xe2\x80\x9d also cannot be sought under \xc2\xa71983.  <em>Id.</em>, at 489; see also <em>Wolff</em> v. <em>McDonnell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/index.html">418 U.

S. 641</a> (1997) (refusing to allow a \xc2\xa71983 procedural challenge to the process used to revoke good-time credits).  Then, in <em>Heck</em> v. <em>Humphrey</em>, we addressed \xc2\xa71983 actions seeking damages.  512 U. S., at 483.  Determining that such actions were not covered by <em>Preiser</em>, we returned to \xe2\x80\x9cthe hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d 512 U. S., at 486, and concluded that a complaint must be dismissed where \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 487.  Most recently, in <em>Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Dotson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/74/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/74/index.html">544 U. S. 74</a>, 82 (2005), we applied the principles from these prior decisions and found cognizable under \xc2\xa71983 a claim that sought to \xe2\x80\x9crender invalid the state procedures used to deny parole eligibility \xe2\x80\xa6 and parole suitability.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have not previously addressed whether due process challenges to state collateral review procedures may be brought under \xc2\xa71983, and I would hold that they may not.  Challenges to all state procedures for reviewing the validity of a conviction should be treated the same as challenges to state trial procedures, which we have already recognized may not be brought under \xc2\xa71983.  Moreover, allowing such challenges under \xc2\xa71983 would undermine Congress\xe2\x80\x99 strict limitations on federal review of state habeas decisions.  If cognizable at all, Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s claim sounds in habeas corpus.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, for the purposes of the Due Process Clause, the process of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all procedures\xe2\x80\x94including collateral review procedures\xe2\x80\x94that establish and review the validity of a conviction.  This has long been recognized for direct appellate review:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd while the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that a State shall provide for an appellate review in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appellate tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process of law under which he is held in custody by the State, and to be considered in determining any question of alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frank</em> v. <em>Mangum</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/237/309/index.html">237 U. S. 309</a>, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSimilarly, although a State is not required to provide procedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that when state collateral review procedures are provided for, they too are part of the \xe2\x80\x9cprocess of law under which [a prisoner] is held in custody by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As this Court has explained, when considering whether the State has provided all the process that is due in depriving an individual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both pre- and post-deprivation process.  See <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Loudermill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/532/index.html">470 U. S. 532</a>, 547, n.\xc2\xa012 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he existence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc.</em> v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/582/index.html">515 U.

There is no principled reason this Court should refuse to allow \xc2\xa71983 suits to challenge part of this process\xe2\x80\x94the trial proceedings\xe2\x80\x94but bless the use of \xc2\xa71983 to challenge other parts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Collateral review procedures are, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cnot part of the criminal proceeding itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Finley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/551/index.html">481 U. S. 551</a>, 557 (1987).  But like trial and direct appellate procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.  Trial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner; appellate procedures review the validity of that conviction before it becomes final; and collateral review procedures permit challenge to the conviction after it is final.  For purposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds of \xc2\xa71983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all constitutional challenges to procedures concerning the validity of a conviction.  See <em>Heck</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 491 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is proper for the Court to devise\nlimitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between habeas and \xc2\xa71983], provided that it does so in a principled fashion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of federalism and comity [are] at stake\xe2\x80\x9d when federal courts review state collateral review procedures, just as when they review state trial procedures.  <em>Osborne</em>, 557 U. S., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  An attack in federal court on any \xe2\x80\x9cstate judicial action\xe2\x80\x9d concerning a state conviction must proceed with \xe2\x80\x9cproper respect for state functions,\xe2\x80\x9d because the federal courts are being asked to \xe2\x80\x9ctr[y] the regularity of proceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Preiser</em>, 411 U. S., at 491 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because of these concerns for federal-state comity, Congress has strictly limited the procedures for federal habeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas decisions.  Congress requires that before a state prisoner may seek relief in federal court, he must \xe2\x80\x9cexhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A).  And state habeas determinations receive significant deference in subsequent federal habeas proceedings.  \xc2\xa72254(d).  These requirements ensure that the state courts have the first opportunity to correct any error with a state conviction and that their rulings receive due respect in subsequent federal challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By bringing a procedural challenge under \xc2\xa71983, Skinner undermines these restrictions.  For example, Skinner has never presented his current challenge to Texas\xe2\x80\x99 procedures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts.  Allowing Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas <em>procedures</em> instead of an attack on state habeas <em>results</em> undercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have placed on federal review of state convictions.  See <em>Osborne</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  To allege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on collateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas petition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions and deferential review.  But a successful challenge to Texas\xe2\x80\x99 collateral review procedures under \xc2\xa71983 would impeach the result of collateral review without complying with any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority contends that its decision will not \xe2\x80\x9cspill over to claims relying on <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13; but cf. <em>Osborne</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x935).  In truth, the majority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under \xc2\xa71983: After state habeas is denied, file a \xc2\xa71983 suit challenging the state habeas process rather than the result.  What prisoner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the apple?[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority relies on <em>Dotson</em> to reach its conclusion.  In that case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in state parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and \xe2\x80\x9ca new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally proper procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 77.  We found the claims cognizable under \xc2\xa71983.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Dotson </em>does not control this case.  Unlike state collateral review, parole does not evaluate the validity of the underlying state conviction or sentence.  Collateral review permits prisoners to \xe2\x80\x9cattack their final convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Osborne</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  In contrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a prisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the underlying conviction or sentence.  Whatever the correctness of <em>Dotson</em>, parole procedures do not review the validity of a conviction or sentence.  For that reason, permitting review of parole procedures does not similarly risk transforming \xc2\xa71983 into a vehicle for \xe2\x80\x9cchallenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heck</em>, 512 U. S., at 486.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contention, <em>Dotson</em> did not reduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under \xc2\xa71983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim would \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily spell speedier release.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 11, 12, n.\xc2\xa012 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  As we recognized in <em>Heck</em>, evaluating the boundaries of \xc2\xa71983 is not a narrow, mechanical inquiry.  Even when the relief sought was not \xe2\x80\x9cspeedier release,\xe2\x80\x9d we inquired further\nand returned to first principles to determine that the chal-lenge in that case was not cognizable under \xc2\xa71983.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See 512 U. S., at 486.  <em>Dotson </em>does not suggest that the <em>Heck</em> approach, which I would continue to follow here, was incorrect.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has struggled to limit \xc2\xa71983 and prevent it from intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus.  In crafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seeking \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate or speedier release\xe2\x80\x9d from confinement fall outside its scope.  <em>Dotson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 82.  We found another limit when faced with a civil action in which \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heck</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 487.  This case calls for yet another: due process challenges to state procedures used to review the validity of a conviction or sentence.  Under that rule, Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not cognizable under \xc2\xa71983, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I adopt the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view that Skinner has alleged a violation of procedural due process despite the fact that his complaint is more naturally read as alleging a violation of <em>substantive </em>due process.  I also ignore the questionable premise that the requested relief\xe2\x80\x94DNA testing\xe2\x80\x94would be available in a procedural due process challenge.

See <em>Ard</em> v. <em>State</em>, 191 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006).
