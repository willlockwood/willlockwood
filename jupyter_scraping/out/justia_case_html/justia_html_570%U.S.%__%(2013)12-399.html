Birth Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South Carolina.  For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four months after Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s birth, Biological Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl.  About four months after Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of the pending adoption.  In the adoption proceedings, Biological Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adoption.  Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couple\xe2\x80\x99s adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father.  At the age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father, whom she had never met.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d under the ICWA; that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, \xc2\xa71915(a)\xe2\x80\x99s adoptionplacement preferences would have applied.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld: \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d under the ICWA, neither \xc2\xa71912(f) nor \xc2\xa71912(d) bars the termination of his parental rights.

The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d thus refers to custody that a parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past).  As a result, \xc2\xa71912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.  This reading comports with the statutory text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian families.  See \xc2\xa71901(4).  But the ICWA\xe2\x80\x99s primary goal is not implicated when an Indian child\xe2\x80\x99s adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights.  Nonbinding guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate that the BIA envisioned that \xc2\xa71912(f)\xe2\x80\x99s standard would apply only to termination of a custodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  Under this reading, Biological Father should not have been able to invoke \xc2\xa71912(f) in this case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl as of the time of the adoption proceedings.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cbreakup\xe2\x80\x9d refers in this context to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or \xe2\x80\x9can ending as an effective entity,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961).  But when an Indian parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has never been in the Indian parent\xe2\x80\x99s legal or physical custody, there is no \xe2\x80\x9crelationship\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cdiscontinu[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d and no \xe2\x80\x9ceffective entity\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cend[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by terminating the Indian parent\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  In such a situation, the \xe2\x80\x9cbreakup of the Indian family\xe2\x80\x9d has long since occurred, and \xc2\xa71912(d) is inapplicable.  This interpretation is consistent with the explicit congressional purpose of setting certain \xe2\x80\x9cstandards for the removal of Indian children from their families,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71902, and with BIA Guidelines.  Section 1912(d)\xe2\x80\x99s proximity to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71912(e) and (f), which both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d with his parent, strongly suggests that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbreakup of the Indian family\xe2\x80\x9d should be read in harmony with the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.

No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court.  Biological Father is not covered by \xc2\xa71915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should not be terminated in the first place.

Because Baby Girl is classified in this way, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that certain provisions of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 required her to be taken, at the age of 27 months, from the only parents she had ever known and handed over to her biological father, who had attempted to relinquish his parental rights and who had no prior contact with the child.  The provisions of the federal statute at issue here do not demand this result.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, we hold that \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71912(f)\xe2\x80\x94which bars involuntary termination of a parent\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the absence of a heightened showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from the parent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d of the child\xe2\x80\x94does not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never had custody of the child.  We further hold that \xc2\xa71912(d)\xe2\x80\x94which conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to prevent the \xe2\x80\x9cbreakup of the Indian family\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is inapplicable when, as here, the parent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never had custody of the child.  Finally, we clarify that \xc2\xa71915(a), which provides placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no other eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child.  We accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), \n\n92Stat.\n3069,\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71901\xe2\x80\x931963, was the product of rising concern in the mid-1970\xe2\x80\x99s over the consequences to In- dian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually in non-Indian homes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.

This \xe2\x80\x9cwholesale removal of Indian children from their homes\xe2\x80\x9d prompted Congress to enact the ICWA, which establishes federal standards that govern state-court child custody proceedings involving Indian children.

First, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny party seeking\xe2\x80\x9d an involuntary termination of parental rights to an Indian child under state law must demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9cactive efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71912(d).  Second, a state court may not involuntarily terminate parental rights to an Indian child \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71912(f).  Third, with respect to adoptive placements for an Indian child under state law, \xe2\x80\x9ca preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child\xe2\x80\x99s extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child\xe2\x80\x99s tribe; or (3) other Indian families.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71915(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, Birth Mother (who is predominantly Hispanic) and Biological Father (who is a member of the Cherokee Nation) became engaged in December 2008.  One month later, Birth Mother informed Biological Father, who lived about four hours away, that she was pregnant.  After learning of the pregnancy, Biological Father asked Birth Mother to move up the date of the wedding.  He also refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married.  The couple\xe2\x80\x99s relationship deteriorated, and Birth Mother broke off the engagement in May 2009.  In June, Birth Mother sent Biological Father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or re- linquish his parental rights.  Biological Father responded via text message that he relinquished his rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBirth Mother then decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption.  Because Birth Mother believed that Biological Father had Cherokee Indian heritage, her attorney contacted the Cherokee Nation to determine whether Biological Father was formally enrolled.  The inquiry letter misspelled Biological Father\xe2\x80\x99s first name and incorrectly stated his birthday, and the Cherokee Nation responded that, based on the information provided, it could not verify Biological Father\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the tribal records.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWorking through a private adoption agency, Birth Mother selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South Carolina, to adopt Baby Girl.  Adoptive Couple supported Birth Mother both emotionally and financially throughout her pregnancy.  Adoptive Couple was present at Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s birth in Oklahoma on September 15, 2009, and Adoptive Father even cut the umbilical cord.  The next morning, Birth Mother signed forms relinquishing her parental rights and consenting to the adoption.

The court then held that two separate provisions of the ICWA barred the termination of Biological Father\xe2\x80\x99s parental rights.  First, the court held that Adoptive Couple had not shown that \xe2\x80\x9cactive efforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71912(d); see also id., at 647\xe2\x80\x93648, 731 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 562.  Second, the court concluded that Adoptive Couple had not shown that Biological Father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccustody of Baby Girl would result in serious emotional or physical harm to her beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 648\xe2\x80\x93649, 731 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 562\xe2\x80\x93563 (citing \xc2\xa71912(f)).  Finally, the court stated that, even if it had decided to terminate Biological Father\xe2\x80\x99s parental rights, \xc2\xa71915(a)\xe2\x80\x99s adoption- placement preferences would have applied.  Id., at 655\xe2\x80\x93657, 731 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 566\xe2\x80\x93567.

The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d therefore refers to custody that a parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past).

But it would be absurd to think that Congress enacted a provision that permits termination of a custodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s rights, while simultaneously prohibiting termination of a noncustodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  If the statute draws any distinction between custodial and noncustodial parents, that distinction surely does not provide greater protection for noncustodial parents.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur reading of \xc2\xa71912(f) comports with the statutory text demonstrating that the primary mischief the ICWA was designed to counteract was the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian families due to the cultural insensitivity and biases of social workers and state courts.  The statutory text expressly highlights the primary problem that the statute was intended to solve: \xe2\x80\x9can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families [were being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71901(4) (emphasis added); see also \xc2\xa71902 (explaining that the ICWA establishes \xe2\x80\x9cminimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Holyfield, 490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32\xe2\x80\x9334.  And if the legislative history of the ICWA is thought to be relevant, it further underscores that the Act was primarily intended to stem the unwarranted removal of Indian children from intact Indian families.  See, e.g., H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

In sum, when, as here, the adoption of an Indian child is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights, the ICWA\xe2\x80\x99s primary goal of preventing the unwarranted removal of Indian children and the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent fails to dispute that nonbinding guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) shortly after the ICWA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment demonstrate that the BIA envisioned that \xc2\xa71912(f)\xe2\x80\x99s standard would apply only to termination of a custodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s rights.

As the State Supreme Court read \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71912(d) and (f), a biological Indian father could abandon his child in utero and refuse any support for the birth mother\xe2\x80\x94perhaps contributing to the mother\xe2\x80\x99s decision to put the child up for adoption\xe2\x80\x94and then could play his ICWA trump card at the eleventh hour to override the mother\xe2\x80\x99s decision and the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.  If this were possible, many prospective adoptive parents would surely pause before adopting any child who might possibly qualify as an Indian under the ICWA.  Such an interpretation would raise equal protection concerns, but the plain text of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71912(f) and (d) makes clear that neither provision applies in the present context.  Nor do \xc2\xa71915(a)\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable adoption preferences apply when no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child.

First, the statute does not directly explain how to treat an absentee Indian father who had next-to-no involvement with his child in the first few months of her life.  That category of fathers may include some who would prove highly unsuitable parents, some who would be suitable, and a range of others in between.  Most of those who fall within that category seem to fall outside the scope of the language of 25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71912(d) and (f).  Thus, while I agree that the better reading of the statute is, as the majority concludes, to exclude most of those fathers, ante, at 8, 12, I also understand the risk that, from a policy perspective, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation could prove to exclude too many.

Thus, this case does not involve a father with visitation rights or a father who has paid \xe2\x80\x9call of his child support obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  See post, at 13.  Neither does it involve special circumstances such as a father who was deceived about the existence of the child or a father who was prevented from supporting his child.  See post, at 13 n.\xc2\xa08.  The Court need not, and in my view does not, now decide whether or how \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71912(d) and (f) apply where those circumstances are present.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, other statutory provisions not now before us may nonetheless prove relevant in cases of this kind.  Section 1915(a) grants an adoptive \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c(1) a member of the child\xe2\x80\x99s extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child\xe2\x80\x99s tribe; or (3) other Indian families . . . . in the absence of good cause to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Further, \xc2\xa71915(c) allows the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian child\xe2\x80\x99s tribe\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a different order of preference by resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Could these provisions allow an absentee father to re-enter the special statutory order of preference with support from the tribe, and subject to a court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause?\xe2\x80\x9d  I raise, but do not here try to answer, the question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970753">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93399\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tADOPTIVE COUPLE, PETITIONERS v.

The ICWA defines \xe2\x80\x9cIndian child\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71903(4).  As relevant, the ICWA defines \xe2\x80\x9cchild custody proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71903(1), to include \xe2\x80\x9cadoptive placement,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9cthe permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71903(1)(iv), and \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of parental rights,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9cany action resulting in the termination of the parent-child relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71903(1)(ii).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe ICWA restricts a state court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to terminate the parental rights of an Indian parent in two relevant ways.  Section 1912(f) prohibits a state court from involuntarily terminating parental rights \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1912(d) prohibits a state court from terminating parental rights until the court is satisfied \xe2\x80\x9cthat active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\xe2\x80\x9d  A third provision creates specific placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children, which favor placement with Indians over other adoptive families.  \xc2\xa71915(a).  Operating together, these requirements often lead to different outcomes than would result under state law.  That is precisely what happened here.  See ante, at 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undisputed that, had Baby Girl not been 3/256 Cherokee, Biological Father would have had no right to object to her adoption under South Carolina law\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe ICWA recognizes States\xe2\x80\x99 inherent \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71901(5), but asserts that federal regulation is necessary because States \xe2\x80\x9chave often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards pre- ailing in Indian communities and families,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  However, Congress may regulate areas of traditional state concern only if the Constitution grants it such power.  Admt. 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people\xe2\x80\x9d).  The threshold question, then, is whether the Constitution grants Congress power to override state custody law whenever an Indian is involved.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe ICWA asserts that the Indian Commerce Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03, and \xe2\x80\x9cother constitutional authority\xe2\x80\x9d provides Congress with \xe2\x80\x9cplenary power over Indian affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71901(1).

At the time of the founding, the Clause was understood to reserve to the States general police powers with respect to Indians who were citizens of the several States.  The Clause instead conferred on Congress the much narrower power to regulate trade with Indian tribes\xe2\x80\x94that is, Indians who had not been incorporated into the body-politic of any State.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore the Revolution, most Colonies adopted their own regulations governing Indian trade.  See Natelson 219, and n. 121 (citing colonial laws).  Such regulations were necessary because colonial traders all too often abused their Indian trading partners, through fraud, exorbitant prices, extortion, and physical invasion of Indian territory, among other things.  See 1 F. Prucha, The Great Father 18\xe2\x80\x9320 (1984) (hereinafter Prucha); Natelson 220, and n. 122.  These abuses sometimes provoked violent Indian retaliation.  See Prucha 20.  To mitigate these conflicts, most Colonies extensively regulated traders engaged in commerce with Indian tribes.  See e.g., Ordinance to Regulate Indian Affairs, Statutes of South Carolina (Aug. 31, 1751), in 16 Early American Indian Documents: Treaties and Laws, 1607\xe2\x80\x931789, pp. 331\xe2\x80\x93334 (A.

Cont\xe2\x80\x99l Cong. 195\xe2\x80\x93199 (W. Ford ed. 1905).  Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was not enacted, but in November 1775, Congress empowered a committee to draft regulations for the Indian trade.  3 id., at 364, 366.  On July 12, 1776, the committee submitted a draft of the Articles of Confederation to Congress, which incorporated many of Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s proposals.  5 id., at 545, 546, n.\xc2\xa01.  The draft prohibited States from waging offensive war against the Indians without congressional authorization and granted Congress the exclusive power to acquire land from the Indians out-side state boundaries, once those boundaries had been es-tablished.  Id., at 549.  This version also gave Congress \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole and exclusive Right and Power of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Regulating the Trade, and managing all Affairs with the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id. at 550.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn August 20, 1776, the Committee of the Whole presented to Congress a revised draft, which provided Congress with \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole and exclusive right and power of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. regulating the trade, and managing all affairs with the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 672, 681\xe2\x80\x93682.  Some delegates feared that the Articles gave Congress excessive power to in-terfere with States\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over affairs with Indians residing within state boundaries.  After further deliberation, the final result was a clause that included a broad grant of congressional authority with two significant exceptions: \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the States, provided that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Articles of Confederation, Art. IX, cl. 4.  As a result, Congress retained exclusive jurisdiction over Indian affairs outside the borders of the States; the States retained exclusive jurisdiction over relations with Member-Indians;\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and Congress and the States \xe2\x80\x9cex-ercise[d] concurrent jurisdiction over transactions with tribal Indians within state boundaries, but congressional decisions would have to be in compliance with local law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Natelson 230.  The drafting of the Articles of Confederation reveals the delegates\xe2\x80\x99 concern with protecting the power of the States to regulate Indian persons who were politically incorporated into the States.  This concern for state power reemerged during the drafting of the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe drafting history of the Constitutional Convention also supports a limited construction of the Indian Commerce Clause.  On July 24, 1787, the convention elected a drafting committee\xe2\x80\x94the Committee of Detail\xe2\x80\x94and charged it to \xe2\x80\x9creport a Constitution conformable to the Res-olutions passed by the Convention.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p.106 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (J. Madison).  During the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations, John Rutledge, the chairman, suggested incorporating an In-dian affairs power into the Constitution.  Id., at 137, n.\xc2\xa06, 143.  The first draft reported back to the convention, however, provided Congress with authority \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 181 (Madison) (Aug. 6, 1787), but did not include any specific Indian affairs clause.  On August 18, James Madison proposed that the Federal Government be granted several additional powers, including the power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as without the limits of the U. States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 324 (J. Madison) (emphasis added).  On August 22, Rutledge delivered the Committee of Detail\xe2\x80\x99s second report, which modified Madison\xe2\x80\x99s proposed clause.  The Committee proposed to add to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States\xe2\x80\x9d the words, \xe2\x80\x9cand with Indians, within the Limits of any State, not subject to the laws thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 366\xe2\x80\x93367 (Journal).  The Committee\xe2\x80\x99s version, which echoed the Articles of Confederation, was far narrower than Madison\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.  On August 31, the revised draft was submitted to a Committee of Eleven for further action.  Id., at 473 (Journal), 481 (J. Madison).  That Committee recommended adding to the Commerce Clause the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cand with the Indian tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 493, which the Convention ultimately adopted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is, thus, clear that the Framers of the Constitution were alert to the difference between the power to regulate trade with the Indians and the power to regulate all In-dian affairs.  By limiting Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to the former, the Framers declined to grant Congress the same broad powers over Indian affairs conferred by the Articles of Confederation.  See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1069, 1090 (2004).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDuring the ratification debates, opposition to the Indian Commerce Clause was nearly nonexistent.  See Natelson 248 (noting that Robert Yates, a New York Anti-Federalist was \xe2\x80\x9calmost the only writer who objected to any part [of\xc2\xa0] of the Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x94a clear indication that its scope was understood to be fairly narrow\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  Given the Anti-Federalists\xe2\x80\x99 vehement opposition to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s other grants of power to the Federal Government, this silence is revealing.  The ratifiers almost certainly understood the Clause to confer a relatively modest power on Congress\xe2\x80\x94namely, the power to regulate trade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders.  And this feature of the Constitution was welcomed by Federalists and Anti-Federalists alike due to the considerable interest in expanding trade with such Indian tribes.  See, e.g., The Federalist No. 42, at 265 (J. Madison) (praising the Constitution for removing the obstacles that had existed under the Articles of Confederation to federal control over \xe2\x80\x9ctrade with Indians\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); 3 J.

Saladino eds. 2012)  (conceding that there must be a standing army for some purposes, including \xe2\x80\x9ctrade with Indians\xe2\x80\x9d).

First, the statute deals with \xe2\x80\x9cchild custody proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71903(1), not \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was enacted in response to concerns that \xe2\x80\x9can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families [were] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71901(4).  The perceived problem was that many Indian children were \xe2\x80\x9cplaced in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This problem, however, had nothing to do with commerce.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the portions of the ICWA at issue here do not regulate Indian tribes as tribes.  Sections 1912(d) and (f\xc2\xa0), and \xc2\xa71915(a) apply to all child custody proceedings involving an Indian child, regardless of whether an Indian tribe is involved.  This case thus does not directly implicate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to \xe2\x80\x9clegislate in respect to Indian tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Lara, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193, \n200 (2004)\n (emphasis added).  Baby Girl was never domiciled on an Indian Reservation, and the Cherokee Nation had no jurisdiction over her.  Cf. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30\n\xe2\x80\x9354 (1989) (holding that the Indian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings, even though the children were born off the reservation, because the children were \xe2\x80\x9cdomiciled\xe2\x80\x9d on the reservation for purposes of the ICWA).  Although Birth Father is a registered member of The Cherokee Nation, he did not live on a reservation either.  He was, thus, subject to the laws of the State in which he resided (Oklahoma) and of the State where his daughter resided during the custody proceedings (South Carolina).  Nothing in the In-dian Commerce Clause permits Congress to enact spe- cial laws applicable to Birth Father merely because of his status as an Indian.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause adoption proceedings like this one involve neither \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d there is simply no constitutional basis for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of authority over such proceedings.  Also, the notion that Congress can direct state courts to apply different rules of evidence and procedure merely because a person of Indian descent is involved raises absurd possibilities.  Such plenary power would allow Congress to dictate specific rules of criminal procedure for state-court prosecutions against Indian defendants.  Likewise, it would allow Congress to substitute federal law for state law when contract disputes involve Indians.  But the Constitution does not grant Congress power to override state law whenever that law happens to be applied to Indians.

I reject the conclusion that the Court draws from the words \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d in 25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C \xc2\xa71912(f) not because \xe2\x80\x9cliteralness may strangle meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d see post, at 11, but because there is no reason that \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to custody in the past rather than custody in the future.  I read the provision as requiring the court to satisfy itself (beyond a reasonable doubt) not merely that initial or temporary custody is not \xe2\x80\x9clikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child,\xe2\x80\x9d but that continued custody is not likely to do so.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed. 1950) (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rotracted in time or space, esp. without interruption; constant\xe2\x80\x9d).

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans the rights of parenthood.  It has been the constant practice of the common law to respect the entitlement of those who bring a child into the world to raise that child.  We do not inquire whether leaving a child with his parents is \xe2\x80\x9cin the best interest of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  It sometimes is not; he would be better off raised by someone else.  But parents have their rights, no less than children do.  This father wants to raise his daughter, and the statute amply protects his right to do so.  There is no reason in law or policy to dilute that protection. \n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970756">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93399\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tADOPTIVE COUPLE, PETITIONERS v.

In truth, however, the path from the text of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to the result the Court reaches is anything but clear, and its result anything but right.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reader\xe2\x80\x99s first clue that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly straightforward reasoning is flawed is that not all Members who adopt its interpretation believe it is compelled by the text of the statute, see ante, at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring); nor are they all willing to accept the consequences it will necessarily have beyond the specific factual sce- nario confronted here, see ante, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring).  The second clue is that the majority begins its analysis by plucking out of context a single phrase from the last clause of the last subsection of the relevant provision, and then builds its entire argument upon it.  That is not how we ordinarily read statutes.  The third clue is that the major- ity openly professes its aversion to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 explicitly stated purpose in enacting the statute.  The majority ex- presses concern that reading the Act to mean what it says will make it more difficult to place Indian children in adoptive homes, see ante, at 14, 16, but the Congress that enacted the statute announced its intent to stop \xe2\x80\x9can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families [from being] broken up\xe2\x80\x9d by, among other things, a trend of \xe2\x80\x9cplac[ing] [Indian children] in non-Indian .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. adoptive homes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71901(4).  Policy disagreement with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judg- ment is not a valid reason for this Court to distort the pro- visions of the Act.  Unlike the majority, I cannot adopt a reading of ICWA that is contrary to both its text and its stated purpose.

Working back to front, the majority then concludes that \xc2\xa71912(d), tainted by its association with \xc2\xa71912(f), is also inapplicable; in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, a family bond that does not take custodial form is not a family bond worth preserving from \xe2\x80\x9cbreakup.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because there are apparently no limits on the contaminating power of this single phrase, the majority does not stop there.  Under its reading, \xc2\xa71903(9), which makes biological fathers \xe2\x80\x9cparent[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under this federal statute (and where, again, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued custody\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear), has substantive force only when a birth father has physical or state-recognized legal custody of his daughter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen it excludes noncustodial biological fathers from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive protections, this textually backward reading misapprehends ICWA\xe2\x80\x99s structure and scope.  Moreover, notwithstanding the majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the per- ceived parental shortcomings of Birth Father, its rea- soning necessarily extends to all Indian parents who have never had custody of their children, no matter how fully those parents have embraced the financial and emotional responsibilities of parenting.  The majority thereby transforms a statute that was intended to provide uniform federal standards for child custody proceedings involving Indian children and their biological parents into an illogical piecemeal scheme.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBetter to start at the beginning and consider the operation of the statute as a whole.

Congress rec- ognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71901(3), and it found that this resource was threatened.  State authorities insufficiently sensitive to \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families\xe2\x80\x9d were breaking up Indian families and moving Indian children to non-Indian homes and institutions.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71901(4)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  As \xc2\xa71901(4) makes clear, and as this Court recognized in Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30, \n33 (1989)\n, adoptive placements of Indian children with non-Indian families contributed significantly to the overall problem.  See \xc2\xa71901(4) (finding that \xe2\x80\x9can alarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children are placed in non-Indian .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. adoptive homes\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with these findings, Congress declared its purpose \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards\xe2\x80\x9d applicable to child custody proceedings involving Indian children.  \xc2\xa71902.  Section 1903 then goes on to establish the reach of these protections through its defi- nitional provisions.  For present purposes, two of these definitions are crucial to understanding the statute\xe2\x80\x99s full scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, ICWA defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d broadly to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany biological parent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of an Indian child or any In- dian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71903(9).  It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an \xe2\x80\x9cIndian child\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute, see \xc2\xa71903(4); ante, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01, and Birth Father consequently qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  The statutory definition of parent \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not include the unwed father where paternity has not been acknowledged or established,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71903(9), but Birth Father\xe2\x80\x99s biological paternity has never been questioned by any party and was confirmed by a DNA test during the state court proceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a (Sealed).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners and Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s guardian ad litem devote many pages of briefing to arguing that the term \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d should be defined with reference to the law of the State in which an ICWA child custody proceeding takes place.  See Brief for Petitioners 19\xe2\x80\x9329; Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 32\xe2\x80\x9341.  These arguments, however, are inconsistent with our recognition in Holyfield that Congress intended the critical terms of the statute to have uniform federal definitions.  See 490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  It is therefore unsurprising, although far from unimportant, that the majority assumes for the purposes of its analysis that Birth Father is an ICWA \xe2\x80\x9cparent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 7.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cchild custody proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d includes not only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adoptive placement[s],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98preadoptive placement[s],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98foster care placement[s],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98termination of parental rights\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings.  \xc2\xa71903(1).  This last category encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cany action resulting in the termination of the parent-child relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71903(1)(ii) (emphasis added).  So far, then, it is clear that Birth Father has a federally recognized status as Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d and that his \xe2\x80\x9cparent-child relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with her is subject to the protections of the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese protections are numerous.  Had Birth Father petitioned to remove this proceeding to tribal court, for example, the state court would have been obligated to transfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or good cause to the contrary.  See \xc2\xa71911(b).  Any voluntary consent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s adoption would have been invalid unless written and executed before a judge and would have been revocable up to the time a final decree of adoption was entered.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71913(a), (c).  And \xc2\xa71912, the center of the dispute here, sets forth procedural and substantive standards applicable in \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary proceeding[s] in a State court,\xe2\x80\x9d including foster care placements of Indian children and termination of paren- tal rights proceedings.  \xc2\xa71912(a).

Although the Constitution does not compel the protection of a biological father\xe2\x80\x99s parent-child relationship until he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has nevertheless recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe biological connection .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lehr v. Robertson, \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 248, \n262 (1983)\n.

Nothing in subsections (a) through (d) suggests a limitation on the types of parental relationships that are protected by any of the provisions of \xc2\xa71912, and there is nothing in the structure of \xc2\xa71912 that would lead a reader to expect subsection (e) or (f) to introduce any such qualification.  Indeed, both subsections, in their opening lines, refer back to the prior provisions of \xc2\xa71912 with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin such proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  This language indicates, quite logically, that in actions where subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply, (e) and (f) apply too.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t All this, and still the most telling textual evidence is yet to come: The text of the subsection begins by announcing, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered\xe2\x80\x9d unless the specified evidentiary showing is made.

If one refers back to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definitional section, this conclusion is not surprising.

A court applying \xc2\xa71912(f) where the parent does not have pre-existing custody should, as Birth Father argues, determine whether the party seeking ter- mination of parental rights has established that the continuation of the parent-child relationship will result in \xe2\x80\x9cserious emotional or physical damage to the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority is willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that Birth Father is a \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of ICWA.

The majority repeatedly passes over the term \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of parental rights\xe2\x80\x9d that, as defined by \xc2\xa71903, clearly encompasses an action aimed at severing Birth Father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cparent-child relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with Baby Girl.  The majority chooses instead to focus on phrases not statutorily defined that it then uses to exclude Birth Father from the benefits of his parental status.

The State of Arizona, for example, requires that notice of an adoption petition be given to all \xe2\x80\x9cpotential father[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and that they be informed of their \xe2\x80\x9cright to seek custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz.

See, e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Adoption of Tobias D., 2012 Me. 45, \xc2\xb627, 40 A. 3d 990, 999 (recognizing that award of custody of 2\xc2\xbd-year-old child to biological father under applicable state law once paternity is established will result in the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult and pain- ful\xe2\x80\x9d necessity of \xe2\x80\x9cremoving the child from the only home he has ever known\xe2\x80\x9d).  On the other hand, these rules recognize that biological fathers have a valid interest in a relationship with their child.  See supra, at 6.  And children have a reciprocal interest in knowing their biological parents.  See Santosky, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 760\xe2\x80\x93761, n.\xc2\xa011 (describing the foreclosure of a newborn child\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9cever know his natural parents\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9clos[s] [that] cannot be measured\xe2\x80\x9d).  These rules also reflect the understanding that the biological bond between a parent and a child is a strong foundation on which a stable and caring relationship may be built.  Many jurisdictions apply a custodial preference for a fit natural parent over a party lacking this biological link.  See, e.g., Ex\xc2\xa0parte Terry, 494 So.\xc2\xa02d 628, 632 (Ala. 1986); Appeal of H.\xc2\xa0R., 581 A.\xc2\xa02d 1141, 1177 (D.\xc2\xa0C. 1990) (opinion of Ferren, J.); Stuhr v.

Some States, like South Carolina, have opted to hew to the con- stitutional baseline established by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prece- dents and do not require a biological father\xe2\x80\x99s consent to adoption unless he has provided financial support during pregnancy.  See Quilloin v. Walcott, \n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246\n\xe2\x80\x93256 (1978); Lehr, 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 261.  Other States, how- ever, have decided to give the rights of biological fathers more robust protection and to afford them consent rights on the basis of their biological link to the child.  At the time that ICWA was passed, as noted, over one-fourth of States did so.  See supra, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tICWA, on a straightforward reading of the statute, is consistent with the law of those States that protected, and protect, birth fathers\xe2\x80\x99 rights more vigorously.  This reading can hardly be said to generate an anomaly.  ICWA, as all acknowledge, was \xe2\x80\x9cthe product of rising concern .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [about] abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian children from their families.\xe2\x80\x9d  Holyfield, 490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32.  It stands to reason that the Act would not render the legal status of an Indian father\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with his biological child fragile, but would instead grant it a degree of protection commensurate with the more robust state-law standards.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F14" name="T14">\n\t\t\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority also protests that a contrary result to the one it reaches would interfere with the adoption of Indian children.  Ante, at 14, 16.  This claim is the most perplexing of all.  A central purpose of ICWA is to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the stability and security of Indian .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. families,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71902, in part by countering the trend of placing \xe2\x80\x9can alarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71901(4).  The Act accomplishes this goal by, first, protecting the familial bonds of Indian parents and children, see supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x9312; and, second, establishing placement preferences should an adoption take place, see \xc2\xa71915(a).  ICWA does not interfere with the adoption of Indian children except to the extent that it attempts to avert the necessity of adoptive placement and makes adoptions of Indian children by non-Indian families less likely.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority may consider this scheme unwise.  But no principle of construction licenses a court to interpret a statute with a view to averting the very consequences Congress expressly stated it was trying to bring about.  Instead, it is the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of the evi- dent legislative purpose in enacting the law in question.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.

Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  We may not, however, give effect only to congressional goals we designate \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d while casting aside others classed as \xe2\x80\x9csecondary\xe2\x80\x9d; we must apply the entire statute Congress has written.  While there are indications that central among Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concerns in enacting ICWA was the removal of Indian children from homes in which Indian parents or other guardians had custody of them, see, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71901(4), 1902, Con- gress also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71901(3).  As we observed in Holyfield, ICWA protects not only Indian parents\xe2\x80\x99 interests but also those of Indian tribes.  See 490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 34, 52.  A tribe\xe2\x80\x99s interest in its next generation of citizens is adversely affected by the placement of Indian children in homes with no connection to the tribe, whether or not those children were initially in the custody of an Indian parent.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F15" name="T15">\n\t\t\t\t\t15\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on \xe2\x80\x9cintact\xe2\x80\x9d families, ante, at 10, begs the question of what Congress set out to accomplish with ICWA.  In an ideal world, perhaps all parents would be perfect.  They would live up to their parental responsibilities by providing the fullest possible financial and emotional support to their children.  They would never suffer mental health problems, lose their jobs, struggle with substance dependency, or encounter any of the other multitudinous personal crises that can make it difficult to meet these responsibilities.  In an ideal world parents would never become estranged and leave their children caught in the middle.  But we do not live in such a world.  Even happy families do not always fit the custodial-parent mold for which the majority would reserve IWCA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive protections; unhappy families all too often do not.  They are families nonetheless.  Congress understood as much.  ICWA\xe2\x80\x99s definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of parental rights\xe2\x80\x9d provided in \xc2\xa71903 sweep broadly.  They should be honored.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority does not rely on the theory pressed by petitioners and the guardian ad litem that the canon of constitutional avoidance compels the conclusion that ICWA is inapplicable here.  See Brief for Petitioners 43\xe2\x80\x9351; Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 48\xe2\x80\x9358.

But the majority nevertheless offers the suggestion that a contrary result would create an equal protection problem.  Ibid.  Cf. Brief for Petitioners 44\xe2\x80\x9347; Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 53\xe2\x80\x9355.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is difficult to make sense of this suggestion in light of our precedents, which squarely hold that classifications based on Indian tribal membership are not impermissible racial classifications.  See United States v. Antelope, \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 641\n\xe2\x80\x93647 (1977); Morton v. Mancari, \n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535\n\xe2\x80\x93554 (1974).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s repeated, analytically unnecessary references to the fact that Baby Girl is 3/256 Cherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its intimation that the statute may violate the Equal Protection Clause as applied here.  See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante, at 16 (stating that ICWA \xe2\x80\x9cwould put certain vulner- able children at a great disadvantage solely because an ancestor\xe2\x80\x94even a remote one\xe2\x80\x94was an Indian\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  I see no ground for this Court to second-guess the membership requirements of federally recognized Indian tribes, which are independent political entities.  See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, \n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49, \n72, n. \n32 (1978)\n. I am particularly averse to doing so when the Federal Government requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for official recognition, to make \xe2\x80\x9cdescen[t] from a historical Indian tribe\xe2\x80\x9d a condition of membership.  25 CFR \xc2\xa783.7(e) (2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of this issue, in the end, does no more than create a lingering mood of disapprobation of the criteria for membership adopted by the Cherokee Nation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an \xe2\x80\x9cIndian child\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute.  Its hints at lurking constitutional problems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its statutory analysis, and accordingly need not detain us any longer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause I would affirm the South Carolina Supreme Court on the ground that \xc2\xa71912 bars the termination of Birth Father\xe2\x80\x99s parental rights, I would not reach the question of the applicability of the adoptive placement preferences of \xc2\xa71915.  I note, however, that the majority does not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on remand, Baby Girl\xe2\x80\x99s paternal grandparents or other members of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for adoption of Baby Girl.  If these parties do so, and if on remand Birth Father\xe2\x80\x99s parental rights are terminated so that an adoption becomes possible, they will then be entitled to consideration under the order of preference established in \xc2\xa71915.  The majority cannot rule prospectively that \xc2\xa71915 would not apply to an adoption petition that has not yet been filed.  Indeed, the statute applies \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71915(a) (emphasis added), and contains no temporal qualifications.  It would indeed be an odd result for this Court, in the name of the child\xe2\x80\x99s best in- terests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro- ceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her paternal grandparents, who may have well-established relationships with her.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority opinion turns \xc2\xa71912 upside down, reading it from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is manifestly contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express purpose in enacting ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian parents and their children and, more broadly, Indian tribes\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with the future citizens who are \xe2\x80\x9cvital to [their] continued existence and integrity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71901(3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority casts Birth Father as responsible for the painful circumstances in this case, suggesting that he intervened \xe2\x80\x9cat the eleventh hour to override the mother\xe2\x80\x99s decision and the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 16.  I have no wish to minimize the trauma of removing a 27-month-old child from her adoptive family.

I expect that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s inexact use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cabandon[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d will sow confusion, because it is a commonly used term of art in state family law that does not have a uniform meaning from State to State.

Ibid.  Tellingly, the major-ity has nothing to say about \xc2\xa71912(f), despite the fact that its interpretation of that provision is not limited in a similar way.  In any event, this example by no means exhausts the class of semiprotected ICWA parents that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion creates.  It also includes, for example, biological fathers who have not yet established a relationship with their child because the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother never informed them of the pregnancy, see, e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Termination of Parental Rights of Biological Parents of Baby Boy W., 1999 OK 74, 988 P.\xc2\xa02d 1270, told them falsely that the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or termination, see, e.g., A Child\xe2\x80\x99s Hope, LLC v.

And it includes biological fathers who did not contribute to pregnancy expenses because they were unable to do so, whether because the father lacked sufficient means, the expenses were covered by a third party, or the birth mother did not pass on the relevant bills.
