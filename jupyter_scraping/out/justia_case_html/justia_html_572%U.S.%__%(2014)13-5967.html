His counsel was ready; the State was not.  When the court swore in the jury and invited the State to present its first witness, the State declined to present any evidence.  So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty verdict, and the court granted it.  The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted its motion for a continuance.  The question is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to appeal in the hope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing the State\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never attached because Martinez \xe2\x80\x9cwas never at risk of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 IL 113475, \xc2\xb639, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 215, 224.

The State subpoenaed both men four days later, and the court rescheduled Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s trial to September 28.  But the State sought another continuance, shortly before that date, because it still had not found Binion and Scott.  The court rescheduled the trial to November 9, and the State reissued subpoenas.  But November 9 came and went (the court continued the case when Martinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually delayed to the following March 29.  In early February, the State yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott.  When March 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an-other continuance.  It reset the trial date for May 17 and ordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.

At 8:30, when the trial was set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.  The court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a complete jury had been empaneled and told the State that it could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to dismiss its case.  When Binion and Scott still had not shown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to call the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing the jury a bit longer.  But when all these delays had run out, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight.  The State filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing that it was \xe2\x80\x9cunable to proceed\xe2\x80\x9d without Binion and Scott.  Tr. 7.

Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwas \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9csubjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 IL 113475, \xc2\xb624, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the court concluded, Martinez \xe2\x80\x9cwas never at risk of conviction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and jeopardy therefore did not attach\xe2\x80\x94because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State indicated it would not participate prior to the jury being sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 IL 113475, \xc2\xb639, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 224.

She explained that under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the State could \xe2\x80\x9cunilaterally render a trial a \xe2\x80\x98sham\xe2\x80\x99 simply by refusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., \xc2\xb664, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 229.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case presents two issues.

As Crist explains, \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise point at which jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been open to argument before this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Downum v. United States, \n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 734\n [(1963)],\xe2\x80\x9d in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a second prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had ended just after the jury had been sworn and before any testimony had been taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 35.  But Downum put any such argument to rest: Its holding \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy attaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit authority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crist, supra, at 35.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in suggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other than a bright line at which jeopardy attaches.  It relied on Serfass, understanding that case to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthat in assessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9crigid, mechanical\xe2\x80\x9d rules\xe2\x80\x99 should not be applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 IL 113475, \xc2\xb624, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 222.  Under Serfass, the court reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defendant was as a functional matter \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9csubjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 IL 113475, \xc2\xb624, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 222.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the determination of when jeopardy has attached.  As to that question, it states the same bright-line rule as every other case: Jeopardy attaches when \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant is \xe2\x80\x98put to trial,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and in a jury trial, that is \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a jury is empaneled and sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 388.  Indeed, Serfass explicitly rejects a functional approach to the question whether jeopardy has attached.  See id., at 390 (refuting the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constructiv[e] jeopardy had attached\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss the indictment, which the defendant characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Serfass Court acknowledged \xe2\x80\x9cthat we have disparaged \xe2\x80\x98rigid, mechanical\xe2\x80\x99 rules in the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But it was referring to the case of Illinois v. Somerville, \n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 458 (1973)\n, in which we declined to apply \xe2\x80\x9crigid, mechanical\xe2\x80\x9d reasoning in answering a very different question: not whether jeopardy had attached, but whether the manner in which it terminated (by mistrial) barred the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retrial.  Id., at 467.  By contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy attaches at the start of a trial is \xe2\x80\x9cby no means a mere technicality, nor is it a \xe2\x80\x98rigid, mechanical\xe2\x80\x99 rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 391.  And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about when a \xe2\x80\x9ctrial\xe2\x80\x9d begins.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Illinois Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s error was consequential, for it introduced confusion into what we have consistently treated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeopardy attaches, when the jury is sworn.  We have never suggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x94that jeopardy may not have attached where, under the circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was not genuinely at risk of conviction.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Martinez was subjected to jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d how- ever, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 390.  The remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in such a manner that the defendant may not be retried.  See 6 LaFave \xc2\xa725.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which retrial is and is not allowed).  Here, there is no doubt that Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his retrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged offenses.  \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that \xe2\x80\x98[a] verdict of acquittal .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could not be reviewed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Martin Linen, supra, at 571.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Evans v. Michigan, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  And the trial court clearly made such a ruling here.  After the State declined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel moved for \xe2\x80\x9cdirected findings of not guilty to both counts,\xe2\x80\x9d and the court \xe2\x80\x9cgrant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 21.  That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence cannot support a conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise.  It first opined that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeopardy, the [trial] court\xe2\x80\x99s entry of directed verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquittals.\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 IL 113475, \xc2\xb640, 990 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 225.  But the premise of that argument is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the reasons given above.  The court went on to \xe2\x80\x9cnote that, in directing findings of not guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d the trial court \xe2\x80\x9creferred to its action as a \xe2\x80\x98dismissal\xe2\x80\x99 rather than an acquittal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Under our precedents, however, that is immaterial: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have emphasized that what constitutes an \xe2\x80\x98acquittal\xe2\x80\x99 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s action\xe2\x80\x9d; it turns on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martin Linen, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur decision turns not on the form of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s action, but rather whether it \xe2\x80\x98serve[s]\xe2\x80\x99 substantive \xe2\x80\x98purposes\xe2\x80\x99 or procedural ones\xe2\x80\x9d); United States v.

On the day of trial, the court was acutely aware of the significance of swearing a jury.  It repeatedly delayed that act to give the State additional time to find its witnesses.  It had previously granted the State a number of continuances for the same purpose.  See supra, at 2.  And, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial that it could \xe2\x80\x9cmove to dismiss [its] case\xe2\x80\x9d before the jury was sworn.  Tr. 3.  Had the State accepted that invitation, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from recharging Martinez.  Instead, the State participated in the selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before the jury was sworn.  When the State declined to dismiss its case, it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98took a chance[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. enter[ing] upon the trial of the case without sufficient evidence to convict.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Downum v. United States, \n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 734, \n737 (1963)\n.  Here, the State knew, or should have known, that an acquittal forever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs after jeopardy has attached.  The Illinois Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is understandable, given the significant consequence of the State\xe2\x80\x99s mistake, but it runs directly counter to our precedents and to the protection conferred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
