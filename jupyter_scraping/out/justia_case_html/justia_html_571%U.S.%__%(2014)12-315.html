When Air Wisconsin stopped flying from Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s home base on aircraft that he was certified to fly, he needed to become certified on a different type of aircraft to keep his job.  After Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to gain certification, Air Wisconsin agreed to give him a fourth and final chance.  But he performed poorly during a required training session in a simulator.  Hoeper responded angrily to this failure\xe2\x80\x94raising his voice, tossing his headset, using profanity, and accusing the instructor of \xe2\x80\x9crailroading the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The instructor called an Air Wisconsin manager, who booked Hoeper on a flight from the test location to Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s home in Denver.  Several hours later, the manager discussed Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior with other airline officials.  The officials discussed Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s outburst, his impending termination, the history of assaults by disgruntled airline employees, and the chance that\xe2\x80\x94because Hoeper was a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO), permitted \xe2\x80\x9cto carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa744921(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x94he might be armed.  At the end of the meeting, an airline executive made the decision to notify the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the situation.  The manager who had received the initial report from Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s instructor made the call to the TSA.  During that call, according to the jury, he made two statements: first, that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cwas an FFDO who may be armed\xe2\x80\x9d and that the airline was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm\xe2\x80\x9d; and second, that an \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was terminated today.\xe2\x80\x9d  In response, the TSA removed Hoeper from his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his gun.  Hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to Denver, and Air Wisconsin fired him the next day.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Hoeper sued for defamation in Colorado state court.  Air Wisconsin moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict, relying on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior,\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa744941(a), except where such disclosure is \xe2\x80\x9cmade with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmade with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa744941(b).  The trial court denied the motions and submitted the ATSA immunity question to the jury.  The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.  It held that the trial court erred in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error was harmless.  Laboring under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly, the court held that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity because its statements to the TSA were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        1.\xc2\xa0ATSA immunity may not be denied to materially true statements.

Because the material falsity requirement was settled when the ATSA was enacted, Congress presumably meant to incorporate it into the ATSA\xe2\x80\x99s immunity exception and did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to true statements made recklessly.  This presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of statutory meaning.  Section 44941(b)(1) requires falsity, and \xc2\xa744941(b)(2) simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones.  Denying immunity for substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth, would defeat the purpose of ATSA immunity: to ensure that air carriers and their employees do not hesitate to provide the TSA with needed information.

Hoeper claims that Air Wisconsin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immunity, but Air Wisconsin contended in the state court that ATSA\xe2\x80\x99s immunity exception incorporates the New York Times actual malice standard, which requires material falsity.  And the State Supreme Court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in finding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict.  A court\xe2\x80\x99s deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the record; the jury was instructed only to determine falsity, not materiality; and applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity.

This standard suffices in the ATSA context as well, so long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer.  For purposes of ATSA immunity, a falsehood cannot be material absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.

First, the Court rejects Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Air Wisconsin should have qualified its statement that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cwas an FFDO who may be armed\xe2\x80\x9d by noting that it had no reason to think he actually was armed.  To the extent that Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statement could have been confusing, any such confusion is immaterial, as a reasonable TSA officer\xe2\x80\x94having been told that Hoeper was an FFDO who was upset about losing his job\xe2\x80\x94would have wanted to investigate whether he was armed.  To demand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats.  Second, Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cwas terminated today\xe2\x80\x9d was not materially false.  While Hoeper had not actually been fired at the time of the statement, everyone involved knew that his firing was imminent.  No reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.  Finally, although the details of Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior during the simulator session may be disputed, it would have been correct even under Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s version of the facts for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cblew up\xe2\x80\x9d during the test.  From a reasonable security officer\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, there is no material difference between a statement that Hoeper had \xe2\x80\x9cblown up\xe2\x80\x9d in a professional setting and a statement that he was unstable.  Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s related statement that it was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about [Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s] mental stability\xe2\x80\x9d is no more troubling.  Many of the officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cmental stability,\xe2\x80\x9d but it would be inconsistent with the ATSA\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the TSA could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the airline\xe2\x80\x99s concern.  A statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision, so long as \xe2\x80\x9cthe gist\xe2\x80\x9d of the statement is accurate, Masson, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 517.

To ensure that theTSA would be informed of potential threats, Congress gave airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior.  \xc2\xa744941(a).  But this immunity does not attach to \xe2\x80\x9cany disclosure made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cany disclosure made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744941(b).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The question before us is whether ATSA immunity may be denied under \xc2\xa744941(b) without a determination that a disclosure was materially false.  We hold that it may not.  Because the state courts made no such determination, and because any falsehood in the disclosure here would not have affected a reasonable security officer\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the supposed threat, we reverse the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court.</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        William Hoeper joined Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation as a pilot in 1998.  But by late 2004, Air Wisconsin had stopped operating flights from Denver, Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s home base, on any type of aircraft for which he was certified.  To continue flying for Air Wisconsin out of Denver, Hoeper needed to gain certification on the British Aerospace 146 (BAe-146), an aircraft he had not flown.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to pass a proficiency test.  After the third failure, as he later acknowledged at trial, his employment was \xe2\x80\x9cat [Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 193.  But he and Air Wisconsin entered into an agreement to afford him \xe2\x80\x9cone more opportunity to pass [the] proficiency check.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 426.  The agreement left little doubt that Hoeper would lose his job if he failed again.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        In December 2004, Hoeper flew from Denver to Virginia for simulator training as part of this final test.  During the training, Hoeper failed to cope with a challenging scenario created by the instructor, Mark Schuerman, and the simulator showed the engines \xe2\x80\x9cflam[ing] out\xe2\x80\x9d due to a loss of fuel.  App. 203.  As Schuerman began to tell Hoeper that he \xe2\x80\x9cshould know better,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., Hoeper responded angrily.  He later described what happened:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt this point, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.  I take my headset off and I toss it up on the glare shield. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  [Schuerman] and I exchanged words at the same elevated decibel level.  Mine went something like this: This is a bunch of shit.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.  You are railroading the situation and it\xe2\x80\x99s not realistic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 203\xe2\x80\x93204.</p><p>When Hoeper announced that he wanted to call the legal department of the pilots\xe2\x80\x99 union, Schuerman ended the session so that Hoeper could do so.  Schuerman then re-ported Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior to Patrick Doyle, the Wisconsin-based manager of the BAe-146 fleet.  Doyle booked Hoeper on a United Airlines flight back to Denver.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Several hours after Schuerman\xe2\x80\x99s report, Doyle discussed the situation at Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters with the airline\xe2\x80\x99s Vice President of Operations, Kevin LaWare; its Managing Director of Flight Operations, Scott Orozco; and its Assistant Chief Pilot, Robert Frisch.  LaWare later ex-plained the accretion of his concerns about what Hoeper might do next.  He regarded Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in the simulator as \xe2\x80\x9ca fairly significant outburst,\xe2\x80\x9d of a sort that he \xe2\x80\x9chadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. before.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 276.  And he knew \xe2\x80\x9cit was a given that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s employment was .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. going to be terminated\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of his failure to complete the simulator training.  Id., at 278.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Then, LaWare testified, Orozco mentioned that Hoeper was a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO).  The FFDO program allows the Government to \xe2\x80\x9cdeputize volunteer pilots of air carriers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defend the flight decks of aircraft .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. against acts of criminal violence or air piracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744921(a).  FFDOs are permitted \xe2\x80\x9cto carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744921(f\xc2\xa0)(1).  Hoeper had become an FFDO earlier in 2004 and had been issued a firearm.  He was not allowed to carry the firearm during his trip to the training facility, because he was not \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in providing air transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  But according to one official at the meeting, the Denver airport\xe2\x80\x99s security procedures made it possible for crew members to bypass screening, so that Hoeper could have carried his gun despite the rule.  Indeed, Frisch later testified that he was \xe2\x80\x9caware of one\xe2\x80\x9d incident in which an Air Wisconsin pilot had come to training with his FFDO weapon.  App. 292.  On the basis of this information, LaWare concluded, there was \xe2\x80\x9cno way .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to confirm\xe2\x80\x9d whether \xe2\x80\x9cHoeper had his weapon with him, even though .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by policy, [he was] not supposed to have it with him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 279.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Finally, LaWare testified, he and the other Air Wisconsin officials discussed two prior episodes in which disgruntled airline employees had lashed out violently.  Id., at 280.  In one incident, a FedEx flight engineer under investigation for misconduct \xe2\x80\x9centered the cockpit\xe2\x80\x9d of a FedEx flight \xe2\x80\x9cand began attacking the crew with a hammer\xe2\x80\x9d before being subdued.  United States v. Calloway, 116 F.\xc2\xa03d 1129, 1131 (CA6 1997).  In another, a recently fired ticket agent brought a gun onto a Pacific Southwest Airlines flight and shot his former supervisor and the crew, leading to a fatal crash.

App. 282.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Doyle offered to make the call.  According to the jury, he made two statements to the TSA: first, that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cwas an FFDO who may be armed\xe2\x80\x9d and that the airline was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm\xe2\x80\x9d; and second, that an \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was terminated today.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.  (The latter statement appears in the record as the subject line of an internal TSA e-mail, summarizing the call from Doyle.  App. 414.)</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The TSA responded to the call by ordering that Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s plane return to the gate.  Officers boarded the plane, re-moved Hoeper, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his gun.  When Hoeper stated that the gun was at his home in Denver, a Denver-based federal agent went there to retrieve it.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Later that day, Hoeper boarded a return flight to Denver.  Air Wisconsin fired him the following day.</p><p>B</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Hoeper sued Air Wisconsin in Colorado state court on several claims, including defamation.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  Air Wisconsin moved for summary judgment on the basis of ATSA immunity,[<a href="#F2">2</a>] but the trial court denied it, ruling that the jury was entitled to find the facts pertinent to immunity.  The case went to trial, and the court denied Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a directed verdict on the same basis.  It submitted the question of ATSA immunity to the jury, with the instruction\xe2\x80\x94following the language of \xc2\xa744941(b)\xe2\x80\x94that immunity would not apply if Hoeper had proved thatAir Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x9cmade the disclosure [to the TSA] with ac-tual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwith reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 582.

It held \xe2\x80\x9cthat the trial court properly submitted the ATSA immunity issue to the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record supports the jury\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\xe2\x80\x99s defamation verdict.  Id., at 233.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed.  2012 WL 907764 (Mar. 19, 2012).  It began by holding, contrary to the lower courts, \xe2\x80\x9cthat immunity under the ATSA is a question of law to be determined by the trial court before trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *4.  But it concluded that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error in submitting immunity to the jury was \xe2\x80\x9charmless because Air Wisconsin is not entitled to immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *6.  In a key footnote, the court stated: \xe2\x80\x9cIn our determination of immunity under the ATSA, we need not, and therefore do not, decide whether the statements were true or false.  Rather, we conclude that Air Wisconsin made the statements with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *16, n. 6.  The court thus appears tohave labored under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Applying this standard, and giving \xe2\x80\x9cno weight to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding[s],\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., n.\xc2\xa05, the court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]l-though the events at the training may have warranteda report to TSA,\xe2\x80\x9d Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statements \xe2\x80\x9coverstated those events to such a degree that they were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *7.  The court opined that Air Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x9cwould likely be immune under the ATSA if Doyle had reported that Hoeper was an Air Wisconsin employee, that he knew he would be terminated soon, that he had acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier and \xe2\x80\x98blew up\xe2\x80\x99 at test administrators, and that he was an FFDO pilot.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *8.  But because Doyle actually told TSA \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that he believed Hoeper to be mentally unstable; (2) that Hoeper had been terminated earlier that day; and (3) that Hoeper may have been armed,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at *7, the court determined that his statements \xe2\x80\x9cwent well beyond\xe2\x80\x9d the facts and did not qualify for immunity, id., at *8.  The court went on to conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\xe2\x80\x99s defamation verdict.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Justice Eid, joined by two others, dissented in part.  She agreed with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding that immunity is an issue for the court, not the jury.  But she reasoned that Air Wisconsin was entitled to immunity \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [its] statements to the TSA were substantially true.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *11.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We granted certiorari to decide \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination that the air carrier\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was materially false.\xe2\x80\x9d  570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Congress patterned the exception to ATSA immunity after the actual malice standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254 (1964), and we have long held that actual malice requires material falsity.  Because we presume that Congress meant to incorporate the settled meaning of actual malice when it incorporated the language of that standard, we hold that a statement otherwise eligible for ATSA immunity may not be deniedimmunity unless the statement is materially false.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        In New York Times, we held that under the First Amendment, a public official cannot recover \xe2\x80\x9cfor a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \xe2\x80\x98actual malice\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 279\xe2\x80\x93280.  Congress borrowed this exact language in denying ATSA immunity to \xe2\x80\x9c(1) any disclosure made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading; or (2) any disclosure made with recklessdisregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744941(b).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        One could in principle construe the language of the actual malice standard to cover true statements made recklessly.  But we have long held, to the contrary, that actual malice entails falsity.  See, e.g., Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps,475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 767,775 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s one might expect given the language of the Court in New York Times, a public-figure plaintiff must show the falsity of the statements at issue in order to prevail in a suit for defamation\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)); Garrison v. Louisiana,379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 64,74 (1964) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe held in New York Times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Indeed, we have required more than mere falsity to establish actual malice: The falsity must be \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,501 U. S. 496,517 (1991).  As we explained in Masson, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as \xe2\x80\x98the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  A \xe2\x80\x9cstatement is not considered false unless it \xe2\x80\x98would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting R. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems 138 (1980)).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        These holdings were settled when Congress enacted the ATSA, and we therefore presume that Congress meant to adopt the material falsity requirement when it incorporated the actual malice standard into the ATSA immunity exception.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that, when Congress employs a term of art, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it is taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The actual malice standard does not cover materially true statements made recklessly, so we presume that Congress did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to such statements.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Other indicia of statutory meaning could rebut this presumption, but here, they do not.  First, the ATSA\xe2\x80\x99stext favors a falsity requirement.  The first subsection of \xc2\xa744941(b) requires falsity, as a true disclosure cannot have been made \xe2\x80\x9cwith actual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that it \xe2\x80\x9cwas false.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only question is whether the second subsection\xe2\x80\x94which denies immunity to \xe2\x80\x9cany disclosure made with reckless disregard as to [its] truth or falsity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94similarly requires falsity.  We conclude that it does.  The second subsection simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones, ensuring that an air carrier cannot avoid liability for a baseless report by sticking its head in the sand to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that its statements are false.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he defense of truth .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , even if not explicitly recognized, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.is implicit in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a standard of recovery that rests on knowing or reckless disregard of the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,420 U. S. 469\xe2\x80\x93499 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        A material falsity requirement also serves the purpose of ATSA immunity.  The ATSA shifted from airlines to the TSA the responsibility \xe2\x80\x9cfor assessing and investigating possible threats to airline security.\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 907764, *14 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  In directing the TSA to \xe2\x80\x9creceive, assess, and distribute intelligence information related to transportation security,\xe2\x80\x9d49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(f)(1), Congress wanted to ensure that air carriers and their employees would not hesitate to provide the TSA with the information it needed.  This is the purpose of the immunity provision, evident both from its context and from the title of the statutory section that contained it: \xe2\x80\x9cencouraging airline employees to report sus-picious activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  ATSA \xc2\xa7125,115Stat.631 (capitali-zation and boldface type omitted).  It would defeat this purpose to deny immunity for substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth.  Such a rule would restore the pre-ATSA state of affairs, in which air carriers bore the responsibility to investigate and verify potential threats.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We therefore hold that ATSA immunity may not be denied under \xc2\xa744941(b) to materially true statements.  This interpretation of the statute is clear enough that Hoeper effectively concedes it.  See Brief for Respondent 30 (acknowledging that if the Colorado Supreme Court actually said \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an airline may be denied ATSA immunity .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for reporting true information,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cthe court was likely wrong\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hoeper does point out in a footnote that given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to deny immunity to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bad actors,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgiven that the vast majority of reckless statements will not turn out to be true[,] . . . Congress could have quite reasonably chosen to deny the special privilege of ATSA immunity to all reckless speakers,\xe2\x80\x9d even those whose statements turned out to be true.  Id., at 30, n.\xc2\xa012.  But although Congress could have made this choice, nothing about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text or purpose suggests that it actually did.  Instead, Congress chose to model the exception to ATSA immunity after a standard we have long construed to require material falsity.</p><p>B</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We are not persuaded by Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s arguments thatwe should affirm the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court notwithstanding its misapprehension of the ATSA immunity standard.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Hoeper first argues that Air Wisconsin forfeited the claim that it is entitled to immunity because its statements were materially true.  His premise is that AirWisconsin argued the truth of its statements only in challenging the evidentiary basis for the defamation verdict, not in asserting immunity.  But Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s brief before the Colorado Supreme Court argued that the exception to ATSA immunity \xe2\x80\x9cappears to incorporate the New York Times actual malice standard,\xe2\x80\x9d which\xe2\x80\x94as we have explained\xe2\x80\x94requires material falsity.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief in No. 09SC1050, p. 24.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Hoeper next argues that the Colorado Supreme Court performed the requisite analysis of material falsity, albeit in the context of finding the record sufficient to support the jury\xe2\x80\x99s defamation verdict.  For several reasons, however, this analysis does not suffice for us to affirm the denialof ATSA immunity.  First, to the extent that the immunity determination belongs to the court\xe2\x80\x94as the Colorado Supreme Court held\xe2\x80\x94a court\xe2\x80\x99s deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the record.  Second, the jury here did not find that any falsity in Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statements was material, because the trial court instructed it only to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne or more of th[e] statements was false,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 580, without addressing materiality.  Third, applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity.  In both contexts,a materially false statement is one that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that which the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. truth would have produced.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Masson, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 517.  But the identity of the relevant reader or listener varies according to the context.  In determining whether a falsehood is material to a defamation claim, we care whether it affects the subject\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in the community.  In the context of determining ATSA immu-nity, by contrast, we care whether a falsehood affects the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 perception of and response to a given threat.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>III</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of material falsity was erroneous.  We turn next to explaining why, by applying the ATSA immunity standard to the facts of this case.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>A</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We begin by addressing how to determine the material-ity of a false statement in the ATSA context.  As we noted earlier, a materially false statement is generally one that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that which the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. truth would have produced.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The parties quibble over whether ATSA immunity requires some special version of this standard, but they more or less agree\xe2\x80\x94as do we\xe2\x80\x94that the usual standard suffices as long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        A further question is what it means for a statement to produce \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a different effect on the mind of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a security officer from that which the truth would have produced.  In defamation law, the reputational harm caused by a false statement is its effect on a reader\xe2\x80\x99s or listener\xe2\x80\x99s mind.  But contrary to the position of Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\xe2\x80\x9333, courts cannot decide whether a false statement produced \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a different effect on the mind of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a hypothetical TSA officer without considering the effect of that statement on TSA\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.  After all, the whole reason the TSA considers threat reports is to deter-mine and execute a response.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        A plaintiff seeking to defeat ATSA immunity need not show \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely what a particular official or federal agency would have done in a counterfactual scenario.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27.  Such a showing would be \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. given the need to maintain se-crecy regarding airline security operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Re-spondent 42.  But any falsehood cannot be material, for purposes of ATSA immunity, absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.  Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,449 (1976) (an omission in a proxy solicitation \xe2\x80\x9cis material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote\xe2\x80\x9d).  This standard \xe2\x80\x9cis an objectiveone, involving the [hypothetical] significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d security official, rather than the actual significance of that fact to a particular security official.  Id., at 445.</p><p>B</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We apply the material falsity standard to the facts of this case.  In doing so, we neither embrace nor reject the Colorado Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous holding \xe2\x80\x9cthat immunity under the ATSA is a question of law to be determined by the trial court before trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 9097764, *4; see id., at *11 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing with majority).  Rather, we conclude that even if a jury were to find the historical facts in the manner most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin is entitled to ATSA immunity as a matter of law.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We begin with Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cwas an FFDO who may be armed.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.  Hoeper cannot dispute the literal truth of this statement: He was an FFDO, and because FFDOs possess weapons, any FFDO \xe2\x80\x9cmay be armed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hoeper argues only that to avoid any misinterpretation, Air Wisconsin should have qualified the statement by adding that it had no reason to think he was actually carrying his gun during the trip to Virginia, especially because he was not allowed to do so under \xc2\xa744921(f\xc2\xa0)(1).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  We agree that Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statement could have been misinterpreted by some, but we reject Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s argument for two reasons.  First, any confusion of the nature that Hoeper suggests would have been immaterial: A reasonable TSA officer, having been told only that Hoeper was an FFDO and that he was upset about losing his job, would have wanted to investigate whether Hoeper was carrying his gun.  Second, to accept Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s demand for such precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats.  Baggage handlers, flight attendants, gate agents, and other airline employees who report suspicious behavior to the TSA should not face financial ruin if, in the heat of a potential threat, they fail to choose their words with exacting care.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We next consider Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cwas terminated today.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.  When Air Wisconsin made that statement, Hoeper had not yet been fired.  But everyone knew the firing was almost certainly imminent.  Hoeper acknowledged that his employment was \xe2\x80\x9cat [Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion\xe2\x80\x9d after his third failed test, App. 193, and the agreement between him and Air Wisconsin stated that his \xe2\x80\x9cfourth .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. attempt\xe2\x80\x9d to pass the test would be his \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d one, id., at 426.  No reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, po-tentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Finally, we consider Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statements that Hoeper was \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nstable\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about his mental stability.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.  Al-though the details of Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior during the simulator session may be disputed, Hoeper himself testified that he had become visibly angry: He decided \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d he removed his headset and \xe2\x80\x9ctoss[ed] it,\xe2\x80\x9d and he accused the instructor\xe2\x80\x94at an \xe2\x80\x9celevated decibel level,\xe2\x80\x9d and with an expletive\xe2\x80\x94of \xe2\x80\x9crailroading the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 203\xe2\x80\x93204.  It would surely have been correct, then, for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98blew up\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d during the test.  2012 WL 907764, *8.  The question is whether, from the perspective of a reasonable security officer, there is any material difference between a statement that Hoeper had just \xe2\x80\x9cblown up\xe2\x80\x9d in a professional setting and a statement that hewas \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nstable.\xe2\x80\x9d  We think not.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We are no more troubled by Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s related statement that it was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about [Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s] mental stability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hoeper is correct that many of the Air Wisconsin officials who attended the meeting at headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cmen-tal stability.\xe2\x80\x9d  LaWare, for instance, testified that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hose weren\xe2\x80\x99t the words that [he] would have anticipated\xe2\x80\x9d when he directed Doyle to call the TSA.  App. 272.  But the officials who attended the meeting did harbor concerns about Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s mental state: They knew he had just \xe2\x80\x9cblown up,\xe2\x80\x9d and they worried about what he might do next.  It would be inconsistent with the ATSA\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because its employee could have chosen a slightly better phrase than \xe2\x80\x9cmental stability\xe2\x80\x9d to articulate its concern.  Just as \xe2\x80\x9c[m]inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity\xe2\x80\x9d in the defamation context, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as \xe2\x80\x98the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Masson, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 517, a statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision, so long as \xe2\x80\x9cthe gist\xe2\x80\x9d of the statement is accurate.  Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the TSA accu-rately conveyed \xe2\x80\x9cthe gist\xe2\x80\x9d of the situation; it is irrelevant whether trained lawyers or judges might with the luxury of time have chosen more precise words.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s overarching factual theory appears to be that members of the BAe-146 team, including Doyle and Schuer-man, harbored personal animosity toward him, which caused them to manipulate the proficiency tests in order to fail him.  But even if Hoeper were correct aboutall this (and we express no view on that question), we do not see why it would have made him any less a threat in the eyes of a reasonable security officer.  As between two employees\xe2\x80\x94one who thinks he is being fired because of his inadequate skills, another who thinks he is being fired because his employer hates him\xe2\x80\x94the latter is presumably more, not less, likely to lash out in anger.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The partial dissent argues that Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmental stability\xe2\x80\x9d was so egregious as to make his report to the TSA the basis of a $1.2 million defamation judgment.  We disagree.  While lawyers and judges may in some contexts apply the label \xe2\x80\x9cmentally unstable\xe2\x80\x9d to people suffering from serious mental illnesses, see post, at 4 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), that is hardly the only manner in which the label is used.  A holding that Air Wisconsin lost its ATSA immunity by virtue of Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s failure to be aware of every connotation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmental stability\xe2\x80\x9d would eviscerate the immunity provision.  All of us from time to time use words that, on reflection, we might modify.  If such slips of the tongue could give rise to major financial liability, no airline would contact the TSA (or permit its employees to do so) without running by its lawyers the text of its proposed disclosure\xe2\x80\x94exactly the kind of hesitation that Congress aimed to avoid.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The partial dissent further argues that Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay of anger\xe2\x80\x9d made him no more a threat than \xe2\x80\x9cmillions of perfectly harmless air travelers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 4.  But Hoeper did not just lose his temper; he lost it in circumstances that he knew would lead to his firing, which he regarded as the culmination of a vendetta against him.  And he was not just any passenger; he was an FFDO, which meant that he could plausibly have been carrying a firearm.  In short, Hoeper was not some traveling businessman who yelled at a barista in a fit of pique over a badly brewed cup of coffee.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Finally, the partial dissent relies on an expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony \xe2\x80\x9cthat Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior did not warrant any report to the TSA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 4 (citing App. 356).  But the expert appears to have based that statement on an outdated understanding of reporting obligations that is flatly at odds with the ATSA.  Prior to the ATSA, \xe2\x80\x9cairlines were responsible for assessing and investigating possible threats to airline security.\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 907764, *14 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  But the ATSA shifted that responsibility to the TSA, creating a policy \xe2\x80\x9cknown as \xe2\x80\x98when in doubt, report.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see supra, at 9.  The expert who believed that Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s conduct did not warrant a report to the TSA also believed that airlines have \xe2\x80\x9can obligation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to filter out .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the low noise from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. what\xe2\x80\x99s significant\xe2\x80\x9d in reporting threats.  App. 356.  That understanding does not comport with the policy that Congress chose to enact.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The Colorado Supreme Court recognized that even if the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x9cwould likely be immune\xe2\x80\x9d had it \xe2\x80\x9creported that Hoeper .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. knew he would be terminated soon, that he had acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier and \xe2\x80\x98blew up\xe2\x80\x99 at test administrators, and that he was an FFDO pilot.\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 907764, *8.  But the court erred in parsing so finely the distinctions between these hypothetical statements and the ones that Air Wisconsin actually made.  The minor differences are, for the reasons we have explained, immaterial as a matter of law in determining Air Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s ATSA immunity.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        By incorporating the actual malice standard into \xc2\xa744941(b), Congress meant to give air carriers the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98breathing space\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to report potential threats to security officials without fear of civil liability for a few inaptly chosen words.

I also agree that, in this context, materiality means that the falsehood had a natural tendency to influence a reasonable TSA officer\xe2\x80\x99s determination of an appropriate response to the report; and that neither the jury nor the courts below considered material falsity in this ATSA-specific way.

In so holding, the Court in my view reaches out to decide a factbound question better left to the lower courts, and then proceeds to give the wrong answer.  I therefore respectfully dissent from Part III\xe2\x80\x93B and the disposition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We have held that under the\n \nFirst Amendment, a court\xe2\x80\x99s role is to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9c[a] reasonable jury could find a material difference between\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statement and the truth.  Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 496,\n522 (1991)\n.

(quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n450 (1976)\n; brackets omitted).  Such a question cannot be withdrawn from the jury unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d on which \xe2\x80\x9creasonable persons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could [not] differ.\xe2\x80\x9d  McDermott Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc. v.

Ante, at 13.  We must of course begin by taking as given the findings that we know the jury already made, including that Air Wisconsin told the TSA that the airline was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about [Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s] mental stability\xe2\x80\x9d and that he was an \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nstable pilot,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a (special verdict form), and that those statements were false, 2012 WL 907764, *10 (Colo., Mar. 19, 2012).  Next, we must ask whether a reasonable jury could find the remaining historical facts to be such that those statements were not only false, but materially false from the perspective of a reasonable TSA agent.  If not, judgment for Air Wisconsin is proper; but if so, the ATSA materiality question should be tried to a (properly instructed) jury.  (Unless, of course, a reasonable jury would be compelled to find facts that would render the statements materially false, in which case judgment for Hoeper would be proper; but that is assuredly not the case here.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Applying that reasonable-jury standard, I do not see how we can possibly hold as a matter of law that AirWisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s report was not materially false.  The Court acknowledges Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s description of the confrontation that spawned the airline\xe2\x80\x99s threat report: After failinga flight simulator test, Hoeper \xe2\x80\x9cdecided \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 heremoved his headset and \xe2\x80\x98toss[ed] it,\xe2\x80\x99 and he accusedthe instructor\xe2\x80\x94at an \xe2\x80\x98elevated decibel level,\xe2\x80\x99 and withan expletive\xe2\x80\x94of \xe2\x80\x98railroading the situation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15 (quoting App. 203\xe2\x80\x93204).  A jury could credit Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s account.  It could also believe his \xe2\x80\x9coverarching factual theory\xe2\x80\x9d that his anger was reasonable because the instructor had \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the test to cause him to fail out of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal animosity,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x94a theory that was not without supporting evidence, see, e.g., App. 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (pilot testifying as expert witness that Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s testing was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely unfair\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbiased\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, there was evidence from which a jury could conclude that no one who interacted with Hoeper during or after the confrontation\xe2\x80\x94including the instructor\xe2\x80\x94viewed him as either unstable or threatening.  See, e.g., id., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (instructor acknowledging that he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98quickly realized it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a threatening situation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 29\xe2\x80\x9331 (instructor testifying he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98never felt that [Hoeper] was going to go do something stupid,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Mr. Hoeper posed a threat in any way to anybody else at all,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98did not believe that Mr. Hoeper was engaging in irrational behavior,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deem[ed] him perfectly safe to get on an airplane\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 462 (airline representative who gave Hoeper permission to fly home testifying he \xe2\x80\x9chad no concern that [Hoeper] was a physical threat to anybody\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he was mentally unstable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In short, a jury could find that Hoeper did nothing more than engage in a brief, run-of-the-mill, and arguably justified display of anger that included raising his voice and swearing, but that did not cause anyone, including the person on the receiving end of the outburst, to view him as either irrational or a potential source of violence.  Viewing the facts in that light, I cannot agree with the Court thata reasonable TSA official would not \xe2\x80\x9cconsider .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. important,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13, the difference between an individual who engaged in this sort of heated but commonplace display of anger, on the one hand, and on the other, anindividual whose colleagues regard him as \xe2\x80\x9cmentally unsta-ble.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the difference between a category that no doubt includes millions of perfectly harmless air travelers and one that, in ordinary parlance, connotes an alarming degree of unpredictability and aggressiveness.  Indeed, we have used that term in connection with individuals so \xe2\x80\x9cdangerously mentally ill\xe2\x80\x9d that they may be subject to civil confinement.  Kansas v. Hendricks,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346,\n363 (1997)\n.  The importance of that difference was highlighted by the expert testimony in this case of a former TSA Federal Security Director, who stated\xe2\x80\x94based on a version of the underlying facts the jury was entitled to accept\xe2\x80\x94that Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s behavior did not warrant any report to the TSA.  App. 356.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The association with dangerous mental illness is not, as the Court suggests, merely one \xe2\x80\x9cconnotation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x98mental [in]stability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d among many, ante, at 17; it is the everyday understanding of that phrase.  The Court says that this is \xe2\x80\x9chardly the only manner in which the label is used,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., but it does not even attempt to describe another usage, let alone one that would be a materially accurate description of the facts of this case as a jury might find them.  The Court also suggests that the circumstances of this case\xe2\x80\x94particularly the fact that Hoeper knew his firing was imminent, had reason to be angry with the airline, and was authorized to carry a firearm\xe2\x80\x94distinguish Hoeper\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation with the instructor from an ordinary \xe2\x80\x9cfit of pique.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But if so, it was all the more important for the airline to make an accurate report to the TSA, so that the agency could assess the possible danger and determine an appropriate response.  Falsely reporting to the TSA that a young Irishman is an IRA terrorist is much more likely to produce a promptand erroneous response than reporting that a 70-year-old English grandmother is.  The circumstances the Court identifies enhanced, rather than diminished, the likelihood that the false \xe2\x80\x9cmentally unstable\xe2\x80\x9d designation would have a material effect on the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s response.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In sum, it is simply implausible that, taking the facts of this case in the light most favorable to Hoeper, a reason-able jury would have to find that the report of mental in-stability would have no effect upon the course of action determined by the TSA.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding to the contrary demonstrates the wisdom of preserving the jury\xe2\x80\x99s role in this inquiry, designed to inject a practical sense that judges sometimes lack.  I respectfully dissent from that holding.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0The Court dismisses the former Director\xe2\x80\x99s testimony because he testified that in making threat reports to the TSA, airline officials should use \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cfilter out the garbage and report [only] really suspicious incidents,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 356, a view the Court deems \xe2\x80\x9cflatly at odds with the ATSA,\xe2\x80\x9d  at 17.  The ATSA, however, simply requires airlines to report \xe2\x80\x9cthreat[s] to civil aviation,\xe2\x80\x9d\n.  The statute surely places a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of reporting, but it certainly does not preclude the exercise of reasonable judgment in deciding what rises to the level of a \xe2\x80\x9cthreat\xe2\x80\x9d and what constitutes, as the former Director put it, irrelevant \xe2\x80\x9cgarbage.\xe2\x80\x9d  And even if one disagrees with the former Director that no report should have been made at all, the point is that a reasonable jury could have considered his testimony relevant to establishing that falsely expressing concerns about an individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmental stability\xe2\x80\x9d in the circumstances of this case would have a material effect on the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
