To determine whether a prior conviction is for one of those listed crimes, courts apply the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94they ask whether the elements of the offense forming the basis for the conviction sufficiently match the elements of the generic (or commonly understood) version of the enumerated crime.  See <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575\n\xe2\x80\x93601.  \xe2\x80\x9cElements\xe2\x80\x9d are the constituent parts of a crime\xe2\x80\x99s legal definition, which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction; they are distinct from \xe2\x80\x9cfacts,\xe2\x80\x9d which are mere real-world things\xe2\x80\x94extraneous to the crime\xe2\x80\x99s legal requirements and thus ignored by the categorical approach.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">When a statute defines only a single crime with a single set of elements, application of the categorical approach is straightforward.  But when a statute defines multiple crimes by listing multiple, alternative elements, the elements-matching required by the categorical approach is more difficult.  To decide whether a conviction under such a statute is for a listed ACCA offense, a sentencing court must discern which of the alternative elements was integral to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  That determination is made possible by the \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d which permits a court to look at a limited class of documents from the record of a prior conviction to determine what crime, with what elements, a defendant was convicted of before comparing that crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements to those of the generic offense.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Shepard</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13\n.  This case involves a different type of alternatively worded statute\xe2\x80\x94one that defines only one crime, with one set of elements, but which lists alternative factual means by which a defendant can satisfy those elements.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Here, petitioner Richard Mathis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.  Because of his five prior Iowa burglary convictions, the Government requested an ACCA sentence enhancement.  Under the generic offense, burglary requires unlawful entry into a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding or other structure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598.  The Iowa statute, however, reaches \xe2\x80\x9cany building, structure, [or] land, water, or air vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Iowa Code \xc2\xa7702.12.  Under Iowa law, that list of places does not set out alternative elements, but rather alternative means of fulfilling a single locational element.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The District Court applied the modified categorical approach, found that Mathis had burgled structures, and imposed an enhanced sentence.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  Acknowledging that the Iowa statute swept more broadly than the generic statute, the court determined that, even if \xe2\x80\x9cstructures\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvehicles\xe2\x80\x9d were not separate elements but alternative means of fulfilling a single element, a sentencing court could still invoke the modified categorical approach.  Because the record showed that Mathis had burgled structures, the court held, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Mathis\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions as ACCA predicates was proper.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because the elements of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary law are broader than those of generic burglary, Mathis\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions cannot give rise to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentence enhancement. Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0This case is resolved by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, which have repeatedly held, and in no uncertain terms, that a state crime cannot qualify as an ACCA predicate if its elements are broader than those of a listed generic offense.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602.  The \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying brute facts or means\xe2\x80\x9d by which the defendant commits his crime, <i>Richardson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813\n, make no difference; even if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, in fact, fits within the definition of the generic offense, the mismatch of elements saves him from an ACCA sentence.  ACCA requires a sentencing judge to look only to \xe2\x80\x9cthe elements of the [offense], not to the facts of [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases establish three basic reasons for adhering to an elements-only inquiry.  First, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s text, which asks only about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprior convictions,\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that Congress meant for the sentencing judge to ask only whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 600, not what he had done.  Second, construing ACCA to allow a sentencing judge to go any further would raise serious\n \nSixth Amendment concerns because only a jury, not a judge, may find facts that increase the maximum penalty.  See <i>Apprendi</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466\n.  And third, an elements-focus avoids unfairness to defendants, who otherwise might be sentenced based on statements of \xe2\x80\x9cnon-elemental fact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that are prone to error because their proof is unnecessary to a conviction.  <i>Descamps</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Those reasons remain as strong as ever when a statute, like Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary statute, lists alternative means of fulfilling one (or more) of a crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements.  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9cconvictions\xe2\x80\x9d still supports an elements-based inquiry.  The\n \nSixth Amendment problems associated with a court\xe2\x80\x99s exploration of means rather than elements do not abate in the face of a statute like Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s: Alternative factual scenarios remain just that, and thus off-limits to sentencing judges.  Finally, a statute\xe2\x80\x99s listing of disjunctive means does nothing to mitigate the possible unfairness of basing an increased penalty on something not legally necessary to a prior conviction.  Accordingly, whether means are listed in a statute or not, ACCA does not care about them; rather, its focus, as always, remains on a crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The first task for a court faced with an alternatively phrased statute is thus to determine whether the listed items are elements or means.  That threshold inquiry is easy here, where a State Supreme Court ruling answers the question.  A state statute on its face could also resolve the issue.  And if state law fails to provide clear answers, the record of a prior conviction itself might prove useful to determining whether the listed items are elements of the offense.  If such record materials do not speak plainly, a sentencing judge will be unable to satisfy \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Taylor</i>\xe2\x80\x99s demand for certainty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shepard</i>, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 21.

For more than 25 years, our decisions have held that the prior crime qualifies as an ACCA predicate if, but only if, its elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.  The question in this case is whether ACCA makes an exception to that rule when a defendant is convicted under a statute that lists multiple, alternative means of satisfying one (or more) of its elements.  We decline to find such an exception.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ACCA prescribes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence if a defendant is convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm following three prior convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  (Absent that sentence enhancement, the felon-in-possession statute sets a 10-year <i>maximum </i>penalty.  See \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).)  ACCA defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include any felony, whether state or federal, that \xe2\x80\x9cis burglary, arson, or extortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  In listing those crimes, we have held, Congress referred only to their usual or (in our terminol-ogy) generic versions\xe2\x80\x94not to all variants of the offenses.  See <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575,\n598 (1990)\n.  That means as to burglary\xe2\x80\x94the offense relevant in this case\xe2\x80\x94that Congress meant a crime \xe2\x80\x9ccontain[ing] the following elements: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To determine whether a prior conviction is for generic burglary (or other listed crime) courts apply what is known as the categorical approach: They focus solely on whether the elements of the crime of conviction sufficiently match the elements of generic burglary, while ignoring the particular facts of the case.  See <i>id.,</i> at 600\xe2\x80\x93601.  Distinguishing between elements and facts is therefore central to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s operation.  \xe2\x80\x9cElements\xe2\x80\x9d are the \xe2\x80\x9cconstituent parts\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime\xe2\x80\x99s legal definition\xe2\x80\x94the things the \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014).  At a trial, they are what the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the defendant, see <i>Richardson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813,\n817 (1999)\n; and at a plea hearing, they are what the defendant necessarily admits when he pleads guilty, see <i>McCarthy</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 459,\n466 (1969)\n.  Facts, by contrast, are mere real-world things\xe2\x80\x94extraneous to the crime\xe2\x80\x99s legal requirements.  (We have sometimes called them \xe2\x80\x9cbrute facts\xe2\x80\x9d when distinguishing them from elements.  <i>Richardson</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 817.)<i> </i>They are \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance[s]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cevent[s]\xe2\x80\x9d having no \xe2\x80\x9clegal effect [or] consequence\xe2\x80\x9d: In particular, they need neither be found by a jury nor admitted by a defendant.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 709.  And ACCA, as we have always understood it, cares not a whit about them.  See, <i>e.g., Taylor, </i>495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599\xe2\x80\x93602.  A crime counts as \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act if its <i>elements</i> are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.  But if the crime of conviction covers any more conduct than the generic offense, then it is not an ACCA \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actual conduct (<i>i.e., </i>the facts of the crime) fits within the generic offense\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The comparison of elements that the categorical approach requires is straightforward when a statute sets out a single (or \xe2\x80\x9cindivisible\xe2\x80\x9d) set of elements to define a single crime.  The court then lines up that crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements alongside those of the generic offense and sees if they match.  So, for example, this Court found that a California statute swept more broadly than generic burglary because it criminalized entering a location (even if lawfully) with the intent to steal, and thus encompassed mere shoplifting.  See <i>id.,</i> at 591; <i>Descamps</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  Accordingly, no conviction under that law could count as an ACCA predicate, even if the defendant in fact made an illegal entry and so committed burglary in its generic form.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Some statutes, however, have a more complicated (sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cdivisible\xe2\x80\x9d) structure, making the comparison of elements harder.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5).  A single statute may list elements in the alternative, and thereby define multiple crimes.  Suppose, for example, that the California law noted above had prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawful entry or the unlawful entry\xe2\x80\x9d of a premises with intent to steal, so as to create two different offenses, one more serious than the other.  If the defendant were convicted of the offense with unlawful entry as an element, then his crime of conviction would match generic burglary and count as an ACCA predicate; but, conversely, the conviction would not qualify if it were for the offense with lawful entry as an element.  A sentencing court thus requires a way of figuring out which of the alternative elements listed\xe2\x80\x94lawful entry or unlawful entry\xe2\x80\x94was integral to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction (that is, which was necessarily found or admitted).  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6).  To address that need, this Court approved the \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d for use with statutes having multiple alternative elements.  See, <i>e.g., Shepard</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13,\n26 (2005)\n<i>.  </i>Under that approach, a sentencing court looks to a limited class of documents (for example, the indictment, jury instructions, or plea agreement and colloquy) to determine what crime, with what elements, a defendant was convicted of.  See <i>ibid.</i>;<i> Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602.  The court can then compare that crime, as the categorical approach commands, with the relevant generic offense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case concerns a different kind of alternatively phrased law: not one that lists multiple elements disjunctively, but instead one that enumerates various factual means of committing a single element.  See generally <i>Schad</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624,\n636 (1991)\n (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]egislatures frequently enumerate alternative means of committing a crime without intending to define separate elements or separate crimes\xe2\x80\x9d).  To use a hypothetical adapted from two of our prior decisions, suppose a statute requires use of a \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d as an element of a crime and further provides that the use of a \xe2\x80\x9cknife, gun, bat, or similar weapon\xe2\x80\x9d would all qualify.  See <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16); <i>Richardson</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 817.  Because that kind of list merely specifies diverse means of satisfying a single element of a single crime\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise said, spells out various factual ways of committing some component of the offense\xe2\x80\x94a jury need not find (or a defendant admit) any particular item: A jury could convict even if some jurors \xe2\x80\x9cconclude[d] that the defendant used a knife\xe2\x80\x9d while others \xe2\x80\x9cconclude[d] he used a gun,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as all agreed that the defendant used a \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (describing means, for this reason, as \xe2\x80\x9clegally extraneous circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).  And similarly, to bring the discussion back to burglary, a statute might\xe2\x80\x94indeed, as soon discussed, Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary law does\xe2\x80\x94itemize the various places that crime could occur as disjunctive factual scenarios rather than separate elements, so that a jury need not make any specific findings (or a defendant admissions) on that score.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The issue before us is whether ACCA treats this kind of statute as it does all others, imposing a sentence enhancement only if the state crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements correspond to those of a generic offense\xe2\x80\x94or instead whether the Act makes an exception for such a law, so that a sentence can be enhanced when one of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s specified means creates a match with the generic offense, even though the broader element would not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner Richard Mathis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See \xc2\xa7922(g).  At sentencing, the Government asked the District Court to impose ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s 15-year minimum penalty based on Mathis\xe2\x80\x99s five prior convictions for burglary under Iowa law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary statute, all parties agree, covers more conduct than generic burglary does.  See Brief for Petitioner 36; Brief for United States 44.  The generic offense requires unlawful entry into a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding or other structure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598; <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 2.  Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s statute, by contrast, reaches a broader range of places: \xe2\x80\x9cany building, structure, <i>[or] land, water, or air vehicle</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Iowa Code \xc2\xa7702.12 (2013) (emphasis added).  And those listed locations are not alternative elements, going toward the creation of separate crimes.  To the contrary, they lay out alternative ways of satisfying a single locational element, as the Iowa Supreme Court has held: Each of the terms serves as an \xe2\x80\x9calternative method of committing [the] single crime\xe2\x80\x9d of burglary, so that a jury need not agree on which of the locations was actually involved.  <i>State</i> v. <i>Duncan</i>, 312 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 519, 523 (Iowa 1981); see <i>State </i>v. <i>Rooney</i>, 862 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 367, 376 (Iowa 2015) (discussing the single \xe2\x80\x9cbroadly phrased .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. element of place\xe2\x80\x9d in Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary law).  In short, the statute defines one crime, with one set of elements, broader than generic burglary\xe2\x80\x94while specifying multiple means of fulfilling its locational element, some but not all of which (<i>i.e., </i>buildings and other structures, but not vehicles) satisfy the generic definition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court imposed an ACCA enhancement on Mathis after inspecting the records of his prior convictions and determining that he had burgled structures, rather than vehicles.  See App. 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  786 F.\xc2\xa03d 1068 (2015).  It acknowledged that Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary statute, by covering vehicles in addition to structures, swept more broadly than generic burglary.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1074.  But it noted that if structures and vehicles were separate elements, each part of a different crime, then a sentencing court could invoke the modified categorical approach and look to old record materials to see which of those crimes the defendant had been convicted of.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1072\xe2\x80\x931074.  And the Court of Appeals thought nothing changed if structures and vehicles were not distinct elements but only alternative means: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether [such locations] amount to alternative elements or merely alternative means to fulfilling an element,\xe2\x80\x9d the Eighth Circuit held, a sentencing court \xe2\x80\x9cmust apply the modified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d and inspect the records of prior cases.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1075.  If the court found from those materials that the defendant had in fact committed the offense in a way that satisfied the definition of generic burglary\xe2\x80\x94here, by burgling a structure rather than a vehicle\xe2\x80\x94then the court should treat the conviction as an ACCA predicate.  And that was so, the Court of Appeals stated, even though the elements of the crime of conviction, in encompassing both types of locations, were broader than those of the relevant generic offense.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1074\xe2\x80\x931075.  In this circumstance, the court thus found, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s usual elements-based inquiry would yield to a facts-based one.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That decision added to a Circuit split over whether ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s general rule\xe2\x80\x94that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction can count as a predicate only if its elements match those of a generic offense\xe2\x80\x94gives way when a statute happens to list various means by which a defendant can satisfy an element.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  We granted certiorari to resolve that division, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As just noted, the elements of Mathis\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction (Iowa burglary) cover a greater swath of conduct than the elements of the relevant ACCA offense (generic burglary).  See <i>supra,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Under our precedents, that undisputed disparity resolves this case.  We have often held, and in no uncertain terms, that a state crime cannot qualify as an ACCA predicate if its elements are broader than those of a listed generic offense.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602.  How a given defendant actually perpetrated the crime\xe2\x80\x94what we have referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying brute facts or means\xe2\x80\x9d of commission<i>, Richardson, </i>526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 817\xe2\x80\x94makes no difference; even if his conduct fits within the generic offense, the mismatch of elements saves the defendant from an ACCA sentence.  Those longstanding principles, and the reasoning that underlies them, apply regardless of whether a statute omits or instead specifies alternative possible means of commission.  The itemized construction gives a sentencing court no special warrant to explore the facts of an offense, rather than to determine the crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements and compare them with the generic definition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Taylor </i>set out the essential rule governing ACCA cases more than a quarter century ago.  All that counts under the Act, we held then, are \xe2\x80\x9cthe elements of the statute of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601.  So, for example, the label a State assigns to a crime\xe2\x80\x94whether \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking and entering,\xe2\x80\x9d or something else entirely\xe2\x80\x94has no relevance to whether that offense is an ACCA predicate.  See <i>id.,</i> at 590\xe2\x80\x93592.  And more to the point here: The same is true of \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular facts underlying [the prior] convictions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the means by which the defendant, in real life, committed his crimes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 600.  That rule can seem counterintuitive: In some cases, a sentencing judge knows (or can easily discover) that the defendant carried out a \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d burglary, even though the crime of conviction also extends to other conduct.  No matter.  Under ACCA, <i>Taylor </i>stated, it is impermissible for \xe2\x80\x9ca particular crime [to] sometimes count towards enhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 601.  Accordingly, a sentencing judge may look only to \xe2\x80\x9cthe elements of the [offense], not to the facts of [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That simple point became a mantra in our subsequent ACCA decisions.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  At the risk of repetition (perhaps downright tedium), here are some examples.  In <i>Shepard</i>: ACCA \xe2\x80\x9crefers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior conduct but of prior \xe2\x80\x98convictions\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98element[s]\xe2\x80\x99 of crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 19 (alteration in original).  In <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have avoided any inquiry into the underlying facts of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] particular offense, and have looked solely to the elements of [burglary] as defined by [state] law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192,\n214 (2007)\n.  In <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>United States</i>: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e consider [only] the <i>elements of the offense</i>[,] without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n7 (2011)\n (quoting <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202; emphasis in original).<i> </i>And most recently (and tersely) in <i>Descamps</i>: \xe2\x80\x9cThe key [under ACCA] is elements, not facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decisions have given three basic reasons for adhering to an elements-only inquiry.  First, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s text favors that approach.  By enhancing the sentence of a defendant who has three \xe2\x80\x9cprevious convictions\xe2\x80\x9d for generic burglary, \xc2\xa7924(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x94rather than one who has thrice committed that crime\xe2\x80\x94Congress indicated that the sentencer should ask only about whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories,\xe2\x80\x9d and not about what the defendant had actually done.  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600.  Congress well knows how to instruct sentencing judges to look into the facts of prior crimes: In other statutes, using different language, it has done just that.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hayes</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415,\n421 (2009)\n (concluding that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9can offense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. committed\xe2\x80\x9d charged sentencers with considering non-elemental facts); <i>Nijhawan</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29,\n36 (2009)\n (construing an immigration statute to \xe2\x80\x9ccall[\xc2\xa0] for a \xe2\x80\x98circumstance-specific,\xe2\x80\x99 not a \xe2\x80\x98categorical\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d).  But Congress chose another course in ACCA, focusing on only \xe2\x80\x9cthe elements of the statute of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, a construction of ACCA allowing a sentencing judge to go any further would raise serious\n \nSixth Amendment concerns.  This Court has held that only a jury, and not a judge, may find facts that increase a maximum penalty, except for the simple fact of a prior conviction.  See <i>Apprendi</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466,\n490 (2000)\n.  That means a judge cannot go beyond identifying the crime of conviction to explore the manner in which the defendant committed that offense.  See <i>Shepard</i>, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25 (plurality opinion); <i>id.</i>, at 28 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (stating that such an approach would amount to \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional error\xe2\x80\x9d).  He is prohibited from conducting such an inquiry himself; and so too he is barred from making a disputed determination about \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the jury in a prior trial must have accepted as the theory of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at 25 (plurality opinion); <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  He can do no more, consistent with the\n \nSixth Amendment, than determine what crime, with what elements, the defendant was convicted of.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And third, an elements-focus avoids unfairness to defendants.  Statements of \xe2\x80\x9cnon-elemental fact\xe2\x80\x9d in the records of prior convictions are prone to error precisely because their proof is unnecessary.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 15). <i> </i>At trial, and still more at plea hearings, a defendant may have no incentive to contest what does not matter under the law; to the contrary, he \xe2\x80\x9cmay have good reason not to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or even be precluded from doing so by the court.  <i>Ibid.</i>  When that is true, a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s or judge\xe2\x80\x99s mistake as to means, reflected in the record, is likely to go uncorrected.  See <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Such inaccuracies should not come back to haunt the defendant many years down the road by triggering a lengthy mandatory sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Those three reasons stay as strong as ever when a statute, instead of merely laying out a crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements, lists alternative means of fulfilling one (or more) of them.  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cconvictions\xe2\x80\x9d still supports an elements-based inquiry; indeed, that language directly refutes an approach that would treat as consequential a statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to factual circumstances <i>not</i> essential to any conviction.  Similarly, the\n \nSixth Amendment problems associated with a court\xe2\x80\x99s exploration of means rather than elements do not abate in the face of a statute like Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s: Whether or not mentioned in a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, alternative factual scenarios remain just that\xe2\x80\x94and so remain off-limits to judges imposing ACCA enhancements.  And finally, a statute\xe2\x80\x99s listing of disjunctive means does nothing to mitigate the possible unfairness of basing an increased penalty on something not legally necessary to a prior conviction.  Whatever the statute says, or leaves out, about diverse ways of committing a crime makes no difference to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s incentives (or lack thereof\xc2\xa0) to contest such matters.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, the court below erred in applying the modified categorical approach to determine the means by which Mathis committed his prior crimes.  786 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1075.  ACCA, as just explained, treats such facts as irrelevant: Find them or not, by examining the record or anything else, a court still may not use them to enhance a sentence.  And indeed, our cases involving the modified categorical approach have already made exactly that point.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he only [use of that approach] we have ever allowed,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated a few Terms ago, is to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhich <i>element[s]</i> played a part in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 5, 8) (emphasis added); see <i>Taylor</i>,<i> </i>495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602 (noting that the modified approach may be employed only to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9ca jury necessarily had to find\xe2\x80\x9d each element of generic burglary).  In other words, the modified approach serves\xe2\x80\x94and serves solely\xe2\x80\x94as a tool to identify the elements of the crime of conviction when a statute\xe2\x80\x99s disjunctive phrasing renders one (or more) of them opaque.  See <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  It is not to be repurposed as a technique for discovering whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction, even though for a too-broad crime, rested on facts (or otherwise said, involved means) that also could have satisfied the elements of a generic offense.</p>\n<p style="p-H2">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government and Justice Breyer claim that our longtime and exclusive focus on elements does not resolve this case because (so they say) when we talked about \xe2\x80\x9celements,\xe2\x80\x9d we did not really mean it.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court used \xe2\x80\x98elements,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Government informs us, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to distinguish between \xe2\x80\x98means\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98elements,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but instead to refer to whatever the statute lists\xe2\x80\x94whether means <i>or </i>elements.  Brief for United States 8; see <i>id.,</i> at 19.  In a similar vein, Justice Breyer posits that every time we said the word \xe2\x80\x9celement,\xe2\x80\x9d we \xe2\x80\x9cused the word generally, simply to refer to the matter at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d without \xe2\x80\x9cintend[ing] to set forth a generally applicable rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But a good rule of thumb for reading our decisions is that what they say and what they mean are one and the same; and indeed, we have previously insisted on that point with reference to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements-only approach.  In <i>Descamps</i>, the sole dissenting Justice made an argument identical to the one now advanced by the Government and Justice Breyer: that our prior caselaw had not intended to distinguish between statutes listing alternative elements and those setting out \xe2\x80\x9cmerely alternative means\xe2\x80\x9d of commission.  570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (opinion of Alito, J.).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The Court rejected that contention, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll those decisions rested on the explicit premise that the laws contain[ed] statutory phrases that cover several different crimes, not several different methods of committing one offense\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words, that they listed alternative elements, not alternative means.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (slip op., at 9, n.\xc2\xa02)<i> </i>(ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted)<i>; </i>see,<i> e.g., Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133,\n144 (2010)\n; <i>Nijhawan</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 35.  That premise was important, we explained, because an ACCA penalty may be based only on what a jury \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily found\xe2\x80\x9d to convict a defendant (or what he necessar-ily admitted).  <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 17).  And elements alone fit that bill; a means, or (as we have called it) \xe2\x80\x9cnon-elemental fact,\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cby definition[\xc2\xa0] <i>not </i>necessary to support a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa03, __ (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa03, 15); see <i>supra,</i> at 2.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]<i> </i>Accordingly, <i>Descamps</i> made clear that when the Court had earlier said (and said and said) \xe2\x80\x9celements,\xe2\x80\x9d it meant just that and nothing else.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For that reason, this Court (including Justice Breyer) recently made clear that a court may not look behind the elements of a generally drafted statute to identify the means by which a defendant committed a crime.  See <i>Descamps,</i> 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  Consider if Iowa defined burglary as involving merely an unlawful entry into a \xe2\x80\x9cpremises\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without any further elaboration of the types of premises that exist in the world (<i>e.g., </i>a house, a building, a car, a boat).  Then, all agree, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements-focus would apply.  No matter that the record of a prior conviction clearly indicated that the defendant burgled a house at 122 Maple Road\xe2\x80\x94and that the jury found as much; because Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s (hypothetical) law included an element broader than that of the generic offense, the defendant could not receive an ACCA sentence.  Were that not so, this Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe categorical approach [would be] at an end\xe2\x80\x9d; the court would merely be asking \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a particular set of facts leading to a conviction conforms to a generic ACCA offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 19).  That conclusion is common ground, and must serve as the baseline for anything Justice Breyer (or the Government) here argues.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And contrary to his view, that baseline not only begins but also ends the analysis, because nothing material changes if Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s law further notes (much as it does) that a \xe2\x80\x9cpremises\xe2\x80\x9d may include \xe2\x80\x9ca house, a building, a car, or a boat.\xe2\x80\x9d  That fortuity of legislative drafting affects neither the oddities of applying the categorical approach nor the reasons for doing so.  On the one hand, a categorical inquiry can produce the same counter-intuitive conse-quences however a state law is written.  Whether or not the statute lists various means of satisfying the \xe2\x80\x9cpremises\xe2\x80\x9d element, the record of a prior conviction is just as likely to make plain that the defendant burgled that house on Maple Road and the jury knew it.  On the other hand (and as already shown), the grounds\xe2\x80\x94constitutional, statutory, and equitable\xe2\x80\x94that we have offered for nonetheless using the categorical approach lose none of their force in the switch from a generally phrased statute (leaving means implicit) to a more particular one (expressly enumerating them).  See <i>supra,</i> at 11.  In every relevant sense, both functional and legal, the two statutes\xe2\x80\x94one saying just \xe2\x80\x9cpremises,\xe2\x80\x9d the other listing structures and vehicles\xe2\x80\x94are the same.  And so the same rule must apply: ACCA disregards the means by which the defendant committed his crime, and looks only to that offense\xe2\x80\x99s elements.</p>\n<p style="p-H2">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The first task for a sentencing court faced with an alternatively phrased statute is thus to determine whether its listed items are elements or means.  If they are elements, the court should do what we have previously approved: review the record materials to discover which of the enumerated alternatives played a part in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction, and then compare that element (along with all others) to those of the generic crime.  See <i>ibid.</i>  But if instead they are means, the court has no call to decide which of the statutory alternatives was at issue in the earlier prosecution.  Given ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to how a defendant actually committed a prior offense, the court may ask only whether the <i>elements </i>of the state crime and generic offense make the requisite match.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This threshold inquiry\xe2\x80\x94elements or means?\xe2\x80\x94is easy in this case, as it will be in many others.  Here, a state court decision definitively answers the question: The listed premises in Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary law, the State Supreme Court held, are \xe2\x80\x9calternative method[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of committing one offense, so that a jury need not agree whether the burgled location was a building, other structure, or vehicle.  See <i>Duncan, </i>312 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 523; <i>supra,</i> at 6.  When a ruling of that kind exists, a sentencing judge need only follow what it says.  See <i>Schad</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636 (plurality opinion).  Likewise, the statute on its face may resolve the issue.  If statutory alternatives carry different punishments, then under <i>Apprendi </i>they must be elements.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93203 (2015); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, \xc2\xa71201 (Cum. Supp. 2015); see also 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 490 (requiring a jury to agree on any circumstance increasing a statutory penalty); <i>supra,</i> at 10.  Conversely, if a statutory list is drafted to offer \xe2\x80\x9cillustrative examples,\xe2\x80\x9d then it includes only a crime\xe2\x80\x99s means of commission.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Howard</i>, 742 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334, 1348 (CA11 2014); see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cabrera-Umanzor</i>, 728 F.\xc2\xa03d 347, 353 (CA4 2013).  And a statute may itself identify which things must be charged (and so are elements) and which need not be (and so are means).  See, <i>e.g., </i>Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7952 (West 2008).<i> </i>Armed with such authoritative sources of state law, federal sentencing courts can readily determine the nature of an alternatively phrased list.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And if state law fails to provide clear answers, federal judges have another place to look: the record of a prior conviction itself.  As Judge Kozinski has explained, such a \xe2\x80\x9cpeek at the [record] documents\xe2\x80\x9d is for \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole and limited purpose of determining whether [the listed items are] element[s] of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rendon </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 782 F.\xc2\xa03d 466, 473\xe2\x80\x93474 (CA9 2015) (opinion dissenting from denial of reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  (Only if the answer is yes can the court make further use of the materials, as previously described, see <i>supra,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.)  Suppose, for example, that one count of an indictment and correlative jury instructions charge a defendant with burgling a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding, structure, or vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thus reiterating all the terms of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s law.  That is as clear an indication as any that each alternative is only a possible means of commission, not an element that the prosecutor must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  So too if those documents use a single umbrella term like \xe2\x80\x9cpremises\xe2\x80\x9d: Once again, the record would then reveal what the prosecutor has to (and does not have to) demonstrate to prevail.  See <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 17).  Conversely, an indictment and jury instructions could indicate, by referencing one alternative term to the exclusion of all others, that the statute contains a list of elements, each one of which goes toward a separate crime.  Of course, such record materials will not in every case speak plainly, and if they do not, a sentencing judge will not be able to satisfy \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Taylor</i>\xe2\x80\x99s demand for certainty\xe2\x80\x9d when determining whether a defendant was convicted of a generic offense.  <i>Shepard</i>, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 21.  But between those documents and state law, that kind of indeterminacy should prove more the exception than the rule.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our precedents make this a straightforward case.  For more than 25 years, we have repeatedly made clear that application of ACCA involves, and involves only, comparing elements.  Courts must ask whether the crime of conviction is the same as, or narrower than, the relevant generic offense.  They may not ask whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94his particular means of committing the crime\xe2\x80\x94falls within the generic definition.  And that rule does not change when a statute happens to list possible alternative means of commission: Whether or not made explicit, they remain what they ever were\xe2\x80\x94just the facts, which ACCA (so we have held, over and over) does not care about.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Some have raised concerns about this line of decisions, and suggested to Congress that it reconsider how ACCA is written.

It then goes on to define \xe2\x80\x9coccupied structure\xe2\x80\x9d as including any (1) \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) \xe2\x80\x9cstructure,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) \xe2\x80\x9cland\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle, (4) \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle, or (5) \xe2\x80\x9cair vehicle, or similar place.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7702.12.  The problem arises because, as we have previously held, see <i>Taylor </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575,\n602 (1990)\n, if the structure that an offender unlawfully entered (with intent to commit a felony) was a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d the state crime that he committed counts under the federal statute as \xe2\x80\x9cbur-glary.\xe2\x80\x9d  But if the structure that the offender unlawfully entered was a land, water, or air vehicle, the state crime does not count as a \xe2\x80\x9cburglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, a conviction for violating the state statute may, or may not, count as a \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d depending upon whether the structure that he entered was, say, a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cwater vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, if we look at the court documents charging Mathis with a violation of the state statute, they tell us that he was charged with entering, for example, a \xe2\x80\x9chouse and garage.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 60\xe2\x80\x9373 (charging documents).  They say nothing about any other structure, say, a \xe2\x80\x9cwater vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, to convict him, the jury\xe2\x80\x94which had to find that he unlawfully entered an \xe2\x80\x9coccupied structure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94must have found that he entered a \xe2\x80\x9chouse and garage,\xe2\x80\x9d which concededly count as \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  So why is that not the end of this matter?  Why does the federal statute not apply?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Just to be sure, let us look at how we previously treated an almost identical instance.  In <i>Taylor</i>, a state statute made criminal the \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking and entering [of] a building, booth, tent, boat, or railroad car.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 579, n.\xc2\xa01.  We explained that breaking into a building would amount to \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under the federal statute, but breaking into a railroad car would not.  But the conviction document itself said only that the offender had violated the statute; it did not say whether he broke into a building or a railroad car.  See <i>id.,</i> at 598\xe2\x80\x93602.  We said that in such a case the federal sentencing judge could look at the charging papers and the jury instructions in the state case to try to determine what the state conviction was actually for: building, tent, or railroad car.  We wrote that</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cin a State whose burglary statutes include entry of an automobile as well as a building, if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building, and that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to convict, then the Government should be allowed to use the conviction for enhancement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 602.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">(We later added that where a conviction rests upon an offender\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea, the federal judge can look to the facts that the offender admitted at his plea colloquy for the same purpose.

The State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cburglary statut[e] include[s] entry\xe2\x80\x9d of a vehicle as well as a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602. <i> </i>The conviction document might not specify what kind of a structure the defendant entered (<i>i.e.,</i> whether a building or an automobile).  But the federal sentencing judge can look at the charging documents (or plea colloquy) to see whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And here that was so.  In addition, since the charging documents show that the defendant was charged only with illegal entry of a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not a tent or a railroad car\xe2\x80\x94the jury, in order to find (as it did) that the defendant broke into an occupied structure, would \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily [have] had to find an entry of a building.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Hence, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government should be allowed to use the conviction for enhancement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority, however, does not agree that the two cases I have described are almost identical.  To the con-trary, it notes correctly that our precedent often uses the word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the relevant facts to which a statute refers when it uses words such as \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cboat,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crailroad car.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  It points out that, here, the Iowa Supreme Court described those words as referring, not to \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime, but rather to \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d through which a crime was committed.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  And that fact, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, makes all the difference.  See <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9316.  But why?  I, of course, see that there is a distinction between means and elements in the abstract, but\xe2\x80\x94for sentencing pur-poses\xe2\x80\x94I believe that it is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I begin with a point about terminology.  All the relevant words in this case, such as \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstructure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwater vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like, are statutory words.  Moreover, the statute uses those words to help describe a crime.  Further, the statute always uses those words to designate <i>facts</i>.  Whether the offender broke into a building is a fact; whether he broke into a water vehicle is a fact.  Sometimes, however, a State may treat certain of those facts as elements of a crime.  And sometimes a State may treat certain of those facts as means of committing a crime.  So far, everyone should agree.  See <i>Richardson </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813,\n817 (1999)\n (describing both \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where we disagree is whether that difference, relevant to the application of state law, should make a difference for federal sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Whether a State considers the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cboat\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d to describe elements of a crime or a means of committing a crime can make a difference for purposes of applying the State\xe2\x80\x99s criminal law, but it should not make a difference in respect to the sentencing question at issue here.  The majority, I believe, reasons something like this: Suppose the jury unanimously agreed that the defendant unlawfully entered some kind of structure with felonious intent, but the jury is deadlocked six to six as to whether that structure is (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cboat\xe2\x80\x9d or (2) a \xe2\x80\x9chouse.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the statute uses those two words to describe two different elements of two different crimes\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> (1) breaking into a boat, and (2) breaking into a house\xe2\x80\x94then the defendant wins, for the jury has not found unanimously each element of either crime.  But if the statute uses those two words to describe two different means of committing the same crime\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>breaking into an occupied structure that consists of either a house or a boat\xe2\x80\x94then the defendant loses, for (as long as the jury decides unanimously that the defendant broke into an occupied structure of whichever kind) the jury need not decide unanimously which particular means the defendant used to commit the crime.  See <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I accept that reasoning.  But I do not see what it has to do with sentencing.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the label \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d opens up the possibility of a six-to-six jury split, and it believes that fact would prevent us from knowing whether the conviction was for breaking into a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cboat.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  But precisely the same is true were we to use the label \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the facts set forth in the state statute.  The federal sentencing judge may see on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s record a conviction for violating a particular provision of the state criminal code; that code may list in a single sentence both \xe2\x80\x9cbuildings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cboats\xe2\x80\x9d; the State may interpret the two words as separate elements of two separate crimes; and the federal judge will not know from the simple fact of conviction for violating the statute (without more) which of the two crimes was at issue (that is, was it the one aimed at burglaries of buildings, or the one aimed at burglaries of boats?).  That is why the Court said in <i>Taylor</i> that in such a case the federal judge may look to the \xe2\x80\x9cindictment or information and jury instructions\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a boat, \xe2\x80\x9cto convict.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602.  If so, the federal judge may count the conviction as falling within the federal statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d and use it for sentencing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, precisely the same is true if the state courts label the statute-mentioned facts (\xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cboat,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.) as \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9celements.\xe2\x80\x9d  The federal judge should be able to \xe2\x80\x9clook .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to\xe2\x80\x9d the charging documents and the plea agreement to see if \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a boat, \xe2\x80\x9cto convict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>If so, the federal judge should be able to count the conviction as a federal-statute \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d conviction and use it for sentencing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, sometimes the charging documents will not give us the answer to the question.  But often they will.  If, for example, the charging document accuses Smith of breaking and entering into a house (and does not mention any other structure), then (1) the jury had to find unanimously that he broke into a \xe2\x80\x9chouse,\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d is an element, and (2) the jury had to find unanimously that he broke into a \xe2\x80\x9chouse,\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d is the only means charged.  (Otherwise the jury would not have unanimously found that he broke into an \xe2\x80\x9coccupied structure,\xe2\x80\x9d which is an element of the statutory crime.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Suppose, for example, that breaking into a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d is an element of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary crime; and suppose the State charges that Smith broke into a building located in Des Moines (and presents evidence at trial concerning only a Des Moines offense), but the jury returns its verdict on a special-verdict form showing that six jurors voted for guilt on the theory that he broke into a building located in Detroit\xe2\x80\x94not Des Moines.  The conviction would fail (at least in Iowa), would it not?  See, <i>e.g., State </i>v. <i>Bratthauer</i>, 354 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 774, 776 (Iowa 1984) (\xe2\x80\x9c<i>If substantial evidence is presented to support each alternative method of committing a single crime</i>, and the alternatives are not repugnant to each other, <i>then</i> unanimity of the jury as to the mode of commission of the crime is not required.  At the root of this standard is the principle that the unanimity rule requires jurors to be in substantial agreement as to just what a defendant did as a step preliminary to determining whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added; citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Similarly, we would know that\xe2\x80\x94if the charging documents claim only that the defendant broke into a house, and the Government presented proof only of that kind of burglary\xe2\x80\x94the jury had to find unanimously that he broke into a house, not a boat.  And that is so whether state law considers the statutory word \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d to be an element or a means.  I have not found any nonfanciful example to the contrary.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Consider the federal statute before us\xe2\x80\x94the statute that contains the word \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from a more general sentencing perspective.  By way of background, it is important to understand that, as a general matter, any sentencing system must embody a host of compromises between theory and practicality.  From the point of view of pure theory, there is much to be said for \xe2\x80\x9creal offense\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing.  Such a system would require a commission or a sentencing judge to determine in some detail \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual conduct in which the defendant engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.,</i> what the defendant really did now and in the past.  United States Sentencing Commission (USSC), Guidelines Manual ch. 1, pt. A, p. 5 (Nov. 2015).  Such a system would produce greater certainty that two offenders who engaged in (and had previously engaged in) the same real conduct would be punished similarly.  See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Pure \xe2\x80\x9creal offense\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing, however, is too complex to work.  It requires a sentencing judge (or a sentencing commission) to know all kinds of facts that are difficult to discover as to present conduct and which a present sentencing judge could not possibly know when he or she seeks to determine what conduct underlies a prior conviction.  Because of these practical difficulties, the USSC created Guidelines that in part reflect a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge offense\xe2\x80\x9d system, a system based \xe2\x80\x9cupon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>A pure \xe2\x80\x9ccharge offense\xe2\x80\x9d system, however, also has serious problems.  It can place great authority to determine a sentence in the hands of the prosecutor, not the judge, creating the very nonuniformity that a commission would hope to minimize.  Hence, the actual federal sentencing system retains \xe2\x80\x9ca significant number of real offense elements,\xe2\x80\x9d allowing adjustments based upon the facts of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <i>Id.,</i> at 6.  And the Commission is currently looking for new ways to create a better compromise.  See, <i>e.g., </i>USSC, Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, at 24 (Apr. 2016) (effective Nov. 1, 2016) (creating a \xe2\x80\x9csentence-imposed model for determining\xe2\x80\x9d whether prior convictions count for sentence-enhancement purposes in the context of certain immigration crimes).</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With this background in mind, turn to the federal statute before us.  The statute, reflecting the impossibility of knowing in detail the conduct that underlies a prior conviction, uses (in certain cases involving possession of weapons) the fact of certain convictions (including convictions for burglary) as (conclusive) indications that the present defendant has previously engaged in highly undesirable conduct.  And, for the general reasons earlier described, it is practical considerations, not a general theory, that would prevent Congress from listing the specific prior conduct that would warrant a higher present sentence.  Practical considerations, particularly of administration, can explain why Congress did not tell the courts precisely how to apply its statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cburglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  And similar practical considerations can help explain why this Court, in <i>Taylor</i> and later cases, described a modified categorical approach for separating the sheep from the goats.  Those cases recognize that sentencing judges have limited time, they have limited information about prior convictions, and\xe2\x80\x94within practical constraints\xe2\x80\x94they must try to determine whether a prior conviction reflects the kind of behavior that Congress intended its proxy (<i>i.e.,</i> \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d) to cover.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, I fear, is not practical.  Perhaps the statutes of a few States say whether words like \xe2\x80\x9cboat\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d stand for an element of a crime or a means to commit a crime.  I do not know.  I do know, however, that many States have burglary statutes that look very much like the Iowa statute before us today.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Colo. Rev.

I also know that there are very few States where one can find authoritative judicial opinions that decide the means/element question.  In fact, the Government told us at oral argument that it had found only \xe2\x80\x9ctwo States\xe2\x80\x9d that, in the context of burglary, had answered the means/elements question.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 45; see <i>id.,</i> at 37.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The lack of information is not surprising.  After all, a prosecutor often will charge just one (<i>e.g.,</i> a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d) of several statutory alternatives.  See <i>Descamps </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6).  A jury that convicts, then, would normally have to agree unanimously about the existence of that particular fact.  See <i>Richardson</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 818 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur decision [whether something is an element or a means] will make a difference where .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Government introduces evidence that the defendant has committed more underlying drug crimes than legally necessary to make up a \xe2\x80\x98series\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence, it will not matter for that particular case whether the State, as a general matter, would categorize that fact (to which the statute refers) as an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d or as a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, what is a federal sentencing judge to do when facing a state statute that refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cboat,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccar,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.?  The charging documents will not answer the question, for\xe2\x80\x94like the documents at issue here\xe2\x80\x94they will simply charge entry into, say, a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d without more.  But see <i>ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (suggesting that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s charging documents <i>will</i> often answer the question).  The parties will have to look to other state cases to decide whether that fact is a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d or an \xe2\x80\x9celement.\xe2\x80\x9d  That research will take time and is likely not to come up with an answer.  What was once a simple matter will produce a time-consuming legal tangle.  See, <i>e.g., State</i> v. <i>Peterson</i>, 168 Wash. 2d 763, 769, 230 P.\xc2\xa03d 588, 591 (2010) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98There is simply no bright-line rule by which the courts can determine whether the legislature intended to provide alternate means of committing a particular crime.  Instead, each case must be evaluated on its own merits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (brackets omitted)); <i>State</i> v. <i>Brown</i>, 295 Kan. 181, 192, 284 P.\xc2\xa03d 977, 987 (2012) (the \xe2\x80\x9calternative means\xe2\x80\x9d definition is \xe2\x80\x9cmind-bending in its application\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is why lower court judges have criticized the approach the majority now adopts.  See, <i>e.g., Omargharib</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 775 F.\xc2\xa03d 192, 200 (CA4 2014) (Niemeyer, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the ever-morphing analysis and the increasingly blurred articulation of applicable standards, we are being asked to decide, without clear and workable standards, whether disjunctive phrases in a criminal law define alternative elements of a crime or alternative means of committing it .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  I find it espe-cially difficult to comprehend the distinction\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority bases its conclusion primarily upon precedent.  In my view, precedent does not demand the conclusion that the majority reaches.  I agree with the majority that our cases on the subject have all used the word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d in contexts similar to the present context.  But that fact is hardly surprising, for all the cases in which that word appears involved elements\xe2\x80\x94or at least the Court assumed that was so.  See <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (slip op., at 8, n.\xc2\xa02).  In each of those cases, the Court used the word generally, simply to refer to the matter at issue, without stating or suggesting any view about the subject of the present case.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (\xe2\x80\x9cSentencing courts may look only to the statutory definitions\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> the elements\xe2\x80\x94of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior offenses\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Shepard</i>, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (using the terms \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory definition\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory elements\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably); <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n offense constitutes \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes of [the Armed Career Criminal Act] if either its statutory definition substantially corresponds to \xe2\x80\x98generic\xe2\x80\x99 burglary, or the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of ge-neric burglary\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The genius of the common law consists in part in its ability to modify a prior holding in light of new circumstances, particularly where, as Justice Holmes said, an existing principle runs up against a different principle that requires such modification.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 457, 469 (1897).  <i>A fortiori</i>, we should not apply this Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of a word in a prior case\xe2\x80\x94a word that was not necessary to the decision of the prior case, and not intended to set forth a generally applicable rule\xe2\x80\x94to a new circumstance that differs signifi-cantly in respect to both circumstances and the legal question at issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Does <i>Apprendi </i>v. <i>New Jersey</i>, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S 466 (2000), require the majority\xe2\x80\x99s result here?

The State must prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully entered a garage.  And that is so, whether the statute uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cgarage\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a fact that is a means or a fact that is an element.  If the charging papers simply said \xe2\x80\x9coccupied structure,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving the jury free to disagree about whether that structure was a \xe2\x80\x9cgarage\xe2\x80\x9d or was, instead, a \xe2\x80\x9cboat,\xe2\x80\x9d then we lack the necessary assurance about jury unanimity; and the sentencing judge consequently cannot use that conviction as a basis for an increased federal sentence.  And that is true whether the state statute, when using the words \xe2\x80\x9cgarage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cboat,\xe2\x80\x9d intends them to refer to a fact that is a means or a fact that is an element.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What about <i>Descamps</i>?

The statute made no distinction between (1) lawful entry (<i>e.g.,</i> entering a department store before closing time) and (2) unlawful entry (<i>e.g.,</i> breaking into a store after it has closed).  See <i>ibid.</i>  The difference matters because unlawful entry is a critical constituent of the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s version of \xe2\x80\x9cburglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the entry is lawful, the crime does not fall within the scope of that word.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We held that a conviction under this statute did not count as a \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d for federal purposes.  We reasoned that the statute required the Government only to prove \xe2\x80\x9centry,\xe2\x80\x9d that there was no reason to believe that charging documents would say whether the entry was lawful or unlawful, and that, \xe2\x80\x9cmost important[ly],\xe2\x80\x9d even if they did, the jury did not have to decide that the entry was unlawful in order to convict (that is, any description in the charging document that would imply or state that the entry was illegal, say, at 2:00 in the morning, would be coincidental).  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 18); see <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, by way of contrast, the charging documents must allege entry into an \xe2\x80\x9coccupied structure,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d can consist of one of several statutory alternatives.  Iowa Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.1, 702.12.  The present law thus bears little resemblance to the hypothetical statute the majority describes.  That hypothetical statute makes it a crime to break into a \xe2\x80\x9cpremises\xe2\x80\x9d without saying more.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Thus, to apply the federal sentencing statute to such a nonspecific, hypothetical statute would require sentencing judges to \xe2\x80\x9cimaginatively transfor[m]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cevery element of [the] statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. so that [the] crime is seen as containing an infinite number of sub-crimes corresponding to \xe2\x80\x98all the possible ways an individual can commit\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the crime\xe2\x80\x94an impossibly difficult task.  <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the Iowa statute before us contains explicit (not hypothetical) statutory alternatives, and therefore it is likely (not unlikely) that the charging documents will list one or more of these alternatives.  Indeed, that is the case with each of Mathis\xe2\x80\x99 charging documents.  See App. 60\xe2\x80\x9373.  And if the charging documents list only one of these alternatives, say, a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding,\xe2\x80\x9d the jury normally would have to find unanimously that the defendant entered into a building in order to convict.  See <i>Bratthauer</i>, 354 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 776.  To repeat my central point: In my view, it is well within our precedent to count a state burglary conviction as a \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the federal law where (1) the <i>statute</i> at issue lists the alternative means by which a defendant can commit the crime (<i>e.g., </i>burgling a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cboat\xe2\x80\x9d) and (2) the <i>charging documents</i> make clear that the state alleged (and the jury or trial judge necessarily found) only an alternative that matches the federal version of the crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Descamps</i> was not that kind of case.  It concerned a statute that did not explicitly list alternative means for commission of the crime.  And it concerned a fact extraneous to the crime\xe2\x80\x94the fact (whether entry into the burgled structure was lawful or unlawful) was neither a statutory means nor an element.  As the Court in that case described it, the fact at issue was, under the state statute, a \xe2\x80\x9clegally extraneous circumstanc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case.  570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  But this case concerns a fact necessary to the crime (regardless of whether the Iowa Supreme Court generally considers that fact to be a means or an element).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Precedent, by the way, also includes <i>Taylor</i>.  And, as I have pointed out, <i>Taylor</i> says that the modified categorical approach it sets forth may \xe2\x80\x9cpermit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602.  <i>Taylor</i> is the precedent that I believe governs here.  Because the majority takes a different view, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</i></div><i>\n</i></div><i>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3589825">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 15\xe2\x80\x936092</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">RICHARD MATHIS, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 23, 2016]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Alito, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sabine Moreau lives in Solre-sur-Sambre, a town in Belgium located 38 miles south of Brussels.  One day she set out in her car to pick up a friend at the Brussels train station, a trip that should have taken under an hour.  She programmed her GPS and headed off.  Although the GPS sent her south, not north, she apparently thought nothing of it.  She dutifully stayed on the prescribed course.  Nor was she deterred when she saw road signs in German for Cologne, Aachen, and Frankfurt.  \xe2\x80\x9cI asked myself no questions,\xe2\x80\x9d she later recounted.  \xe2\x80\x9cI kept my foot down.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hours passed.  After crossing through Germany, she entered Austria.  Twice she stopped to refuel her car.  She was involved in a minor traffic accident.  When she tired, she pulled over and slept in her car.  She crossed the Alps, drove through Slovenia, entered Croatia, and finally arrived in Zagreb\xe2\x80\x94two days and 900 miles after leaving her home.  Either she had not properly set her GPS or the device had malfunctioned.  But Ms. Moreau apparently refused to entertain that thought until she arrived in the Croatian capital.  Only then, she told reporters, did she realize that she had gone off course, and she called home, where the police were investigating her disappearance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Twenty-six years ago, in <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575,\n602 (1990)\n, this Court set out on a journey like Ms. Moreau\xe2\x80\x99s.  Our task in <i>Taylor</i>, like Ms. Moreau\xe2\x80\x99s short trip to the train station, might not seem very difficult\xe2\x80\x94determining when a conviction for burglary counts as a prior conviction for burglary under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e).  But things have not worked out that way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress enacted ACCA to ensure that violent repeat criminal offenders could be subject to enhanced penalties\xe2\x80\x94that is, longer prison sentences\xe2\x80\x94in a fair and uniform way across States with myriad criminal laws.  See <i>Descamps</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  ACCA calls for an enhanced sentence when a defendant, who has three or more prior convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d is found guilty of possession of a firearm.  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  And ACCA provides that the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d means, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).  In other words, \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d = \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While this language might seem straightforward, <i>Taylor</i> introduced two complications.  First, <i>Taylor</i> held that \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA means offenses that have the elements of what the Court called \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d burglary, defined as unlawfully entering or remaining in a building or structure with the intent to commit a crime.  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598.  This definition is broader than that of the common law but does not include every offense that States have labeled burglary, such as the burglary of a boat or vehicle.  Second, <i>Taylor</i> and subsequent cases have limited the ability of sentencing judges to examine the record in prior cases for the purpose of determining whether the convictions in those cases were for \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., Shepard</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13,\n26 (2005)\n.  We have called this the \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Descamps</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Programmed in this way, the Court set out on a course that has increasingly led to results that Congress could not have intended.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  And finally, the Court arrives at today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the upshot of which is that all burglary convictions in a great many States may be disqualified from counting as predicate offenses under ACCA.  This conclusion should set off a warning bell.  Congress indisputably wanted burglary to count under ACCA; our course has led us to the conclusion that, in many States, no burglary conviction will count; maybe we made a wrong turn at some point (or perhaps the Court is guided by a malfunctioning navigator).  But the Court is unperturbed by its anomalous result.  Serenely chanting its mantra, \xe2\x80\x9cElements,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>ante</i>, at 8, the Court keeps its foot down and drives on.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach calls for sentencing judges to delve into pointless abstract questions.  In <i>Descamps</i>, the Court gave sentencing judges the assignment of determining whether a state statute is \xe2\x80\x9cdivisible.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  When I warned that this novel inquiry would prove to be difficult, the opinion of the Court brushed off that concern, see <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa02) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e can see no real-world reason to worry\xe2\x80\x9d).  But lower court judges, who must regularly grapple with the modified categorical approach, struggled to understand <i>Descamps</i>.  Compare <i>Rendon</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 764 F.\xc2\xa03d 1077, 1084\xe2\x80\x931090 (CA9 2014) (panel opinion), with 782 F.\xc2\xa03d 466, 466\xe2\x80\x93473 (CA9 2015) (eight judges dissenting from denial of reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc), and <i>id.,</i> at 473\xe2\x80\x93474 (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc).  Now the Court tells them they must decide whether entering or remaining in a building is an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of committing a crime or merely a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d of doing so.  I wish them good luck.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The distinction between an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d is important in a very different context: The requisite number of jurors (all 12 in most jurisdictions) must agree that a defendant committed each element of an offense, but the jurors need not agree on the means by which an element was committed.  So if entering or remaining <i>in a building</i> is an element, the jurors must agree that the defendant entered or remained in a <i>building</i> and not, say, a boat.  But if the element is entering or remaining within one of a list of places specified in the statute (say, building, boat, vehicle, tent), then entering or remaining in a building is simply a means.  Jurors do not need to agree on the means by which an offense is committed, and therefore whether a defendant illegally entered a building or a boat would not matter for purposes of obtaining a conviction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the real world, there are not many cases in which the state courts are required to decide whether jurors in a burglary case must agree on the building vs. boat issue, so the question whether buildings and boats are elements or means does not often arise.  As a result, state-court cases on the question are rare.  The Government has surveyed all the state burglary statutes and has found only one\xe2\x80\x94Iowa, the State in which petitioner was convicted for burglary\xe2\x80\x94in which the status of the places covered as elements or means is revealed.  See Brief for United States 43, and n.\xc2\xa013.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys have not cited a similar decision from any other State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">How, then, are federal judges sentencing under ACCA to make the element/means determination?  The Court writes: \xe2\x80\x9cThis threshold inquiry\xe2\x80\x94elements or means?\xe2\x80\x94is easy in this case, as it will be in many others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 17.  Really?[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  The determination is easy in this case only because the fortified legal team that took over petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s representation after this Court granted review found an Iowa case on point, but this discovery does not seem to have been made until the preparation of the brief filed in this Court.  Brief for United States 43, and n. 13.  \xe2\x80\x9cPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s belated identification of a relevant state decision confirms that the task is not an easy one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  And that is not the worst of it.  Although many States have bur-glary statutes like Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s that apply to the burglary of places other than a building, neither the Government nor petitioner has found a single case in any of these jurisdictions resolving the question whether the place burglarized is an element or a means.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court assures the federal district judges who must apply ACCA that they do not need such state-court decisions, that it will be easy for federal judges to predict how state courts would resolve this question if it was ever presented to them.  <i>Ante</i>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  But the Court has not shown how this can be done.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief cites numerous state statutes like Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s.  Brief for United States 42, n. 12.  If this task is so easy, let the Court pick a few of those States and give the lower court judges a demonstration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Picking up an argument tossed off by Judge Kozinski, the Court argues that a federal sentencing judge can get a sense of whether the places covered by a state burglary statute are separate elements or means by examining the charging document.  <i>Ante</i>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing <i>Rendon</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 473\xe2\x80\x93474 (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc)).  If, for example, the charging document alleges that the defendant burglarized a house, that is a clue, according to the Court, that \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d is an element.  See <i>ibid</i>.  I pointed out the problem with this argument in <i>Descamps</i>.  See 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  State rules and practices regarding the wording of charging documents differ, and just because something is specifically alleged in such a document, it does not follow that this item is an element and not just a means.  See <i>ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The present case illustrates my point.  Petitioner has five prior burglary convictions in Iowa.  In Iowa, the places covered are \xe2\x80\x9cmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante</i>, at 13.  Yet the charging documents in all these cases set out the specific places that petitioner burglarized\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9chouse and garage,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cgarage,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cmachine shed,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cstorage shed.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Petitioner 9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A real-world approach would avoid the mess that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will produce.  Allow a sentencing court to take a look at the record in the earlier case to see if the place that was burglarized was a building or something else.  If the record is lost or inconclusive, the court could refuse to count the conviction.  But where it is perfectly clear that a building was burglarized, count the conviction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority disdains such practicality, and as a result it refuses to allow a burglary conviction to be counted even when the record makes it clear beyond any possible doubt that the defendant committed generic burglary.  Consider this hypothetical case.  Suppose that a defendant wishes to plead guilty to burglary, and the following occurs in open court on the record at the time of the plea:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">PROSECUTOR: I am informed that the defendant wishes to plead guilty to the charge set out in the complaint, namely, \xe2\x80\x9con June 27, 2016, he broke into a house at 10 Main Street with the intent to commit larceny.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">DEFENSE COUNSEL: That is correct.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">COURT: Mr. Defendant, what did you do?</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">DEFENDANT: I broke into a house to steal money and jewelry.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">COURT: Was that the house at 10 Main St.?</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">DEFENDANT: That\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">COURT: Now, are you sure about that?
