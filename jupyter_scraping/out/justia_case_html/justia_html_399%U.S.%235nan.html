CHIEF JUSTICE  BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This appeal from Illinois presents an important question involving a claim of discriminatory treatment based upon financial inability to pay a fine and court costs imposed in a criminal case.  The narrow issue raised is whether an indigent may be continued in confinement beyond the maximum term specified by statute because of his failure to satisfy the monetary provisions of the sentence.  We noted probable jurisdiction [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and set the case for oral argument with No. 782, <em>Morris v. Schoonfield, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/508/case.html">399 U. S. 508</a></span>, also decided today.</p>\n<p>On August 16, 1967, appellant was convicted of petty theft, and received the maximum sentence provided by state law:  one year imprisonment and a $500 fine. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Appellant was also taxed $5 in court costs.  The judgment directed, as permitted by statute, that, if appellant was in default of the payment of the fine and court costs at the expiration of the one-year sentence, he should remain in jail pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1-7(k) of the Illinois Criminal Code to "work off" the monetary obligations at the rate of $5 per day. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Thus, whereas the maximum term of imprisonment for petty theft was one year, the effect of the sentence imposed here required appellant to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 399 U. S. 237</a></p><p> confined for 101 days beyond the maximum period of confinement fixed by the statute, since he could not pay the fine and costs of $505.</p>\n<p>On November 29, 1967, appellant, while still an inmate in the county jail, petitioned the sentencing judge [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] to vacate that portion of the order requiring that he remain imprisoned upon expiration of his one-year sentence because of nonpayment of the fine and court costs.  Appellant alleged that he was indigent at all stages of the proceeding, was without funds or property to satisfy the money portion of the sentence, and that he would "be able to get a job and earn funds to pay the fine and costs if . . . released from jail upon expiration of his one-year sentence."  The State did not dispute the factual allegations, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and the trial court granted the State\'s motion to dismiss the petition</p>\n<p>"for the reason that [appellant] was not legally entitled at that time to the relief requested . . . , because he still has time to serve on his jail sentence, and, when that sentence has been served, his financial ability to pay a fine might not be the same as it is of the date [of sentencing]. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 399 U. S. 238</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appeal was taken directly to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which appears to have rejected any suggestion by the trial court that the petition was premature, and went on to decide appellant\'s constitutional claim on the merits.  It held that "there is no denial of equal protection of the law when an indigent defendant is imprisoned to satisfy payment of the fine."  <em>People v. Williams,</em> 41 Ill.2d 511, 517, 244 N.E.2d 197, 200 (1969). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to renewing the constitutional argument rejected by the state courts, appellant advances a host of other claims [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] which, in light of our disposition, we find unnecessary to reach or decide.  Appellant challenges the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 1-7(k) of the Illinois Criminal Code, and argues primarily that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits imprisonment of an indigent beyond the maximum term authorized by the statute governing the substantive offense when that imprisonment flows directly from his present inability to pay a fine and court costs.  In response, the State asserts its interest in the collection of revenues produced by payment of fines, and contends that a "work-off" system, as provided by \xc2\xa7 1-7(k), is a rational means of implementing that policy.  That interest is substantial and legitimate, but, for present purposes, it is not unlike the State\'s interest in collecting a fine from an indigent person in circumstances where no imprisonment is included in the judgment.  The State argues further that the statute is not constitutionally infirm simply because the legislature could have achieved the same result </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 399 U. S. 239</a></p><p> by some other means.  With that general proposition, we have no quarrel, but that generality does not resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>As noted earlier, appellant\'s incarceration beyond the statutory maximum stems from separate, albeit related, reasons:  nonpayment of a fine and nonpayment of court costs.  We find that neither of those grounds can constitutionally support the type of imprisonment imposed here, but we treat the fine and costs together, because disposition of the claim on fines governs our disposition on costs. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The custom of imprisoning a convicted defendant for nonpayment of fines date back to medieval England, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and has long been practiced in this country.  At the present time, almost all States and the Federal Government have statutes authorizing incarceration under such circumstances.  Most States permit imprisonment beyond the maximum term allowed by law, and, in some, there is no limit on the length of time one may serve for nonpayment. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  While neither the antiquity of a practice nor the fact of steadfast legislative and judicial adherence to it through the centuries insulates it from constitutional attack, these factors should be weighed in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 399 U. S. 240</a></p><p> he balance. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Indeed, in prior cases, this Court seems to have tacitly approved incarceration to "work-off" unpaid fines.  <em>See Hill v. Wampler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/460/case.html">298 U. S. 460</a></span> (1936); <em>Ex parte Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/727/case.html">96 U. S. 727</a></span> (1878). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The need to be open to reassessment of ancient practices other than those explicitly mandated by the Constitution is illustrated by the present case, since the greatly increased use of fines as a criminal sanction has made nonpayment a major cause of incarceration in this country. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Default imprisonment has traditionally been justified on the ground that it is a coercive device to ensure obedience to the judgment of the court. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, commitment for failure to pay has not been viewed as a part of the punishment or as an increase in the penalty; rather, it has been viewed as a means of enabling the court to enforce collection of money that a convicted defendant was obligated by the sentence to pay.  The additional imprisonment, it has been said, may always be avoided by payment of the fine. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We conclude that, when the aggregate imprisonment exceeds the maximum period fixed by the statute, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 399 U. S. 241</a></p><p> results directly from an involuntary nonpayment of a fine or court costs we are confronted with an impermissible discrimination that rests on ability to pay, and, accordingly, we vacate the judgment below.</p>\n<p><em>Griffin v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html">351 U. S. 12</a></span> (1956), marked a significant effort to alleviate discrimination against those who are unable to meet the costs of litigation in the administration of criminal justice.  In holding that the failure to provide an indigent criminal defendant with a trial transcript at public expense in order to prosecute an appeal was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, this Court declared the "[t]here can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html#19">351 U. S. 19</a></span>.  In the years since the <em>Griffin</em> case, the Court has had frequent occasion to reaffirm allegiance to the basic command that justice be applied equally to all persons. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Subsequent decisions of this Court have pointedly demonstrated that the passage of time has heightened, rather than weakened, the attempts to mitigate the disparate treatment of indigents in the criminal process. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Applying the teaching of the <em>Griffin</em> case here, we conclude that an indigent criminal defendant may not be imprisoned in default of payment of a fine beyond the maximum authorized by the statute regulating the substantive offense.</p>\n<p>A State has wide latitude in fixing the punishment for state crimes.  Thus, appellant doe not assert that Illinois could not have appropriately fixed the penalty, in the first instance, at one year and 101 days.  Nor has the claim been advanced that the sentence imposed was excessive in light of the circumstances of the commission of this particular offense.  However, once the State has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 399 U. S. 242</a></p><p> defined the outer limits of incarceration necessary to satisfy its penological interests and policies, it may not then subject a certain class of convicted defendants to a period of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of their indigency.</p>\n<p>It is clear, of course, that the sentence was not imposed upon appellant because of his indigency, but because he had committed a crime.  And the Illinois statutory scheme does not distinguish between defendants on the basis of ability to pay fines.  But, as we said in <em>Griffin v. Illinois,  supra,</em> "a law nondiscriminatory on its face may be grossly discriminatory in its operation."   <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html#17">351 U. S. 17</a></span> n. 11.  Here, the Illinois statute, as applied to Williams, works an invidious discrimination solely because he is unable to pay the fine.  On its face, the statute extends to all defendants an apparently equal opportunity for limiting confinement to the statutory maximum simply by satisfying a money judgment.  In fact, this is an illusory choice for Williams or any indigent who, by definition, is without funds. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Since only a convicted person with access to funds can avoid the increased imprisonment, the Illinois statute, in operative effect, exposes only indigents to the risk of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum.  By making the maximum confinement contingent upon one\'s ability to pay, the State has visited different consequences on two categories of persons, since the result is to make incarceration in excess of the statutory maximum applicable only to those without the requisite resources to satisfy the money portion of the judgment. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 399 U. S. 243</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The mere fact that an indigent in a particular case may be imprisoned for a longer time than a non-indigent convicted of the same offense does not, of course, give rise to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Sentencing judges are vested with wide discretion in the exceedingly difficult task of determining the appropriate punishment in the countless variety of situations that appear.  The Constitution permits qualitative differences in meting out punishment, and there is no requirement that two persons convicted of the same offense receive identical sentences.  Thus it was that, in <em>Williams v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/case.html">337 U. S. 241</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/case.html#247">337 U. S. 247</a></span> (1949), we said:</p>\n<p>"The belief no longer prevails that every offence in a like legal category calls for an identical punishment, without regard to the past life and habits of a particular offender."</p>\n<p>Nothing in today\'s decision curtails the sentencing prerogative of a judge, because, as noted previously, the sovereign\'s purpose in confining an indigent beyond the statutory maximum is to provide a coercive means of collecting or "working out" a fine.  After having taken into consideration the wide range of factors underlying the exercise of his sentencing function, nothing we now hold precludes a judge from imposing on an indigent, as on any defendant, the maximum penalty prescribed by law.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasis that our holding does not deal with a judgment of confinement for nonpayment of a fine in the familiar pattern of alternative sentence of "$30 or 30 days."  We hold only that a State may not constitutionally imprison beyond the maximum duration fixed by statute a defendant who is financially unable to pay a fine.  A statute permitting a sentence of both imprisonment and fine cannot be parlayed into a longer term of imprisonment than is fixed by the statute, since to do so would be to accomplish indirectly as to an indigent that which cannot be done directly.  We have no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 399 U. S. 244</a></p><p> occasion to reach the question whether a State is precluded in any other circumstances from holding an indigent accountable for a fine by use of a penal sanction.  We hold only that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the statutory ceiling placed on imprisonment for any substantive offense be the same for all defendants, irrespective of their economic status. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>The State is not powerless to enforce judgments against those financially unable to pay a fine; indeed, a different result would amount to inverse discrimination, since it would enable an indigent to avoid both the fine and imprisonment for nonpayment, whereas other defendants must always suffer one or the other conviction.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary for us to canvass the numerous alternatives to which the State, by legislative enactment -- or judges within the scope of their authority -- may resort in order to avoid imprisoning an indigent beyond the statutory maximum for involuntary nonpayment of a fine or court costs.  Appellant has suggested several plans, some of which are already utilized in some State, while others resemble those proposed by various studies. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 399 U. S. 245</a></p><p> is free to choose from among the variety of solutions already proposed and, of course, it may devise new ones. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>We are not unaware that today\'s holding may place a further burden on States in administering criminal justice.  Perhaps a fairer and more accurate statement would be that new cases expose old infirmities which apathy or absence of challenge has permitted to stand.  But the constitutional imperatives of the Equal Protection Clause must have priority over the comfortable convenience of the <em>status quo.</em></p>\n<p>"Any supposed administrative inconvenience would be minimal, since . . . [the unpaid portion of the judgment] could be reached through the ordinary process of garnishment in the event of default."</p>\n<p><em>Rinaldi v. Yeager,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/305/case.html">384 U.

S. 310</a></span> (1966).</p>\n<p>Nothing we hold today limits the power of the sentencing judge to impose alternative sanctions permitted by Illinois law; the definition of such alternatives, if any, lies with the Illinois courts.  We therefore vacate the judgment appealed from and remand to the Supreme Court of Illinois for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

I, for one, would prefer to judge the legislation before us in this case in terms of due process, that is to determine whether it arbitrarily infringes a constitutionally protected interest of this appellant.

I need not retrace the views expressed in these cases, except to object once again to this rhetorical preoccupation with "equalizing," rather than analyzing the rationality of the legislative distinction in relation to legislative purpose.</p>\n<p>An analysis under due process standards, correctly understood, is, in my view, more conducive to judicial restraint than an approach couched in slogans and ringing phrases, such as "suspect" classification or "invidious" distinctions, or "compelling" state interest, that blur analysis by shifting the focus away from the nature of the individual interest affected, the extent to which it is affected, the rationality of the connection between legislative means and purpose, the existence of alternative means for effectuating the purpose, and the degree of confidence we may have that the statute reflects the legislative concern for the purpose that would legitimately support the means chosen.  Accordingly, I turn to the case at hand.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The State of Illinois has made the unquestionably legitimate determination that the crime of petty larceny </p><p><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 399 U. S. 261</a></p><p> should be punished by a jail term of days, up to one year, in combination with a fine of a dollar amount.  Anyone who, in the judgment of the trial judge, should receive the stiffest penalty known to Illinois law for this crime may, if he possesses funds, satisfy the demands of the criminal law by paying the fine superimposed on the jail term.  If he cannot pay his debt to society, it is surely not unequal, but, to the contrary, most equal, that some substitute sanction be imposed lest the individual of means be subjected to a harsher penalty than one who is impoverished.  If equal protection implications of the Court\'s opinion were to be fully realized, it would require that the consequence of punishment be comparable for all individuals; the State would be forced to embark on the impossible task of developing a system of individualized fines, so that the total disutility of the entire fine, or the marginal disutility of the last dollar taken, would be the same for all individuals.  <em>Cf.</em> Michelman, Foreword:  On Protecting the Poor Through the Fourteenth Amendment, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 7 (1969).  Today\'s holding, and those in the other so-called "equal protection" decisions, <em>e.g., Douglas v. California, supra; Anders v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/738/case.html">386 U. S. 738</a></span> (1967), offer no pretense to actually providing such equal treatment.  It cannot be argued that the requirement of counsel on appeal is the right to the most skilled advocate who is theoretically at the call of the defendant of means.  However desirable and enlightened a theory of social and economic equality may be, it is not a theory that has the blessing of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Not</p>\n<p>"every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional \'principle,\' and . . . this Court [is not equipped to] \'take the lead\' in promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act.  The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare, nor should this Court, ordained as a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="262">Page 399 U. S. 262</a></p><p> judicial body, be thought of as a general haven for reform movements."</p>\n<p><em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 624</span>-625 (1964) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The reluctance of the Court to carry its "equal protection" approach to its most logical consequences accents what I deem to be the true considerations involved in this case, namely, whether the legislature has impermissibly affected an individual right, or has done so in an arbitrary fashion.  <em>Cf. Michelman, supra.</em>  While legislation usually will not be deemed arbitrary if its means can arguably be supposed to be related to a legitimate purpose (<em>see</em> my dissenting opinion in <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, supra</em>) and generally the burden of demonstrating the existence of a rational connection between means and ends is not borne by the State (<em>see Flemming v. Nestor, supra,</em> and my dissenting opinion in <em>Swann v. Adams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/440/case.html">385 U. S. 440</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/440/case.html#447">385 U. S. 447</a></span> (1967)), the presumption of regularity that comes with legislative judgment is one that is not equally acceptable in all instances, nor is it blind to the nature of the interests affected.</p>\n<p>Thus, as a due process matter, I have subscribed to the admonition of <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/535/case.html">316 U. S. 535</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/535/case.html#541">316 U. S. 541</a></span> (1942), where the Court cautioned that there are limits to the extent to which the presumption of constitutionality can be pressed where a "basic liberty" is concerned.  <em>See</em> my dissenting opinion in <em>Poe v. Ullman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html#543">367 U. S. 543</a></span>.  The same viewpoint was implicit in <em>Flemming v. Nestor, supra,</em> where the Court noted the breadth of latitude to be accorded to a legislative judgment when the interest was that of a "noncontractual benefit under a social welfare program."  363 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/603/case.html#611">363 U. S. 611</a></span>.  Thus, while that</p>\n<p>"interest . . . is of sufficient substance to fall within the protection from arbitrary governmental action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 399 U. S. 263</a></p><p> afforded by the Due Process Clause,"</p>\n<p>when that interest is the</p>\n<p>"withholding of a noncontractual benefit under a social welfare program . . . , we must recognize that the Due Process Clause can be thought to interpose a bar only if the statute manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The implication of <em>Flemming</em> is, however, that the deference owed to legislative judgment is not the same in all cases.  Thus, legislation that regulates conduct but incidentally affects freedom of expression may, although it is a rational choice to effectuate a legitimate legislative purpose, be invalid because it imposes a burden on that right, or because other means, entailing less imposition, may exist.  <em>See NAACP v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html">357 U. S. 449</a></span> (1958); <em>Lovell v. City of Griffin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/444/case.html">303 U. S. 444</a></span> (1938); <em>Garner v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/157/case.html">368 U.

Ullman, supra.</em>  While the interest of the State, that of punishing one convicted of crime, is no less substantial, <em>cf.</em> concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN in <em>Illinois v. Allen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/337/case.html">397 U. S. 337</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/337/case.html#347">397 U. S. 347</a></span> (1970), the</p>\n<p>"balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized society,"</p>\n<p><em>Poe v. Ullman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html#542">367 U. S. 542</a></span>, "having regard to what history teaches" is not such that the State\'s interest here outweighs that of the individual so as to bring into full play the application of the usual salutary presumption of rationality. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="264">Page 399 U. S. 264</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The State by this statute or any other statute fixing a penalty of a fine, has declared its penological interest -- deterrence, retribution, and rehabilitation -- satisfied by a monetary payment, and disclaimed, as serving any penological purpose in such cases, a term in jail.  While there can be no question that the State has a legitimate concern with punishing an individual who cannot pay the fine, there is serious question in my mind whether, having declared itself indifferent as between fine and jail, it can, consistently with due process, refrain from offering some alternative such as payment on the installment plan.</p>\n<p>There are two conceivable justifications for not doing so.  The most obvious and likely justification for the present statute is administrative convenience.  Given the interest of the individual affected, I do not think a State may, after declaring itself indifferent between a fine and jail, rely on the convenience of the latter as a constitutionally acceptable means for enforcing its interest, given the existence of less restrictive alternatives.  <em>Cf. Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html">339 U. S. 306</a></span> (1950).</p>\n<p>The second conceivable justification is that the jail alternative serves a penological purpose that cannot be served by collection of a fine over time.  It is clear that, having declared itself satisfied by a fine, the alternative of jail to a fine serves neither a rehabilitative nor a retributive interest.  The question is, then, whether the requirement of a lump-sum payment can be sustained as a rational legislative determination that deterrence is effective only when a fine is exacted at once after sentence and by lump sum, rather than over a term.  This is a highly doubtful proposition, since, apart from the mere fact of conviction and the humiliation associated with it and the token of punishment evidenced by the forfeiture, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 399 U. S. 265</a></p><p> the deterrent effect of a fine is apt to derive more from its pinch on the purse than the time of payment.</p>\n<p>That the Illinois statute represents a considered judgment, evincing the belief that jail is a rational and necessary trade-off to punish the individual who possesses no accumulated assets, seems most unlikely, since the substitute sentence provision, phrased in terms of a judgment collection statute, does not impose a discretionary jail term as an alternative sentence, but, rather, equates days in jail with a fixed sum.  Thus, given that the only conceivable justification for this statute that would satisfy due process -- that a lump-sum fine is a better deterrent than one payable over a period of time -- is the one that is least likely to represent a considered legislative judgment, I would hold this statute invalid.</p>\n<p>The conclusion I reach is only that, when a State declares its penal interest may be satisfied by a fine or a forfeiture in combination with a jail term, the administrative inconvenience in a judgment collection procedure does not, as a matter of due process, justify sending to jail, or extending the jail term of, individuals who possess no accumulated assets.<l=>*  I would reserve the question as to whether a considered legislative judgment that a lump-sum fine is the only effective kind of forfeiture for deterrence, and that the alternative must be jail, would be constitutional.  It follows <em>a fortiori</em> that no conclusion reached herein casts any doubt on the conventional "$30 or 30 days" if the legislature decides that should be the penalty for the crime.  Note, Discriminations Against the Poor and the Fourteenth Amendment, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 435 (1967).  Such a statute </l=></p><p><a class="page-number" name="266">Page 399 U. S. 266</a></p><p> evinces the perfectly rational determination that some individuals will be adequately punished by a money fine, and others, indifferent to money -- whether by virtue of indigency or other reasons -- can be punished only by a jail term.  Still more patently, nothing said herein precludes the State from punishing ultimately by jail individuals who fail to pay fines or imprisoning immediately individuals who, in the judgment of a court, will not undertake to pay their fines.</p>\n<p>On these premises, I join the Court\'s judgment vacating appellant\'s sentence and remanding to the Supreme Court of Illinois to afford it an opportunity to instruct the sentencing judge as to any permissible alternatives under Illinois law.  It may be that Illinois courts have the power to fashion a procedure pending further consideration of this problem by the state legislature.  <em>Cf. Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#421">397 U.
