It is a crime if a person who is \xe2\x80\x9crequired to register under [the Act]\xe2\x80\x9d and who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. commerce\xe2\x80\x9d knowingly \xe2\x80\x9cfails to register or update a registration.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a).  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9csex offender\xe2\x80\x9d to include offenders who were convicted before the Act\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716911(1), and says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements\xe2\x80\x9d to pre-Act offenders, \xc2\xa716913(d).  The Act, which seeks to make more uniform and effective a patchwork of pre-Act federal and 50 state registration systems, became law in July 2006.  In February 2007, the Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act applies to all pre-Act offenders.  He has since promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Reynolds, a pre-Act offender, registered in Missouri in 2005 but moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updating the Missouri registration or registering in Pennsylvania.  He was indicted for failing to meet the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements between September 16 and October 16, 2007.  He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the Act was not applicable to pre-Act offenders during that time, arguing that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s February 2007 Interim Rule was invalid because it violated the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnondelegation\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s notice and comment requirements.  The District Court rejected on the merits of Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 legal attack on the Interim Rule, but the Third Circuit rejected his argument without reaching the merits, concluding that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements applied to pre-Act offenders even in the absence of a rule by the Attorney General.  Thus, it found, the Interim Rule\xe2\x80\x99s validity made no legal difference in the outcome.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Act does not require pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General validly specifies that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration provisions apply to them.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0This conclusion is supported by a natural reading of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, which consists of four statements.  Statement One says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement Two says that, generally, the offender must initially register before completing his \xe2\x80\x9csentence of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement Three says that the sex offender must update a registration within three business days of any change of \xe2\x80\x9cname, residence, employment, or student status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement Four says that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  \xc2\xa716913.  Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.  It deals specifically with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of the First Statement\xe2\x80\x99s broad general class (all sex offenders) and thus should control the Act\xe2\x80\x99s application to that subset.  See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395\n.  Also, by giving the Attorney General authority to specify the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9capplicability,\xe2\x80\x9d not its \xe2\x80\x9cnonapplicability,\xe2\x80\x9d the Fourth Statement is more naturally read to confer authority to apply the Act, not authority to make exceptions.  This reading efficiently resolves what may have been Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern about the practical problems of applying the new registration requirements to a large number of pre-Act offenders, which could have been expensive and might not have proved feasible to do immediately.  It might have thought that such concerns warranted different treatment for different categories of pre-Act offenders.  And it could have concluded that it was efficient and desirable to ask the Justice Department, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine pre-Act offender problems and to apply the new requirements accordingly.  This reading also takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic criminal law principles.  The Second Statement, e.g., requires a sex offender to register before completing his prison term, but says nothing about when a pre-Act offender who has left prison is to register.  An Attorney General ruling could diminish such uncertainties, helping to eliminate the kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to avoid.

Some lower courts have read the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to apply only to pre-Act sex offenders who are unable to comply with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinitial registration\xe2\x80\x9d requirements, but that is not what the Act says.

It does so by repealing several earlier federal laws that also (but less effectively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive registration-system standards; by making federal funding contingent on States\xe2\x80\x99 bringing their systems into compliance with those standards; by requiring both state and federal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions (and to keep registration information current); and by creating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who violate the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements.  \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a) (criminal provision); 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716911(10), 16913\xe2\x80\x9316916 (2006 ed. and Supp. III) (registration requirements); \xc2\xa716925 (federal funding); \xc2\xa7129, \n\n120Stat.\n600 (repeal of earlier laws).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act\xe2\x80\x99s criminal penalty applies to \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ho[m]ever .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is required to register under [the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a).

He was convicted of a Missouri sex offense in October 2001; he served four years in prison; he was released in July 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender; but he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updating his Missouri registration information (as Missouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylvania.

He conceded that the Act had become law earlier (namely, in July 2006), and he conceded that the Attorney General had already (in February 2007) promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements were applicable to pre-Act offenders.  But he claimed that the Interim Rule was invalid because it violated both the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnondel- egation\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s (APA) requirement for \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause\xe2\x80\x9d to promulgate a rule without \xe2\x80\x9cnotice and comment\xe2\x80\x9d (as the Attorney General had done).

But the Court of Appeals rejected Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 argument without reaching those merits.  380 Fed. Appx. 125 (2010).  That court thought that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements apply to pre-Act offenders such as Reynolds (who was subject to a pre-existing state-law registration requirement) from the date of the new law\xe2\x80\x99s enactment\xe2\x80\x94even in the absence of any rule or regulation by the Attorney General specifying that the new registration requirements apply.  That being so, the validity of the Interim Rule could make no legal dif- ference, for the Act required Reynolds to follow the new federal registration requirements regardless of any rulemaking.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Courts of Appeals have reached different conclusions about whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements apply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time that the Attorney General specifies their applicability, i.e., from July 2006 until at least February 2007.  Six Circuits have held that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so specifies.  United States v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 922\xe2\x80\x93927 (CA5 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F. 3d 1159, 1162\xe2\x80\x931164 (CA9 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d 408, 414\xe2\x80\x93419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226\xe2\x80\x93229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852, 856\xe2\x80\x93859 (CA11 2008) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).  Five Circuits have held that they apply from the date of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with respect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered under state law.  United States v. Fuller, 627 F. 3d 499, 506 (CA2 2010); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F. 3d 17, 24 (CA1 2010); United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F. 3d 151, 163 (CA3 2010); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d 926, 932 (CA10 2008); United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912, 918\xe2\x80\x93919 (CA8 2008).  In light of this split, we agreed to consider the question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question before us is whether the Act requires pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General validly specifies that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration provisions ap- ply to them.  We believe that it does not.  For one thing, a natural reading of the textual language supports our conclusion.  The text consists of four statements.  See supra, at 3.  Statement One says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement Two says that a sex offender must initially register before completing his \xe2\x80\x9csentence of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d (or, if the sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three days of conviction).  Statement Three says that the sex offender must update a registration within three business days of any change of \xe2\x80\x9cname, residence, employment, or student status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement Four says that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRead naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.  It specifically deals with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of a broad general class (all sex offenders) to which the First Statement applies.  And it therefore should control the Act\xe2\x80\x99s application to that subset.  See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395, \n407 (1991)\n (specific statutory provision normally controls over one of more general application); see also Bloate v. United States, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the Fourth Statement says that the Attorney General has authority to specify the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9capplicability,\xe2\x80\x9d not its \xe2\x80\x9cnonapplicability.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it consequently is more naturally read as conferring the authority to apply the Act, not the authority to make exceptions.  That is how we normally understand a term such as \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to specify\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of applying new rules to persons already governed by pre-existing rules.  If, for example, the Major League Baseball Players Association and the team owners agreed that the Commissioner of Baseball \xe2\x80\x9cshall have the authority to specify the applicability\xe2\x80\x9d to the major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug testing policy, we should think that the minor league policy would not apply unless and until the Commissioner so specified.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, this reading of the Act efficiently resolves what Congress may well have thought were practical problems arising when the Act sought to apply the new registration requirements to pre-Act offenders.  The problems arise out of the fact that the Act seeks to make more uniform a patchwork of pre-existing state systems.  Doing so could require newly registering or re-registering \xe2\x80\x9ca large number\xe2\x80\x9d of pre-Act offenders.  That effort could prove expensive.  And it might not prove feasible to do so immediately.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these problems).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern about these problems is re- flected in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s providing the States with three years to bring their systems into compliance with federal standards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that 3-year grace period to five years.  \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716924.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese same considerations might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act offenders.  Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035\xe2\x80\x9338036, and 38046\xe2\x80\x9338047 (final Department of Justice guidelines allowing States to meet Act requirements without registering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg. 1635\xe2\x80\x931636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same).  At least Congress might well have so thought.  And consequently, Congress might well have looked for a solution.  Asking the Department of Justice, charged with respon- sibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act offender problems and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly could have represented one efficient and desirable solution (though we express no view on Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 related constitutional claim).  Cf. 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945 (granting the Attorney General authority to administer various aspects of the Act).  And that is just the solution that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language says that Congress adopted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic background principles of criminal law.  The Second Statement, for example, says that a sex offender must register before completing his prison term, but the provision says nothing about when a pre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act must register.  Although a state pre-Act offender could not be prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no interstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender.  And to apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from the date of enactment would require reading into the statute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equivalent (e.g., registering or updating within a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwithin three days of first post-Act travel in interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cas preexisting state law requires\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae, and difficulties, might, on their own, reach different conclusions about whether, or how, the new registration requirements applied to them.  A ruling from the Attorney General, however, could diminish or eliminate those uncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to avoid.  Cf., e.g., United States v. Lanier, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259, \n266 (1997)\n (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe canon of strict construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government makes three principal arguments to the contrary.  First, it says that our interpretation of the Act conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders,\xe2\x80\x9d \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716901, that includes offenders who committed their offenses before the Act became law.  The Act reflects that purpose when it defines \xe2\x80\x9csex offender\xe2\x80\x9d broadly to include any \xe2\x80\x9cindividual who was convicted of a sex offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716911(1).  And we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in general, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act offender required to register under the Act who later travels interstate and fails to register.  See Carr, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act\xe2\x80\x99s history also reveals that many of its supporters placed considerable importance upon the registration of pre-Act offenders.  See, e.g., H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93218, pt. 1, p. 24 (2005) (H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Twenty] percent of sexual offenders are \xe2\x80\x98lost,\xe2\x80\x99 and there is a strong public interest in finding them and having them register with current information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against children\xe2\x80\x9d); 152 Cong. Rec. 15333 (2006) (statement of Sen. Cantwell) (\xe2\x80\x9cChild sex offenders have exploited this stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have been tragic.  Twenty percent of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s 560,000 sex offenders are \xe2\x80\x98lost\xe2\x80\x99 because State offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 15338 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere currently are over 100,000 sex offenders in this country who are required to register but are \xe2\x80\x98off the system.\xe2\x80\x99  They are not registered.  The penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that these individuals register\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 13050 (statement of Sen. Frist) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere are currently 550,000 registered sex offenders in the U.\xc2\xa0S. and at least 100,000 of them are missing from the system.  Every day that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have this national sex offender registry, these missing sex predators are out there somewhere\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe difficulty with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, how- ever, is that it overstates the need for instantaneous registration of pre-Act offenders.  Our different reading, we concede, involves implementation delay.  But that delay need not be long (the Attorney General issued his Interim Rule 217 days after the effective date of the new law).  And that delay can be justified by the need to accommodate other Act-related interests.  See supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Government suggests that our reading leads to an absurd result.  As it points out, the Fourth Statement grants the Attorney General the \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to specify\xe2\x80\x9d the registration requirements\xe2\x80\x99 applicability not only to pre-Act offenders but also to those convicted prior to the \xe2\x80\x9cimplementation\xe2\x80\x9d of the new Act \xe2\x80\x9cin a particular jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act for up to five years.  See \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716924; \xc2\xa0see also Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department Finds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented SORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as of July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/ pressreleases/2011/SMART_PR-072811.htm (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Yet, the Government concludes, it is absurd to believe that Congress would have desired so long a delay in the application of its new registration requirements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe problem with this argument, however, is that reading the two categories similarly (a matter which we need not decide) would not require a long delay in applying the registration requirements to post-Act offenders who committed a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement the new requirements.  At most, that reading would require the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applicable to all preimplementation offenders.  That rule could specify that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s preregistration provisions apply to some or to all those offenders.  And it could do so quickly, well before a jurisdiction implements the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements. Indeed, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Interim Rule and the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s final guidelines, both issued before any jurisdiction implemented the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, state that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements apply to \xe2\x80\x9call sex offenders,\xe2\x80\x9d including all preimplementation offenders.  See 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3); 73 Fed. Reg. 38036; cf. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department Announces First Two Jurisdictions  to Implement Sex Offender Registration and Notifica- tion Act (Sept. 23, 2009), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/ pressreleases/2009/SMART09154.htm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the Government argues against our interpretation on the ground that the Act says only that the At- torney General \xe2\x80\x9cshall have the authority to specify the applicability\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements to pre-Act offenders; it does not say that he \xe2\x80\x9cshall specify\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise require him to do so.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s language, the Government continues, consequently gives the Attorney General the power not to specify anything; that power is inconsistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to ensure the speedy registration of thousands of \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d pre-Act offenders, supra, at 10; and we can avoid this result only by reading the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements as applying immedi- ately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though the Attorney General would have the power to make exceptions).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument bases too much upon too little.  There is no reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attorney General would refuse to apply the new requirements to pre-Act offenders.  See, e.g., H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Protecting Our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Children from Sexual Predators and Violent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4\xe2\x80\x9313 (2005); Office of the Press Sec\xe2\x80\x99y, The White House, President Signs H.\xc2\xa0R. 4472,  the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (July 27, 2006), http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ news/releases/2006/07/20060727-6.html.  And there was no need for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic possibility.  There is consequently no need to read the language unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the authority only to make exceptions from an implicit (unstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registration requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board and immediately.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, we note that some lower courts have read the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s specification authority as applying only to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinitial registration\xe2\x80\x9d requirements.  See \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(b).  That, however, is not what the statute says.  Rather, its Fourth Statement, \xc2\xa716913(d), says that the Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act (and preimplementation) offenders, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (2) to prescribe rules for their registration, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (3) to prescribe registration rules for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with the initial registration requirements.  See supra, at 3.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d means that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority extends beyond those pre-Act \xe2\x80\x9csex offenders who are unable to comply\xe2\x80\x9d with the initial registration requirements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, we conclude that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General so specifies.  Whether the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification consequently matters in the case before us.

S. C. \xc2\xa716901 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. III), apply of their own force, without action by the Attorney General.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of  the [registration] requirements\xe2\x80\x9d to pre-Act sex offenders, \xc2\xa716913(d), is best understood as conferring on the Attorney General an authority to make exceptions to the otherwise applicable registration requirements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo begin with, I do not share the Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief that  to \xe2\x80\x9cspecify the applicability\xe2\x80\x9d more naturally means, in the present context, to \xe2\x80\x9cmake applicable\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to \xe2\x80\x9cmake inapplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 7.  The example the Court gives, the Commissioner of Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98authority to spec-ify the applicability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of more stringent minor-league drug testing policies to the major leagues, ibid., is entirely inapt, because it deals with a policy that on its face is otherwise not applicable.  Since the major leagues are not covered by the policies, the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98authority to specify [their] applicability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d can mean nothing else but the authority to render them applicable.  What we have here, however, is a statute that states in unqualified terms that \xe2\x80\x9ca sex offender shall register,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa716913(a)\xe2\x80\x94and that the Court rightly believes was meant to cover pre-Act offenders.*  The issue is whether \xe2\x80\x9cspecify the applicability\xe2\x80\x9d means that no pre-Act offenders need register unless the Attorney General says so, or rather that the Attorney General may excuse the unqualified requirement for pre-Act offenders.  In that context, it seems to me that the latter meaning is more natural.  One specifies the applicability of an application that already exists by describing or revising its contours.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI think it preferable to give \xe2\x80\x9cspecify\xe2\x80\x9d this meaning not only because here it is more natural, but also because  the alternative is to read the statute as leaving it up to the Attorney General whether the registration requirement would ever apply to pre-Act offenders, even though registration of pre-Act offenders was (as the Court acknowl-edges) what the statute sought to achieve.  For the statute does not instruct the Attorney General to specify; it merely gives him \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d to do so.  In this respect, the provision at issue here stands in marked contrast to other provisions of the Act which clearly impose duties on the Attorney General.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa716912(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General shall issue guidelines and regulations to interpret and implement this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa716917(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General shall prescribe rules for the notification of [certain] sex offenders\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa716919(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General shall maintain a national database\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa716926(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General shall establish and implement a Sex Offender Management Assistance program\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s response to this\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no need for a mandatory requirement to avoid [the] unrealistic possibility\xe2\x80\x9d that the Attorney General would not specify, ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x94seems to me a fine answer to the question \xe2\x80\x9cWhat mandatory requirements must a poorly drafted statute contain in order to be workable?\xe2\x80\x9d  It is an inadequate answer, however, to the question that is relevant here: \xe2\x80\x9cWould Congress have written the provision this way if it wanted pre-Act offenders covered and did not think they were covered absent specification by the Attorney Gen-eral?\xe2\x80\x9d  Intelligently drafted statutes make mandatory those executive acts essential to their functioning, whether or not those acts would likely occur anyway.  It would have taken little effort (in fact, less effort) for Congress to write \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General shall specify the applicability\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General shall have authority to specify the applicability.\xe2\x80\x9d  The latter formulation confers discretion, and it is simply implausible that the Attorney General was given discretion to determine whether coverage of pre-Act offenders (one of the purposes of the Act) should exist.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, it is not entirely clear to me that Congress  can constitutionally leave it to the Attorney General to decide\xe2\x80\x94with no statutory standard whatever governing his discretion\xe2\x80\x94whether a criminal statute will or will not apply to certain individuals.  That seems to me sailing close to the wind with regard to the principle that legislative powers are nondelegable, see Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457\n\xe2\x80\x93476 (2001); Loving v. United States, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 748\n\xe2\x80\x93777 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is our settled policy to avoid an interpretation of a federal statute that engenders constitutional issues if a reasonable alternative interpretation poses  no constitutional question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gomez v. United States, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 858, \n864 (1989)\n.  Construing the Act to give the Attorney General the power to reduce congressionally imposed requirements fits that bill, because such a power is little more than a formalized version of the time-honored practice of prosecutorial discretion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court points out that there might have been need for \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act offenders,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 8, and that absent a \xe2\x80\x9cruling from the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x9d pre-Act offenders would be uncertain \xe2\x80\x9cabout whether, or how, the new registration requirements applied to them,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9.  But attending to those details would certainly come within the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to \xe2\x80\x9cspecify\xe2\x80\x9d application of the Act\xe2\x80\x94and so would the temporary suspension of registration requirements pending the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s reso-lution of those details.  And of course the uncertainty of where to register could form the basis for the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of his discretion not to prosecute in individual cases.  Neither problem, it seems to me, justifies the extraordinary interpretation that this Act does not apply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General, in his discretion, says so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0The Court reaches this conclusion based on an inquiry into legislative history.
