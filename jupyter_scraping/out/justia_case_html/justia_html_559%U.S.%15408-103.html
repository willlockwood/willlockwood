The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright infringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with \xc2\xa7411(a).  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their works and authors who had not.  The parties moved the District Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agreement.  The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance authors.  On appeal, the Second Circuit <em>sU. S.onte</em> raised the question whether \xc2\xa7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights, concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the class or approve the settlement.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement is a precondition to filing a copyright infringement claim.

Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d properly applies only to \xe2\x80\x9cprescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)\xe2\x80\x9d implicating that authority.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Because the distinction between jurisdictional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in practice, federal courts and litigants should use the term \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d only when it is apposite.  <em>Ibid.</em>  A statutory requirement is considered jurisdictional if Congress \xe2\x80\x9cclearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d; a condition \xe2\x80\x9cnot rank[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d as such should be treated \xe2\x80\x9cas nonjurisdictional in character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U.

In <em>Arbaugh, </em>the Court held that the employee-numerosity coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly stat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement\xe2\x80\x99s location in a provision separate from Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction-granting section indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdictional.

Although \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s last sentence contains the word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d that sentence speaks to a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority to determine a copyright claim\xe2\x80\x99s registrability and says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement, like Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s employee-numerosity requirement, is located in a provision \xe2\x80\x9cseparate\xe2\x80\x9d from those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those respective claims, <em>ibid., </em>and no other factor suggests that \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement can be read to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee-numerosity requirement in <em>Arbaugh</em> was considered an element of a Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit.  See <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 393.

That analysis is consistent with the <em>Arbaugh</em> framework because context is relevant to whether a statute \xe2\x80\x9crank[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a requirement as jurisdictional.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7411(a) (Supp. 2009).  In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a copyright holder\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright infringement claim.  We disagree.  Section 411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim\nthat does not restrict a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution grants Congress the power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors \xe2\x80\xa6 the exclusive Right to \xe2\x80\xa6 their \xe2\x80\xa6 Writings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08.  Exercising this power, Congress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the existence and scope of \xe2\x80\x9c[c]opyright protection\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102(a).  This scheme gives copyright owners \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive rights\xe2\x80\x9d (with specified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or publicly perform their works.  \xc2\xa7106.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act \xe2\x80\x9cis an infringer of the copyright.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7501(a).  When such infringement occurs, a copyright owner \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled, <em>subject to the requirements of section 411</em>, to institute an action\xe2\x80\x9d for copyright infringement.  \xc2\xa7501(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns \xe2\x80\x9cthe requirements of section 411\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xc2\xa7501(b) refers.  Section 411(a) provides, <em>inter alia</em> and with certain exceptions, that \xe2\x80\x9cno civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  This provision is part of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s remedial scheme.  It establishes a condition\xe2\x80\x94copyright registration\xe2\x80\x94that plaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringement claim and invoking the Act\xe2\x80\x99s remedial provisions.  We address whether \xc2\xa7411(a) also deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant proceedings in this case began after we issued our opinion in <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Tasini</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/483/index.html">533 U. S. 483</a> (2001).  In<em> Tasini</em>, we agreed with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of online databases and print publishers had infringed the copyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the authors\xe2\x80\x99 works electronically without first securing their permission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 493.  In so holding, we affirmed the principal theory of liability underlying copyright infringement suits that other freelance authors had filed after the Court of Appeals had issued its opinion in <em>Tasini</em>.  These other suits, which were stayed pending our decision in <em>Tasini</em>, resumed after we issued our opinion and were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consolidated complaint alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine, that they had registered in accordance with \xc2\xa7411(a).  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their copyrighted works and authors who had not.  See App. 94.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because of the growing size and complexity of the lawsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.  For more than three years, the freelance authors, the publishers (and their insurers), and the electronic databases (and their insurers) negotiated.  Finally, in March 2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the parties intended \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve a global peace in the publishing industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Literary Works in Electronic Databases Copyright Litigation</em>, 509 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties moved the District Court to certify a class for settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.  Ten freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (hereinafter Muchnick respondents), objected.  The District Court overruled the objections; certified a settlement class of freelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final judgment.  At no time did the Muchnick respondents or any other party urge the District Court to dismiss the case, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settlement, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their objections to the settlement on procedural and substantive grounds.  Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Appeals <em>sU. S.onte</em> ordered briefing on the question whether \xc2\xa7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights.  All parties filed briefs asserting that the District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve the settlement agreement even though it included unregistered works.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 121 (citing <em>Well-Made Toy Mfg. Corp.</em> v. <em>Goffa Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</em>, 354 F.\xc2\xa03d 112, 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (CA2 2003); <em>Morris</em> v. <em>Business Concepts, Inc.</em>, 259 F.\xc2\xa03d 65, 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (CA2 2001)), the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the infringement of unregistered works, and also lacked jurisdiction to approve a settlement with respect to those claims, 509 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 121 (citing \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread agreement among the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Walker dissented.  He concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xc2\xa7411(a) is more like the [nonjurisdictional] employee-numerosity requirement in <em>Arbaugh</em> [v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/500/index.html">546 U.

S. 205</a> (2007).  509 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 129.  Accordingly, he reasoned that \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement does not limit federal subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement suits involving unregistered works.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the owners\xe2\x80\x99 and publishers\xe2\x80\x99 petition for a writ of certiorari, and formulated the question presented to ask whether \xc2\xa7411(a) restricts the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts over copyright infringement actions.  555 U. S. ____ (2009).  Because no party supports the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdictional holding, we appointed an <em>amicus curiae </em>to defend the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  556 U.

Courts\xe2\x80\x94including this Court\xe2\x80\x94have sometimes mischaracterized claim-processing rules or elements of a cause of action as jurisdictional limitations, particularly when that characterization was not central to the case, and thus did not require close analysis.  See <em>Arbaugh</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 511\xe2\x80\x93512 (citing examples); <em>Steel Co</em>., 523 U. S., at 91 (same).  Our recent cases evince a marked desire to curtail such \xe2\x80\x9cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> which too easily can miss the \xe2\x80\x9ccritical difference[s]\xe2\x80\x9d between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional limitations on causes of action, <em>Kontrick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 456; see also <em>Arbaugh</em>, 546 U.

But employees can bring Title VII claims only against employers that have \xe2\x80\x9cfifteen or more employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e(b).  <em>Arbaugh </em>addressed whether that employee numerosity requirement \xe2\x80\x9caffects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, instead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII claim for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  546 U.

We held that it does the latter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding turned principally on our examination of the text of \xc2\xa72000e(b), the section in which Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s numerosity requirement appears.  Section 2000e(b) does not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly stat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that the employee numerosity threshold on Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s scope \xe2\x80\x9ccount[s] as jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 515\xe2\x80\x93516, and n.\xc2\xa011.  And nothing in our prior Title VII cases compelled the conclusion that even though the numerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it nonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit.  See <em>id.</em>, at 511\xe2\x80\x93513.

Brief for Court-Appointed <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in support of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter <em>Amicus</em> Brief).  But this reference to \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d cannot bear the weight that <em>amicus </em>places upon it.  The sentence upon which <em>amicus </em>relies states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Register [of Copyrights] may, at his or her option, become a party to the [copyright infringement] action with respect to <em>the issue of registrability of the copyright claim</em> by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but the Register\xe2\x80\x99s failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine <em>that issue</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7411(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress added this sentence to the Act in 1976, 90 Stat. 2583, to clarify that a federal court can determine \xe2\x80\x9cthe issue of registrability of the copyright claim\xe2\x80\x9d even if the Register does not appear in the infringement suit.  That clarification was necessary because courts had interpreted \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s precursor provision,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which imposed a similar registration requirement, as prohibiting copyright owners who had been <em>refused</em> registration by the Register of Copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners <em>first</em> sought mandamus against the Register.  See <em>Vacheron &amp; Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc.</em> v. <em>Benrus Watch Co.</em>, 260 F.\xc2\xa02d 637, 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (CA2 1958) (construing \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s precursor).  The 1976 amendment made it clear that a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to determine \xe2\x80\x9c<em>that</em> issue,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7411(a) (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the issue of <em>registrability</em>\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether the Register is a party to the <em>infringement</em> suit.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d as used here, thus says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement, like Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision \xe2\x80\x9cseparate\xe2\x80\x9d from those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those respective claims.  See <em>Arbaugh</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 514\xe2\x80\x93515.  Federal district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions based on 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71331 and 1338.  But neither \xc2\xa71331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over questions of federal law, nor \xc2\xa71338(a), which is specific to copyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on whether copyright holders have registered their works before suing for infringement.  Cf. <em>Arbaugh</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 515 (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9cspecif[y] any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement can be read to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U. S., at 515 (quoting <em>Zipes</em>, 455 U. S.,<em> </em>at 394).  First, and most significantly, \xc2\xa7411(a) expressly <em>allows </em>courts to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works in three circumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where the infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and integrity under \xc2\xa7106A, or where the holder attempted to register the work and registration was refused.  Separately, \xc2\xa7411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement actions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the author \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the work\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmakes registration for the work, if required by subsection (a), within three months after [the work\xe2\x80\x99s] first transmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7411(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  It would be at least unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a condition subject to these sorts of exceptions.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the numerosity requirement in <em>Arbaugh</em> could be considered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this conclusion, as our decision in <em>Zipes</em> demonstrates.  <em>Zipes</em> (upon which <em>Arbaugh</em> relied) held that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a discrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil action in federal court was nonjurisdictional.  See<em> </em>455 U. S.,<em> </em>at 393; 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1) (establishing specific time periods within which a discrimination claimant must file a lawsuit after filing a charge with the EEOC).  A statutory condition that requires a party to take some action before<em> </em>filing a lawsuit is not automatically \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>jurisdictional</em> prerequisite to suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zipes</em>, 455 U. S., at 393 (emphasis added).  Rather, the jurisdictional analysis must focus on the \xe2\x80\x9clegal character\xe2\x80\x9d of the requirement, <em>id.</em>, at 395, which we discerned by looking to the condition\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and relevant historical treatment, <em>id</em>., at 393\xe2\x80\x93395; see also <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/101/index.html"></a><a href="/us/536/101/index.html">536 U. S. 101</a>, 119\xe2\x80\x93121 (2002).  We similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types of threshold requirements that claimants must complete, or exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The registration requirement in 17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7411(a) fits in this mold.  Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to filing a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is not located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c).   Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of precondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment under our precedents.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em> insists that our decision in <em>Bowles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/205/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/205/index.html">551 U. S. 205</a>, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach today.  <em>Amicus</em> cites <em>Bowles </em>for the proposition that where Congress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as jurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such if that is how the condition consistently has been interpreted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpretation.  <em>Amicus </em>Brief 26.  Specifically, <em>amicus </em>relies on a footnote in <em>Bowles</em> to argue that here, as in <em>Bowles</em>, it would be improper to characterize the statutory condition as nonjurisdictional because doing so would override \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a century\xe2\x80\x99s worth of precedent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d treating \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement as jurisdictional.  <em>Amicus </em>Brief 26 (quoting <em>Bowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 209, n.\xc2\xa02).  This argument focuses\non the result in <em>Bowles</em>, rather than on the analysis we employed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bowles</em> did not hold that any statutory condition devoid of an express jurisdictional label should be treated as jurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as such.  Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions imposing a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Rather, <em>Bowles</em> stands for the proposition that context, including this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Bowles</em>, we considered 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72107, which requires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which \xe2\x80\x9ccarries \xc2\xa72107 into practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 208.<em> </em>After analyzing \xc2\xa72107\xe2\x80\x99s specific language and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s historical treatment of the type of limitation \xc2\xa72107 imposes (<em>i.e.</em>, statutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that Congress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdictional.  Our focus in <em>Bowles</em> on the historical treatment of statutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consistent with the <em>Arbaugh</em> framework.  Indeed<em>,</em> <em>Bowles</em> emphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions as jurisdictional, including in statutes <em>other</em> than \xc2\xa72107, and specifically in statutes that predated the creation of the courts of appeals.  See 551 U. S., at 209\xe2\x80\x93210, and n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bowles</em> therefore demonstrates that the relevant question here is not (as <em>amicus</em> puts it) whether \xc2\xa7411(a) itself has long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type<em> </em>of limitation that \xc2\xa7411(a) imposes is one that is properly ranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.  The statutory limitation in <em>Bowles </em>was of a type that we had long held <em>did </em>\xe2\x80\x9cspeak in jurisdictional terms\xe2\x80\x9d even absent a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d label, and nothing about \xc2\xa72107\xe2\x80\x99s text or context, or the historical treatment of that type of limitation, justified a departure from this view.  That was not the case, however, for the types of conditions in <em>Zipes</em> and <em>Arbaugh</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that \xc2\xa7411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts.  Although \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s historical treatment as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d is a factor in the analysis, it is not dispositive.  The other factors discussed above demonstrate that \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement is more analogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we considered in <em>Zipes</em> and <em>Arbaugh</em> than to the statutory time limit at issue in <em>Bowles</em>.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We thus conclude that \xc2\xa7411(a)\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding its prior jurisdictional treatment.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em> argues that even if \xc2\xa7411(a) is nonjurisdictional, we should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment vacating the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order approving the settlement and dismissing the case.  According to <em>amicus</em>, petitioners asserted previously in these proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdictional, and this assertion should estop them from now asserting a right to waive objections to the authors\xe2\x80\x99 failure to register.  <em>Amicus</em> urges us to prevent the parties \xe2\x80\x9cfrom \xe2\x80\x98playing fast and loose with the courts\xe2\x80\x99 by \xe2\x80\x98deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Amicus </em>Brief 58 (quoting <em>New Hampshire</em> v. <em>Maine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/742/index.html">532 U.

But we decline to apply judicial estoppel.  As we explained in <em>New Hampshire</em>, that doctrine typically applies when, among other things, a \xe2\x80\x9cparty has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\xe2\x80\x99s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 750 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.  First, the parties made their prior statements when negotiating or defending the settlement agreement.  We do not fault the parties\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers for invoking in the negotiations binding Circuit precedent that supported their clients\xe2\x80\x99 positions.  Perhaps more importantly, in approving the settlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa7411(a) as jurisdictional.  Second, when the Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether \xc2\xa7411(a) restricted the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of Appeals rejected their arguments.  See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 3a\xe2\x80\x935a, and n.\xc2\xa02.  Accepting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments here thus cannot create \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent court determinations\xe2\x80\x9d in their favor.  <em>New Hampshire</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 751 (internal quotation marks omitted).

As we explained, the time limit in <em>Scarborough </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconcerned \xe2\x80\x98a <em>mode of relief</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 ancillary to the judgment of a court\xe2\x80\x99 that already had plenary jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 211 (quoting <em>Scarborough</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 413; (emphasis added)).  <em>Bowles</em> also distinguished <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/443/index.html">540 U.

See 551 U. S., at 210\xe2\x80\x93211.  <em>Kontrick</em> involved \xe2\x80\x9ctime constraints applicable to objections to discharge\xe2\x80\x9d in bankruptcy proceedings.  540 U. S., at 453.  In that case, we first examined 28 U.

S., at 453.  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9ctime constraints applicable to objections to discharge\xe2\x80\x9d were contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that they \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ibid. </em>(quoting Fed.

That provision, which instructs authors to register their copyrights before commencing suit for infringement, \xe2\x80\x9cis a precondition to filing a claim that does not restrict a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  I further agree that <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a> (2006), is the controlling precedent, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, and that <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/205/index.html">551 U. S. 205</a> (2007), does not counsel otherwise.  There is, however, undeniable tension between the two decisions.  Aiming to stave off continuing controversy over what qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d and what does not, I set out my understanding of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions in <em>Arbaugh </em>and <em>Bowles,</em> and the ground on which I would reconcile those rulings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Arbaugh</em>, we held nonjurisdictional a prescription confining Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to employers with 15 or more employees, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  After observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe 15-employee threshold \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98d[id] not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 546 U.

S. 385</a>, 394 (1982)), the <em>Arbaugh</em> opinion announced and applied a \xe2\x80\x9creadily administrable bright line\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope shall count as jurisdictional,<font super="1"> then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.  But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.  Applying that readily administrable bright line to this case, we hold that the threshold number of employees for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  546 U. S., at 515\xe2\x80\x93516 (citation and footnote omitted).</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">\nAs the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous <em>Arbaugh </em>Court anticipated that all federal courts would thereafter adhere to the \xe2\x80\x9cbright line\xe2\x80\x9d held dispositive that day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bowles</em> moved in a different direction.  A sharply divided Court there held \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory and jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d the time limits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72107(a), (c).  551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks omitted).  <em>Bowles</em> mentioned <em>Arbaugh </em>only to distinguish it as involving a statute setting \xe2\x80\x9can employee-numerosity requirement, not a time limit.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 211.  Section 2107\xe2\x80\x99s time limits were \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bowles</em> explained, because they were contained in a statute, not merely a rule, <em>id.</em>, at 210\xe2\x80\x93213, and because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his Court ha[d] long held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \xe2\x80\x98mandatory and jurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 209.  Fidelity to <em>Arbaugh</em> and similarly reasoned decisions,*<footcall num="*"> the dissent in <em>Bowles</em> observed, would have yielded the conclusion that statutory time limits \xe2\x80\x9care only jurisdictional if Congress says so.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U.

The same is true of our decision, subsequent to <em>Bowles</em>, in <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/130/index.html">552 U. S. 130</a> (2008).  There the Court concluded, largely on <em>stare decisis</em> grounds, that the Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires <em>sua sponte</em> consideration of a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness.  <em>Id.</em>, at 136 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that this Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn, its earlier precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plainly read, <em>Arbaugh</em> and <em>Bowles</em> both point to the conclusion that \xc2\xa7411(a) is nonjurisdictional.  Section 411(a) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zipes</em>, 455 U.
