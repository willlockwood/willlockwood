Most relevant here, an acquittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.  See, e.g., United States v.

In contrast to procedural rulings, which lead to dismissals or mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, acquittals are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely, and thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns.  Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 91.  Here, the trial court clearly \xe2\x80\x9cevaluated the [State\xe2\x80\x99s] evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564\n.  Evans\xe2\x80\x99 acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing legal principles, but that error affects only the accuracy of the determination to acquit, not its essential character.

This case, like the Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.  The State and the United States claim that only when an actual element of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the offense, but Evans\xe2\x80\x99 verdict was based on something that was concededly not an element.  Their argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly and is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions since then.  Martin Linen focused on the significance of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s acquittal based on a nonculpability determination, and its result did not depend on defining the \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense.  Culpability is the touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct.  Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98.

The State claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way to know whether the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was an \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal\xe2\x80\x9d is to rely upon the court\xe2\x80\x99s label, which would wrongly allow the form of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s action to control.  However, the instant decision turns not on the form of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s action but on whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes.  The State and the United States argue that if the grounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for any reason at all.  But this Court presumes that courts exercise their duties in good faith.  The State also suggests that Evans should not be heard to complain when a trial-court error that he induced is corrected and the State wishes to retry him, but most midtrial acquittals result from defense motions.  The United States claims that, under Lee v. United States, \n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 23\n, Evans was required to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an element of the offense before jeopardy attached.  However, Lee involved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial, while this case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s proof.

Pennsylvania, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140\n.  There is no reason to believe that the existing rules have become so \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable\xe2\x80\x9d as to justify overruling precedent.  Payne v. Tennessee, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808\n.  And the logic of those cases still holds.  As for the objection that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d from the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s unreviewable error, sovereigns have power to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial acquittals, encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to acquit until after the jury renders a verdict, or providing for mandatory continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.

It turns out that the unproven \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d was not actually a required element at all.  We must de- cide whether an erroneous acquittal such as this nevertheless constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, which would mean that Evans could not be retried.  This Court has previously held that a judicial acquittal premised upon a \xe2\x80\x9cmisconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d of a criminal statute is an \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal on the merits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [that] bars retrial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arizona v. Rumsey, \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203, \n211 (1984)\n.  Seeing no meaningful constitutional distinction between a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmisconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d of a statute and its erroneous addition of a statutory element, we hold that a midtrial acquittal in these circumstances is an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State charged Evans with burning \xe2\x80\x9cother real property,\xe2\x80\x9d a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws \xc2\xa7750.73 (1981).  The State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence at trial suggested that Evans had burned down an unoccupied house.  At the close of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case, however, Evans moved for a directed ver- dict of acquittal.  He pointed the court to the applicable Michigan Criminal Jury Instructions, which listed as the \xe2\x80\x9cFourth\xe2\x80\x9d element of the offense \xe2\x80\x9cthat the building was not a dwelling house.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Mich. Crim. Jury Instr. \xc2\xa731.3, p. 31\xe2\x80\x937 (2d ed., Supp. 2006/2007).  And the commentary to the Instructions emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9can essential element is that the structure burned is not a dwelling house.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 31\xe2\x80\x938.  Evans argued that Mich. Comp. Laws \xc2\xa7750.72 criminal- izes common-law arson, which requires that the structure burned be a dwelling, while the provision under which he was charged, \xc2\xa7750.73, covers all other real property.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Persuaded, the trial court granted the motion.  491 Mich. 1, 8, 810 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 535, 539 (2012).  The court explained that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98testimony [of the homeowner] was this was a dwelling house,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d so the nondwelling requirement of \xc2\xa7750.73 was not met.

App. 410, 794 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 848 (2010).  Evans had conceded, and the court held, that under controlling precedent, burning \xe2\x80\x9cother real property\xe2\x80\x9d is a lesser included offense under Michigan law, and disproving the greater offense is not required.

Quite the opposite.  It has been half a century since we first recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial following a court-decreed acquittal, even if the ac- quittal is \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fong Foo v. United States, \n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141, \n143 (1962)\n (per curiam).  A mistaken acquittal is an acquittal nonetheless, and we have long held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] verdict of acquittal .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Ball, \n\n163 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662, \n671 (1896)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur cases have applied Fong Foo\xe2\x80\x99s principle broadly.  An acquittal is unreviewable whether a judge directs a jury to return a verdict of acquittal, e.g., Fong Foo, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143, or forgoes that formality by entering a judgment of acquittal herself.  See Smith v. Massachusetts, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462\n\xe2\x80\x93468 (2005) (collecting cases).  And an acquittal precludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous decision to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 54\n\xe2\x80\x9369, 78 (1978); a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction, Smith, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 473; or a \xe2\x80\x9cmisconstruction of the stat- ute\xe2\x80\x9d defining the requirements to convict, Rumsey, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203, 211; cf. Smalis v. Pennsylvania, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140\n\xe2\x80\x93145, n.\xc2\xa07 (1986).  In all these circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles affects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter its essential character.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Scott, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 82, \n98 (1978)\n (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMost relevant here, our cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.  See ibid., and n.\xc2\xa011; Burks v. United States, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n10 (1978)\n; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564, \n571 (1977)\n.  Thus an \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9ca ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cfactual finding [that] necessarily establish[es] the criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of criminal culpability,\xe2\x80\x9d and any other \xe2\x80\x9crulin[g] which relate[s] to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 91, 98, and n.\xc2\xa011 (internal quotation marks omitted).  These sorts of substantive rulings stand apart from procedural rulings that may also terminate a case midtrial, which we generally refer to as dismissals or mistrials.  Procedural dismissals include rulings on questions that \xe2\x80\x9care unrelated to factual guilt or innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cwhich serve other purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9ca legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished\xe2\x80\x9d because of some problem like an error with the indictment.  Id., at 98, and n.\xc2\xa011.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBoth procedural dismissals and substantive rulings result in an early end to trial, but we explained in Scott that the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquittal,\xe2\x80\x9d so a merits-related ruling concludes proceedings absolutely.  Id., at 91.  This is because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that \xe2\x80\x98even though innocent he may be found guilty,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.

And retrial following an acquittal would upset a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ex- pectation of repose, for it would subject him to additional \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassment, expense and ordeal\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 187.

The trial court granted Evans\xe2\x80\x99 motion under a rule that requires the court to \xe2\x80\x9cdirect a verdict of acquittal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is insufficient to support conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mich. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.419(A) (2012).  And the court\xe2\x80\x99s oral ruling leaves no doubt that it made its determination on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he testimony\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the State had presented.  491 Mich., at 8, 810 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at 539.

Under our precedents, then, Evans was acquitted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no question the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was wrong; it was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what facts the State needed to prove under State law.  But that is of no moment.  Martin Linen, Sanabria, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith all instruct that an acquittal due to insufficient evidence precludes retrial, whether the court\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the evidence was \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect or not,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin Linen, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571, and regardless of whether the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling of law.  Here Evans\xe2\x80\x99 acquittal was the product of an \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous interpretatio[n] of governing legal principles,\xe2\x80\x9d but as in our other cases, that error affects only \xe2\x80\x9cthe accuracy of [the] determination\xe2\x80\x9d to acquit, not \xe2\x80\x9cits essential character.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe court below saw things differently.  It identified a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally meaningful difference\xe2\x80\x9d between this case and our previous decisions.  Those cases, the court found, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[d] evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed to establish a factual element of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. crimes at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d but still ultimately involved \xe2\x80\x9ca resolution regarding the sufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 Mich., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, 810 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at 542\xe2\x80\x93543.  When a court mistakenly \xe2\x80\x9cidentifie[s] an extraneous element and dismisse[s] the case solely on that basis,\xe2\x80\x9d however, it has \xe2\x80\x9cnot resolve[d] or even address[ed] any factual element necessary to establish\xe2\x80\x9d the offense.  Id., at 15, 20, 810 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at 543, 546.  As a result, the court below reasoned, the case terminates \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an error of law unrelated to [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt or innocence on the ele-ments of the charged offense,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus falls outside the definition of an acquittal.

This case, like our previous ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because the State failed to prove some fact it was not actually required to prove.  Consider Rumsey.  There the trial court, sitting as sentencer in a capital case involving a murder committed during a robbery, mistakenly held that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statutory aggravating factor describing killings for pecuniary gain was limited to murders for hire.  Accordingly, it found the State had failed to prove the killing was for pecuniary gain and sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment.  After the State successfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand, we held that retrial on the penalty phase question was a double jeopardy violation.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe only relevant difference between that situation and this one is that in Rumsey the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error was called a \xe2\x80\x9cmisinterpretation\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cmisconstruction of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 207, 211, whereas here the error has been designated the \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous addition of [an] extraneous element to the charged offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 Mich., at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 810 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at 536.  But we have emphasized that labels do not control our analysis in this context; rather, the substance of a court\xe2\x80\x99s decision does.  See Smalis, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144, n.\xc2\xa05; Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 96\xe2\x80\x9397; Martin Linen, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571.  The error in Rumsey could just as easily have been characterized as the erroneous addition of an element of the statutory aggravating circumstance: that the homicide be a murder-for-hire.  Conversely, the error here could be viewed as a misinterpretation of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding or other real property\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude dwellings.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  This is far too fine a distinction to be meaningful, and we reject the notion that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights would turn on the happenstance of how an appellate court chooses to describe a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEchoing the Michigan Supreme Court, the State and the United States, as well as the dissent, emphasize Martin Linen\xe2\x80\x99s description of an acquittal as the \xe2\x80\x9cresolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571 (emphasis added); see Brief for Respondent 11\xe2\x80\x9317; see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11\xe2\x80\x9315 (hereinafter U.\xc2\xa0S. Brief); see post, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  They observe that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same \xe2\x80\x9coffence,\xe2\x80\x9d U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 5, cl.\xc2\xa02, and they note that an offense comprises constituent parts called elements, which are facts that must be proved to sustain a conviction.  See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 688\n\xe2\x80\x93697 (1993).  Consequently, they argue, only if an actual element of the offense is resolved can it be said that there has been an acquittal of the offense, because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98innocence of the charged offense\xe2\x80\x99 cannot turn on something that is concededly not an element of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Brief 15.  Because Evans\xe2\x80\x99 trial ended without resolution of even one actual element, they conclude, there was no acquittal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly, and it is inconsistent with our decisions since then.  Our focus in Martin Linen was on the significance of a judicial acquittal under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29.  The District Court in that case had \xe2\x80\x9cevaluated the Government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a con-viction.\xe2\x80\x9d  430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 572.  That determination of nonculpability was enough to make the acquittal akin to a jury verdict; our holding did not depend upon defining the \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense.  As we have explained, supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, Scott confirms that the relevant distinction is between judicial determinations that go to \xe2\x80\x9cthe criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of criminal culpability,\xe2\x80\x9d and those that hold \xe2\x80\x9cthat a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed\xe2\x80\x9d procedural error.  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98.  Culpability (i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate question of guilt or innocence\xe2\x80\x9d) is the touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or whether the determination of nonculpability was legally correct.  Id., at 98, n.\xc2\xa011 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps most inconsistent with the State\xe2\x80\x99s and United States\xe2\x80\x99 argument is Burks.  There we held that when a defendant raises insanity as a defense, and a court decides the \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment ha[s] failed to come forward with sufficient proof of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] capacity to be responsible for criminal acts,\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant has been acquitted because the court decided that \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal culpability ha[s] not been established.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 10.  Lack of insanity was not an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of Burks\xe2\x80\x99 offense, bank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon.  See \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72113(d) (1976 ed.).  Rather, insanity was an affirmative defense to criminal liability.  Our conclusion thus depended upon equating a judicial acquittal with an order finding insufficient evidence of culpability, not insufficient evidence of any particular element of the offense.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, this case follows those that have come before it.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of acquittal resolved the question of Evans\xe2\x80\x99 guilt or innocence as a matter of the sufficiency of the evidence, not on unrelated procedural grounds.  That judgment, \xe2\x80\x9chowever erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d it was, precludes reprosecution on this charge, and so should have barred the State\xe2\x80\x99s appeal as well.

Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  We disagree.  Our decision turns not on the form of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s action, but rather whether it \xe2\x80\x9cserve[s]\xe2\x80\x9d substantive \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes\xe2\x80\x9d or procedural ones.  Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98, n.\xc2\xa011.  If a trial court were to announce, midtrial, \xe2\x80\x9cThe defendant shall be acquitted because he was prejudiced by preindictment delay,\xe2\x80\x9d the Double Jeopardy Clause would pose no barrier to reprosecution, notwithstanding the \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal\xe2\x80\x9d label.  Cf. Scott, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 82\n.  Here we know the trial court acquitted Evans, not because it incanted the word \xe2\x80\x9cacquit\xe2\x80\x9d (which it did not), but because it acted on its view that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNext, the State and the United States fear that if the grounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for any reason at all, such as that the prosecution failed to prove \xe2\x80\x9cthat the structure burned [was] blue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 16\xe2\x80\x9317; U.\xc2\xa0S. Brief 15.  If the concern is that there is no limit to the magnitude of the error that could yield an acquittal, the response is that we have long held as much.  See supra, at 4.  If the concern is instead that our holding will make it easier for courts to insulate from review acquittals that are granted as a form of nullifi- cation, see Brief for Respondent 30, n.\xc2\xa058, we reject the premise.  We presume here, as in other contexts, that courts exercise their duties in good faith.  Cf. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the State suggests that because Evans induced the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error, he should not be heard to complain when that error is corrected and the State wishes to retry him.  Brief for Respondent 32\xe2\x80\x9333; cf. id., at 5\xe2\x80\x939.  But we have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cmost [judgments of acquittal] re- sult from defense motions,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o hold that a defendant waives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial court error in his favor on a midtrial motion leads to an acquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on which our system of criminal justice rests, and would vitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the \n \nFifth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sanabria, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 78 (citation omitted).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It is true that when a defendant persuades the court to declare a mistrial, jeopardy continues and retrial is generally allowed.  See United States v. Dinitz, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600 (1976)\n.  But in such circumstances the defendant consents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution, whereas when a defendant moves for acquittal he does not.  See Sanabria, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States makes a related argument.  It contends that Evans could have asked the court to resolve whether nondwelling status is an element of the offense before jeopardy attached, so having elected to wait until trial was underway to raise the point, he cannot now claim a double jeopardy violation.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Brief 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  The Government relies upon Lee v. United States, \n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 23 (1977)\n, in which the District Court dismissed an indictment midtrial because it had failed to allege the required intent element of the offense.  We held that retrial on a corrected indictment was not barred, because the dismissal was akin to a mistrial, not an acquittal.  This was clear because the District Court had separately denied the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment of acquittal, explaining that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98has been proven [guilty] beyond any reasonable doubt in the world,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d while acknowledging that the error in the indictment required dismissal.  Id., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Because the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cinvited the court to interrupt the proceedings before formalizing a finding on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d by raising the indictment issue so late, we held the principles governing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent to mistrial should apply.  Id., at 28 (citing Dinitz, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600\n).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government suggests the situation here is \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally similar,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying the elements of an offense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency of a charging document.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Brief 23.  But we can- not ignore the fact that what the trial court actually did here was rule on the sufficiency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s proof, not the sufficiency of the information filed against him.  Lee demonstrates that the two need not rise or fall together.  And even if the Government is correct that Evans could have challenged the charging document on the same legal theory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, it matters that he made only the latter motion, a motion that necessarily may not be made until trial is underway.  Evans cannot be penalized for requesting from the court a ruling on the merits of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case, as the Michigan Rules entitled him to do; whether he could have also brought a distinct procedural objection earlier on is beside the point.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the alternative, the State and the United States ask us to reconsider our past decisions.

Payne v. Tennessee, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808, \n827 (1991)\n.  The distinction drawn in Scott has stood the test of time, and we expect courts will continue to have little \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulty in distinguishing between those rulings which relate to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those which serve other purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98, n.\xc2\xa011 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See, e.g., United States v. Dionisio, 503 F.\xc2\xa03d 78, 83\xe2\x80\x9388 (CA2 2007) (collecting cases); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O.

There is no question that a jury verdict of acquittal precludes retrial, and thus bars appeal of any legal error that may have led to that acquittal.  See Ball, 163 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 671.  So, had the trial court here instructed the jury that it must find the burned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict, the jury would have acquitted Evans accordingly; \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] jury is presumed to follow its instructions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Blueford v.

From that premise, Fong Foo\xe2\x80\x99s holding follows: If a trial court instead exercises its discretion to direct a jury to return a verdict of acquittal, jeopardy also terminates notwithstanding any legal error, because there too it is the jury that returns an acquittal.  And from there, Martin Linen\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is unavoidable: It should make no difference whether the court employs the formality of directing the jury to return an acquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal itself.  Sanabria, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith merely apply Fong Foo and Martin Linen in tandem: If a trial court makes an antecedent legal error (as in Fong Foo), and then grants a judgment of acquittal rather than directing the jury to acquit (as in Martin Linen), the result is an acquittal all the same.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn other words, there is no way for antecedent legal errors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals unless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise to jury acquittals (contrary to the settled understanding that a jury verdict of acquittal is unreviewable), or unless we distinguish between juries that acquit pursuant to their instructions and judicial acquittals (notwithstand- ing that this is a purely formal distinction).  Neither option has become more attractive with time.  We therefore reiterate: \xe2\x80\x9cany contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause must itself .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at odds with the well-established rule that the bar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently wrong in law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 473.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the State and the United States object that this rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence to the jury, while the defendant reaps a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d from the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s unreviewable error.

Nothing obligates a jurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a midtrial acquittal, and at least two States disallow the practice.  See Nev. Rev.

Many jurisdictions, including the federal system, allow or encourage their courts to defer consideration of a motion to acquit until after the jury returns a verdict, which mitigates double jeopardy concerns.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See Fed.

As the Court has previously explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe common-law protection against double jeopardy historically applied only to charges on which a jury had rendered a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 466 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  As a result, the original understanding of the Clause, which is \xe2\x80\x9chardly a matter of dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott, supra, at 87, does not compel the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a defendant is acquitted for double jeopardy purposes whenever a judge issues a preverdict ruling that the prosecution has failed to prove a nonexistent \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of the charged offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough our decisions have expanded double jeopardy protection beyond its common-law origins, see, e.g., Smith, supra, at 466\xe2\x80\x93467 (acknowledging the Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of \xe2\x80\x9cthe common-law protection against double jeopardy\xe2\x80\x9d); Crist, supra, at 33\xe2\x80\x9334, I nonetheless count it significant that the result the Court reaches today finds no support in the relevant common-law analogues that \xe2\x80\x9clie at the core of the area protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d see Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 96.  And given how far we have departed from the common-law principles that applied at the time of the founding, we should at least ensure that our decisions in this area serve the underlying purposes of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.  See id., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396, 100\xe2\x80\x93101.  Yet today\xe2\x80\x99s decision fails to advance the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Double Jeopardy Clause is largely based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe deeply ingrained principle that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and or- deal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yeager v. United States, \n\n557 U. S. 110\n\xe2\x80\x93118 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Blueford v. Arkansas, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5); Martin Linen, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569.  Allowing retrial in the circumstances of the present case would not result in any such abuse.  The prosecution would not be afforded a second opportunity to persuade the factfinder that its evidence satisfies the actual elements of the offense.  Instead, because the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in the first trial was not based on an actual element of the charged offense, retrial would simply give the prosecution one fair opportunity to prove its case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAllowing retrial in this case would not permit prosecutors \xe2\x80\x9cto make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\xe2\x80\x9d Yeager, supra, at 117.  It was petitioner, not the prosecutor, who sought to terminate the trial prior to verdict.  Thus, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unexplained suggestion, see ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case hardly presents the specter of \xe2\x80\x98an all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101\n\xe2\x80\x93115 (2003) (quoting Scott, supra, at 96).  On the contrary, this is a case in which defense counsel fooled the judge into committing an error that provided his client with an undeserved benefit, the termination of a trial that the defense obviously did not want to run to completion.  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require that the defense receive an even greater benefit, the protection provided by an acquittal.  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs this Court has repeatedly emphasized in double jeopardy cases, a State has an interest in receiving \xe2\x80\x9cone complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws,\xe2\x80\x9d Sattazahn, supra, at 115 (internal quotation marks omitted); Scott, supra, at 100, but today\xe2\x80\x99s decision deprives the State of Michigan of this valuable right.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision also flies in the face of our established understanding of the meaning of an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.  The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \xe2\x80\x9cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ouble-jeopardy analysis focuses on the individual \xe2\x80\x98offence\xe2\x80\x99 charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 469, n.\xc2\xa03.  And to determine what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual \xe2\x80\x98offence\xe2\x80\x99 charged,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the Court homes in on the elements of the offense.  See United States v. Dixon, \n\n509 U. S. 688, \n696 (1993)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts, this Court has concluded that where the two of- fenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the \xe2\x80\x98same-elements\xe2\x80\x99 test, the double jeopardy bar applies\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consistent with the constitutional text\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the \xe2\x80\x9coffence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thus the elements\xe2\x80\x94with which a defendant is charged, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-jeopardy cases have consistently\xe2\x80\x9d defined an acquittal as a decision that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith, supra, at 468 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at 571); see also Scott, supra, at 97 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant is acquitted only when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s favor, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday, the Court effectively abandons the well-established definition of an acquittal.  Indeed, in the face of our repeated holdings that an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes requires a \xe2\x80\x9cresolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith, supra, at 468; Martin Linen, supra, at 571; see also Scott, supra, at 97, the Court now declares that \xe2\x80\x9cthe touchstone [is] not whether any particular elements were resolved,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 10 (emphasis added).  Instead, the Court proclaims that the dispositive question is whether a midtrial termination represented a \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural dismissa[l]\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive rulin[g],\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 5.  This reformulation of double jeopardy law is not faithful to our prece- dents\xe2\x80\x94or to the Double Jeopardy Clause itself.  The key question is not whether a ruling is \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d (whatever those terms mean in this context), but whether a ruling relates to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s factual guilt or innocence with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9coffence,\xe2\x80\x9d see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5\xe2\x80\x94and thus the elements\xe2\x80\x94with which he is charged.  See Scott, supra, at 87, 97\xe2\x80\x9399, and n. 11.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen a judge evaluates the evidence and determines that the prosecution has not proved facts that are legally sufficient to satisfy the actual elements of the charged offense, the ruling, however labeled, represents an acquittal because it is founded on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s factual innocence.  See Martin Linen, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 572.  But when a judge manufactures an additional \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d of an offense and then holds that there is insufficient evidence to prove that extra \xe2\x80\x9celement,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge has not resolved the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfactual guilt or innocence\xe2\x80\x9d as to any of the actual elements of the offense.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, the ruling, no matter what the judge calls it, does not acquit the defendant of the offense with which he is charged.  No acquittal occurs when a criminal trial is terminated \xe2\x80\x9con a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which [a defendant] is accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scott, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 87, 94\xe2\x80\x9395, 98\xe2\x80\x9399.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the proceedings against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 98\xe2\x80\x9399 (reasoning that, in such a case, the defendant was \xe2\x80\x9cneither acquitted nor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook to persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt or innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try him\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, its decision in this case is not supported by prior precedent.  In all three of the principal cases on which the Court relies\xe2\x80\x94Smalis v. Pennsylvania, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140 (1986)\n; Smith, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462\n; and Arizona v. Rumsey, \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203 (1984)\n\xe2\x80\x94trial judges ruled that the prosecution had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements of the offenses in question.  In none of these cases (and in none of our other double jeopardy cases) did a trial judge terminate a prosecution before verdict based on an element of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s own creation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first two cases, Smalis and Smith, involved gar- den variety preverdict acquittals, i.e., rulings based on the ground that the prosecution had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements of an offense.  (Using conventional modern terminology, Rule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure explicitly labels such rulings \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal[s].\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Smalis, the judge, at the close of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief, granted a demurrer with respect to certain charges on the ground that the evidence regarding those charges was \xe2\x80\x9clegally insufficient to support a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141.  The State Supreme Court held that this ruling was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes because it was based on a legal determination (i.e., that the evidence was not sufficient) rather than a factual finding, but we rejected that distinction.  Id., at 143\xe2\x80\x93144.  See also Sanabria v. United States, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 54\n\xe2\x80\x9372 (1978).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSmith involved a similar situation. There, one of the elements of a firearms offense with which the defendant was charged required proof that the gun \xe2\x80\x9chad a barrel \xe2\x80\x98less than 16 inches\xe2\x80\x99 in length,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 464, and the trial judge dismissed this charge before verdict on the ground that the prosecution had not introduced sufficient evidence to establish this undisputed element, id., at 464\xe2\x80\x93465.  Before the remaining charges were submitted to the jury, however, the judge reversed this ruling and allowed the charge to go to the jury.  Id., at 465.  We held, how- ever, that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s prior ruling constituted an acquittal and therefore barred the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for this offense.  Id., at 467\xe2\x80\x93469.  Thus, both Smalis and Smith involved rulings that were very different from the one at issue here.  In both of those earlier cases, the trial judges held that the evidence was insufficient to prove undis- puted elements of the offenses in question.  In neither case did the judge invent a new element.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe final case, Rumsey, differs from Smalis and Smith in only one particular.  Like Smalis and Smith, Rumsey involved a ruling that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence was in- sufficient to prove an element, but in Rumsey the ruling was predicated on a misconstruction of an element.  In that case, after the defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial judge, with no jury, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. con- ducted a separate sentencing hearing\xe2\x80\x9d at which he determined that no aggravating circumstances were present.  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 205.  In particular, the judge found that the prosecution had not proved that the murder had been committed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(F)(5) (Supp. 1983\xe2\x80\x931984)).  The judge reached this conclusion because, in his (incorrect) view, that aggravating circumstance was limited to contract killings.  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.  Holding that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling constituted an acquittal on the merits of the question whether a death sentence was appropriate, we noted that the ruling rested on \xe2\x80\x9ca misconstruction of the statute defining the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 211.  Accordingly, the ruling was based on a determination that there was insufficient evidence to prove a real element; it was not based on the judicial invention of an extra \xe2\x80\x9celement.\xe2\x80\x9d  And for that reason, it does not support the nonsensical result that the Court reaches today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court may feel compelled to reach that result because it thinks that it would be unworkable to draw a distinction between a preverdict termination based on the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s misconstruction of an element of an offense and a preverdict termination based on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s perception that a statute contains an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d that is actually nonexistent.  This practical concern is overblown.  There may be cases in which this determination presents problems, but surely there are many cases in which the de- termination is quite easy.  The present case is a perfect example, for here there is no real dispute that the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was based on a nonexistent statutory \xe2\x80\x9celement.\xe2\x80\x9d  As noted, defense counsel conceded on appeal that the judge had \xe2\x80\x9cwrongly added an extraneous element to the statute\xe2\x80\x9d under which his client was charged.  491 Mich., at 3, 810 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 536.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother good example is provided by State v. Korsen, 138 Idaho 706, 69 P.\xc2\xa03d 126 (2003), where a Magistrate erroneously concluded that the offense of criminal trespass under Idaho law requires a showing that the defendant did something to justify the property owner\xe2\x80\x99s request for the defendant to leave the premises.

There is no question that the Magistrate in Korsen \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively created an additional statutory element\xe2\x80\x9d before concluding that the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence as to this purported \xe2\x80\x9celement.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ibid.
