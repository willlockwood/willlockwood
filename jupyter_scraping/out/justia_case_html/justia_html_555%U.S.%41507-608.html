HAYES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">UNITED STATES <em>v</em>. HAYES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93608.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 10, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 24, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">In 1996, Congress extended the federal Gun Control Act of 1968\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on possession of a firearm by convicted felons to include persons convicted of \xe2\x80\x9ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  Responding to a 911 call reporting domestic violence, police officers discovered a rifle in respondent Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Based on this and other evidence, Hayes was charged under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2) with possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  The indictment identified as the predicate misdemeanor offense Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s 1994 conviction for battery against his then-wife, in violation of West Virginia law.  Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his 1994 conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) because West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s generic battery law did not designate a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the offense.  When the District Court denied the motion, Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that a \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) predicate offense must have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d contained in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), imposes two requirements.  First, the crime must have, \xe2\x80\x9cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  Second, it must be \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The definition does not, however, require the predicate-offense statute to include, as an element, the existence of that domestic relationship.  Instead, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for \xe2\x80\x9can offense \xe2\x80\xa6 committed by\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the singular word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element, the use of force.  Had Congress also meant to make the specified relationship a predicate-offense element, it likely would have used the plural \xe2\x80\x9celements,\xe2\x80\x9d as it has done in other offense-defining provisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(c)(2)(A).  Treating the specified relationship as a predicate-offense element is also awkward as a matter of syntax.  It requires the reader to regard \xe2\x80\x9cthe use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d as an expression modified by the relative clause \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is more natural, however, to say a person \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d than to say one \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s textual arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  First, that court noted, clause (ii) is separated from clause (i)\xe2\x80\x94which defines \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by a line break and a semicolon, while clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s components\xe2\x80\x94force and domestic relationship\xe2\x80\x94are joined in an unbroken word flow.  Such less-than-meticulous drafting hardly shows that Congress meant to exclude from \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition domestic abusers convicted under generic assault or battery laws.  As structured, \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) defines \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d by addressing in clause (i) the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor,\xe2\x80\x9d and in clause (ii) \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d involves both a use of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to confine laws qualifying under \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as elements both use of force and domestic relationship.  A related statutory provision, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72803(3)(C), indicates that Congress did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line breaks and semicolons in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  Second, the Fourth Circuit relied on the \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent\xe2\x80\x9d to read \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d as modifying the immediately preceding use-of-force phrase rather than the earlier word \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  The last-antecedent rule, however, \xe2\x80\x9cis not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/20/index.html">540 U. S. 20</a>, 26.  Applying the rule here would require the Court to accept the unlikely premises that Congress employed the singular \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction \xe2\x80\x9ccommi[t]\xe2\x80\x9d a use.  The rule, moreover, would render the word \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous, for Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to \xe2\x80\x9cthe use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force \xe2\x80\xa6 by a current or former spouse \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Practical considerations strongly support this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s proponents sought to close a loophole:\xc2\xa0Existing felon-in-possession laws often failed to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, for such offenders generally were not charged with, or convicted of, felonies.  Construing \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would frustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 manifest purpose.  The statute would have been a dead letter in some two-thirds of the States because, in 1996, only about one-third of them had criminal statutes specifically proscribing <em>domestic </em>violence.  Hayes argues that the measure that became \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(g)(9) and 921(a)(33)(A), though it initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, was revised and narrowed during the legislative process, but his argument is not corroborated by the revisions he identifies.  Indeed, \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s Senate sponsor observed that a domestic relationship often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense.  Such remarks are \xe2\x80\x9cnot controlling,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/index.html">447 U. S. 102</a>, 118, but the legislative record is otherwise silent.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The rule of lenity, on which Hayes also relies, applies only when a statute is ambiguous.  Section 921(a)(33)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s definition, though not a model of the careful drafter\xe2\x80\x99s art, is also not \xe2\x80\x9cgrievous[ly] ambigu[ous].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Huddleston</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/814/index.html">415 U. S. 814</a>, 831.  The text, context, purpose, and what little drafting history there is all point in the same direction: Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d to include an offense \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.

S. C. \xc2\xa7921 <em>et seq</em>., has long prohibited possession of a firearm by any person convicted of a felony.  In 1996, Congress extended the prohibition to include persons convicted of \xe2\x80\x9ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d contained in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), is at issue in this case.  Does that term cover a misdemeanor battery whenever the battered victim was in fact the offender\xe2\x80\x99s spouse (or other relation specified in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A))?  Or, to trigger the possession ban, must the predicate misdemeanor identify as an element of the crime a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim?  We hold that the domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2004, law enforcement officers in Marion County, West Virginia, came to the home of Randy Edward Hayes in response to a 911 call reporting domestic violence.  Hayes consented to a search of his home, and the officers discovered a rifle.  Further investigation revealed that Hayes had recently possessed several other firearms as well.  Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned an indictment in 2005, charging Hayes, under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2), with three counts of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The indictment identified Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s predicate misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as a 1994 conviction for battery in violation of West Virginia law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The victim of that battery, the indictment alleged, was Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s then-wife\xe2\x80\x94a person who \xe2\x80\x9cshared a child in common\xe2\x80\x9d with Hayes and \xe2\x80\x9cwho was cohabitating with . . . him as a spouse.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Asserting that his 1994 West Virginia battery conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment.  Section 922(g)(9), Hayes maintained, applies only to persons previously convicted of an offense that has as an element a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim.  The West Virginia statute under which he was convicted in 1994, Hayes observed, was a generic battery proscription, not a law designating a domestic relationship between offender and victim as an element of the offense.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia rejected Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s argument and denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.  377 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 540, 541\xe2\x80\x93542 (2005).  Hayes then entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.  A \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) predicate offense, the Court of Appeals held, must \xe2\x80\x9chave as an element a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 F.\xc2\xa03d 749, 751 (2007).  In so ruling, the Fourth Circuit created a split between itself and the nine other Courts of Appeals that had previously published opinions deciding the same question.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  According to those courts, \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) does not require that the offense predicate to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s firearm possession conviction have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim.  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve this conflict.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 922(g)(9) makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person \xe2\x80\xa6 who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence \xe2\x80\xa6 [to] possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 921(a)(33)(A) defines \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x99 means an offense that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim\xe2\x80\x9d (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This definition, all agree, imposes two requirements: First, a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d must have, \xe2\x80\x9cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, it must be \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  The question here is whether the language of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) calls for a further limitation: Must the statute describing the predicate offense include, as a discrete element, the existence of a domestic relationship between offender and victim?  In line with the large majority of the Courts of Appeals, we conclude that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) does not require a predicate-offense statute of that specificity.  Instead, in a \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) prosecution, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for \xe2\x80\x9can offense \xe2\x80\xa6 committed by\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note as an initial matter that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) uses the word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d in the singular, which suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element.  Immediately following the word \xe2\x80\x9celement,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the use of force (undoubtedly a required element) and thereafter to the relationship between aggressor and victim, <em>e.g.</em>, a current or former spouse.  The manner in which the offender acts, and the offender\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the victim, are \xe2\x80\x9cconceptually distinct attributes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Meade</em>, 175 F.\xc2\xa03d 215, 218 (CA1 1999).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Had Congress meant to make the latter as well as the former an element of the predicate offense, it likely would have used the plural \xe2\x80\x9celements,\xe2\x80\x9d as it has done in other offense-defining provisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(c)(2)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98assault with intent to commit rape\xe2\x80\x99 means an offense that has as its elements engaging in physical contact with another person or using or brandishing a weapon against another person with intent to commit aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 559 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed &lt;Burke failed to prove the element of proximate cause in prosecuting his negligence claim&gt;\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Treating the relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the predicate offense is also awkward as a matter of syntax.  It requires the reader to regard \xe2\x80\x9cthe use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d as an expression modified by the relative clause \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by.\xe2\x80\x9d  In ordinary usage, however, we would not say that a person \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is more natural to say that a person \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Belless</em>, 338 F.\xc2\xa03d 1063, 1066 (CA9 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cOne can \xe2\x80\x98commit\xe2\x80\x99 a crime or an offense, but one does not \xe2\x80\x98commit\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98force\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98use.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching the conclusion that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) renders both the use of force and a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim necessary elements of a qualifying predicate offense, the Fourth Circuit majority relied on two textual arguments.  First, the court noted that clause (ii) is separated from clause (i) by a line break and a semicolon; in contrast, the components of clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x94force and domestic relationship\xe2\x80\x94are joined in an unbroken word flow.

In 2006, Congress amended \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(i) to include misdemeanors under \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ribal law\xe2\x80\x9d as predicate offenses.  As a companion measure, Congress simultaneously enacted \xc2\xa72803(3)(C), which employs use-of-force and domestic-relationship language virtually identical to the language earlier placed in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(i), except that \xc2\xa72803(3)(C) uses no semicolon or line break.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2803(3)(C) authorizes federal agents to \xe2\x80\x9cmake an arrest without a warrant for an offense committed in Indian country if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe offense is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence \xe2\x80\xa6 and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent or guardian of the victim . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nAt the time Congress enacted \xc2\xa72803(3)(C), the Courts of Appeals uniformly agreed that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) did not limit predicate offenses to statutory texts specifying both a use of force and a domestic relationship as offense elements.  Congress presumably knew how \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) had been construed, and presumably intended \xc2\xa72803(3)(C) to bear the same meaning.

Relying on spacing and punctuation to hem in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), while reading \xc2\xa72803(3)(C) to contain no similar limitation, would create a disjunction between these two provisions that Congress could not have\nintended.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a second justification for its construction of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), the Court of Appeals invoked the \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent,\xe2\x80\x9d under which \xe2\x80\x9ca limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/20/index.html">540 U.

The words \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d immediately follow the use-of-force language, the court observed, and therefore should be read to modify that phrase, not the earlier word \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 482 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 753\xe2\x80\x93755.

Moreover, as the dissent acknowledges, <em>post</em>, at 4, the last-antecedent rule would render the word \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous: Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to \xe2\x80\x9cthe use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force \xe2\x80\xa6 by a current or former spouse \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  \xe2\x80\x9cCommitted\xe2\x80\x9d retains its operative meaning only if it is read to modify \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most sensibly read, then, \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) defines \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as a misdemeanor offense that (1) \xe2\x80\x9chas, as an element, the use [of force],\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) is committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  To obtain a conviction in a \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate offense was the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s current or former spouse or was related to the defendant in another specified way.  But that relationship, while it must be established, need not be denominated an element of the predicate offense.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Practical considerations strongly support our reading of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s language.  Existing felon-in-possession laws, Congress recognized, were not keeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, because \xe2\x80\x9cmany people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies.\xe2\x80\x9d  142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996) (statement of Sen. Lautenberg).  By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime[s] of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d proponents of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) sought to \xe2\x80\x9cclose this dangerous loophole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 22986.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Construing \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute (one that does not designate a domestic relationship as an element of the offense) would frustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 manifest purpose.  Firearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination nationwide.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x9315; Brief for National Network to End Domestic Violence et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 2\xe2\x80\x938.  Yet, as interpreted by the Fourth Circuit, \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) would have been \xe2\x80\x9ca dead letter\xe2\x80\x9d in some two-thirds of the States from the very moment of its enactment.  482 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 762 (Williams, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As of 1996, only about one-third of the States had criminal statutes that specifically proscribed <em>domestic </em>violence.  See Brief for United States 23, n.\xc2\xa08.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Even in those States, domestic abusers were (and are) routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault or battery laws.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.  And no statute defining a distinct federal misdemeanor designated as an element of the offense a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim.  Yet Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor[s] under Federal \xe2\x80\xa6 law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(i).  Given the paucity of state and federal statutes targeting <em>domestic </em>violence, we find it highly improbable that Congress meant to extend \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense.  See <em>Barnes</em>, 295 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1364 (rejecting the view that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress remedied one disparity\xe2\x80\x94between felony and misdemeanor domestic violence convictions\xe2\x80\x94while at the same time creating a new disparity among (and sometimes, within) states\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The measure that became \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) and \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), Hayes acknowledges, initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, see Brief for Respondent 28\xe2\x80\x9329, but the text of the proposal, he maintains, was revised and narrowed while the measure remained in the congressional hopper.  The compromise reflected in the text that gained passage, Hayes argues, restricted the legislation to offenses specifically denominating a domestic relationship as a defining element.  The changes Hayes identifies, however, do not corroborate his argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress did revise the language of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) to spell out the use-of-force requirement.  The proposed legislation initially described the predicate domestic-violence offense as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence \xe2\x80\xa6 committed by\xe2\x80\x9d a person who had a domestic relationship with the victim.  142 Cong. Rec. 5840.  The final version replaced the unelaborated phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  This apparently last-minute insertion may help to explain some of the syntactical awkwardness of the enacted language, but it does not evince an intention to convert the \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d phrase into a required element of the predicate\noffense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in a floor statement discussing the revised version of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), Senator Frank Lautenberg, the sponsor of the provision, observed that a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[C]onvictions for domestic violence-related crimes often are for crimes, such as assault, that are not explicitly identified as related to domestic violence.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  The question before the Court is whether the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) includes misdemeanor offenses with no domestic-relationship element.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 921(a)(33)(A) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x99 means an offense that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority would read the \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d phrase in clause (ii) to modify the word \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d in the opening clause of subparagraph (A), leapfrogging the word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d at the outset of clause (ii).  That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute.  Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would therefore be subject to prosecution under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held to the contrary that \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d modifies the immediately preceding phrase: \xe2\x80\x9cthe use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A); 482 F.\xc2\xa03d 749, 753\xe2\x80\x93754 (CA4 2007).  Read that way, a domestic relationship is an element of the prior offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That seems to be the most natural reading right off the bat.  The term at issue is \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is a defined term\xe2\x80\x94so the definition certainly must be parsed\xe2\x80\x94but it would be at least surprising to find from that parsing that a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d need not by its terms have anything to do with domestic violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01. The grammatical rule of the last antecedent indicates that the domestic relationship is a required element of the predicate offense.  That rule instructs that \xe2\x80\x9ca limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/20/index.html">540 U. S. 20</a>, 26 (2003).  Pursuant to that rule, the \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d phrase in clause (ii) is best read to modify the preceding phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 482 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 754\xe2\x80\x93755.  By not following the usual grammatical rule, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading requires jumping over two line breaks, clause (i), a semicolon, and the first portion of clause (ii) to reach the more distant antecedent (\xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d).  Due to the floating \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x9d after \xe2\x80\x9coffense,\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d modified \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d the text would read \xe2\x80\x9coffense that committed by.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority counters that people do not ordinarily say someone \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  True enough, but only because \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force is a term that encompasses a variety of conduct, which if listed separately would not pose the objection the majority raises (<em>e.g.,</em> commits a battery, robbery, or kidnaping).  There is no reason to believe that the reasonable drafting decision to insert \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force rather than coming up with a laundry list of offenses was meant to alter the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also relies on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d in the singular.  From that, the majority infers that Congress intended to describe only one required element\xe2\x80\x94the use of force.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  In its view, Congress would have used the plural \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d if it meant to encompass both the use of force and the offender\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the victim.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That argument is contrary to the Dictionary Act, which specifies that unless the context indicates otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cwords importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71; see <em>Rowland</em> v. <em>California Men\xe2\x80\x99s Colony, Unit II Men\xe2\x80\x99s Advisory Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/194/index.html">506 U. S. 194</a>, 200 (1993).  More significantly, reading \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d as limited to the singular does not resolve what that element is.  See <em>United States </em>v<em>. Barnes</em>, 295 F.\xc2\xa03d 1354, 1369 (CADC 2002) (Sentelle, J., dissenting).  A single element often contains multiple components.  In the very provision at issue, the \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened use of a deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d includes three concepts: (1) the threatened use (2) of a weapon (3) that is deadly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other statutes, Congress has used the word \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d in the singular to refer to the use of force and its object.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(a) (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority finds it \xe2\x80\x9cunsurprising\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress would have chosen to combine the mode of aggression and its object in a \xe2\x80\x9csingle, undifferentiated element.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, n. 4.  It asserts, however, that Congress would not have so joined the use of force and the offender\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the victim, because those requirements \xe2\x80\x9care not readily conceptualized as a single element.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  That distinction is elusive; both 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(a) and the provision at issue here contain as distinct components the act (use of force) and the target (person or property in the former case, domestic relationship victim in the latter).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also points out that interpreting \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d to modify the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force would render the word \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  That may be so, but as shown, reading \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d to modify \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d has its own flaws.  All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading.  The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects \xe2\x80\x9cless-than-meticulous drafting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csyntactical awkwardness,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cis not a model of the careful drafter\xe2\x80\x99s art.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 6, 12, 13.  I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading.  But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02. That brings us to the structure of the statute.  The most natural reading of the statute, as it is laid out, is that the underlying misdemeanor must have as an element the use of force committed by a person in a domestic relationship with the victim.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is twice qualified: first, by the relative clause \xe2\x80\x9cis a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law\xe2\x80\x9d; and second by the relative clause \xe2\x80\x9chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by [a person in a specified domestic relationship with the victim].\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) (footnote omitted).  The fact that Congress included the domestic relationship language in the clause of the statute designating the element of the predicate offense strongly suggests that it is in fact part of the required element.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading requires restructuring the statute and adding words.  The majority first must place the \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d phrase in its own clause\xe2\x80\x94set off by a line break, a semicolon, or \xe2\x80\x9c(iii)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to indicate that \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d refers all the way back to \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, as noted, because the word \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x9d appears at the end of subparagraph (A), the statute would then read \xe2\x80\x9can offense that committed by.\xe2\x80\x9d  To arrive at its reading, the majority must ignore the floating \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x9d or add \xe2\x80\x9cand is\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government would define \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can offense, committed by a person with a domestic relationship with the victim, that is a misdemeanor and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 13; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\xe2\x80\x939.  That reading also requires rearranging the statute.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d phrase would have to be severed from clause (ii) and moved up to appear after the word \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d in subparagraph (A).  Changing and rearranging the wording as the Government does to explain what the actual words mean is, in any event, not a compelling line of argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to diminish the magnitude of these alterations by stating that the lawmakers might have better conveyed their intent by setting off the \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d phrase with \xe2\x80\x9ca semicolon\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca line break.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ante</em>, at 6.  But those are not insignificant revisions; they alter the structure of the statute, and we have recognized that structure is often critical in resolving verbal ambiguity.  See <em>Castillo</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/120/index.html">530 U. S. 120</a>, 124 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure clarifies any ambiguity inherent in its literal language\xe2\x80\x9d).  I therefore respectfully disagree with the majority that \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is most sensibly read as including misdemeanor offenses without a domestic-relationship element.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03. Moving beyond text and structure, the majority recognizes that there is \xe2\x80\x9clittle . . . drafting history,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, but gamely trots out what there is: a statement on the floor of the Senate by the bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, see <em>ante</em>, at 12.  Such tidbits do not amount to much.  See <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/index.html">447 U. S. 102</a>, 118 (1980).  This is especially true here where the statement was delivered the day the legislation was passed and <em>after</em> the House of Representatives had passed the pertinent provision.  See <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/546/index.html">545 U. S. 546</a>, 568 (2005); see also Brief for Respondent 33.  The majority nonetheless looks to the floor statement because \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislative record is otherwise \xe2\x80\x98absolutely silent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But that is no reason to accord the statement significance: We dismiss the value of such statements due to their inherent flaws as guides to legislative intent, flaws that persist (and indeed may be amplified) in the absence of other indicia of intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also finds it \xe2\x80\x9chighly improbable that Congress meant to extend \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  In its view, construing \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to exclude persons convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 manifest purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 10, of keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. <em> </em>See <em>ante</em>, at 10 (quoting statement of Sen. Lautenberg, 142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Invoking the <em>sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s</em> objective as <em>Congress\xe2\x80\x99s</em> manifest purpose, however, \xe2\x80\x9cignores the complexity of the problems Congress is called upon to address and the dynamics of legislative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Governors, FRS</em> v. <em>Dimension Financial Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/361/index.html">474 U. S. 361</a>, 373\xe2\x80\x93374 (1986).  Legislative enactments are the result of negotiations between competing interests; \xe2\x80\x9cthe final language of the legislation may reflect hard-fought compromises.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 374.  Even if there were sufficient sentiment to extend the gun ban, individual legislators might have disagreed on the appropriate reach of the new provision.  See <em>ibid</em>.  Some members might well have been willing to extend the ban beyond individuals convicted of felonies, but only if the predicate misdemeanor by its terms was addressed to domestic violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04. The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach will entail significant problems in application.  Under the interpretation adopted by the court below, it is easy to determine whether an individual is covered by the gun ban: Simply look to the record of the prior conviction.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, on the other hand, it will often be necessary to go beyond the fact of conviction and \xe2\x80\x9cengage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior offens[e],\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 601 (1990), to determine whether it happened to involve domestic violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is one reason we adopted a categorical approach to predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(1), \xe2\x80\x9clooking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor, supra</em>, at 600; see <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 19 (2005) (Court considered \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate offens[e] in terms not of prior conduct but of prior \xe2\x80\x98convictions\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98element[s]\xe2\x80\x99 of crimes\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we warned in <em>Taylor</em> and reaffirmed in <em>Shepard</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach are daunting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 601; see <em>Shepard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 20.  Those same concerns are implicated here, given that the majority would require juries and courts to look at the particular facts of a prior conviction to determine whether it happened to involve domestic violence, rather than simply looking to the elements of the predicate offense.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4-5.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05. Taking a fair view, the text of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) is ambiguous, the structure leans in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the purpose leans in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor, and the legislative history does not amount to much.  This is a textbook case for application of the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause construction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for fair warning, it is rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by the text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crandon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/152/index.html">494 U. S. 152</a>, 160 (1990).  It cannot fairly be said here that the text \xe2\x80\x9cclearly warrants\xe2\x80\x9d the counterintuitive conclusion that a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d need not have domestic violence as an element.  That leaves the majority\xe2\x80\x99s arguments about legislative history and statutory purpose.  This is not the \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d case in which such grounds provide \xe2\x80\x9cfair warning,\xe2\x80\x9d especially given that there is nothing wrong with the conduct punished\xe2\x80\x94possessing a firearm\xe2\x80\x94if the prior misdemeanor is not covered by the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the rule of lenity means anything, it is that an individual should not go to jail for failing to conduct a 50-state survey or comb through obscure legislative history.  Ten years in jail is too much to hinge on the will-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-wisp of statutory meaning pursued by the majority.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
