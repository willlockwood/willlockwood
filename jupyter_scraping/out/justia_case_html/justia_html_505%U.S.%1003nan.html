At that time, Lucas\'s lots were not subject to the State\'s coastal zone building permit requirements. In 1988, however, the state legislature enacted the Beachfront Management Act, which barred Lucas from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his parcels. He filed suit against respondent state agency, contending that, even though the Act may have been a lawful exercise of the State\'s police power, the ban on construction deprived him of all "economically viable use" of his property and therefore effected a "taking" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments that required the payment of just compensation.

Toward the close of the development cycle for one residential subdivision known as "Beachwood East," Lucas in 1986 purchased the two lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. No portion of the lots, which were located approximately 300 feet from the beach, qualified as a "critical area" under the 1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these parcels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from the Council in advance of any development activity. His intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of the immediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect singlefamily residences. He commissioned architectural drawings for this purpose.</p><p>The Beachfront Management Act brought Lucas\'s plans to an abrupt end. Under that 1988 legislation, the Council was directed to establish a "baseline" connecting the landwardmost "point[s] of erosion ... during the past forty years" in the region of the Isle of Palms that includes Lucas\'s lots. S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-280(A)(2) (Supp. 1988).1 In action not challenged here, the Council fixed this baseline landward of Lucas\'s parcels. That was significant, for under the Act</p><p>1 This specialized historical method of determining the baseline applied because the Beachwood East subdivision is located adjacent to a so-called "inlet erosion zone" (defined in the Act to mean "a segment of shoreline along or adjacent to tidal inlets which are directly influenced by the inlet and its associated shoals," S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-270(7) (Supp. 1988)) that is "not stabilized by jetties, terminal groins, or other structures," \xc2\xa7 48-39-280(A)(2). For areas other than these unstabilized inlet erosion zones, the statute directs that the baseline be established along "the crest of an ideal primary oceanfront sand dune." \xc2\xa748-39-280(A)(1).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1009">1009</a></p><p>construction of occupable improvements 2 was flatly prohibited seaward of a line drawn 20 feet landward of, and parallel to, the baseline. \xc2\xa7 48-39-290(A). The Act provided no exceptions.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>Lucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, contending that the Beachfront Management Act\'s construction bar effected a taking of his property without just compensation. Lucas did not take issue with the validity of the Act as a lawful exercise of South Carolina\'s police power, but contended that the Act\'s complete extinguishment of his property\'s value entitled him to compensation regardless of whether the legislature had acted in furtherance of legitimate police power objectives. Following a bench trial, the court agreed. Among its factual determinations was the finding that "at the time Lucas purchased the two lots, both were zoned for single-family residential construction and ... there were no restrictions imposed upon such use of the property by either the State of South Carolina, the County of Charleston, or the Town of the Isle of Palms." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. The trial court further found that the Beachfront Management Act decreed a permanent ban on construction insofar as Lucas\'s lots were concerned, and that this prohibition "deprive[d] Lucas of any reasonable economic use of the lots, ... eliminated the unrestricted right of use, and render[ed] them valueless." <i>Id., </i>at 37. The court thus concluded that Lucas\'s properties had been "taken" by operation of the Act, and it ordered respondent to pay "just compensation" in the amount of <i>$1,232,387.50. Id., </i>at 40.</p><p>The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed. It found dispositive what it described as Lucas\'s concession "that the</p><p>2 The Act did allow the construction of certain nonhabitable improvements, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>"wooden walkways no larger in width than six feet," and "small wooden decks no larger than one hundred forty-four square feet." \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 48-39-290(A)(1) and (2).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1010">1010</a></p><p>Beachfront Management Act [was] properly and validly designed to preserve ... South Carolina\'s beaches." 304 S. C. 376, 379, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 896 (1991). Failing an attack on the validity of the statute as such, the court believed itself bound to accept the "uncontested ... findings" of the South Carolina Legislature that new construction in the coastal zone-such as petitioner intended-threatened this public resource. <i>Id., </i>at 383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. The court ruled that when a regulation respecting the use of property is designed "to prevent serious public harm," <i>id., </i>at 383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 899 (citing, <i>inter alia, Mugler </i>v. <i>Kansas, 123 </i>U. S. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under the Takings Clause regardless of the regulation\'s effect on the property\'s value.</p><p>Two justices dissented. They acknowledged that our <i>Mugler </i>line of cases recognizes governmental power to prohibit "noxious" uses of property-i. <i>e., </i>uses of property akin to "public nuisances"-without having to pay compensation. But they would not have characterized the Beachfront Management Act\'s <i>"primary </i>purpose [as] the prevention of a nuisance." 304 S. C., at 395, 404 S. E. 2d, at 906 (Harwell, J., dissenting). To the dissenters, the chief purposes of the legislation, among them the promotion of tourism and the creation of a "habitat for indigenous flora and fauna," could not fairly be compared to nuisance abatement. <i>Id., </i>at 396, 404 S. E. 2d, at 906. As a consequence, they would have affirmed the trial court\'s conclusion that the Act\'s obliteration of the value of petitioner\'s lots accomplished a taking.</p><p>We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 966 (1991).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>As a threshold matter, we must briefly address the Council\'s suggestion that this case is inappropriate for plenary review. After briefing and argument before the South Carolina Supreme Court, but prior to issuance of that court\'s opinion, the Beachfront Management Act was amended to</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1011">1011</a></p><p>authorize the Council, in certain circumstances, to issue "special permits" for the construction or reconstruction of habitable structures seaward of the baseline. See S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-290(D)(1) (Supp. 1991). According to the Council, this amendment renders Lucas\'s claim of a permanent deprivation unripe, as Lucas may yet be able to secure permission to build on his property. "[The Court\'s] cases," we are reminded, "uniformly reflect an insistence on knowing the nature and extent of permitted development before adjudicating the constitutionality of the regulations that purport to limit it." <i>MacDonald, Sommer </i>&amp; <i>Frates </i>v. <i>Yolo County, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/340/case.html">477 U. S. 340</a>, 351 (1986). See also <i>Agins </i>v. <i>City of Tiburon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 255</a>, 260 (1980). Because petitioner "has not yet obtained a final decision regarding how [he] will be allowed to develop [his] property," <i>Williamson County Regional Planning Comm\'n </i>v. <i>Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 </i>U. S. 172, 190 (1985), the Council argues that he is not yet entitled to definitive adjudication of his takings claim in this Court.</p><p>We think these considerations would preclude review had the South Carolina Supreme Court rested its judgment on ripeness grounds, as it was (essentially) invited to do by the Council. See Brief for Respondent 9, n. 3. The South Carolina Supreme Court shrugged off the possibility of further administrative and trial proceedings, however, preferring to dispose of Lucas\'s takings claim on the merits. Cf., <i>e. g., San Diego Gas </i>&amp; <i>Electric Co. </i>v. <i>San Diego, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html">450 U. S. 621</a>, 631-632 (1981). This unusual disposition does not preclude Lucas from applying for a permit under the 1990 amendment for <i>future </i>construction, and challenging, on takings grounds, any denial. But it does preclude, both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas\'s <i>past </i>deprivation, i. <i>e., </i>for his having been denied construction rights during the period before the 1990 amendment. See generally <i>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale </i>v. <i>County of Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html">482 U.

Without even so much as commenting upon the consequences of the South Carolina Supreme Court\'s judgment in this respect, the Council insists that permitting Lucas to press his claim of a past deprivation on this appeal would be improper, since "the issues of whether and to what extent [Lucas] has incurred a temporary taking ... have simply never been addressed." Brief for Respondent 11. Yet Lucas had no reason to proceed on a "temporary taking" theory at trial, or even to seek remand for that purpose prior to submission of the case to the South Carolina Supreme Court, since as the Act then read, the taking was unconditional and permanent.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN finds it "baffling," <i>post, </i>at 1043, n. 5, that we grant standing here, whereas "just a few days ago, in <i>Lujan </i>v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/case.html">504 U.

He sees in that strong evidence to support his repeated imputations that the Court "presses" to take this case, <i>post, </i>at 1036, is "eager to decide" it, <i>post, </i>at 1045, and is unwilling to "be denied," <i>post, </i>at 1042. He has a point: The decisions are indeed very close in time, yet one grants standing and the other denies it. The distinction, however, rests in law rather than chronology. <i>Lujan, </i>since it involved the establishment of injury in fact at the <i>summary judgment stage, </i>required specific facts to be adduced by sworn testimony; had the same challenge to a generalized allegation of injury in fact been made at the pleading stage, it would have been unsuccessful.</p><p>4 In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached the merits of a takings challenge to the 1988 Beachfront Management Act identical to the one Lucas brings here even though the Act was amended, and the special permit procedure established, while the case was under submission. The court observed:</p><p>"The enactment of the 1990 Act during the pendency of this appeal, with its provisions for special permits and other changes that may affect the plaintiffs, does not relieve us of the need to address the plaintiffs\' claims under the provisions of the 1988 Act.

S. 393</a> (1922), it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a "direct appropriation" of property, <i>Legal Tender Cases, </i>12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a "practical ouster of [the owner\'s] possession," <i>Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/635/case.html">99 U. S. 635</a>, 642 (1879). See also <i>Gibson </i>v. <i>United States, 166 </i>U. S. 269, 275-276 (1897). Justice Holmes recognized in <i>Mahon, </i>however, that if the protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the government\'s power to redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U. S., at 414-415. If, instead, the uses of private property were subject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, "the natural tendency of human nature [would be] to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappear[ed]." <i>Id., </i>at 415. These considerations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, "while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>5JU8TICE BLACKMUN states that our "intense interest in Lucas\' plight ... would have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgment below and remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments" to the Beachfront Management Act. <i>Post, </i>at 1045, n. 7. That is a strange suggestion, given that the South Carolina Supreme Court rendered its categorical disposition in this case <i>after </i>the Act had been amended, and <i>after </i>it had been invited to consider the effect of those amendments on Lucas\'s case. We have no reason to believe that the justices of the South Carolina Supreme Court are any more desirous of using a narrower ground now than they were then; and neither "prudence" nor any other principle of judicial restraint requires that we remand to find out whether they have changed their mind.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1015">1015</a></p><p>Nevertheless, our decision in <i>Mahon </i>offered little insight into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as going "too far" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding "regulatory takings" jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any " \'set formula\' " for determining how far is too far, preferring to "engag[e] in ... essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries." <i>Penn Central Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>New York City, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U.

See Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resurrection, 1987 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 4. We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical "invasion" of his property. In general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation. For example, in <i>Loretto </i>v. <i>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html">458 U. S. 419</a> (1982), we determined that New York\'s law requiring landlords to allow television cable companies to emplace cable facilities in their apartment buildings constituted a taking, <i>id., </i>at 435-440, even though the facilities occupied at most only 11/2 cubic feet of the landlords\' property, see <i>id., </i>at 438, n. 16. See also <i>United States </i>v. <i>Causby, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/256/case.html">328 U. S. 256</a>, 265, and n. 10 (1946) (physical invasions of airspace); cf. <i>Kaiser Aetna </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html">444 U. S. 164</a> (1979) (imposition of navigational servitude upon private marina).</p><p>The second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. See <i>Agins, </i>447 U. S., at 260; see also <i>Nollan </i>v. <i>California Coastal Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/case.html">483 U.

S. 264, 295-296 (1981).6 As we have said on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use regulation "does not substantially advance legitimate state interests <i>or denies an owner economically viable use of his land." Agins, supra, </i>at 260 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).7</p><p>6We will not attempt to respond to all of JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'S mistaken citation of case precedent. Characteristic of its nature is his assertion that the cases we discuss here stand merely for the proposition "that proof that a regulation does <i>not </i>deny an owner economic use of his property is sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge" and not for the point that <i>"denial </i>of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration." <i>Post, </i>at 1050, n. 11. The cases say, repeatedly and unmistakably, that" \'[t]he test to be applied in considering [a] facial [takings] challenge is fairly straightforward. A statute regulating the uses that can be made of property <i>effects a taking if it "denies an owner economically viable use of his land."\'" Keystone, </i>480 U. S., at 495 (quoting <i>Hodel, </i>452 U. S., at 295-296 (quoting <i>Agins, </i>447 U. S., at 260)) (emphasis added).</p><p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN describes that rule (which we do not invent but merely apply today) as "alter[ing] the long-settled rules of review" by foisting on the State "the burden of showing [its] regulation is not a taking." <i>Post, </i>at 1045, 1046. This is of course wrong. Lucas had to do more than simply file a lawsuit to establish his constitutional entitlement; he had to show that the Beachfront Management Act denied him economically beneficial use of his land. Our analysis presumes the unconstitutionality of state land-use regulation only in the sense that <i>any </i>rule with exceptions presumes the invalidity of a law that violates it-for example, the rule generally prohibiting content-based restrictions on speech. See, <i>e. g., Simon </i>&amp; <i>Schuster, Inc. </i>v. <i>Members of N. </i>Y. <i>State Crime Victims Ed., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/105/case.html">502 U. S. 105</a>, 115 (1991) ("A statute is presumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech"). JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'S real quarrel is with the substantive standard of liability we apply in this case, a longestablished standard we see no need to repudiate.</p><p>7 Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our "deprivation of all economically feasible use" rule is greater than its precision, since the rule does not make clear the "property interest" against which the loss of value is to be measured. When, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave 90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1017">1017</a></p><p>We have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner\'s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. See <i>San Diego Gas </i>&amp; <i>Electric Co. </i>v. <i>San Diego, </i>450 U. S., at 652 (dissenting opinion). "[F]or what is the land but the profits thereof[?]" 1 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 1, \xc2\xa7 1 (1st Am. ed. 1812). Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance when <i>no </i>productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply "adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life," <i>Penn Central Transportation Co., 438</i></p><p>analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all economically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one in which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tract as a whole. (For an extreme-and, we think, unsupportable-view of the relevant calculus, see <i>Penn Central Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>New York City, </i>42 N. Y. 2d 324, 333-334, 366 N. E. 2d 1271, 1276-1277 (1977), aff\'d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U. S. 104</a> (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel\'s value produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total value of the takings claimant\'s other holdings in the vicinity.) Unsurprisingly, this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator in our "deprivation" fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the Court. Compare <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Mahon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/393/case.html">260 U. S. 393</a>, 414 (1922) (law restricting subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with <i>Key</i>stone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. <i>DeBenedictis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/470/case.html">480 U.

J., dissenting); Rose, <i>Mahon </i>Reconstructed: Why the Takings Issue is Still a Muddle, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 561,566-569 (1984). The answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner\'s reasonable expectations have been shaped by the State\'s law of property-i. <i>e., </i>whether and to what degree the State\'s law has accorded legal recognition and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In any event, we avoid this difficulty in the present case, since the "interest in land" that Lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with a rich tradition of protection at common law, and since the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act left each of Lucas\'s beachfront lots without economic value.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1018">1018</a></p><p>u.

And the <i>functional </i>basis for permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property values without compensation-that "Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law," <i>id., </i>at 413-does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.</p><p>On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use-typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state-carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm. See, <i>e. g., Annicelli </i>v. <i>South Kingstown, </i>463 A. 2d 133, 140-141 (R. 1. 1983) (prohibition on construction adjacent to beach justified on twin grounds of safety and "conservation of open space"); <i>Morris County Land Improvement Co. </i>v. <i>Parsippany-Troy Hills Township, </i>40 N. J. 539, 552-553, 193 A. 2d 232, 240 (1963) (prohibition on filling marshlands imposed in order to preserve region as water detention basin and create wildlife refuge). As Justice Brennan explained: "From the government\'s point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity production through a dam project that floods private property." <i>San Diego Gas </i>&amp; <i>Elec.

See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>16 U. S.

This analysis errs in its assumption that the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation. Such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, "[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and ... the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations" are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. <i>Penn</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1020">1020</a></p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The trial court found Lucas\'s two beachfront lots to have been rendered valueless by respondent\'s enforcement of the coastal-zone construction ban.9 Under Lucas\'s theory of the case, which rested upon our "no economically viable use" statements, that finding entitled him to compensation. Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either the purposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or the means chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, thought otherwise. In its view, the Beachfront Management Act was no ordinary enactment, but involved an exercise of South Carolina\'s "police powers" to mitigate the harm to the public interest that petitioner\'s use of his</p><p><i>Central Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>New York City, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U.

But that occasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between the landowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in full) and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former value by the highway (who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these "allor-nothing" situations.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS similarly misinterprets our focus on "developmental" uses of property (the uses proscribed by the Beachfront Management Act) as betraying an "assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under the Constitution are <i>developmental </i>uses." <i>Post, </i>at 1065, n. 3. We make no such assumption. Though our prior takings cases evince an abiding concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land, there are plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impairment will invite exceedingly close scrutiny under the Takings Clause.

It is quite possible, for example, to describe in <i>either </i>fashion the ecological, economic, and esthetic concerns that inspired the South Carolina Legislature in the present case. One could say that imposing a servitude on Lucas\'s land is necessary in order to prevent his use of it from "harming" South Carolina\'s ecological resources; or, instead, in order to achieve the "benefits" of an ecological preserveY Compare, <i>e. g., Claridge </i>v. <i>New Hampshire</i></p><p>11 In the present case, in fact, some of the "[South Carolina] legislature\'s \'findings\' " to which the South Carolina Supreme Court purported to defer in characterizing the purpose of the Act as "harm-preventing," 304 S. C. 376, 385, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 900 (1991), seem to us phrased in "benefitconferring" language instead. For example, they describe the importance of a construction ban in enhancing "South Carolina\'s annual tourism industry revenue," S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-250(1)(b) (Supp. 1991), in "provid[ing] habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of which are threatened or endangered," \xc2\xa7 48-39-250(1)(c), and in "provid[ing] a natural healthy environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being," \xc2\xa7 48-39250(1)(d). It would be pointless to make the outcome of this case hang upon this terminology, since the same interests could readily be described in "harm-preventing" fashion.</p><p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, however, apparently insists that we <i>must </i>make the outcome hinge (exclusively) upon the South Carolina Legislature\'s other, "harm-preventing" characterizations, focusing on the declaration that "prohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary to protect people and property from storms, high tides, and beach erosion." <i>Post, </i>at 1040. He says "[n]othing in the record undermines [this] assessment," <i>ibid., </i>apparently seeing no significance in the fact that the statute permits owners of <i>existing </i>structures to remain (and even to rebuild</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1025">1025</a></p><p><i>Wetlands Board, </i>125 N.

Whether one or the other of the competing characterizations will come to one\'s lips in a particular case depends primarily upon one\'s evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7 822, Comment <i>g, </i>p. 112 (1979) ("Practically all human activities unless carried on in a wilderness interfere to some extent with others or involve some risk of interference"). A given restraint will be seen as mitigating "harm" to the adjacent parcels or securing a "benefit" for them, depending upon the observer\'s evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint favors. See Sax, Takings and the Police Power, 74 Yale L. J. 36, 49 (1964) ("[T]he problem [in this area] is not one of noxiousness or harm-creating activity at all; rather it is a problem of inconsistency between perfectly innocent and independently desirable uses"). Whether Lucas\'s construction of singlefamily residences on his parcels should be described as bringing "harm" to South Carolina\'s adjacent ecological resources thus depends principally upon whether the describer believes that the State\'s use interest in nurturing those resources is so important that <i>any </i>competing adjacent use must yield.12</p><p>if their structures are not "destroyed beyond repair," S.

C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-290(D)(1) (Supp. 1991).</p><p>12 In JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'S view, even with respect to regulations that deprive an owner of all developmental or economically beneficial land uses,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1026">1026</a></p><p>When it is understood that "prevention of harmful use" was merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) <i>any </i>regulatory diminution in value; and that the distinction between regulation that "prevents harmful use" and that which "confers benefits" is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis; it becomes self-evident that noxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory "takings"-which require compensation-from regulatory deprivations that do not require compensation. <i>A fortiori </i>the legislature\'s recitation of a noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. If it were, departure would virtually always be allowed. The South Carolina Supreme Court\'s approach would essentially nullify <i>Mahon\'s </i>affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. Our cases provide no support for this: None of them that employed the logic of "harmful use" prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allegation that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of the claimant\'s land.

It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; "[a]s long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power." <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Mahon, </i>260 U.

The Beachfront Management Act is general, in his view, because it "regulates the use of the coastline of the entire State." <i>Post, </i>at 1074. There may be some validity to the principle JUSTICE STEVENS proposes, but it does not properly apply to the present case. The equivalent of a law of general application that inhibits the practice of religion without being aimed at religion, see <i>Oregon </i>v. <i>Smith, supra, </i>is a law that destroys the value of land without being aimed at land. Perhaps such a law-the generally applicable criminal prohibition on the manufacturing of alcoholic beverages challenged in <i>Mugler </i>comes to mind-cannot constitute a compensable taking. See 123 U. S., at 655-656. But a regulation <i>specifically directed to land use </i>no more acquires immunity by plundering landowners generally than does a law specifically directed at religious practice acquire immunity by prohibiting all religions.

In the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow held subject to the "implied limitation" that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture.15</p><p>Where "permanent physical occupation" of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the government to decree it anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty the asserted "public interests" involved, <i>Loretto </i>v. <i>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </i>458 U.

That is largely true, but entirely irrelevant. The practices of the States <i>prior </i>to incorporation of the Takings and Just Compensation Clauses, see <i>Chicago, B. </i>&amp; <i>Q. </i><i>R. Co. </i>v. <i>Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/166/226/case.html">166 U.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN is correct that early constitutional theorists did not believe the Takings Clause embraced regulations of property at all, see <i>post, </i>at 1057-1058, and n. 23, but even he does not suggest (explicitly, at least) that we renounce the Court\'s contrary conclusion in <i>Mahon. </i>Since the text of the Clause can be read to encompass regulatory as well as physical deprivations (in contrast to the text originally proposed by Madison, see Speech Proposing Bill of Rights (June 8, 1789), in 12 J. Madison, The Papers of James Madison 201 <i>(C. </i>Hobson, R. Rutland, W. Rachal, &amp; J.

S., at 178-180 (imposition of navigational servitude on marina created and rendered navigable at private expense held to constitute a taking). We believe similar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations, i. <i>e., </i>regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial use of land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the State\'s law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must, in other words, do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts-by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State\'s law of private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public generally, or otherwise. 16</p><p>On this analysis, the owner of a lakebed, for example, would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied the requisite permit to engage in a landfilling operation that would have the effect of flooding others\' land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is directed to remove all improvements from its land upon discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Such regulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating the land\'s only economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible</p><p>16 The principal "otherwise" that we have in mind is litigation absolving the State (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of "real and personal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire" or to forestall other grave threats to the lives and property of others. <i>Bowditch </i>v. <i>Boston, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/16/case.html">101 U.

The use of these properties for what are now expressly prohibited purposes was <i>always </i>unlawful, and (subject to other constitutionallimitations) it was open to the State at any point to make the implication of those background principles of nuisance and property law explicit. See Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness, Comments on the Ethical Foundations of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 12391241 (1967). In light of our traditional resort to "existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law" to define the range of interests that qualify for protection as "property" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, <i>Board of Regents of State Colleges </i>v. <i>Roth, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html">408 U.

When, however, a regulation that declares "off-limits" all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background principles would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it.17</p><p>The "total taking" inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to public lands and resources, or adjacent private property,</p><p>17 Of course, the State may elect to rescind its regulation and thereby avoid having to pay compensation for a permanent deprivation.

We emphasize that to win its case South Carolina must do more than proffer the legislature\'s declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. </i>As we have said, a "State, by <i>ipse dixit, </i>may not transform private property into public property without compensation ....

See <i>Oklahoma City </i>v. <i>Tuttle, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/808/case.html">471 U. S. 808</a>, 816 (1985). Accepting the finding as entered, it follows that petitioner is entitled to invoke the line of cases discussing regulations that deprive real property of all economic value. See <i>Agins </i>v. <i>City of Tiburon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 255</a>, 260 (1980).</p><p>The finding of no value must be considered under the Takings Clause by reference to the owner\'s reasonable, investment-backed expectations. <i>Kaiser Aetna </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html">444 U. S. 164</a>, 175 (1979); <i>Penn Central Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>New York City, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U. S. 104</a>, 124 (1978); see also <i>W B. Worthen Co. </i>v. <i>Kavanaugh, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/56/case.html">295 U. S. 56</a> (1935). The Takings Clause, while conferring substantial protection on property owners, does not eliminate the police power of the State to enact limitations on the use of their property. <i>Mugler </i>v. <i>Kansas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/case.html">123 U. S. 623</a>, 669 (1887). The rights conferred by the Takings Clause and the police power of the State may coexist without conflict. Property is bought and sold, investments are made, subject to the State\'s power to regulate. Where a taking is alleged from regulations which deprive the property of all value, the test must be whether the deprivation is contrary to reasonable, investmentbacked expectations.</p><p>There is an inherent tendency towards circularity in this synthesis, of course; for if the owner\'s reasonable expectations are shaped by what courts allow as a proper exercise of governmental authority, property tends to become what courts say it is. Some circularity must be tolerated in these matters, however, as it is in other spheres. <i>E. g., Katz </i>v.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1035">1035</a></p><p><i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a> (1967) (Fourth Amendment protections defined by reasonable expectations of privacy). The definition, moreover, is not circular in its entirety. The expectations protected by the Constitution are based on objective rules and customs that can be understood as reasonable by all parties involved.</p><p>In my view, reasonable expectations must be understood in light of the whole of our legal tradition. The common law of nuisance is too narrow a confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent society. <i>Gold</i>blatt v. <i>Hempstead, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/590/case.html">369 U. S. 590</a>, 593 (1962). The State should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initiatives in response to changing conditions, and courts must consider all reasonable expectations whatever their source. The Takings Clause does not require a static body of state property law; it protects private expectations to ensure private investment. I agree with the Court that nuisance prevention accords with the most common expectations of property owners who face regulation, but I do not believe this can be the sole source of state authority to impose severe restrictions. Coastal property may present such unique concerns for a fragile land system that the State can go further in regulating its development and use than the common law of nuisance might otherwise permit.</p><p>The Supreme Court of South Carolina erred, in my view, by reciting the general purposes for which the state regulations were enacted without a determination that they were in accord with the owner\'s reasonable expectations and therefore sufficient to support a severe restriction on specific parcels of property. See 304 S. C. 376, 383, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 899 (1991). The promotion of tourism, for instance, ought not to suffice to deprive specific property of all value without a corresponding duty to compensate. Furthermore, the means, as well as the ends, of regulation must accord with the owner\'s reasonable expectations. Here, the State did not act until after the property had been zoned for individual</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1036">1036</a></p><p>lot development and most other parcels had been improved, throwing the whole burden of the regulation on the remaining lots. This too must be measured in the balance. See <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Mahon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/393/case.html">260 U. S. 393</a>, 416 (1922).</p><p>With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p><p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.</p><p>Today the Court launches a missile to kill a mouse.</p><p>The State of South Carolina prohibited petitioner Lucas from building a permanent structure on his property from 1988 to 1990. Relying on an unreviewed (and implausible) state trial court finding that this restriction left Lucas\' property valueless, this Court granted review to determine whether compensation must be paid in cases where the State prohibits all economic use of real estate. According to the Court, such an occasion never has arisen in any of our prior cases, and the Court imagines that it will arise "relatively rarely" or only in "extraordinary circumstances." Almost certainly it did not happen in this case.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Court presses on to decide the issue, and as it does, it ignores its jurisdictional limits, remakes its traditional rules of review, and creates simultaneously a new categorical rule and an exception (neither of which is rooted in our prior case law, common law, or common sense). I protest not only the Court\'s decision, but each step taken to reach it. More fundamentally, I question the Court\'s wisdom in issuing sweeping new rules to decide such a narrow case. Surely, as JUSTICE KENNEDY demonstrates, the Court could have reached the result it wanted without inflicting this damage upon our Takings Clause jurisprudence.</p><p>My fear is that the Court\'s new policies will spread beyond the narrow confines of the present case.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 1451 <i>et seq. </i>The Act was designed to provide States with money and incentives to carry out Congress\' goal of protecting the public from shoreline erosion and coastal hazards. In the 1980 amendments to the Act, Congress directed States to enhance their coastal programs by "[p]reventing or significantly reducing threats to life and the destruction of property by eliminating development and redevelopment in high-hazard areas." 1 16 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1456b(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. II).</p><p>South Carolina began implementing the congressional directive by enacting the South Carolina Coastal Zone Management Act of 1977. Under the 1977 Act, any construction activity in what was designated the "critical area" required a permit from the South Carolina Coastal Council (Council), and the construction of any habitable structure was prohibited. The 1977 critical area was relatively narrow.</p><p>This effort did not stop the loss of shoreline. In October 1986, the Council appointed a "Blue Ribbon Committee on Beachfront Management" to investigate beach erosion and</p><p>1 The country has come to recognize that uncontrolled beachfront development can cause serious damage to life and property. See Brief for Sierra Club et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>2-5. Hurricane Hugo\'s September 1989 attack upon South Carolina\'s coastline, for example, caused 29 deaths and approximately $6 billion in property damage, much of it the result of uncontrolled beachfront development. See Zalkin, Shifting Sands and Shifting Doctrines: The Supreme Court\'s Changing Takings Doctrine and South Carolina\'s Coastal Zone Statute, 79 Calif. L. Rev. 205, 212-213 (1991).

In March 1987, the Committee found that South Carolina\'s beaches were "critically eroding," and proposed land-use restrictions. Report of the South Carolina Blue Ribbon Committee on Beachfront Management i, 6-10 (Mar. 1987). In response, South Carolina enacted the Beachfront Management Act on July 1, 1988. S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-250 <i>et seq. </i>(Supp. 1990). The 1988 Act did not change the uses permitted within the designated critical areas. Rather, it enlarged those areas to encompass the distance from the mean high watermark to a setback line established on the basis of "the best scientific and historical data" available.2 S. C.

The decision rested on two premises that until today were unassailable-that the State has the power to prevent any use of property it finds to be harmful to its citizens, and that a state statute is entitled to a presumption of constitutionality.</p><p>The Beachfront Management Act includes a finding by the South Carolina General Assembly that the beach/dune system serves the purpose of "protect[ing] life and property by serving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy and contributes to shoreline stability in an economical and effective manner." S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-250(1)(a) (Supp. 1990). The General Assembly also found that "development unwisely has been sited too close to the [beach/dune] system. This type of development has jeopardized the stability of the beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangered adjacent property." \xc2\xa748-39-250(4); see also \xc2\xa748-39-250(6) (discussing the need to "afford the beach/dune system space to accrete and erode").</p><p>If the state legislature is correct that the prohibition on building in front of the setback line prevents serious harm, then, under this Court\'s prior cases, the Act is constitutional.

Nor did he contend that the threatened harm was not sufficiently serious to make building a house in a particular location a "harmful" use, that the legislature had not made sufficient findings, or that the legislature was motivated by anything other than a desire to minimize damage to coastal areas. Indeed, petitioner objected at trial that evidence as to the purposes of the setback requirement was irrelevant. Tr. 68. The South Carolina Supreme Court accordingly understood petitioner not to contest the State\'s position that "discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public harm," 304 S.

This Court has held consistently that a land-use challenge is not ripe for review until there is a final decision about what uses of the property will be permitted.

In the absence of "a final and authoritative determination of the type and intensity of development legally permitted on the subject property," <i>MacDonald, Sommer </i>&amp; <i>Frates </i>v. <i>Yolo County, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/340/case.html">477 U.

Because Lucas failed to pursue this administrative remedy, the Council never finally decided whether Lucas\' particular piece of property was correctly categorized as a critical area in which building would not be permitted.

State courts frequently have recognized that land has economic value where the only residual economic uses are recreation or camping. See, <i>e. g., Turnpike Realty Co. </i>v. <i>Dedham, </i>362 Mass. 221, 284 N. E. 2d 891 (1972); <i>Turner </i>v. <i>County of Del Norte, </i>24 Cal. App. 3d 311, 101 Cal.

When the government regulation prevents the owner from any economically valuable use of his property, the private interest is unquestionably substantial, but we have never before held that no public interest can outweigh it.

In <i>Hadacheck </i>v. <i>Sebastian, 239 </i>U.

Even if the Court\'s factual premise were correct, its understanding of the Court\'s cases is distorted. In none of the cases did the Court suggest that the right of a State to prohibit certain activities without paying compensation turned on the availability of some residual valuable use.12 Instead, the cases depended on whether the</p><p>if total value has been taken. The Court has indicated that proof that a regulation does <i>not </i>deny an owner economic use of his property is sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge. See <i>Hodel </i>v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining </i>&amp; <i>Reclamation Assn., Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html">452 U. S. 264</a>, 295-297 (1981). But the conclusion that a regulation is not on its face a taking because it allows the landowner some economic use of property is a far cry from the proposition that <i>denial </i>of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration. The Court never has accepted the latter proposition.</p><p>The Court relies today on dicta in <i>Agins, Hodel, Nollan </i>v. <i>California Coastal Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/case.html">483 U.

In the course of demonstrating that apple trees are more valuable than red cedar trees, the Court noted that red cedar has "occasional use and value as lumber." <i>Id., </i>at 279. But the Court did not discuss whether the timber owned by the petitioner in that case was commercially salable, and nothing in the opinion suggests that the State\'s right to require uncompensated felling of the trees depended on any such salvage value. To the contrary, it is clear from its unanimous opinion that the <i>Schoene </i>Court would have sustained a law requiring the burning of cedar trees if that had been necessary to protect apple trees in which there was a public interest: The Court</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1051">1051</a></p><p>government interest was sufficient to prohibit the activity, given the significant private cost.13</p><p>These cases rest on the principle that the State has full power to prohibit an owner\'s use of property if it is harmful to the public. "[S]ince no individual has a right to use his property so as to create a nuisance or otherwise harm others, the State has not \'taken\' anything when it asserts its power to enjoin the nuisance-like activity." <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal, </i>480 U. S., at 491, n. 20. It would make no sense under this theory to suggest that an owner has a constitutionally protected right to harm others, if only he makes the proper showing of economic loss.14 See <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Mahon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/393/case.html">260 U.

There is language in the earliest takings cases suggesting that the police power was considered to be the power simply to prevent harms. Subsequently, the Court expanded its understanding of what were government\'s legitimate interests. But it does not follow that the holding of those early cases-that harmful and noxious uses of property can be forbidden whatever the harm to the property owner and without the payment of compensation-was repudiated. To the contrary, as the Court consciously expanded the scope of the police power beyond preventing harm, it clarified that there was a core of public interests that overrode any private interest. See <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal, </i>480 U. S., at 491, n. 20.</p><p>14 "Indeed, it would be extraordinary to construe the Constitution to require a government to compensate private landowners because it denied them \'the right\' to use property which cannot be used without risking injury and death." <i>First Lutheran Church, </i>210 Cal.

Public nuisance was first a common-law creation, see Newark, The Boundaries of Nuisance, 65 L. Q. Rev. 480, 482 (1949) (attributing development of nuisance to 1535), but by the 1800\'s in both the United States and England, legislatures had the power to define what is a public nuisance, and particular uses often have been selectively targeted. See Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 999-1000 (1966); J. Stephen, A General View of the Criminal Law of England 105-107 (2d ed. 1890). The Court\'s references to "common-law" background principles, however, indicate that legislative determinations do not constitute "state nuisance and property law" for the Court.</p><p>16 Also, until today the fact that the regulation prohibited uses that were lawful at the time the owner purchased did not determine the constitutional question. The brewery, the brickyard, the cedar trees, and the gravel pit were all perfectly legitimate uses prior to the passage of the regulation. See <i>Mugler </i>v. <i>Kansas, </i>123 U.

Instead the Court has relied in the past, as the South Carolina court has done here, on legislative judgments of what constitutes a harmP</p><p>The Court rejects the notion that the State always can prohibit uses it deems a harm to the public without granting compensation because "the distinction between \'harmpreventing\' and \'benefit-conferring\' regulation is often in the eye of the beholder." <i>Ante, </i>at 1024. Since the characterization will depend "primarily upon one\'s evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate," <i>ante, </i>at 1025, the Court decides a legislative judgment of this kind no longer can provide the desired "objective, value-free basis" for upholding a regulation, <i>ante, </i>at 1026. The Court, however, fails to explain how its proposed common-law alternative escapes the same trap.</p><p>17The Court argues that finding no taking when the legislature prohibits a harmful use, such as the Court did in <i>Mugler </i>and the South Carolina Supreme Court did in the instant case, would nullify <i>Pennsylvania Coal. </i>See <i>ante, </i>at 1022-1023. Justice Holmes, the author of <i>Pennsylvania Coal, </i>joined <i>Miller </i>v. <i>Schoene, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/272/case.html">276 U. S. 272</a> (1928), six years later. In <i>Miller, </i>the Court adopted the exact approach of the South Carolina court:</p><p>It found the cedar trees harmful, and their destruction not a taking, whether or not they were a nuisance. Justice Holmes apparently believed that such an approach did not repudiate his earlier opinion. Moreover, this Court already has been over this ground five years ago, and at that point rejected the assertion that <i>Pennsylvania Coal </i>was inconsistent with <i>Mugler, Hadacheck, Miller, </i>or the others in the string of "noxious use" cases, recognizing instead that the nature of the State\'s action is critical in takings analysis. <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal, </i>480 U.

As the Court admits, whether the owner has been deprived of all economic value of his property will depend on how "property" is defined. The "composition of the denominator in our \'deprivation\' fraction," <i>ante, </i>at 1017, n. 7, is the dispositive inquiry. Yet there is no "objective" way to define what that denominator should be. "We have long understood that any land-use regulation can be characterized as the \'total\' deprivation of an aptly defined entitlement .... Alternatively, the same regulation can always be characterized as a mere \'partial\' withdrawal from full, unencumbered ownership of the landholding affected by the regulation .... " 18 Michelman, Takings, 1987, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1614 (1988).</p><p>The Court\'s decision in <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal </i>illustrates this principle perfectly. In <i>Keystone, </i>the Court determined that the "support estate" was "merely a part of the entire bundle of rights possessed by the owner." 480 U. S., at 501. Thus, the Court concluded that the support estate\'s destruction merely eliminated one segment of the total property. <i>Ibid. </i>The dissent, however, characterized the support estate as a distinct property interest that was wholly destroyed. <i>Id., </i>at 519. The Court could agree on no "value-free basis" to resolve this dispute.</p><p>Even more perplexing, however, is the Court\'s reliance on common-law principles of nuisance in its quest for a valuefree takings jurisprudence.

There is nothing magical in the reasoning of judges long dead. They determined a harm in the same way as state judges and legislatures do today. If judges in the 18th and 19th centuries can distinguish a harm from a benefit, why not judges in the 20th century, and if judges can, why not legislators? There simply is no reason to believe that new interpretations of the hoary common-law nuisance doctrine will be particularly "objective" or "value free." 19 Once one abandons the level of generality of <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, ante, </i>at 1031, one searches in vain, I think, for anything resembling a principle in the common law of nuisance.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>Finally, the Court justifies its new rule that the legislature may not deprive a property owner of the only economically valuable use of his land, even if the legislature finds it to be a harmful use, because such action is not part of the" \'long recognized\'" "understandings of our citizens." <i>Ante, </i>at 1027.

Rptr. 93 (1972).</p><p>In addition, state courts historically have been less likely to find that a government action constitutes a taking when the affected land is undeveloped. According to the South Carolina court, the power of the legislature to take unimproved land without providing compensation was sanctioned by "ancient rights and principles." <i>Lindsay </i>v. <i>Commissioners, </i>2 S. C. L. 38, 57 (1796). "Except for Massachusetts, no colony appears to have paid compensation when it built a state-owned road across unimproved land. Legislatures provided compensation only for enclosed or improved land." Treanor, 94 Yale L. J., at 695 (footnotes omitted). This rule was followed by some States into the 1800\'s. See Horwitz 63-65.</p><p>With similar result, the common agrarian conception of property limited owners to "natural" uses of their land prior to and during much of the 18th century. See <i>id., </i>at 32. Thus, for example, the owner could build nothing on his land that would alter the natural flow of water. See <i>id., </i>at 44; see also, <i>e. g., Merritt </i>v. <i>Parker, </i>1 Coxe 460, 463 (N. J. 1795). Some more recent state courts still follow this reasoning. See, <i>e. g., Just </i>v. <i>Marinette County, </i>56 Wis. 2d 7, 201 N. W. 2d 761, 768 (1972).</p><p>Nor does history indicate any common-law limit on the State\'s power to regulate harmful uses even to the point of destroying all economic value. Nothing in the discussions in Congress concerning the Takings Clause indicates that the Clause was limited by the common-law nuisance doctrine. Common-law courts themselves rejected such an understanding. They regularly recognized that it is "for the legislature to interpose, and by positive enactment to prohibit a use of property which would be injurious to the public."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1060">1060</a></p><p><i>Tewksbury, </i>11 Mete., at 57.25 Chief Justice Shaw explained in upholding a regulation prohibiting construction of wharves, the existence of a taking did not depend on "whether a certain erection in tide water is a nuisance at common law or not." <i>Alger, </i>7 Cush., at 104; see also <i>State </i>v. <i>Paul, </i>5 R. 1. 185, 193 (1858); <i>Commonwealth </i>v. <i>Parks, </i>155 Mass. 531, 532, 30 N.

("[T]he legislature may change the common law as to nuisances, and may move the line either way, so as to make things nuisances which were not so, or to make things lawful which were nuisances").</p><p>In short, I find no clear and accepted "historical compact" or "understanding of our citizens" justifying the Court\'s new takings doctrine. Instead, the Court seems to treat history as a grab bag of principles, to be adopted where they support the Court\'s theory, and ignored where they do not. If the Court decided that the early common law provides the background principles for interpreting the Takings Clause, then regulation, as opposed to physical confiscation, would not be compensable. If the Court decided that the law of a later period provides the background principles, then regulation might be compensable, but the Court would have to confront the fact that legislatures regularly determined which uses were prohibited, independent of the common law, and independent of whether the uses were lawful when the owner purchased. What makes the Court\'s analysis unworkable is its attempt to package the law of two incompatible eras and peddle it as historical fact.26</p><p>25 More recent state-court decisions agree.

Until he exhausts his right to apply for a special permit under that amendment, petitioner is not entitled to an adjudication by this Court of the merits of his permanent takings claim. <i>MacDonald, Sommer </i>&amp; <i>Frates </i>v. <i>Yolo County, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/340/case.html">477 U. S. 340</a>, 351 (1986).</p><p>It is also not clear that he has a viable "temporary takings" claim. If we assume that petitioner is now able to build on the lot, the only injury that he may have suffered is</p><p>whether or not the prohibition was a common-law nuisance, and whether or not the prohibition occurred subsequent to the purchase. See <i>supra, </i>at 1047-1048, 1052-1053, and n. 16. I cannot imagine where the Court finds its "historical compact," if not in history.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1062">1062</a></p><p>the delay caused by the temporary existence of the absolute statutory ban on construction. We cannot be sure, however, that that delay caused petitioner any harm because the record does not tell us whether his building plans were even temporarily frustrated by the enactment of the statute.1 Thus, on the present record it is entirely possible that petitioner has suffered no injury in fact even if the state statute was unconstitutional when he filed this lawsuit.</p><p>It is true, as the Court notes, that the argument against deciding the constitutional issue in this case rests on prudential considerations rather than a want of jurisdiction. I think it equally clear, however, that a Court less eager to decide the merits would follow the wise counsel of Justice Brandeis in his deservedly famous concurring opinion in <i>Ashwander </i>v. <i>TVA, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 341 (1936). As he explained, the Court has developed "for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision." <i>Id., </i>at 346. The second of those rules applies directly to this case.</p><blockquote><p>\n"2.

The test the Court announces is that the regulation must "do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved" under a State\'s nuisance law. <i>Ante, </i>at 1029. Under this test the categorical rule will apply unless the regulation merely makes explicit what was otherwise an implicit limitation on the owner\'s property rights.</p><p>In my opinion, the Court is doubly in error. The categorical rule the Court establishes is an unsound and unwise addition to the law and the Court\'s formulation of the exception to that rule is too rigid and too narrow.</p><p>The Categorical Rule</p><p>As the Court recognizes, <i>ante, </i>at 1015, <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Mahon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/393/case.html">260 U. S. 393</a> (1922), provides no support for its-or, indeed, any-categorical rule. To the contrary, Justice Holmes recognized that such absolute rules ill fit the inquiry into "regulatory takings." Thus, in the paragraph that contains his famous observation that a regulation may go "too far" and thereby constitute a taking, the Justice wrote: "As we already have said, this is a question of degree-and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions." <i>Id., </i>at 416. What he had "already ... said" made perfectly clear that Justice Holmes regarded economic injury to be merely one factor to be weighed: "One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminu-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1064">1064</a></p><p>tion [of value.] So the question depends upon the particular facts." <i>Id., </i>at 413.</p><p>Nor does the Court\'s new categorical rule find support in decisions following <i>Mahon. </i>Although in dicta we have sometimes recited that a law "effects a taking if [it] ... denies an owner economically viable use of his land," <i>Agins </i>v. <i>City of Tiburon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 255</a>, 260 (1980), our <i>rulings </i>have rejected such an absolute position. We have frequentlyand recently-held that, in some circumstances, a law that renders property valueless may nonetheless not constitute a taking. See, <i>e. g., First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale </i>v. <i>County of Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html">482 U. S. 304</a>, 313 (1987); <i>Goldblatt </i>v. <i>Hempstead, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/590/case.html">369 U.

In short, as we stated in <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. </i>v. <i>DeBenedictis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/470/case.html">480 U. S. 470</a>, 490 (1987), "\'Although a comparison of values before and after\' a regulatory action \'is relevant, ... it is by no means conclusive.\' "</p><p>In addition to lacking support in past decisions, the Court\'s new rule is wholly arbitrary. A landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing, while an owner whose property is diminished 100% recovers the land\'s full value. The case at hand illustrates this arbitrariness well. The Beachfront Management Act not only prohibited the building of new dwellings in certain areas, it also prohibited the rebuilding of houses that were "destroyed beyond repair by natural causes or by fire." 1988 S. C. Acts 634, \xc2\xa7 3; see also <i>Esposito </i>v. <i>South Carolina Coastal Council, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/939/165/">939 F.2d 165</a>, 167 (CA4 1991).2 Thus, if the homes adjacent to Lucas\'</p><p>2 This aspect of the Act was amended in 1990.

Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-290(B) (Supp. 1990).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1065">1065</a></p><p>lot were destroyed by a hurricane one day after the Act took effect, the owners would not be able to rebuild, nor would they be assured recovery. Under the Court\'s categorical approach, Lucas (who has lost the opportunity to build) recovers, while his neighbors (who have lost <i>both </i>the opportunity to build <i>and </i>their homes) do not recover. The arbitrariness of such a rule is palpable.</p><p>Moreover, because of the elastic nature of property rights, the Court\'s new rule will also prove unsound in practice. In response to the rule, courts may define "property" broadly and only rarely find regulations to effect total takings. This is the approach the Court itself adopts in its revisionist reading of venerable precedents. We are told that-notwithstanding the Court\'s findings to the contrary in each casethe brewery in <i>Mugler, </i>the brickyard in <i>Hadacheck, </i>and the gravel pit in <i>Goldblatt </i>all could be put to "other uses" and that, therefore, those cases did not involve total regulatory takings.3 <i>Ante, </i>at 1026, n. 13.</p><p>On the other hand, developers and investors may market specialized estates to take advantage of the Court\'s new rule. The smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatory change will effect a total taking. Thus, an investor may, for example, purchase the right to build a multifamily home on a specific lot, with the result that a zoning regulation that</p><p>3 Of course, the same could easily be said in this case: Lucas may put his land to "other uses" -fishing or camping, for example-or may sell his land to his neighbors as a buffer. In either event, his land is far from "valueless."</p><p>This highlights a fundamental weakness in the Court\'s analysis: its failure to explain why only the impairment of <i>"economically </i>beneficial or productive use," <i>ante, </i>at 1015 (emphasis added), of property is relevant in takings analysis. I should think that a regulation arbitrarily prohibiting an owner from continuing to use her property for bird watching or sunbathing might constitute a taking under some circumstances; and, conversely, that such uses are of value to the owner. Yet the Court offers no basis for its assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under the Constitution are <i>developmental </i>uses.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1066">1066</a></p><p>allows only single-family homes would render the investor\'s property interest "valueless."4 In short, the categorical rule will likely have one of two effects: Either courts will alter the definition of the "denominator" in the takings "fraction," rendering the Court\'s categorical rule meaningless, or investors will manipulate the relevant property interests, giving the Court\'s rule sweeping effect. To my mind, neither of these results is desirable or appropriate, and both are distortions of our takings jurisprudence.</p><p>Finally, the Court\'s justification for its new categorical rule is remarkably thin. The Court mentions in passing three arguments in support of its rule; none is convincing. First, the Court suggests that "total deprivation of feasible use is, from the landowner\'s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation." <i>Ante, </i>at 1017. This argument proves too much. From the "landowner\'s point of view," a regulation that diminishes a lot\'s value by 50% is as well "the equivalent" of the condemnation of half of the lot. Yet, it is well established that a 50% diminution in value does not by itself constitute a taking. See <i>Euclid </i>v. <i>Ambler Realty Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/365/case.html">272 U. S. 365</a>, 384 (1926) (75% diminution in value). Thus, the landowner\'s perception of the regulation cannot justify the Court\'s new rule.</p><p>Second, the Court emphasizes that because total takings are "relatively rare" its new rule will not adversely affect the government\'s ability to "go on." <i>Ante, </i>at 1018. This argument proves too little. Certainly it is true that defining a small class of regulations that are <i>per se </i>takings will not</p><p>4 This unfortunate possibility is created by the Court\'s subtle revision of the "total regulatory takings" dicta. In past decisions, we have stated that a regulation effects a taking if it "denies an owner economically viable use of his <i>land," Agins </i>v. <i>City of Tiburon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 255</a>, 260 (1980) (emphasis added), indicating that this "total takings" test did not apply to other estates. Today, however, the Court suggests that a regulation may effect a total taking of <i>any </i>real property interest. See <i>ante, </i>at 10161017, n. 7.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1067">1067</a></p><p>greatly hinder important governmental functions-but this is true of <i>any </i>small class of regulations. The Court\'s suggestion only begs the question of why regulations of <i>this </i>particular class should always be found to effect takings.</p><p>Finally, the Court suggests that "regulations that leave the owner ... without economically beneficial ... use ... carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service." <i>Ibid. </i>As discussed more fully below, see Part III, <i>infra, </i>I agree that the risks of such singling out are of central concern in takings law. However, such risks do not justify a <i>per se </i>rule for total regulatory takings. There is no necessary correlation between "singling out" and total takings: A regulation may single out a property owner without depriving him of all of his property, see, <i>e. g., Nollan </i>v. <i>California Coastal Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/case.html">483 U. S. 825</a>, 837 (1987); <i>J. </i><i>E. D. Associates, Inc. </i>v. <i>Atkinson, </i>121 N. H. 581, 432 A. 2d 12 (1981); and it may deprive him of all of his property without singling him out, see, <i>e. g., Mugler </i>v. <i>Kansas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/case.html">123 U. S. 623</a> (1887); <i>Hadacheck </i>v. <i>Sebastian, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/394/case.html">239 U. S. 394</a> (1915). What matters in such cases is not the degree of diminution of value, but rather the specificity of the expropriating act. For this reason, the Court\'s third justification for its new rule also fails.</p><p>In short, the Court\'s new rule is unsupported by prior decisions, arbitrary and unsound in practice, and theoretically unjustified. In my opinion, a categorical rule as important as the one established by the Court today should be supported by more history or more reason than has yet been provided.</p><p>The Nuisance Exception</p><p>Like many bright-line rules, the categorical rule established in this case is only "categorical" for a page or two in the U. S. Reports. No sooner does the Court state that "total regulatory takings must be compensated," <i>ante, </i>at 1026, than it quickly establishes an exception to that rule.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1068">1068</a></p><p>The exception provides that a regulation that renders property valueless is not a taking if it prohibits uses of property that were not "previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles." <i>Ante, </i>at 1029-1030. The Court thus rejects the basic holding in <i>Mugler </i>v. <i>Kan</i><i>sas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/case.html">123 U. S. 623</a> (1887). There we held that a statewide statute that prohibited the owner of a brewery from making alcoholic beverages did not effect a taking, even though the use of the property had been perfectly lawful and caused no public harm before the statute was enacted. We squarely rejected the rule the Court adopts today:</p><blockquote><p>\n"It is true, that, when the defendants ... erected their breweries, the laws of the State did not forbid the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. But the State did not thereby give any assurance, or come under an obligation, that its legislation upon that subject would remain unchanged. [T]he supervision of the public health and the public morals is a governmental power, \'continuing in its nature,\' and \'to be dealt with as the special exigencies of the moment may require;\' ... \'for this purpose, the largest legislative discretion is allowed, and the discretion cannot be parted with any more than the power itself.\'\'\' <i>Id., </i>at 669.</p></blockquote><p>Under our reasoning in <i>Mugler, </i>a State\'s decision to prohibit or to regulate certain uses of property is not a compensable taking just because the particular uses were previously lawful. Under the Court\'s opinion today, however, if a State should decide to prohibit the manufacture of asbestos, cigarettes, or concealable firearms, for example, it must be prepared to pay for the adverse economic consequences of its decision. One must wonder if government will be able to "go on" effectively if it must risk compensation "for every such change in the general law." <i>Mahon, </i>260 U. S., at 413.</p><p>The Court\'s holding today effectively freezes the State\'s common law, denying the legislature much of its traditional</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1069">1069</a></p><p>power to revise the law governing the rights and uses of property. Until today, I had thought that we had long abandoned this approach to constitutional law. More than a century ago we recognized that "the great office of statutes is to remedy defects in the common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances." <i>Munn </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/113/case.html">94 U. S. 113</a>, 134 (1877). As Justice Marshall observed about a position similar to that adopted by the Court today:</p><blockquote><p>\n"If accepted, that claim would represent a return to the era of <i>Lochner </i>v. <i>New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a> (1905), when common-law rights were also found immune from revision by State or Federal Government. Such an approach would freeze the common law as it has been constructed by the courts, perhaps at its 19th-century state of development. It would allow no room for change in response to changes in circumstance. The Due Process Clause does not require such a result." <i>PruneYard Shopping Center </i>v. <i>Robins, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/74/case.html">447 U. S. 74</a>, 93 (1980) (concurring opinion).</p></blockquote><p>Arresting the development of the common law is not only a departure from our prior decisions; it is also profoundly unwise. The human condition is one of constant learning and evolution-both moral and practical. Legislatures implement that new learning; in doing so they must often revise the definition of property and the rights of property owners. Thus, when the Nation came to understand that slavery was morally wrong and mandated the emancipation of all slaves, it, in effect, redefined "property." On a lesser scale, our ongoing self-education produces similar changes in the rights of property owners: New appreciation of the significance of endangered species, see, <i>e. g., Andrus </i>v. <i>Allard, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html">444 U. S. 51</a> (1979); the importance of wetlands, see, <i>e. g., </i>16 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3801 <i>et seq.; </i>and the vulnerability of coastal</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1070">1070</a></p><p>lands, see, <i>e. g., </i>16 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1451 <i>et seq., </i>shapes our evolving understandings of property rights.</p><p>Of course, some legislative redefinitions of property will effect a taking and must be compensated-but it certainly cannot be the case that every movement away from common law does so. There is no reason, and less sense, in such an absolute rule. We live in a world in which changes in the economy and the environment occur with increasing frequency and importance. If it was wise a century ago to allow government "\'the largest legislative discretion\'" to deal with" \'the special exigencies of the moment,\'" <i>Mugler, </i>123 U. S., at 669, it is imperative to do so today. The rule that should govern a decision in a case of this kind should focus on the future, not the past.5</p><p>The Court\'s categorical approach rule will, I fear, greatly hamper the efforts of local officials and planners who must deal with increasingly complex problems in land-use and environmental regulation. As this case-in which the claims of an <i>individual </i>property owner exceed $1 million-well demonstrates, these officials face both substantial uncertainty because of the ad hoc nature of takings law and unacceptable penalties if they guess incorrectly about that law.6</p><p>5 Even measured in terms of efficiency, the Court\'s rule is unsound. The Court today effectively establishes a form of insurance against certain changes in land-use regulations. Like other forms of insurance, the Court\'s rule creates a "moral hazard" and inefficiencies: In the face of uncertainty about changes in the law, developers will overinvest, safe in the knowledge that if the law changes adversely, they will be entitled to compensation. See generally Farber, Economic Analysis and Just Compensation, 12 Int\'l Rev. of Law &amp; Econ. 125 (1992).</p><p>6 As the Court correctly notes, in regulatory takings, unlike physical takings, courts have a choice of remedies. See <i>ante, </i>at 1030, n. 17. They may "invalidat[e the] excessive regulation" or they may "allo[w] the regulation to stand and orde[r] the government to afford compensation for the permanent taking." <i>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale </i>v. <i>County of Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html">482 U. S. 304</a>, 335 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); see also <i>id., </i>at 319-321. In either event, however, the costs to the government are likely to be substantial and are therefore likely to impede the development of sound land-use policy.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1071">1071</a></p><p>Viewed more broadly, the Court\'s new rule and exception conflict with the very character of our takings jurisprudence. We have frequently and consistently recognized that the definition of a taking cannot be reduced to a "set formula" and that determining whether a regulation is a taking is "essentially [an] ad hoc, factual inquir[y]." <i>Penn Central Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>New York City, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U. S. 104</a>, 124 (1978) (quoting <i>Goldblatt </i>v. <i>Hempstead, </i>369 U. S., at 594). This is unavoidable, for the determination whether a law effects a taking is ultimately a matter of "fairness and justice," <i>Armstrong </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/40/case.html">364 U. S. 40</a>, 49 (1960), and "necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests," <i>Agins, </i>447 U. S., at 261. The rigid rules fixed by the Court today clash with this enterprise: "fairness and justice" are often disserved by categorical rules.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>It is well established that a takings case "entails inquiry into [several factors:] the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations." <i>Prune Yard, </i>447 U. S., at 83. The Court\'s analysis today focuses on the last two of these three factors: The categorical rule addresses a regulation\'s "economic impact," while the nuisance exception recognizes that ownership brings with it only certain "expectations." Neglected by the Court today is the first and, in some ways, the most important factor in takings analysis: the character of the regulatory action.</p><p>The Just Compensation Clause "was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole." <i>Armstrong, </i>364 U. S., at 49. Accordingly, one of the central concerns of our takings jurisprudence is "prevent[ing] the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share of the burdens of government." <i>Monongahela Navigation Co. </i>v. <i>United</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1072">1072</a></p><p><i>States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/148/312/case.html">148 U. S. 312</a>, 325 (1893). We have, therefore, in our takings law frequently looked to the <i>generality </i>of a regulation of property.7</p><p>For example, in the case of so-called "developmental exactions," we have paid special attention to the risk that particular landowners might "b[e] singled out to bear the burden" of a broader problem not of his own making. <i>Nollan, 483 </i>U. S., at 835, n. 4; see also <i>Pennell </i>v. <i>San Jose, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/1/case.html">485 U. S. 1</a>, 23 (1988). Similarly, in distinguishing between the Kohler Act (at issue in <i>Mahon) </i>and the Subsidence Act (at issue in <i>Keystone), </i>we found significant that the regulatory function of the latter was substantially broader. Unlike the Kohler</p><p>7This principle of generality is well rooted in our broader understandings of the Constitution as designed in part to control the "mischiefs of faction." See The Federalist No. 10, p. 43 (G. Wills ed. 1982) (J. Madison).</p><p>An analogous concern arises in First Amendment law. There we have recognized that an individual\'s rights are not violated when his religious practices are prohibited under a neutral law of general applicability. For example, in <i>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. </i>v. <i>Smith, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html">494 U. S. 872</a>, 879-880 (1990), we observed:</p><p>"[Our] decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a \'valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\' <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lee, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/252/case.html">455 U. S. 252</a>, 263, n. 3 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) .... In <i>Prince </i>v. <i>Massachusetts, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/158/case.html">321 U. S. 158</a> (1944), we held that a mother could be prosecuted under the child labor laws for using her children to dispense literature in the streets, her religious motivation notwithstanding. We found no constitutional infirmity in \'excluding [these children] from doing there what no other children may do.\' <i>Id., </i>at 171. In <i>Braunfeld </i>v. <i>Brown, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/599/case.html">366 U. S. 599</a> (1961) (plurality opinion), we upheld Sunday-closing laws against the claim that they burdened the religious practices of persons whose religions compelled them to refrain from work on other days. In <i>Gillette </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/437/case.html">401 U. S. 437</a>,461 (1971), we sustained the military Selective Service System against the claim that it violated free exercise by conscripting persons who opposed a particular war on religious grounds."</p><p>If such a neutral law of general applicability may severely burden constitutionally protected interests in liberty, a comparable burden on property owners should not be considered unreasonably onerous.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1073">1073</a></p><p>Act, which simply transferred back to the surface owners certain rights that they had earlier sold to the coal companies, the Subsidence Act affected all surface owners-including the coal companies-equally. See <i>Keystone, </i>480 U. S., at 486. Perhaps the most familiar application of this principle of generality arises in zoning cases. A diminution in value caused by a zoning regulation is far less likely to constitute a taking if it is part of a general and comprehensive land-use plan, see <i>Euclid </i>v. <i>Amber Realty Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/365/case.html">272 U. S. 365</a> (1926); conversely, "spot zoning" is far more likely to constitute a taking, see <i>Penn Central, </i>438 U. S., at 132, and n. 28.</p><p>The presumption that a permanent physical occupation, no matter how slight, effects a taking is wholly consistent with this principle. A physical taking entails a certain amount of "singling out." 8 Consistent with this principle, physical occupations by third parties are more likely to effect takings than other physical occupations. Thus, a regulation requiring the installation of a junction box owned by a third party, <i>Loretto </i>v. <i>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html">458 U. S. 419</a> (1982), is more troubling than a regulation requiring the installation of sprinklers or smoke detectors; just as an order granting third parties access to a marina, <i>Kaiser Aetna </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html">444 U. S. 164</a> (1979), is more troubling than an order requiring the placement of safety buoys in the marina.</p><p>In analyzing takings claims, courts have long recognized the difference between a regulation that targets one or two parcels of land and a regulation that enforces a statewide policy. See, <i>e. g., A. A. Profiles, Inc. </i>v. <i>Ft. Lauderdale, 850 </i>F. 2d 1483, 1488 (CA111988); <i>Wheeler </i>v. <i>Pleasant Grove, 664 </i>F. 2d 99, 100 (CA5 1981); <i>Trustees Under Will of Pomeroy </i>v. <i>Westlake, </i>357 So. 2d 1299, 1304 (La.

The Act does not target particular landowners, but rather regulates the use of the coastline of the entire State. See S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 4839-10 (Supp. 1990). Indeed, South Carolina\'s Act is best understood as part of a national effort to protect the coastline, one initiated by the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. Pub. L. 92-583, 86 Stat. 1280, codified as amended at 16 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1451 <i>et seq. </i>Pursuant to the federal Act, every coastal State has implemented coastline regulations.9 Moreover, the Act did not single out owners of undeveloped land. The Act also prohibited owners of developed land from rebuilding if their structures were destroyed, see 1988 S. C. Acts 634, \xc2\xa7 3,10 and what is equally significant, from repairing erosion control devices, such as seawalls, see S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-39-290(B)(2) (Supp. 1990). In addition, in some situations, owners of developed land were required to "renouris[h] the beach ...  on a yearly basis with an amount ... of sand ... not ...  less than one and one-half times the yearly volume of sand lost due to erosion." 1988 S.

Yet, if anything, the costs to and expectations of the owners of developed land are even greater: I doubt, however, that the cost to owners of developed land of renourishing the beach and allowing their seawalls to deteriorate effects a taking. The costs imposed on the owners of undeveloped land, such as petitioner, differ from these costs only in degree, not in kind.</p><p>The impact of the ban on developmental uses must also be viewed in light of the purposes of the Act. The legislature stated the purposes of the Act as "protect[ing], preserv[ing], restor[ing] and enhanc[ing] the beach/dune system" of the State not only for recreational and ecological purposes, but also to "protec[t] life and property." S. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 4839-260(1)(a) (Supp. 1990). The State, with much science on its side, believes that the "beach/dune system [acts] as a buffer from high tides, storm surge, [and] hurricanes." <i>Ibid. </i>This is a traditional and important exercise of the State\'s police power, as demonstrated by Hurricane Hugo, which in 1989, caused 29 deaths and more than $6 billion in property damage in South Carolina alone.13</p><p>In view of all of these factors, even assuming that petitioner\'s property was rendered valueless, the risk inherent in investments of the sort made by petitioner, the generality of the Act, and the compelling purpose motivating the South</p><p>12 In this regard, the Act more closely resembles the Subsidence Act in <i>Keystone </i>than the Kohler Act in <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Mahon, 260 </i>U.

After briefing and argument it is abundantly clear that an unreviewable assumption on which this case comes to us is both questionable as a conclusion of Fifth Amendment law and sufficient to frustrate the Court\'s ability to render certain the legal premises on which its holding rests.</p><p>The petition for review was granted on the assumption that the State by regulation had deprived the owner of his entire economic interest in the subject property. Such was the state trial court\'s conclusion, which the State Supreme Court did not review. It is apparent now that in light of our prior cases, see, <i>e. g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. </i>v. <i>DeBenedictis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/470/case.html">480 U. S. 470</a>, 493-502 (1987); <i>Andrus </i>v. <i>Allard, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html">444 U.

S. 104</a>, 130-131 (1978), the trial court\'s conclusion is highly questionable. While the respondent now wishes to contest the point, see Brief for Respondent 45-50, the Court is certainly right to refuse to take up the issue, which is not fairly included within the question presented, and has received only the most superficial and one-sided treatment before us.</p><p>Because the questionable conclusion of total deprivation cannot be reviewed, the Court is precluded from attempting to clarify the concept of total (and, in the Court\'s view, categorically compensable) taking on which it rests, a concept which the Court describes, see <i>ante, </i>at 1016-1017, n. 6, as so uncertain under existing law as to have fostered inconsistent pronouncements by the Court itself. Because that concept is left uncertain, so is the significance of the exceptions to the compensation requirement that the Court proceeds to recog-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1077">1077</a></p><p>nize. This alone is enough to show that there is little utility in attempting to deal with this case on the merits.</p><p>The imprudence of proceeding to the merits in spite of these unpromising circumstances is underscored by the fact that, in doing so, the Court cannot help but assume something about the scope of the uncertain concept of total deprivation, even when it is barred from explicating total deprivation directly. Thus, when the Court concludes that the application of nuisance law provides an exception to the general rule that complete denial of economically beneficial use of property amounts to a compensable taking, the Court will be understood to suggest (if it does not assume) that there are in fact circumstances in which state-law nuisance abatement may amount to a denial of all beneficial land use as that concept is to be employed in our takings jurisprudence under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The nature of nuisance law, however, indicates that application of a regulation defensible on grounds of nuisance prevention or abatement will quite probably not amount to a complete deprivation in fact. The nuisance enquiry focuses on conduct, not on the character of the property on which that conduct is performed, see 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7 821B (1979) (public nuisance); <i>id., </i>\xc2\xa7 822 (private nuisance), and the remedies for such conduct usually leave the property owner with other reasonable uses of his property, see W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 90 (5th ed. 1984) (public nuisances usually remedied by criminal prosecution or abatement), <i>id., </i>\xc2\xa7 89 (private nuisances usually remedied by damages, injunction, or abatement); see also, <i>e. g., Mugler </i>v. <i>Kansas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/case.html">123 U. S. 623</a>, 668669 (1887) (prohibition on use of property to manufacture intoxicating beverages "does not disturb the owner in the control or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by the State that its use ... for certain forbidden purposes, is prejudicial to the public interests"); <i>Hadacheck </i>v. <i>Sebastian,</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1078">1078</a></p><p><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/394/case.html">239 U. S. 394</a>, 412 (1915) (prohibition on operation of brickyard did not prohibit extraction of clay from which bricks were produced). Indeed, it is difficult to imagine property that can be used only to create a nuisance, such that its sole economic value must presuppose the right to occupy it for such seriously noxious activity.</p><p>The upshot is that the issue of what constitutes a total deprivation is being addressed by indirection, and with uncertain results, in the Court\'s treatment of defenses to compensation claims. While the issue of what constitutes total deprivation deserves the Court\'s attention, as does the relationship between nuisance abatement and such total deprivation, the Court should confront these matters directly. Because it can neither do so in this case, nor skip over those preliminary issues and deal independently with defenses to the Court\'s categorical compensation rule, the Court should dismiss the instant writ and await an opportunity to face the total deprivation question squarely. Under these circumstances, I believe it proper for me to vote to dismiss the writ, despite the Court\'s contrary preference.
