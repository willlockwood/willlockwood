JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The petitioner was convicted in a New York trial court in 1966 on three counts of conspiracy to extort, attempted extortion, and coercion.  The case for the prosecution rested principally on the content of two telephone conversations between the petitioner and one of his coconspirators.  Tapes and transcripts of those conversations were introduced at the trial over the petitioner\'s objection that they had been obtained by an unlawful </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 394 U. S. 281</a></p><p> wiretap.  The conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and by the New York Court of Appeals. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We granted certiorari. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The telephone calls in question were made in 1964 by the petitioner from outside New York City to a coconspirator at a bar in Manhattan.  The conversations were recorded by means of a device attached to wires of the central terminal box in the basement of the building in which the bar was located.  This wiretapping was conducted pursuant to a warrant issued under N.Y.Code Crim.Proc. \xc2\xa7 813-a, the statute with which this Court subsequently dealt in <em>Berger v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/41/case.html">388 U. S. 41</a></span>, in reversing a conviction under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>The petitioner contends that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments as construed in <em>Berger,</em> as well as \xc2\xa7 60 of the Federal Communications Act, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] prohibited the introduction of the intercepted conversations and therefore require reversal of his conviction.  For the reasons stated below, we reject these contentions and affirm the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 394 U. S. 282</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Not until last Term in <em>Katz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a></span>, did this Court overrule its prior decisions that the Fourth Amendment encompassed seizures of speech only if the law enforcement officers committed a trespass or at least physically invaded a constitutionally protected area of the speaker. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Olmstead v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html">277 U. S. 438</a></span>, explicitly held that wiretapping conducted without such an intrusion was not an unlawful search or seizure.  That rule was not modified by <em>Berger v. New York.</em>  The Court\'s discussion of <em>Olmstead in Berger,</em> while recognizing that other cases had negated the statements in <em>Olmstead</em> that conversations are never protected by the Fourth Amendment, cast no doubt upon "[t]he basis of the [<em>Olmstead</em>] decision" -- "that the Constitution did not forbid the obtaining of evidence by wiretapping unless it involved actual unlawful entry into the house." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Furthermore, the Court in <em>Berger</em> found the overbreadth of N.Y.Code Crim.Proc. \xc2\xa7 81a repugnant to the Fourth Amendment only to the limited extent that it permitted a "trespassory intrusion into a constitutionally protected area." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Olmstead,</em> then, stated the controlling interpretation of the Fourth Amendment with respect to wiretapping until it was overruled by <em>Katz.</em>  And in <em>Desist v. United States, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html">394 U. S. 244</a></span>, we have held today that <em>Katz</em> is to be applied wholly prospectively.  Since the wiretapping in this case occurred before <em>Katz</em> was decided and was accomplished without any intrusion into a constitutionally protected area of the petitioner, its fruits were not inadmissible under the exclusionary rule of the Fourth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 394 U. S. 283</a></p><p> and Fourteenth Amendments.  <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Nor did \xc2\xa7 605 of the Federal Communications Act require exclusion of the intercepted conversations.  Until our decision last Term in <em>Lee v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/378/case.html">392 U. S. 378</a></span>, state trial courts were free to accept evidence violative of \xc2\xa7 605. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Lee extended the <em>Nardone</em> [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] exclusionary rule of \xc2\xa7 605 to the States, but that decision has also been held to apply only prospectively.  <em>Fuller v.

JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.</p>\n<p>It is conceded that petitioner\'s conviction rested largely upon evidence acquired by nontrespassory wiretapping conducted pursuant to a warrant issued under N.Y.Code Crim.Proc. \xc2\xa7 13-a.  The Court affirms the conviction on the ground that today\'s decision in <em>Desist v. United States, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html">394 U. S. 244</a></span>, necessarily dictates that evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 394 U. S. 284</a></p><p> obtained by an illegal, nontrespassory wiretap will be inadmissible only if the tapping occurred after the date of the decision in <em>Katz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a></span> (1967).  The wiretapping in this case took place prior to <em>Katz.</em>  However, the case is here on direct review, and for the reasons stated in Part I of my dissenting opinion in <em>Desist, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#258">394 U. S. 258</a></span>-259, I would hold that petitioner is entitled to benefit from the <em>Katz</em> rule.</p>\n<p>It is therefore necessary for me to consider whether petitioner\'s federal constitutional rights were violated by the wiretapping.  Were I free to do so, I would decide this issue by inquiring whether, on the facts of this particular case and in light of New York decisions construing \xc2\xa7 813-a, the wiretapping was valid under the Warrants Clause of the Fourth Amendment.  <em>See Ker v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/23/case.html">374 U. S. 23</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/321/case.html#334">374 U. S. 334</a></span> (1963); <em>see also Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961).  However, I believe that this approach is foreclosed by this Court\'s decision in <em>Berger v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/41/case.html">388 U. S. 41</a></span> (1967).  In <em>Berger,</em> the Court held that a "bugging" pursuant to a \xc2\xa7 813-a warrant violated the petitioner\'s Fourth Amendment rights because, on its face, the statute did not contain constitutionally required safeguards.  It is true that the "bugging" in <em>Berger</em> involved a trespass and that the Court did not reach the question whether <em>Olmstead</em> should be overruled.  But the holding that \xc2\xa7 813-a was to be considered on its face, rather than as applied, depended in no way upon the fact of physical intrusion.  The warrant procedure prescribed in \xc2\xa7 813-a applies equally to "bugging" and to wiretapping.  Hence, the Court\'s "on its face" approach would seem necessarily to embrace \xc2\xa7 813-a wiretapping.</p>\n<p>I dissented from the "on its face" approach adopted in <em>Berger.</em> <em>See</em> 388 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/41/case.html#89">388 U. S. 89</a></span> <em>et seq.</em>  I continue to disagree with that approach.  Yet I think that <em>Berger</em> must be taken as having decided that a warrant issued </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 394 U. S. 285</a></p><p> pursuant to the version of \xc2\xa7 81a then in effect could not possibly satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/280/case.html">*</a></span>  Since I regard myself as bound by <em>Berger,</em> I am reluctantly compelled to conclude that the wiretap evidence introduced against petitioner was seized in violation of the Constitution, and that his conviction consequently cannot stand.</p>\n<p>* There were no amendments to \xc2\xa7 813-a between June, 1962, the date of the "bugging" in <em>Berger,</em> and July, 1964, the date of the wiretapping in this case.  Nor, in my view, is it necessary to decide whether <em>Berger</em> should be "retroactive."  The present case was on direct appeal in the New York courts at the time <em>Berger</em> was decided, and petitioner is therefore entitled to invoke <em>Berger</em> under the rule advanced in Part I of my dissenting opinion in <em>Desist.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
