Orito, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/139/case.html#147">413 U.S. 139, 147</a>, in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, which is similar in scope to 1461, I expressed the view that \'[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government\'s power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.\' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a> (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html#494">413 U.S. 483, 494</a> (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). </p><p> Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Miller v.

Slaton, 413; U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari in this case and summarily reverse. </p><p> Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html">418 U.S. 87</a> (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioners must be given an opportunity to have <font color="#005500" size="-1"><a name="913">[419 U.S. 911 , 913]</a> <br/><br/><br/>\n</font></p></span></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n</font></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1951071">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> SULAIMAN v.
