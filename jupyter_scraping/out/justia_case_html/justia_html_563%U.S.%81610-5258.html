In sentencing petitioner McNeill for violating \xc2\xa7922(g), the District Court determined that he qualified for ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement based in part on six prior North Carolina drug trafficking convictions.  When McNeill committed those crimes, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, which McNeill in fact received.  However, because the State later reduced the maximum sentence for those offenses to fewer than 10 years, McNeill argued that none of his six prior convictions were for \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offenses\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  The District Court rejected McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s request that it look to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied at the time he committed his state offenses.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0A federal sentencing court must determine whether \xe2\x80\x9can offense under State law\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d by consulting the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d applicable to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior state drug offense at the time of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for that offense.  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(ii).

The only way to answer this backward-looking question is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the present tense in defining a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d as, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9can offense \xe2\x80\xa6 for which a maximum [10-year] term \xe2\x80\xa6 is prescribed by law\xe2\x80\x9d does not suggest otherwise.

Although Congress used the present tense in defining \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B), this Court has repeatedly turned to the version of state law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating in determining whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  The question in this case concerns how a federal court should determine the maximum sentence for a prior state drug offense for ACCA purposes.  We hold that the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d for a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior state drug offense is the maximum sentence applicable to his offense when he was convicted of it.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After an extended chase, police officers in Fayetteville, North Carolina apprehended petitioner Clifton Terelle McNeill.  McNeill was caught with 3.1 grams of crack cocaine packaged for distribution and a .38-caliber revolver.  In August 2008, he pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At sentencing, the District Court determined that McNeill qualified for ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement.  Under ACCA, a person who violates 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g) and \xe2\x80\x9chas three previous convictions \xe2\x80\xa6 for a violent felony or a serious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to a 15-year minimum prison sentence.  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  McNeill conceded that two of his prior convictions\xe2\x80\x94assault with a deadly weapon and robbery\xe2\x80\x94were for \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felonies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McNeill argued, however, that none of his six state drug trafficking convictions were for \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offenses\xe2\x80\x9d be-cause those crimes no longer carried a \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term\nof imprisonment of ten years or more.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  When McNeill committed those crimes between 1991 and 1994, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, and McNeill in fact received 10-year sentences.  See N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x931.1(a)(8), 90\xe2\x80\x9395(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993) (sale of cocaine and possession with intent to sell cocaine).  But as of October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the maximum sentence for selling cocaine to 38 months and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell to 30 months.  See N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa715A\xe2\x80\x931340.17(c) and (d), 90\xe2\x80\x9395(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Lexis 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court rejected McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s request that it\nlook to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied to McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s drug offenses at the time he committed them.

Finding that McNeill therefore had three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, the court applied ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement.  The court then departed upward from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range and sentenced McNeill to 300 months in prison in light of his \xe2\x80\x9clong and unrelenting history of serious criminal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnear certain likelihood of recidivism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 119, 121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  Although the court consulted the maximum sentence under <em>current</em> state law, it reached the same conclusion as the District Court because North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s revised sentencing scheme does not apply to crimes committed before October 1, 1994.  598 F.\xc2\xa03d 161, 165 (2010) (agreeing with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hinojosa</em>, 349 F.\xc2\xa03d 200 (CA5 2003), and disagreeing with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Darden</em>, 539 F.\xc2\xa03d 116 (CA2 2008)).  Thus, even if McNeill were convicted today for his 1991, 1992, and September 1994 drug offenses, he would still be subject to the old 10-year statutory maximum.  598 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 165 (citing N.\xc2\xa0C.

S. 337</a>, 341 (1997).  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement applies to individuals who have \xe2\x80\x9cthree previous convictions \xe2\x80\xa6 for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  As relevant here, the statute defines a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance \xe2\x80\xa6 , for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing court to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s previous drug offense at the time of his conviction for that offense.  The statute requires the court to determine whether a \xe2\x80\x9cprevious conviction\xe2\x80\x9d was for a serious drug offense.  The only way to answer this backward-looking question is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.  We did precisely that in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rodriquez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/377/index.html">553 U. S. 377</a> (2008), where we addressed whether the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d in-cludes recidivism enhancements.  In assessing the \xe2\x80\x9cmax-imum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d for Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s state drug offenses, we consulted the version of state law \xe2\x80\x9cthat\n[he] was convicted of violating,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, the 1994 statutes and penalties that applied to his offenses at the time of his state convictions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 380\xe2\x80\x93381.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Use of the present tense in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d does not suggest otherwise.  McNeill argues that the present-tense verb in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cis prescribed by law\xe2\x80\x9d requires federal courts to determine the maximum sentence for a potential predicate offense by looking to the state law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing, as if the state offense were committed on the day of federal sentencing.  That argument overlooks the fact that ACCA is concerned with convictions that have already occurred.  Whether the prior conviction was for an offense \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance\xe2\x80\x9d can only be answered by reference to the law under which the defendant was convicted.  Likewise, the maximum sentence that \xe2\x80\x9cis prescribed by law\xe2\x80\x9d for that offense must also be determined according to the law applicable at that time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation contorts the plain meaning of the statute.  Although North Carolina courts actually sentenced him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses, McNeill now contends that the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d for those offenses is 30 or 38 months.  We find it \xe2\x80\x9chard to accept the proposition that a defendant may lawfully [have] be[en] sentenced to a term of imprisonment that exceeds the \xe2\x80\x98maximum term of imprisonment \xe2\x80\xa6 prescribed by law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 383.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cbroader context of the statute as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d specifically the adjacent definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d confirms this interpretation.  <em>Robinson, supra,</em> at 341.  ACCA defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d in part as a crime that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>has</em> as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c<em>is</em> burglary, arson, or extortion, <em>involves</em> the use of explosives, or otherwise <em>involves</em> conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of present tense in that definition, when determining whether a defendant was convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d we have turned to the version of state law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating.  In <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a> (1990), the Court held that whether Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s 1963 and 1971 convictions were for a crime that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cis</em> burglary\xe2\x80\x9d depended on the \xe2\x80\x9cformer Missouri statutes defining second-degree burglary\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwere the bases for Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 602; see <em>id.</em>, at 578, n.\xc2\xa01 (noting a subsequent change in state law, but relying on the burglary statutes in force \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n those years\xe2\x80\x9d in which Taylor was convicted).  Similarly, in <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a> (2007), this Court looked to the versions of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s burglary and criminal attempt statutes that were in effect \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of James\xe2\x80\x99 [1993 state] conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 197; see <em>ibid.</em> (quoting the 1993 versions of the Florida statutes).  The present-tense verbs in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d did not persuade us to look anywhere other than the law under which the defendants were actually convicted to determine the elements of their offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having repeatedly looked to the historical statute of conviction in the context of violent felonies, we see no reason to interpret \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offenses\xe2\x80\x9d in the adjacent section of the same statute any differently.  In both definitions, Congress used the present tense to refer to past convictions.  Cf. <em>Nijhawan</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language \xe2\x80\xa6 in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previous offense.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/329/index.html">503 U. S. 329</a>, 334 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]bsurd results are to be avoided\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, McNeill concedes that under his approach, a prior conviction could \xe2\x80\x9cdisappear\xe2\x80\x9d entirely for ACCA purposes if a State reformulated the offense between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction and federal sentencing.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The Sixth Circuit confronted a similar scenario in <em>Mallett</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 491 (2003), where Ohio had substantially changed how drug quantities were measured since Mallett\xe2\x80\x99s state drug conviction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 502 (addressing this issue in the context of the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines).  The Sixth Circuit could not \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine how Mallett would now be sentenced under Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s revised drug laws\xe2\x80\x9d because the offense for which he had been convicted \xe2\x80\x9cno longer exist[ed] and no conversion between the former and amended statutes [wa]s facially apparent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court therefore was compelled to look to state law \xe2\x80\x9cas of the time of the state-court conviction\xe2\x80\x9d to determine the maximum possible sentence for Mallet\xe2\x80\x99s prior offense.  <em>Id.</em>, at 503.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It cannot be correct that subsequent changes in state law can erase an earlier conviction for ACCA purposes.  A defendant\xe2\x80\x99s history of criminal activity\xe2\x80\x94and the culpability and dangerousness that such history demonstrates\xe2\x80\x94does not cease to exist when a State reformulates its criminal statutes in a way that prevents precise translation of the old conviction into the new statutes.  Congress based ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement on prior convictions and could not have expected courts to treat those convictions as if they had simply disappeared.  To the contrary, Congress has expressly directed that a prior violent felony conviction remains a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction\xe2\x80\x9d unless it has been \xe2\x80\x9cexpunged, or set aside or [the] person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921(a)(20); see also <em>Custis</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/485/index.html">511 U. S. 485</a>, 491 (1994) (explaining that \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) \xe2\x80\x9ccreates a clear negative implication that courts <em>may</em> count a conviction that has <em>not </em>been set aside\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would make ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s applicability depend on the timing of the federal sentencing proceeding.  McNeill cannot explain why two defendants who violated \xc2\xa7922(g) on the same day and who had identical criminal histories\xe2\x80\x94down to the dates on which they committed and were sentenced for their prior offenses\xe2\x80\x94should receive dramatically different federal sentences solely because one\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7922(g) sentencing happened to occur after the state legislature amended the punishment for one of the shared prior offenses.  In contrast, the interpretation we adopt permits a defendant to know even before he violates \xc2\xa7922(g) whether ACCA would apply.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying our holding to this case, we conclude that the District Court properly applied ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement to McNeill.  In light of his two admitted violent felony convictions, McNeill needed only one conviction for a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d to trigger ACCA, but we note that all six of his prior drug convictions qualify.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 1992, McNeill pleaded guilty and was sentenced in a North Carolina court for five offenses: selling cocaine on four separate occasions in October 1991 and possessing cocaine with intent to sell on one occasion in February 1992.  At the time of McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s November 1992 conviction and sentencing, North Carolina law dictated that the maximum sentence for selling cocaine in 1991 and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell in 1992 was 10 years in prison.  See N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x931.1(a)(8), 90\xe2\x80\x9395(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1991).  McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s 1992 convictions were therefore for \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offenses\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of ACCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s sixth drug offense was possessing cocaine with intent to sell in September 1994.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in a North Carolina court in April 1995.  By April 1995, North Carolina had changed the sentence applicable to that type of drug offense but still provided that the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell in September 1994 was 10 years in prison.  See 1993 N.\xc2\xa0C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, \xc2\xa72 (repealing N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen Stat. \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x931.1); 1993 N.\xc2\xa0C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, \xc2\xa756 (as modified by Extra Session 1994 N.\xc2\xa0C. Sess. Laws, ch. 24, \xc2\xa714(b)) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis act becomes effective October 1, 1994, and applies only to offenses occurring on or after that date.  Prosecutions for, or sentences based on, offenses occurring before the effective date of this act [are controlled by] the statutes that would be applicable to those prosecutions or sentences but for the provisions of this act\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, McNeill\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 conviction was also for a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that a federal sentencing court must determine whether \xe2\x80\x9can offense under State law\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d by consulting the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d applicable to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s previous drug offense at the time of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction for that offense.<footcall num="*">  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(ii).
