Mr. Fuller, appearing as the attorney, did accordingly file a petition in the name of Stowe, "to the use and benefit of White," and in it he represents that "White furnished the grain delivered to the United States."

JUSTICE DAVIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We think that the claim was rightly dismissed on the ground of the conclusiveness of the settlement with White.  Stowe, by his own action, is estopped from disputing the validity of the settlement.  If it be conceded that the power of attorney was not an effective instrument for any purpose, because not executed in conformity with law, the concession cannot operate to the advantage of Stowe, because he acted in such a way after the suit was brought as to preclude him from assuming the position he took in his amended petition.  This action has induced the accounting officers of the government to treat White as the only party in interest, and if loss is suffered on this account, it should not be borne by the defendants.  Stowe, in suffering the suit to proceed and cooperating with White\'s attorney in its prosecution, cannot be heard to say that the statements contained in the petition are not true.  It would be wrong to allow him to stand by and see the suit settled on the basis of the truth of those statements and then to turn round and take a new position because the partial interest which he held in the claim was left unprotected by the settlement.  If there be cause of complaint against anyone for the failure to protect this interest, it is not against the defendants whose officers conducted and completed the negotiation on the faith that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 86 U. S. 17</a></p><p> White, as declared in the petition, was the real owner of the claim, and that the suit was prosecuted for his benefit.  In assisting to carry on this suit, Stowe adopted the proceeding on which it was based, and in effect notified the defendants that they could safely settle the cause of action with the attorney of record.  Besides, in taking charge of it after the settlement and asking leave to amend the petition, he recognized the authority of the counsel who instituted it, and it is very clear that the amendment which he was permitted to file could not affect rights acquired while the suit as originally framed was pending.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* 10 Stat. at Large 170.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
