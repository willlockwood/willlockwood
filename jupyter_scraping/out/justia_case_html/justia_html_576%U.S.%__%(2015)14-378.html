Arguing that he did not know the \xe2\x80\x9cbath salts\xe2\x80\x9d he was distributing were regulated as controlled substance analogues, McFadden sought an instruction that would have prevented the jury from finding him guilty unless it found that he knew the substances he distributed had chemical structures and effects on the central nervous system substantially similar to those of controlled substances.  Instead, the District Court instructed the jury that it need only find that McFadden knowingly and intentionally distributed a substance with substantially similar effects on the central nervous system as a controlled substance and that he intended that substance to be consumed by humans.  McFadden was convicted.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Analogue Act\xe2\x80\x99s intent element required only proof that McFadden intended the substance to be consumed by humans.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0When a controlled substance is an analogue, \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) requires the Government to establish that the defendant knew he was dealing with a substance regulated under the Controlled Substances Act or Analogue Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0In addressing the treatment of controlled substance analogues under federal law, one must look to the CSA, which, as relevant here, makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person knowingly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to distribute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).  The ordinary meaning of that provision requires a defendant to know only that the substance he is distributing is some unspecified substance listed on the federal drug schedules.  Thus, the Government must show either that the defendant knew he was distributing a substance listed on the schedules, even if he did not know which substance it was, or that the defendant knew the identity of the substance he was distributing, even if he did not know it was listed on the schedules.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Because the Analogue Act extends that framework to analogous substances, the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s mental-state requirement applies when the controlled substance is, in fact, an analogue.  It follows that the Government must prove that a defendant knew that the substance he was distributing was \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d even in prosecutions dealing with analogues.  That knowledge requirement can be established in two ways: by evidence that a defendant knew that the substance he was distributing is controlled under the CSA or Analogue Act, regardless of whether he knew the substance\xe2\x80\x99s identity; or by evidence that the defendant knew the specific analogue he was distributing, even if he did not know its legal status as a controlled substance analogue.  A defendant with knowledge of the features defining a substance as a controlled substance analogue, \xc2\xa7802(32)(A), knows all of the facts that make his conduct illegal.

Instead, it concluded that the only mental-state requirement for analogue prosecutions is the one in \xc2\xa7813\xe2\x80\x94that an analogue be \xe2\x80\x9cintended for human consumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  That conclusion is inconsistent with the text and structure of the statutes.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Neither the Government\xe2\x80\x99s nor McFadden\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation fares any better.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xc2\xa7841(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge requirement as applied to analogues is satisfied if the defendant knew he was dealing with a substance regulated under some law ignores \xc2\xa7841(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a defendant know he was dealing with \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  That term includes only drugs listed on the federal drug schedules or treated as such by operation of the Analogue Act; it is not broad enough to include all substances regulated by any law.  McFadden contends that a defendant must also know the substance\xe2\x80\x99s features that cause it to fall within the scope of the Analogue Act.  But the key fact that brings a substance within the scope of the Analogue Act is that the substance is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled,\xe2\x80\x9d and that fact can be established in the two ways previously identified.  <i>Staples </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600\n, distinguished.

The owner of the store, Lois McDaniel, had been purchasing bath salts from petitioner Stephen McFadden for several months.  McFadden had marketed the substances to her as \xe2\x80\x9cAlpha,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo Speed,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>Speed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cUp,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Up,\xe2\x80\x9d and had compared them to cocaine and crystal meth.  He had often sold those products with labels borrowing language from the Analogue Act, asserting that the contents were \xe2\x80\x9cnot for human consumption\xe2\x80\x9d or stating that a particular product \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not contain any of the following compounds or analogues of the following compounds\xe2\x80\x9d and listing controlled substances.  McDaniel purchased the bath salts for $15 per gram and resold them for $30 to $70 per gram.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After investigators had conducted two controlled buys from the store and confronted McDaniel, she agreed to cooperate in their investigation by making five controlled buys from McFadden.  The Government intercepted the substances McFadden sent when they arrived at the local FedEx store.  Like the substances sold in the video store, these substances were white and off-white powders packaged in small plastic bags.  Chemical analysis identified the powders as containing, among other substances, 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone, also known as MDPV; 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone, also known as Meth-ylone or MDMC; and 4-Methyl-N-ethylcathinone, also known as 4-MEC.  When ingested, each of these sub-stances is capable of producing effects on the centralnervous system similar to those that controlled substances (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and methcathinone) produce.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A federal grand jury indicted McFadden on eight counts of distribution of controlled substance analogues and one count of conspiracy.  At trial, McFadden argued that he did not know the substances he was distributing were regulated as controlled substances under the Analogue Act.  He and the Government also disagreed about what knowledge was required for a conviction.  The Government sought an instruction requiring only \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat the defendant knowingly and intentionally distributed a mixture or substance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [t]hat .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was a controlled substance analogue .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with the intent that it be consumed by humans.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  McFadden sought a more demanding instruction requiring that he \xe2\x80\x9cknew that the substances that he was distributing possessed the characteristics of controlled substance analogues,\xe2\x80\x9d including their chemical structures and effects on the central nervous system.  <i>Id.</i>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  The District Court compromised, instructing the jury that the statute required that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant knowingly and intentionally distributed a mixture or substance that has\xe2\x80\x9d substantially similar effects on the nervous system as a controlled substance and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat the defendant intended for the mixture or substance to be consumed by humans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 40.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury convicted McFadden on all nine counts.  On appeal, McFadden insisted that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cerred in refusing to instruct the jury that the government was required to prove that he knew, had a strong suspicion, or deliberately avoided knowledge that the [substances] possessed the characteristics of controlled substance analogues.\xe2\x80\x9d  753 F.\xc2\xa03d 432, 443 (CA4 2014).  Rejecting that argument, the Court of Appeals affirmed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 444, 446.  Stating that it was bound by Circuit precedent, the court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cintent element [in the Act] requires [only] that the government prove that the defendant meant for the substance at issue to be consumed by humans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 441; see <i>id.</i>, at 444.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted a writ of certiorari, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S ___ (2015), and now vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Analogue Act requires a controlled substance analogue, if intended for human consumption, to be treated \xe2\x80\x9cas a controlled substance in schedule I\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of federal law.  \xc2\xa71201,\n\n100Stat.\n3207\xe2\x80\x9313,\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7813.  We therefore must turn first to the statute that addresses controlled substances, the CSA.  The CSA makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7401(a)(1),\n\n84Stat.\n1260,\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).  Under the most natural reading of this provision, the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d applies not just to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s verbs but also to the object of those verbs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c<i>a</i> controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Flores-Figueroa </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646,\n650 (2009)\n; <i>id.,</i> at 657 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 660\xe2\x80\x93661 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  When used as an indefinite article, \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ome undetermined or unspecified particular.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1 (2d ed. 1954).  And the CSA defines \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7802(6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The ordinary meaning of \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) thus requires a defendant to know only that the substance he is dealing with is some unspecified substance listed on the federal drug schedules.  The Courts of Appeals have recognized as much.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Andino</i>, 627 F.\xc2\xa03d 41, 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (CA2 2010); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Gamez-Gonzalez</i>, 319 F.\xc2\xa03d 695, 699 (CA5 2003); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Martinez</i>, 301 F.\xc2\xa03d 860, 865 (CA7 2002).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That knowledge requirement may be met by showing that the defendant knew he possessed a substance listed on the schedules, even if he did not know which substance it was.  Take, for example, a defendant whose role in a larger drug organization is to distribute a white powder to customers.  The defendant may know that the white powder is listed on the schedules even if he does not know precisely what substance it is.  And if so, he would be guilty of knowingly distributing \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The knowledge requirement may also be met by showing that the defendant knew the identity of the substance he possessed.  Take, for example, a defendant who knows he is distributing heroin but does not know that heroin is listed on the schedules, 21 CFR \xc2\xa71308.11 (2014).  Because ignorance of the law is typically no defense to criminal prosecution, <i>Bryan </i>v. <i>United </i>States,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 184,\n196 (1998)\n, this defendant would also be guilty of knowingly distributing \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Analogue Act extends the framework of the CSA to analogous substances.\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7813.  The Act defines a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance analogue\xe2\x80\x9d as a substance:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c(i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7802(32)(A).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It further provides, \xe2\x80\x9cA controlled substance analogue shall, to the extent intended for human consumption, be treated, for the purposes of any Federal law as a controlled substance in schedule I.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7813.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question in this case is how the mental state requirement under the CSA for knowingly manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance\xe2\x80\x9d applies when the controlled substance is in fact an analogue.  The answer begins with \xc2\xa7841(a)(1), which expressly requires the Government to prove that a defendant knew he was dealing with \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Analogue Act does not alter that provision, but rather instructs courts to treat controlled substance analogues \xe2\x80\x9cas .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. controlled substance[s] in schedule I.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7813.  Applying this statutory command, it follows that the Government must prove that a defendant knew that the substance with which he was dealing was \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d even in prosecutions involving an analogue.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That knowledge requirement can be established in two ways.  First, it can be established by evidence that a defendant knew that the substance with which he was dealing is some controlled substance\xe2\x80\x94that is, one actually listed on the federal drug schedules or treated as such by operation of the Analogue Act\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether he knew the particular identity of the substance.  Second, it can be established by evidence that the defendant knew the specific analogue he was dealing with, even if he did not know its legal status as an analogue.  The Analogue Act defines a controlled substance analogue by its features, as a substance \xe2\x80\x9cthe chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than\xe2\x80\x9d the effect of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or which is represented or intended to have that effect with respect to a particular person.  \xc2\xa7802(32)(A).  A defendant who possesses a substance with knowledge of those features knows all of the facts that make his conduct illegal, just as a defendant who knows he possesses heroin knows all of the facts that make his conduct illegal.  A defendant need not know of the existence of the Analogue Act to know that he was dealing with \xe2\x80\x9ca controlledsubstance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals did not adhere to \xc2\xa7813\xe2\x80\x99s command to treat a controlled substance analogue \xe2\x80\x9cas a controlled substance in schedule I,\xe2\x80\x9d and, accordingly, it did not apply the mental-state requirement in \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).  Instead, it concluded that the only mental state requirement for prosecutions involving controlled substance analogues is the one in \xc2\xa7813\xe2\x80\x94that the analogues be \xe2\x80\x9cintended for human consumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  metricconverter753 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 436 (citing <i>United States </i>v. <i>Klecker</i>, metricconverter348 F.\xc2\xa03d 69, 71 (CA4 2003)).  Because that interpretation is inconsistent with the text and structure of the statutes, we decline to adopt it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unsurprisingly, neither the Government nor McFadden defends the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 position.  But their alternative interpretations fare no better.  The Government agrees that the knowledge requirement in \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) applies to prosecutions involving controlled substance analogues, yet contends that it is met if the \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant knew he was dealing with an illegal or regulated substance\xe2\x80\x9d under some law.  Brief for United States 15.  Section 841(a)(1), however, requires that a defendant knew he was dealing with \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  That term includes only those drugs listed on the federal drug schedules or treated as such by operation of the Analogue Act.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7802(6), 813.  It is not broad enough to include all substances regulated by any law.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For his part, McFadden contends that, in the context of analogues, knowledge of \xe2\x80\x9ca controlled substance\xe2\x80\x9d can <i>only </i>be established by knowledge of the characteristics that make a substance an \xe2\x80\x9canalogue\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  In support of that argument, he relies heavily on our conclusion in <i>Staples </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600 (1994)\n, that a statute making it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unlawful for any person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 605 (quoting\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.

McFadden reasons by analogy that a defendant convicted under \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) must also know the features of the substance that brought it within the scope of the Analogue Act.  But that position ignores an important textual distinction between \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and the statute at issue in <i>Staples</i>.  The statute at issue in <i>Staples </i>defined \xe2\x80\x9ca firearm\xe2\x80\x9d by its physical features such as the length of its barrel and its capacity to shoot more than one shot with a single function of the trigger.  Unlike those physical features that brought the firearm \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of\xe2\x80\x9d that statute, the fea-ture of a substance \xe2\x80\x9cthat br[ings] it within the scope of\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) is the fact that it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98controlled.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7802(6).  Knowledge of <i>that</i> fact can be established in the twoways previously discussed: either by knowledge that a substance is listed or treated as listed by operation ofthe Analogue Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7802(6), 813, or by knowledge of the physical characteristics that give rise to that treatment.  <i>Supra,</i> at 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">McFadden also invokes the canon of constitutional avoidance, arguing that we must adopt his interpretation of the statute lest it be rendered unconstitutionally vague.  But that argument fails on two grounds.  Under our precedents, this canon \xe2\x80\x9cis a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Warger </i>v. <i>Shauers</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It \xe2\x80\x9chas no application\xe2\x80\x9d in the interpretation of an unambiguous statute such as this one.  See <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even if this statute were ambiguous, McFadden\xe2\x80\x99s argument would falter.  Under our precedents, a scienter requirement in a statute \xe2\x80\x9calleviate[s] vagueness concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow[s] the scope of the [its] prohibition[,] and limit[s] prosecutorial discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales </i>v. <i>Carhart</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124,\n149,\n150 (2007)\n.  The scienter requirement in this statute does not, as McFadden suggests, render the statute vague.  More-over, to the extent McFadden suggests that the substantial similarity test for defining analogues is itself indeterminate, his proposed alternative scienter requirement would do nothing to cure that infirmity.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to the jury did not fully convey the mental state required by the Analogue Act.  The jury was instructed only that McFadden had to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intentionally distribut[e] a mixture or substance that has an actual, intended, or claimed stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system\xe2\x80\x9d substantially similar to that of a controlled substance.  App. 40.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government contends that any error in the jury instructions was harmless because no rational jury could have concluded that McFadden was unaware that the substances he was distributing were controlled.  We have recognized that even the omission of an element from a jury charge is subject to harmless-error analysis.  <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n15 (1999)\n.

Direct evidence could include, for example, past arrests that put a defendant on notice of the controlled status of a substance.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Abdulle</i>, 564 F.\xc2\xa03d 119, 127 (CA2 2009).  Circumstantial evidence could include, for example, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s concealment of his activities, evasive behavior with respect to law enforcement, knowledge that a particular substance produces a \xe2\x80\x9chigh\xe2\x80\x9d similar to that produced by controlled substances, and knowledge that a particular substance is subject to seizure at customs.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Ali</i>, 735 F.\xc2\xa03d 176, 188\xe2\x80\x93189 (CA4 2013).

Second, that an alleged analogue either has, or is represented or intended to have, a stimulant, depressant, hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to that of a controlled substance, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7802(32)(A)(ii), (iii).

As with prosecutions involving substances actually listed on the drug schedules, the Government may offer circumstantial evidence of that knowledge.  See n.\xc2\xa01, <i>supra</i>.  In such cases, it will be left to the trier of fact to determine whether the circumstantial evidence proves that the defendant knew that the substance was a controlled substance under the CSA or Analogue Act, as opposed to under any other federal or state laws.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3422826">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x93378</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">STEPHEN DOMINICK McFADDEN, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 18, 2015]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, except to the extent that it says the Government can satisfy the mental state requirement of Section 841(a)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cby showing that the defendant knew the identity of the substance he possessed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 5.  Section 841(a)(1) makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person knowingly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to manufacture, distribute, or dispense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the Court points out, the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d applies \xe2\x80\x9cnot just to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s verbs, but also to the object of those verbs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 4 (emphasis deleted).  That suggests that a defendant needs to know more than the identity of the substance; he needs to know that the substance is <i>controlled</i>.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Howard</i>, 773 F.\xc2\xa03d 519, 526 (CA4 2014); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 596 F.\xc2\xa03d 926, 944 (CA8 2010); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rogers</i>, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d 925, 935 (CA7 2004).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In cases involving well-known drugs such as heroin, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the identity of the substance can be compelling evidence that he knows the substance is controlled.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Turcotte</i>, 405 F.\xc2\xa03d 515, 525 (CA7 2005).  But that is not necessarily true for lesser known drugs.  A pop quiz for any reader who doubts the point: Two drugs\xe2\x80\x94dextromethorphan and hydrocodone\xe2\x80\x94are both used as cough suppressants.  They are also both used as recreational drugs.  Which one is a controlled substance?[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court says that knowledge of the substance\xe2\x80\x99s iden-tity suffices because \xe2\x80\x9cignorance of the law is typically no defense to criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 5.  I agree that is \xe2\x80\x9ctypically\xe2\x80\x9d true.  But when \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a legal element in the definition of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d a person\xe2\x80\x99s lack of knowledge regarding that legal element <i>can</i> be a defense.  <i>Liparota</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419\n, n.\xc2\xa09 (1985).  And here, there is arguably a legal element in Section 841(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94that the substance be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The analogy the Court drew in <i>Liparota</i> was to a charge of receipt of stolen property: It is no defense that the defendant did not know such receipt was illegal, but it is a defense that he did not know the property was stolen.  Here, the argument goes, it is no defense that a defendant did not know it was illegal to possess a controlled substance, but it is a defense that he did not know the substance was controlled.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements on this issue are not necessary to its conclusion that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jury instructions \xe2\x80\x9cdid not fully convey the mental state required by the Analogue Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  Those statements should therefore not be regarded as controlling if the issue arises in a future case.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t* The answer is hydrocodone.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
