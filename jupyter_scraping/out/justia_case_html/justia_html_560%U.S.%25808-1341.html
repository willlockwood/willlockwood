On appeal, he pointed out for the first time that the federal statutes he violated did not become law until October 2000.  Thus, he claimed, the indictment and evidence permitted at trial allowed a jury to convict him exclusively on the basis of preenactment conduct in violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause.  He conceded that he had not raised this objection in the District Court, but argued that because the constitutional error was plain, his conviction must be set aside.  The Second Circuit agreed and vacated the conviction.  In doing so, the court held that, even in the case of a continuing offense, retrial is necessary if there is \xe2\x80\x9cany possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court noted that this was \xe2\x80\x9ctrue even under plain error review.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s plain-error standard conflicts with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the plain-error rule.  An appellate court may recognize a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error that affects substantial rights,\xe2\x80\x9d even if that error was \xe2\x80\x9cnot brought\xe2\x80\x9d to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cattention.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases interpret this rule such that an appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only when the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious; (3) the error affected the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The standard the Second Circuit applied in this case is inconsistent with the third and fourth of these criteria.  To begin, it is irreconcilable with the criterion that the error \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Puckett</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  This condition requires the error to be prejudicial, meaning that there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the trial\xe2\x80\x99s outcome, not that there is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any possibility</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d however remote, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on preenactment conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does this error fall within the category of \xe2\x80\x9cstructural errors\xe2\x80\x9d that may \xe2\x80\x9caffect substantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of their actual impact on an appellant\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___.  Here, a jury instruction might have minimized or eliminated the risk that Marcus would have been convicted based solely on preenactment conduct.  A reviewing court should find it no more difficult to assess the failure to give such an instruction than to assess numerous other instructional errors previously found nonstructural, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hedgpeth</em> v. <em>Pulido</em>, 555 U. S. ___ <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The Court further rejects Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the error at issue should be labeled an <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto </em>Clause violation, and that all such violations should be treated as special, structural errors warranting reversal without a showing of prejudice.  As an initial matter, the Government never argued that the statute that criminalized Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 conduct applied retroactively, and Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 claim is thus properly brought under the Due Process, and not the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto,</em> Clause.  Moreover, we see no reason why errors similar to the one at issue in this case, taken as a class, would automatically affect substantial rights without a showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cany possibility,\xe2\x80\x9d however remote, standard also cannot be reconciled with the criterion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe error seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Puckett, supra,</em> at ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach, a retrial would be required even where the evidence supporting conviction consists of a few days of preenactment conduct along with several continuous years of identical postenactment conduct.  Given the tiny risk that a jury would base its conviction in these circumstances on the few preenactment days alone, such an error is most unlikely to cast serious doubt on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial system.

See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  The Second Circuit has said that it must recognize a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d if there is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any possibility</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d however remote, that a jury convicted a defendant exclusively on the basis of actions taken before enactment of the statute that made those actions criminal.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d 97, 102 (2008) <em>(per curiam) </em>(emphasis added).  In our view, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A federal grand jury indicted respondent Glenn Marcus on charges that he engaged in unlawful forced labor and sex trafficking between \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98January 1999 and October 2001.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 100; see also 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71589, 1591(a)(1).  At trial, the Government presented evidence of his conduct during that entire period.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 100.  And a jury found him guilty of both charges.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Marcus pointed out for the first time that the statutes he violated were enacted as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), which did not become law until October 28, 2000.  \xc2\xa7112(a)(2), 114 Stat. 1486.  Marcus noted that the indictment and the evidence presented at trial permitted a jury to convict him exclusively upon the basis of actions that he took before October 28, 2000.  And for that reason, Marcus argued that his conviction violated the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94in Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 view, the Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl. 3.  Marcus conceded that he had not objected on these grounds in the District Court.  Letter Brief for Appellant in No. 07\xe2\x80\x934005\xe2\x80\x93cr (CA2), p.\xc2\xa012.  But, he said, the constitutional error is \xe2\x80\x9cplain,\xe2\x80\x9d and his conviction therefore must be set aside.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government replied by arguing that Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 conviction was for a single course of conduct, some of which took place before, and some of which took place after, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment date.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 101.  The Constitution, it said, does not forbid the application of a new statute to such a course of conduct so long as the course of conduct continued <em>after</em> the enactment of the statute.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 79 F.\xc2\xa03d 223, 229 (CA2 1996); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Duncan</em>, 42 F.\xc2\xa03d 97, 104 (CA2 1994).  The Government conceded that the conviction could not rest exclusively upon conduct which took place before the TVPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, but it argued that the possibility that the jury here had convicted on that basis was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98remote.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 102.  Hence, the Government claimed, it was highly unlikely that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make this aspect of the law clear (say, by explaining to the jury that it could not convict based on preenactment conduct alone) affected Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter Brief for United States in No. 07\xe2\x80\x934005\xe2\x80\x93cr (CA2), p.\xc2\xa09.  And the Government thus argued that the court should not recognize a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit noted that Marcus had not raised his <em>ex post facto</em> argument in the District Court.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 102.  The court also recognized that, under Circuit precedent, the Constitution did not prohibit conviction for a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98continuing offense\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d so long as the conviction rested, at least in part, upon postenactment conduct.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101 (quoting <em>Harris, supra, </em>at 229).  But, the court held, \xe2\x80\x9ceven in the case of a continuing offense, if it was <em>possible</em> for the jury\xe2\x80\x94wh[ich] had not been given instructions regarding the date of enactment\xe2\x80\x94to convict <em>exclusively</em> on [the basis of] pre-enactment conduct, then the conviction constitutes a violation\xe2\x80\x9d of the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 101.  The court noted that this was \xe2\x80\x9ctrue even under plain error review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>In short, under the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach, \xe2\x80\x9ca retrial is necessary whenever there is any possibility, <em>no matter how unlikely</em>, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 102 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government sought certiorari.  And we granted the writ, agreeing to decide whether the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach to \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d review, as we have set it forth, conflicts with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d rule.  See Fed. Rule Crim.

The third criterion specifies that a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d must \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t]\xe2\x80\x9d the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the ordinary case, to meet this standard an error must be \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial,\xe2\x80\x9d which means that there must be a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.  <em>Olano, supra, </em>at 734\xe2\x80\x93735 (stating that, to satisfy the third criterion of Rule 52(b), a defendant must \xe2\x80\x9cnormally\xe2\x80\x9d demonstrate that the alleged error was not \xe2\x80\x9charmless\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dominguez Benitez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/74/index.html">542 U. S. 74</a>, 83 (2004).  The Court of Appeals, however, would notice a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d and set aside a conviction whenever there exists \xe2\x80\x9cany<em> </em>possibility, <em>no matter how unlikely</em>, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 102 (emphasis added).  This standard is irreconcilable with our \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Olano, supra, </em>at 734\xe2\x80\x93735.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that our cases speak of a need for a showing that the error affected the \xe2\x80\x9coutcome of the district court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary<em> </em>case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Puckett, </em>556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And we have noted the possibility that certain errors, termed \xe2\x80\x9cstructural errors,\xe2\x80\x9d might \xe2\x80\x9caffect substantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of their actual impact on an appellant\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  See <em>id., </em>at ___ (slip op., at 11) (reserving the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cstructural errors\xe2\x80\x9d automatically satisfy the third \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d criterion); <em>Cotton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 632 (same); <em>Johnson, supra</em>, at 469 (same); <em>Olano, supra, </em>at 735 (same).  But \xe2\x80\x9cstructural errors\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9ca very limited class\xe2\x80\x9d of errors that affect the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98framework within which the trial proceeds,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 468 (quoting <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html">499 U.

We cannot conclude that the error here falls within that category.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The error at issue in this case created a risk that the jury would convict respondent solely on the basis of conduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in that conduct.  A judge might have minimized, if not eliminated, this risk by giving the jury a proper instruction.  We see no reason why, when a judge fails to give such an instruction, a reviewing court would find it any more difficult to assess the likely consequences of that failure than with numerous other kinds of instructional errors that we have previously held to be non-\xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, instructing a jury as to an invalid alternative theory of guilt, <em>Hedgpeth</em> v. <em>Pulido</em>, 555 U.

S. 570</a> (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Marcus argues that, like the Second Circuit, we should apply the label \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause violation\xe2\x80\x9d to the error in this case, and that we should then treat all errors so labeled as special, \xe2\x80\x9cstructural,\xe2\x80\x9d errors that warrant reversal without a showing of prejudice.  See Brief for Respondent 27\xe2\x80\x9329.  But we cannot accept this argument.  As an initial matter, we note that the Government has never claimed that the TVPA retroactively criminalizes preenactment conduct, see Brief for United States 16, and that Marcus and the Second Circuit were thus incorrect to classify the error at issue here as an <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto </em>Clause violation, see <em>Marks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/index.html">430 U. S. 188</a>, 191 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  Rather, if the jury, which was not instructed about the TVPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment date, erroneously convicted Marcus based exclusively on noncriminal, preenactment conduct, Marcus would have a valid due process claim.  Cf. <em>Bouie</em> v. <em>City of Columbia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/index.html">378 U. S. 347</a>, 353\xe2\x80\x93354 (1964) (applying Due Process Clause to <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto </em>judicial decisions).  In any event, however Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 claim is labeled, we see no reason why this kind of error would automatically \xe2\x80\x9caffect substantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d without a showing of individual prejudice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is because errors similar to the one at issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, errors that create a risk that a defendant will be convicted based exclusively on noncriminal conduct\xe2\x80\x94come in various shapes and sizes.  The kind and degree of harm that such errors create can consequently vary.  Sometimes a proper jury instruction might well avoid harm; other times, preventing the harm might only require striking or limiting the testimony of a particular witness.  And sometimes the error might infect an entire trial, such that a jury instruction would mean little.  There is thus no reason to believe that <em>all or almost all </em>such errors <em>always</em> \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fulminante</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 310, or \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Neder, supra, </em>at 9 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, while the rights at issue in this case are important, they do not differ significantly in importance from the constitutional rights at issue in other cases where we have insisted upon a showing of individual prejudice.  See <em>Fulminante, supra, </em>at 306\xe2\x80\x93307 (collecting cases).  Indeed, we have said that \xe2\x80\x9cif the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred\xe2\x80\x9d are not \xe2\x80\x9cstructural errors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rose, supra,</em> at 579.  No one here denies that defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach also cannot be reconciled with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s fourth \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d criterion, which permits an appeals court to recognize \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d only if the error \xe2\x80\x9cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson, </em>520 U. S.<em>, </em>at 467 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In cases applying this fourth criterion, we have suggested that, in most circumstances, an error that does not affect the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict does not significantly impugn the \xe2\x80\x9cfairness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintegrity,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpublic reputation\xe2\x80\x9d of the judicial process.  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Cotton</em>, 535 U. S., at 633.  The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cany possibility, no matter how unlikely\xe2\x80\x9d standard, however, would require finding a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d in a case where the evidence supporting a conviction consisted of, say, a few days of preenactment conduct along with several continuous years of identical postenactment conduct.  Given the tiny risk that the jury would have based its conviction upon those few preenactment days alone, a refusal to recognize such an error as a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d (and to set aside the verdict) is most unlikely to cast serious doubt on the \xe2\x80\x9cfairness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintegrity,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpublic reputation\xe2\x80\x9d of the judicial system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not intend to trivialize the claim that respondent here raises.  Nor do we imply that the kind of error at issue here is unimportant.  But the rule that permits courts to recognize a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9cremove\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseriou[s]\xe2\x80\x9d errors \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the ambit of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 466.  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d rule, as interpreted by this Court, sets forth criteria that a claim of error not raised at trial must satisfy.  The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule would require reversal under the \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d standard for errors that do not meet those criteria.  We can find no good reason to treat respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim of error differently from others.  See <em>Puckett, </em>556 U. S.<em>, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 14) (reviewing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s violation of a plea agreement for \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Cotton, supra, </em>at 631\xe2\x80\x93632 (reviewing an indictment\xe2\x80\x99s failure to charge a fact that increased defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statutory maximum sentence for \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 464 (reviewing the failure to submit an element of the crime to the jury for \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence we must reject the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.  As the Court of Appeals has not yet considered whether the error at issue in this case satisfies this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d standard\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether the error affects \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94we remand the case to that court so that it may do so.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963271">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nUNITED STATES V.

Yet while it may have taken an unusual route to get there, I find nothing wrong with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.  I am more concerned with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to, and policing of, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 28, 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), 114 Stat. 1466.  Respondent Glenn Marcus was convicted on two counts under the TVPA: one for sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71591(a)(1), and one for forced labor, in violation of \xc2\xa71589.  The indictment charged conduct that spanned from January 1999 to October 2001.  See 538 F.\xc2\xa03d 97, 100 (CA2 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The evidence introduced by the Government at trial spanned from 1998 to 2003.  See 487 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 289, 292\xe2\x80\x93297 (EDNY 2007).  Most of the evidence supporting the sex trafficking charge, and some of the evidence supporting the forced labor charge, related to discrete events that occurred before October 28, 2000.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At trial, Marcus failed to ask the judge to inform the jury that his preenactment conduct was not unlawful, and the judge failed to give an instruction to that effect.  If a request had been made, it is clear that an appropriate instruction would have been given.  Indeed, it is equally clear that the judge would have given such an instruction <em>sU. S.onte</em> if she had been aware of the effective date of the statute.  No one disputes that error was committed in the way Marcus was charged and tried, and the error was sufficiently plain to be considered on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record demonstrates that Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 sex trafficking conviction likely violated the <em>ex post facto </em>rule, as applied to trial proceedings through the Due Process Clause, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, because the postenactment evidence appears to have been insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See 538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 105\xe2\x80\x93106 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  Whether his forced labor conviction is invalid for the same reason is not clear.  What is clear, however, is that neither the Second Circuit nor this Court has to determine that an error of constitutional magnitude occurred for Marcus to be eligible for relief.  The question under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) is whether the trial error was sufficiently weighty to affect \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and in my view this error surely was.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court notes that the error \xe2\x80\x9ccreated a risk that the jury would convict respondent solely on the basis of conduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in that conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  That is true, and it is of fundamental concern because imposing criminal sanctions for nonproscribed conduct has always been considered a hallmark of tyranny\xe2\x80\x94no matter how morally reprehensible the prosecuted party.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But in addition to the very real possibility that the jury convicted Marcus of sex trafficking <em>solely</em> on the basis of preenactment conduct, the error created another risk: namely, that both verdicts, returned after seven days of deliberation, rested in part on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect belief that the conduct before October 28, 2000, was unlawful.  The error committed at trial not only prevented the jury from focusing on the relevant time period, but it also distorted the jury\xe2\x80\x99s perception of Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  By arguing that its preenactment evidence showed a violation of the TVPA, the Government effectively mischaracterized all of that evidence as descriptions of illegal behavior.  And by giving the jury the impression that Marcus committed a much larger amount of criminal conduct than he really did, the error may have tipped the scales in favor of the prosecution, when the actual evidence of guilt would not have persuaded the jury to convict.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no need to decide whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments or the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give a curative instruction reached a level of unfairness sufficient to violate the Due Process Clause.  For the foregoing reasons, I am convinced that the error prejudiced Marcus and seriously undermined the integrity of the proceedings.  While I do not endorse the reasoning in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion,*<footcall num="*"> I would therefore affirm its judgment.</footcall></p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not engage the merits of that judgment, but instead remands to the Court of Appeals to apply the test we have devised for evaluating claims of \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d  That test requires lower courts to conduct four separate inquiries, each of which requires a distinct form of judgment and several of which have generated significant appellate-court dissensus; the test may also contain an exception for \xe2\x80\x9cstructural errors,\xe2\x80\x9d a category we have never defined clearly.  With great concision, the Court manages to summarize all of these moving parts in about five pages.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet the language of Rule 52(b) is straightforward.  It states simply: \xe2\x80\x9cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is the mirror image of Rule 52(a), which instructs courts to disregard any error \xe2\x80\x9cthat does not affect substantial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federal Rules thus set forth a unitary standard, which turns on whether the error in question affected substantial rights (either in a particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case or in the mine run of comparable cases), and they leave it to judges to figure out how best to apply that standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our attempt to clarify Rule 52(b), we have, I fear, both muddied the waters and lost sight of the wisdom embodied in the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s spare text.  Errors come in an endless variety of \xe2\x80\x9cshapes and sizes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  Because error-free trials are so rare, appellate courts must repeatedly confront the question whether a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s mistake was harmless or warrants reversal.  They become familiar with particular judges and with the vast panoply of trial procedures, they acquire special expertise in dealing with recurring issues, and their doctrine evolves over time to help clarify and classify various types of mistakes.  These are just a few of the reasons why federal appellate courts are \xe2\x80\x9callowed a wide measure of discretion in the supervision of litigation in their respective circuits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Olano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/725/index.html">507 U. S. 725</a>, 745 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s ever more intensive efforts to rationalize plain-error review may have been born of a worthy instinct.  But they have trapped the appellate courts in an analytic maze that, I have increasingly come to believe, is more liable to frustrate than to facilitate sound decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial error at issue in this case undermined the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights by allowing the jury to convict him on the basis of an incorrect belief that lawful conduct was unlawful, and it does not take an elaborate formula to see that.  Because, in my view, the Court of Appeals properly exercised its discretion to remedy the error and to order a retrial, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The <em>per curiam</em> opinion contained a curious wrinkle, apart from misclassifying the trial error.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  The <em>per curiam</em> applied a standard from earlier Second Circuit cases that asked whether there was any possibility the jury convicted the defendant exclusively on the basis of preenactment conduct.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d 97, 101 (CA2 2008) (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Torres</em>, 901 F.\xc2\xa02d 205, 229 (1990), <em>United States</em> v. <em>Monaco</em>, 194 F.\xc2\xa03d 381, 386 (1999), and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 79 F.\xc2\xa03d 223, 229 (1996)).  As I read the Second Circuit precedents, however, they used that standard to determine whether an <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto</em> violation occurred, not to determine whether that violation warranted vacatur of the conviction pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).  <em>Torres </em>is the only one of the cited cases that even considered Rule 52(b), and its holding rested on a combination of factors, including that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendants brought the general ex\xc2\xa0post facto question to the attention of the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d albeit imprecisely, and that a mandatory life sentence was imposed.  901 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 229.  It is thus unclear why the Court of Appeals believed itself foreclosed from conducting a regular \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d review.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
