UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x936330.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 2, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 10, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of cocaine, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841, and the relevant Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine.  Petitioner Kimbrough pleaded guilty to four offenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder; possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack; possession with intent to distribute powder; and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense.  Under the relevant statutes, Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s plea subjected him to a minimum prison term of 15 years and a maximum of life.  The applicable advisory Guidelines range was 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.  The District Court found, however, that a sentence in this range would have been greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a).  In making that determination, the court relied in part on its view that Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s case exemplified the \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court noted that if Kimbrough had possessed only powder cocaine, his Guidelines range would have been far lower: 97 to 106 months.  Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence was long enough to accomplish \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s objectives, the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in prison.  The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence, finding that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is <em>per se</em> unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder offenses.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Under United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, and the Fourth Circuit erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory.  A district judge must include the Guidelines range in the array of factors warranting consideration, but the judge may determine that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to serve the objectives of sentencing, \xc2\xa73553(a).  In making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of crack and powder offenses.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Crack and powder cocaine have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but are handled very differently for sentencing purposes.  The relevant statutes and Guidelines employ a 100-to-1 ratio that yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for offenses involving equal amounts of powder.  Thus, a major supplier of powder may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys powder and converts it to crack.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), which created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution offenses.  Congress apparently adopted the 100-to-1 ratio because it believed that crack, a relatively new drug in 1986, was significantly more dangerous than powder.  Thus, the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 5 grams of  crack or 500 grams of powder, and its ten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder.  In developing Guidelines sentences for cocaine offenses, the Sentencing Commission employed the statute\xe2\x80\x99s weight-driven scheme, rather than its usual empirical approach based on past sentencing practices.  The statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines used the 100-to-1 ratio to set sentences for a full range of drug quantities.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Based on additional research and experience with the 100-to-1 ratio, the Commission later determined that the crack/powder differential does not meet the objectives of the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.  The Commission also found the disparity inconsistent with the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level dealers, and furthermore observed that the differential fosters a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system because of a perception that it promotes an unwarranted divergence based on race.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The Commission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio.  Congress rejected a 1995 amendment to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100-to-1 ratio with a 1-to-1 ratio, but directed the Commission to propose revision of the ratio under the relevant statutes and Guidelines.  Congress took no action after the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s 1997 and 2002 reports recommended changing the ratio. The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 report again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act, but the Commission also adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines.  The modest amendment, which became effective on November 1, 2007, yields sentences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder.  The Commission thus noted that it is only a partial remedy to the problems generated by the crack/powder disparity.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The federal sentencing statute, as modified by <em>Booker</em>, requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, but \xe2\x80\x9cpermits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other [\xc2\xa73553(a)] concerns as well,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U. S., at\xc2\xa0245\xe2\x80\x93246.  The Government contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100-to-1 ratio are an exception to this general freedom and offers three arguments in support of its position, each of which this Court rejects.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Government argues that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100-to-1 ratio.  This position lacks grounding in the statute, which, by its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack must be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 40.  A person with 50 grams or more of crack must be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of life.  The statute says nothing about appropriate sentences within these brackets, and this Court declines to read any implicit directive into the congressional silence.  See <em>Jama</em> v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/335/index.html">543 U. S. 335</a>, 341.  Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, because Congress knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(h).  This cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from <em>Neal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/284/index.html">516 U. S. 284</a>, which involved different methods of calculating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights: The method applicable in determining statutory minimum sentences combined the weight of the pure drug and its carrier medium, while the one controlling the calculation of Guidelines ranges presumed a lower weight for the carrier medium.  This Court rejected the argument that the Guidelines and the statute should be interpreted consistently, with the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 presumptive-weight method controlling the mandatory minimum calculation.  Were the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current position correct, the Guidelines involved in <em>Neal</em> would be in serious jeopardy.  The same reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100-to-1 ratio to all crack quantities could be urged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in calculating LSD weights.  Yet <em>Neal</em> never questioned the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 validity, and in fact endorsed the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to adopt a new method.  If the 1986 Act does not require the Commission to adhere to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s method for determining LSD weights, it does not require the Commission\xe2\x80\x94or, after <em>Booker</em>, sentencing courts\xe2\x80\x94to adhere to the 100-to-1 ratio for crack quantities other than those triggering the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Government also argues that Congress made clear, in disapproving the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 proposed Guidelines amendment, that the 1986 Act required the Commission and courts to respect the 100-to-1 ratio.  But nothing in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1995 action suggested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1.  To the contrary, Congress required the Commission to recommend a revision of the ratio.  The Government argues that, by calling for recommendations to change both the statute and the Guidelines, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of congressional action.  But the more likely reading is that Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines because the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms of the 100-to-1 ratio concerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.  Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, which Congress did not disapprove or modify, the Guidelines now deviate from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s 100-to-1 ratio, advancing a ratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements with the crack/powder ratio, \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted sentence disparities,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a)(6), will ensue.  The Government claims that, because sentencing courts remain bound by the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimum sentences, deviations from the 100-to-1 ratio could result in sentencing \xe2\x80\x9ccliffs\xe2\x80\x9d around quantities triggering the mandatory minimums.  For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack, but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence for only 1 additional gram.  The LSD Guidelines approved in <em>Neal,</em> however, create a similar risk of sentencing \xe2\x80\x9ccliffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government also maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, defendants will receive markedly different sentences depending on the particular judge drawn for sentencing.  While uniformity remains an important sentencing goal, <em>Booker </em>recognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy that decision adopted.  And as to crack sentences in particular, possible variations among district courts are constrained by the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimums.  Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted sentence disparities\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa73353(a)(6), the proper solution is for district courts to take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the \xe2\x80\x9ccliffs\xe2\x80\x9d resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences and weigh these disparities against the other \xc2\xa73553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparities created by the crack/powder ratio itself.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Booker</em> rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, 543 U. S., at 245, but preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission.  In the ordinary case, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation of a sentencing range will \xe2\x80\x9creflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 11).  The sentencing judge, on the other hand, is \xe2\x80\x9cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \xc2\xa73553(a) in each particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \xe2\x80\x9coutside the \xe2\x80\x98heartland\xe2\x80\x99 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rita</em>, 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Guidelines range \xe2\x80\x9cfails properly to reflect \xc2\xa73553(a) considerations\xe2\x80\x9d even in a mine-run case.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its characteristic institutional role.  Given the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s departure from its empirical approach in formulating the crack Guidelines and its subsequent criticism of the crack/powder disparity, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, even in a mine-run case.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection.  The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range.  It then addressed the relevant \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, including the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s reports criticizing the 100-to-1 ratio.  Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own, but appropriately framed its final determination in line with \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s overarching instruction to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).  The court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate considerations and \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted no procedural error,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gall,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 17.  Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range.  But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with \xc2\xa73553(a).  Giving due respect to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion.

Kimbrough pleaded guilty to all four charges.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the relevant statutes, Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s plea subjected him to an aggregate sentence of 15 years to life in prison: 10 years to life for the three drug offenses, plus a consecutive term of 5 years to life for the firearm offense.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In order to determine the appropriate sentence within this statutory range, the District Court first calculated Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s sentence under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea acknowledged that he was accountable for 56 grams of crack cocaine and 92.1 grams of powder cocaine.  This quantity of drugs yielded a base offense level of 32 for the three drug charges.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2004) (USSG).  Finding that Kimbrough, by asserting sole culpability for the crime, had testified falsely at his codefendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the District Court increased his offense level to 34.  See \xc2\xa73C1.1.  In accord with the presentence report, the court determined that Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history category was II.  An offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II yielded a Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months for the three drug charges.  See <em>id.</em>, ch.\xc2\xa05, pt.\xc2\xa0A, Sentencing Table.  The Guidelines sentence for the firearm offense was the statutory minimum, 60 months.  See USSG\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa72K2.4(b).  Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s final advisory Guidelines range was thus 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A sentence in this range, in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, would have been \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to accomplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.

In this regard, the court contrasted Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range of 228 to 270 months with the range that would have applied had he been accountable for an equivalent amount of powder cocaine: 97 to 106 months, inclusive of the 5-year mandatory minimum for the firearm charge, see USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c); <em>id.</em>, ch.\xc2\xa05, pt.\xc2\xa0A, Sentencing Table.  Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly long enough\xe2\x80\x9d to accomplish the objectives listed in \xc2\xa73553(a), the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in prison plus 5 years of supervised release.

Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug.  Powder cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, is generally inhaled through the nose; it may also be mixed with water and injected.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 5, 12 (Feb. 1995), available at http://www.ussc.gov/crack/exec.htm (hereinafter 1995 Report).  (All Internet materials as visited Dec. 7, 2007, and included in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file.)  Crack cocaine, a type of cocaine base, is formed by dissolving powder cocaine and baking soda in boiling water.  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa014.  The resulting solid is divided into single-dose \xe2\x80\x9crocks\xe2\x80\x9d that users smoke.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The active ingredient in powder and crack cocaine is the same.  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa09.  The two forms of the drug also have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but smoking crack cocaine allows the body to absorb the drug much faster than inhaling powder cocaine, and thus produces a shorter, more intense high.  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although chemically similar, crack and powder cocaine are handled very differently for sentencing purposes.  The 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy iv (May 2002), \navailable at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/\n2002crackrpt.pdf (hereinafter 2002 Report).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This disparity means that a major supplier of powder cocaine may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys powder from the supplier but then converts it to crack.  See 1995 Report\xc2\xa0193\xe2\x80\x93194.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat. 3207.  The 1986 Act created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution offenses.  Congress sought \xe2\x80\x9cto link the ten-year mandatory minimum trafficking prison term to major drug dealers and to link the five-year minimum term to serious traffickers.\xe2\x80\x9d  1995 Report\xc2\xa0119.  The 1986 Act uses the weight of the drugs involved in the offense as the sole proxy to identify \xe2\x80\x9cmajor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d dealers.  For example, any defendant responsible for 100 grams of heroin is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp V), and any defendant responsible for 1,000 grams of heroin is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Crack cocaine was a relatively new drug when the 1986 Act was signed into law, but it was already a matter of great public concern: \xe2\x80\x9cDrug abuse in general, and crack cocaine in particular, had become in public opinion and in members\xe2\x80\x99 minds a problem of overwhelming dimensions.\xe2\x80\x9d  1995 Report\xc2\xa0121.  Congress apparently believed that crack was significantly more dangerous than powder cocaine in that: (1) crack was highly addictive; (2) crack users and dealers were more likely to be violent than users and dealers of other drugs; (3) crack was more harmful to users than powder, particularly for children who had been exposed by their mothers\xe2\x80\x99 drug use during pregnancy; (4) crack use was especially prevalent among teenagers; and (5) crack\xe2\x80\x99s potency and low cost were making it increasingly popular.  See 2002 Report\xc2\xa090.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on these assumptions, the 1986 Act adopted a \xe2\x80\x9c100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio\xe2\x80\x9d that treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B)(ii), (iii); its ten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Congress was considering adoption of the 1986 Act, the Sentencing Commission was engaged in formulating the Sentencing Guidelines.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In the main, the Commission developed Guidelines sentences using an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing practices, including 10,000 presentence investigation reports.  See USSG \xc2\xa71A.1, intro. comment., pt.\xc2\xa0A, \xc2\xb63.  The Commission \xe2\x80\x9cmodif[ied] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at\xc2\xa010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission did not use this empirical approach in developing the Guidelines sentences for drug-trafficking offenses.  Instead, it employed the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s weight-driven scheme.  The Guidelines use a drug quantity table based on drug type and weight to set base offense levels for drug trafficking offenses.  See USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c).  In setting offense levels for crack and powder cocaine, the Commission, in line with the 1986 Act, adopted the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.  The statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cgo further and set sentences for the full range of possible drug quantities using the same 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 quantity ratio.\xe2\x80\x9d  1995 Report\xc2\xa01.  The Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 drug quantity table sets base offense levels ranging from 12, for offenses involving less than 250 milligrams of crack (or 25 grams of powder), to 38, for offenses involving more than 1.5 kilograms of crack (or 150 kilograms of powder).  USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Commission immediately used the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio to define base offense levels for all crack and powder offenses, it later determined that the crack/powder sentencing disparity is generally unwarranted.  Based on additional research and experience with the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio, the Commission concluded that the disparity \xe2\x80\x9cfails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by Congress in both the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  2002 Report\xc2\xa091.  In a series of reports, the Commission identified three problems with the crack/powder disparity.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Commission reported, the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio rested on assumptions about \xe2\x80\x9cthe relative harmfulness of the two drugs and the relative prevalence of certain harmful conduct associated with their use and distribution that more recent research and data no longer support.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007), available at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/\ncocaine2007.pdf (hereinafter 2007 Report) (ratio Congress embedded in the statute far \xe2\x80\x9coverstate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d both \xe2\x80\x9cthe relative harmfulness\xe2\x80\x9d of crack cocaine, and the \xe2\x80\x9cseriousness of most crack cocaine offenses\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, the Commission found that crack is associated with \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly less trafficking-related violence \xe2\x80\xa6 than previously assumed.\xe2\x80\x9d  2002 Report 100.  It also observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negative effects of prenatal crack cocaine exposure are identical to the negative effects of prenatal powder cocaine exposure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 94.  The Commission furthermore noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe epidemic of crack cocaine use by youth never materialized to the extent feared.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa096. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Commission concluded that the crack/powder disparity is inconsistent with the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level dealers.  Drug importers and major traffickers generally deal in powder cocaine, which is then converted into crack by street-level sellers.  See 1995 Report\xc2\xa066\xe2\x80\x9367.  But the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio can lead to the \xe2\x80\x9canomalous\xe2\x80\x9d result that \xe2\x80\x9cretail crack dealers get longer sentences than the wholesale drug distributors who supply them the powder cocaine from which their crack is produced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 174.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Commission stated that the crack/powder sentencing differential \xe2\x80\x9cfosters disrespect for and lack of confidence in the criminal justice system\xe2\x80\x9d because of a \xe2\x80\x9cwidely-held perception\xe2\x80\x9d that it \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes unwarranted disparity based on race.\xe2\x80\x9d  2002 Report 103.  Approximately 85 percent of defendants convicted of crack offenses in federal court are black; thus the severe sentences required by the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio are imposed \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily upon black offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite these observations, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s most recent reports do not urge identical treatment of crack and powder cocaine.  In the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9csome differential in the quantity-based penalties\xe2\x80\x9d for the two drugs is warranted, <em>id.</em>, at 102, because crack is more addictive than powder, crack offenses are more likely to involve weapons or bodily injury, and crack distribution is associated with higher levels of crime, see <em>id.</em>, at 93\xe2\x80\x9394, 101\xe2\x80\x93102.  But the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 crack/powder ratio, the Commission concluded, significantly overstates the differences between the two forms of the drug.  Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the ratio be \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially\xe2\x80\x9d reduced.  <em>Id.</em>, at viii.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio.  In 1995, it proposed amendments to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio with a 1&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.  Complementing that change, the Commission would have installed special enhancements for trafficking offenses involving weapons or bodily injury.  See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 60 Fed. Reg. 25075\xe2\x80\x9325077 (1995).  Congress, acting pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(p),[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] rejected the amendments.  See Pub. L. 104\xe2\x80\x9338, \xc2\xa71, 109 Stat. 334.  Simultaneously, however, Congress directed the Commission to \xe2\x80\x9cpropose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(a)(2), <em>id</em>., at\xc2\xa0335.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to this directive, the Commission issued reports in 1997 and 2002 recommending that Congress change the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio prescribed in the 1986 Act.  The 1997 Report proposed a 5&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 2 (Apr. 1997), http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/newcrack.pdf.  The 2002 Report recommended lowering the ratio \xe2\x80\x9cat least\xe2\x80\x9d to 20 to 1.  2002 Report\xc2\xa0viii.  Neither proposal prompted congressional action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s most recent report, issued in 2007, again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act to reduce the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.  This time, however, the Commission did not simply await congressional action.  Instead, the Commission adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines.  See 2007 Report 9.  The alteration, which became effective on November 1, 2007, reduces the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels.  See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571\xe2\x80\x9328572 (2007).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  This modest amendment yields sentences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder.  See <em>ibid</em>.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Describing the amendment as \xe2\x80\x9conly \xe2\x80\xa6 a partial remedy\xe2\x80\x9d for the problems generated by the crack/powder disparity, the Commission noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny comprehensive solution requires appropriate legislative action by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  2007 Report\xc2\xa010.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With this history of the crack/powder sentencing ratio in mind, we next consider the status of the Guidelines tied to the ratio after our decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/220/index.html">543 U.

The <em>Booker </em>remedial opinion determined that the appropriate cure was to sever and excise the provision of the statute that rendered the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  This modification of the federal sentencing statute, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes the Guidelines effectively advisory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em> </em>543 U. S., at 245.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute, as modified by <em>Booker</em>, contains an overarching provision instructing district courts to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to accomplish the goals of sentencing, including \xe2\x80\x9cto reflect the seriousness of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto promote respect for the law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto provide just punishment for the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  The statute further provides that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the court should consider a number of factors, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentencing range established\xe2\x80\x9d by the Guidelines, \xe2\x80\x9cany pertinent policy statement\xe2\x80\x9d issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to its statutory authority, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In sum, while the statute still requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, see <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 7, 11,<em> Booker </em>\xe2\x80\x9cpermits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well,\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at\xc2\xa0245\xe2\x80\x93246.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government acknowledges that the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9care now advisory\xe2\x80\x9d and that, as a general matter, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States\xc2\xa016; cf. <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at\xc2\xa012) (a district court may consider arguments that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \xc2\xa73553(a) considerations\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Government contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio are an exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral freedom that sentencing courts have to apply the [\xc2\xa73553(a)] factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 16.  That is so, according to the Government, because the ratio is a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific policy determinatio[n] that Congress has directed sentencing courts to observe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa025.  The Government offers three arguments in support of this position.  We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As its first and most heavily pressed argument, the Government urges that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Sentencing Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Government acknowledges that the \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not <em>expressly</em> direct the Sentencing Commission to incorporate the 100:1 ratio in the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States\xc2\xa033 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  Nevertheless, it asserts that the Act \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mplicit[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d requires the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.  <em>Id.</em>, at 32.  Any deviation, the Government urges, would be \xe2\x80\x9clogically incoherent\xe2\x80\x9d when combined with mandatory minimum sentences based on the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio.  <em>Id</em>., at\xc2\xa033.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument encounters a formidable obstacle: It lacks grounding in the text of the 1986 Act.  The statute, by its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and the maximum term is 40 years.  A person with 50 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and the maximum term is life.  The statute says nothing about the appropriate sentences within these brackets, and we decline to read any implicit directive into that congressional silence.  See <em>Jama</em> v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/335/index.html">543 U. S. 335</a>, 341 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, for Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms.  For example, Congress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for serious recidivist offenders \xe2\x80\x9cat or near\xe2\x80\x9d the statutory maximum.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(h).  See also \xc2\xa7994(i) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d for specified categories of offenders.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from <em>Neal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/284/index.html"></a><a href="/us/516/284/index.html">516 U. S. 284</a> (1996).  That case involved different methods of calculating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights, one applicable in determining statutory minimum sentences, the other controlling the calculation of Guidelines ranges.  The 1986 Act sets mandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\xe2\x80\x9d of LSD.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(v), (B)(v).  Prior to <em>Neal</em>, we had interpreted that language to include the weight of the carrier medium (usually blotter paper) on which LSD is absorbed even though the carrier is usually far heavier than the LSD itself.  See <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/453/index.html">500 U. S. 453</a>, 468 (1991).  Until 1993, the Sentencing Commission had interpreted the relevant Guidelines in the same way.  That year, however, the Commission changed its approach and \xe2\x80\x9cinstructed courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neal</em>, 516 U. S., at\xc2\xa0287 (citing USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c), n.\xc2\xa0(H) (Nov. 1995)).  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s change significantly lowered the Guidelines range applicable to most LSD offenses, but defendants remained subject to higher statutory minimum sentences based on the combined weight of the pure drug and its carrier medium.  The defendant in <em>Neal</em> argued that the revised Guidelines and the statute should be interpreted consistently and that the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptive-weight method of the Guidelines should also control the mandatory minimum calculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 U. S., at\xc2\xa0287.  We rejected that argument, emphasizing that the Commission had not purported to interpret the statute and could not in any event overrule our decision in <em>Chapman</em>.

We have just recounted the reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio to all quantities of crack cocaine.  Those same reasons could be urged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in calculating the weight of LSD for Guidelines purposes.  Yet our opinion in <em>Neal</em> never questioned the validity of the altered Guidelines.  To the contrary, we stated: \xe2\x80\x9cEntrusted within its sphere to make policy judgments, the Commission may abandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemed a more desirable \xe2\x80\x98approach\xe2\x80\x99 to calculating LSD quantities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa0295.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  If the 1986 Act does not require the Commission to adhere to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s method for determining LSD weights, it does not require the Commission\xe2\x80\x94or, after <em>Booker</em>, sentencing courts\xe2\x80\x94to adhere to the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio for crack cocaine quantities other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the 1986 Act, the Government relies on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 disapproval of the Guidelines amendment that the Sentencing Commission proposed in 1995.  Congress \xe2\x80\x9cnot only disapproved of the 1:1 ratio,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government urges; it also made clear \xe2\x80\x9cthat the 1986 Act required the Commission (and sentencing courts) to take drug quantities into account, and to do so in a manner that respects the 100:1 ratio.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States\xc2\xa035.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that Congress rejected the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 proposal to place a 1&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio in the Guidelines, and that Congress also expressed the view that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pub. L. 104\xe2\x80\x9338, \xc2\xa72(a)(1)(A), 109 Stat. 334.  But nothing in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1995 reaction to the Commission-proposed 1&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio suggested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1.  To the contrary, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1995 action required the Commission to recommend a \xe2\x80\x9crevision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(a)(2), <em>id.</em>, at 335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government emphasizes that Congress required the Commission to propose changes to the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio in <em>both</em> the 1986 Act and the Guidelines.  This requirement, the Government contends, implicitly foreclosed any deviation from the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio in the Guidelines (or by sentencing courts) in the absence of a corresponding change in the statute.  See Brief for United States 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  But it does not follow as the night follows the day that, by calling for recommendations to change the statute, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of congressional action.  The more likely reading is that Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines because the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms of the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>, concerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, see <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311,<em> </em>the Guidelines now advance a crack/powder ratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1.  See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571\xe2\x80\x9328572.  Adopting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, the amended Guidelines would conflict with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1995 action, and with the 1986 Act, because the current Guidelines ratios deviate from the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 statutory ratio.  Congress, however, did not disapprove or modify the Commission-initiated 2007 amendment.  Ordinarily, we resist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction.  See <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/574/index.html">461 U. S. 574</a>, 600 (1983).  But in this case, Congress failed to act on a proposed amendment to the Guidelines in a high-profile area in which it had previously exercised its disapproval authority under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(p).  If nothing else, this tacit acceptance of the 2007 amendment undermines the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position, which is itself based on implications drawn from congressional silence.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements with the crack/powder ratio, unwarranted disparities of two kinds will ensue.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a)(6) (sentencing courts shall consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\xe2\x80\x9d).  First, because sentencing courts remain bound by the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed in the 1986 Act, deviations from the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio could result in sentencing \xe2\x80\x9ccliffs\xe2\x80\x9d around quantities that trigger the mandatory minimums.  Brief for United States\xc2\xa033 (internal quotation marks omitted).  For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence on a defendant responsible for only 1 additional gram.  Second, the Government maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, \xe2\x80\x9cdefendants with identical real conduct will receive markedly different sentences, depending on nothing more than the particular judge drawn for sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa040.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither of these arguments persuades us to hold the crack/powder ratio untouchable by sentencing courts.  As to the first, the LSD Guidelines we approved in <em>Neal</em> create a similar risk of sentencing \xe2\x80\x9ccliffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  An offender who possesses LSD on a carrier medium weighing ten grams is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(v), but an offender whose carrier medium weighs slightly less may receive a considerably lower sentence based on the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 presumptive-weight methodology.  Concerning the second disparity, it is unquestioned that uniformity remains an important goal of sentencing.  As we explained in <em>Booker</em>, however, advisory Guidelines combined with appellate review for reasonableness and ongoing revision of the Guidelines in response to sentencing practices will help to \xe2\x80\x9cavoid excessive sentencing disparities.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 264.  These measures will not eliminate variations between district courts, but our opinion in <em>Booker </em>recognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy we adopted.  See <em>id.</em>, at\xc2\xa0263 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot and do not claim that use of a \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness\xe2\x80\x99 standard will provide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to secure [through mandatory Guidelines].\xe2\x80\x9d).  And as to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note a congressional control on disparities: possible variations among district courts are constrained by the mandatory minimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted sentence disparities\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73353(a)(6), the proper solution is not to treat the crack/powder ratio as mandatory.  Section 3553(a)(6) directs <em>district courts</em> to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparities\xe2\x80\x94along with other \xc2\xa73553(a) factors\xe2\x80\x94when imposing sentences.  See <em>Gall</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa06, 16.  Under this instruction, district courts must take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the \xe2\x80\x9ccliffs\xe2\x80\x9d resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.  To reach an appropriate sentence, these disparities must be weighed against the other \xc2\xa73553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparity created by the crack/powder ratio itself.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 245 (2005), we have nevertheless preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission.  As explained in <em>Rita</em> and <em>Gall</em>, district courts must treat the Guidelines as the \xe2\x80\x9cstarting point and the initial benchmark,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 11.  Congress established the Commission to formulate and constantly refine national sentencing standards.  See <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2007) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9311).  Carrying out its charge, the Commission fills an important institutional role: It has the capacity courts lack to \xe2\x80\x9cbase its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pruitt</em>, 502 F.\xc2\xa03d 1154, 1171 (CA10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring); see <em>supra</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have accordingly recognized that, in the ordinary case, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation of a sentencing range will \xe2\x80\x9creflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rita</em>, 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  The sentencing judge, on the other hand, has \xe2\x80\x9cgreater familiarity with \xe2\x80\xa6 the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 18).  He is therefore \xe2\x80\x9cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \xc2\xa73353(a)\xe2\x80\x9d in each particular case.  <em>Gall</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted)<em>.</em>  In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \xe2\x80\x9coutside the \xe2\x80\x98heartland\xe2\x80\x99 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rita</em>, 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Guidelines range \xe2\x80\x9cfails properly to reflect \xc2\xa73553(a) considerations\xe2\x80\x9d even in a mine-run case.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States</em>, O. T. 2007, No. 06-7949, pp. 38\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its characteristic institutional role.  In formulating Guidelines ranges for crack cocaine offenses, as we earlier noted, the Commission looked to the mandatory minimum sentences set in the 1986 Act, and did not take account of \xe2\x80\x9cempirical data and national experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Pruitt</em>, 502 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1171 (McConnell, J., concurring).  Indeed, the Commission itself has reported that the crack/powder disparity produces disproportionately harsh sanctions, <em>i.e.</em>, sentences for crack cocaine offenses \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the purposes of sentencing set forth in \xc2\xa73553(a).  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Given all this, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, even in a mine-run case.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking account of the foregoing discussion in appraising the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition in this case, we conclude that the 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection.  The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range.  It then addressed the relevant \xc2\xa73553(a) factors.  First, the court considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d of the crime, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a)(1), which was an unremarkable drug-trafficking offense.  App.\xc2\xa072\xe2\x80\x9373 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his defendant and another defendant were caught sitting in a car with some crack cocaine and powder by two police officers\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the sum and substance of it\xe2\x80\x94[and they also had] a firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, the court considered Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chistory and characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(1).  The court noted that Kimbrough had no prior felony convictions, that he had served in combat during Operation Desert Storm and received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, and that he had a steady history of employment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the court alluded to the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s reports criticizing the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio, cf. \xc2\xa73553(a)(5) (Supp. V), noting that the Commission \xe2\x80\x9crecognizes that crack cocaine has not caused the damage that the Justice Department alleges it has.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.\xc2\xa072.  Comparing the Guidelines range to the range that would have applied if Kimbrough had possessed an equal amount of powder, the court suggested that the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio itself created an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of \xc2\xa73553(a).  Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own.  Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s overarching instruction to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.  Concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe crack cocaine guidelines [drove] the offense level to a point higher than is necessary to do justice in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 72, the District Court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate considerations and \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted no procedural error,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ultimate question in Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s case is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the sentence was reasonable\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors supported a sentence of [15 years] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The sentence the District Court imposed on Kimbrough was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range.  But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99s case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with \xc2\xa73553(a).  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>.  Indeed, aside from its claim that the 100&amp;nbhyph;to&amp;nbhyph;1 ratio is mandatory, the Government did not attack the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s downward variance as unsupported by \xc2\xa73553(a).<em> </em>Giving due respect to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion.

S. 220</a>, 258\xe2\x80\x93265 (2005).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s post-<em>Booker</em> sentencing cases illustrate why the remedial majority in <em>Booker</em> was mistaken to craft a remedy far broader than necessary to correct constitutional error.  The Court is now confronted with a host of questions about how to administer a sentencing scheme that has no basis in the statute.  Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in this area are necessarily grounded in policy considerations rather than law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Booker</em>, the Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment insofar as they permit a judge to make findings that raise a sentence beyond the level justified by the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 232 (quoting <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, 303 (2004) (emphasis deleted)).  In my view, this violation was more suitably remedied by requiring any such facts to be submitted to the jury.  <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S., at 323\xe2\x80\x93325 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).  That approach would have been consistent with our longstanding presumption of the severability of unconstitutional applications of statutory provisions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 322\xe2\x80\x93323 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).  And it would have achieved compliance with the Sixth Amendment while doing the least amount of violence to the mandatory sentencing regime that Congress enacted.  <em>Id</em>., at 324\xe2\x80\x93326 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).  The Court, however, chose a more sweeping remedy.  Despite acknowledging that under the mandatory Guidelines not \xe2\x80\x9cevery sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court rendered the Guidelines advisory in their entirety and mandated appellate review of all sentences for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 268.  Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csolution fail[ed] to tailor the remedy to the wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d I dissented from the remedial opinion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial approach, we are now called upon to decide a multiplicity of questions that have no discernibly legal answers.  Last Term, in <em>Rita </em>v.<em> United States</em>, 551 U. S. __ (2007), the Court held that a Court of Appeals may treat sentences within the properly calculated Guidelines range as presumptively reasonable.  Today, in <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, p. __, the Court holds that a Court of Appeals may not require sentences that deviate substantially from the Guidelines range to be justified by extraordinary circumstances.  And here the Court holds that sentencing courts are free to reject the Sentencing Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These outcomes may be perfectly reasonable as a matter of policy, but they have no basis in law.  Congress did not mandate a reasonableness standard of appellate review\xe2\x80\x94that was a standard the remedial majority in <em>Booker</em> fashioned out of whole cloth.  See 543 U. S., at 307\xe2\x80\x93312 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part).  The Court must now give content to that standard, but in so doing it does not and cannot rely on any statutory language or congressional intent.  We are asked here to determine whether, under the new advisory Guidelines regime, district courts may impose sentences based in part on their disagreement with a categorical policy judgment reflected in the Guidelines.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to that question necessarily derives from something other than the statutory language or congressional intent because Congress, by making the Guidelines mandatory, quite clearly intended to bind district courts to the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s categorical policy judgments.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (excised by <em>Booker</em>).  By rejecting this statutory approach, the <em>Booker </em>remedial majority has left the Court with no law to apply and forced it to assume the legislative role of devising a new sentencing scheme.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I joined Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissent in <em>Rita</em> accepting the <em>Booker</em> remedial opinion as a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory <em>stare decisis</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 551 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 2), I am now convinced that there is no principled way to apply the <em>Booker </em>remedy\xe2\x80\x94certainly not one based on the statute.  Accordingly, I think it best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory.  Cf. <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 465 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the statute as written, it is clear that the District Court erred by departing below the mandatory Guidelines range.  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacating petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962556">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n552 U.
