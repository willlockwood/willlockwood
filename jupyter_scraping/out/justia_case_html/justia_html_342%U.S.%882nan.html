When, as here, Commission action constitutes an intrusion on state power, there is a duty on that body clearly to justify its action.  <em>Florida v.

JUSTICE BLACK dissents to the action of the Court disposing of the case without oral argument.</p>\n<p>To justify its conclusion of discrimination against interstate commerce, the Commission must show that intrastate commutation service is not producing its fair share of the New Haven\'s revenues.  <em>Wisconsin Railroad Commission v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q.R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/563/case.html">257 U. S. 563</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/563/case.html#585">257 U. S. 585</a></span>-586; <em>United States v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/70/case.html">290 U. S. 70</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/70/case.html#75">290 U. S. 75</a></span>.  Intrastate traffic must, of course, bear a proportionate amount of the burden necessary to meet maintenance and operating costs and yield a fair return on investment.  But here, as in <em>North Carolina v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/507/case.html">325 U. S. 507</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/507/case.html#516">325 U. S. 516</a></span>, the "Commission made no findings as to what contribution from intrastate traffic would constitute a fair proportion of the railroad\'s total income."  It merely found that the interstate rates were reasonable, and fixed intrastate rates at the same level.</p>\n<p>We have here no finding as to the necessary relation between interstate and intrastate commutation rates.  Perhaps intrastate fares need not be as high as interstate fares to produce intrastate\'s fair share of total revenue.  Perhaps they should be higher.  The critical issue is at what rates the two types of commuter traffic will be capable of producing their proper shares of revenue.  It is not necessary on this record to equate the two rates in order to prevent diversion of traffic to the lower intrastate fare.  <em>Illinois Commerce Commission v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/474/case.html">292 U. S. 474</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/474/case.html#485">292 U. S. 485</a></span>.  An adequate basis for a conclusion of rate discrimination in this case would require a finding as to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="884">Page 342 U. S. 884</a></p><p> amount of revenue expected of the intrastate and interstate commuters and the revenue producing capacities of the two groups.</p>\n<p>Unless we make the requirements for administrative action strict and demanding, expertise, the strength of modern government, can become a monster which rules with no practical limits on its discretion.  Absolute discretion, like corruption, marks the beginning of the end of liberty.  This case is perhaps insignificant in the annals.  But the standard set for men of good will is even more useful to the venal.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
