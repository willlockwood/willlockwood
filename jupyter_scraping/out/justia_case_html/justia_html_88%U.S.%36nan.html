Walker, as trustee, was authorized, upon default of payment of the debt, to take possession of the mortgaged premises and sell them, upon certain specified terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>In this state of things, Brown, the administrator, and as already said a citizen of Tennessee, filed a bill of foreclosure in a chancery court of Tennessee, against Gardner, the debtor, and of New York, and Walker, the trustee, of the same state with himself, for the foreclosure of the mortgage or deed of trust executed by Gardner.  The service on Gardner was by publication.</p>\n<p>The bill charged</p>\n<p>"that Walker had never given bond as trustee of said trust, and had taken no steps to foreclose the trust, and did not wish or intend to <em>execute</em> the same, and that the complainant had the right to have the trust closed by a sale of the lands free from the equity of redemption, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 88 U.

It is claimed in the bill that he had not qualified himself under the laws of Tennessee to act under this power, and the suit was brought to foreclose the mortgage in chancery, without reference to the special power of sale.  Walker, the trustee, was made codefendant with Gardner, the mortgagor, the object </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 88 U. S. 41</a></p><p> being to reach the property in his hands as trustee and subject it, through the ordinary powers of a court of chancery, to the payment of the debt it was given to secure.</p>\n<p>The motion of Gardner, the mortgagor, to transfer the cause, as to himself, to the circuit court under the provisions of the Act of July 27, 1866, could not be granted unless there could be a final determination of the cause so far as it concerned him without the presence of the other defendant as a party.  And we think that the circuit court was right in its opinion that Walker was a necessary party to the relief asked against Gardner and in refusing to entertain jurisdiction and in remanding the cause.  The bill prayed a foreclosure of the mortgage by a sale of the land.  This required the presence of the party holding the legal title.  The complainant had only the equitable title.  Walker held the legal title.  The final determination of the controversy, therefore, required his presence, and as the cause was not removable as to him, under the authority of <em>Coal Company v. Blatchford,</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] it could not be removed as to Gardner alone.</p>\n<p><em>Order of the circuit court affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 1794.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>14 Stat. at Large 306.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/172/case.html">78 U.
