Marx and the United States concede that the statute does not expressly limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs under the Rule, but argue that it does so by negative implication.  They claim that unless \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis on which to award costs, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cand costs\xe2\x80\x9d would be superfluous with Rule 54(d)(1).  And the United States also argues that \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s more specific cost statute displaces Rule 54(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s more general rule.

The expressio unius canon that they invoke does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cunless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149\n, and can be overcome by \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Vonn, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55\n.  Here, context indicates that Congress did not intend \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from awarding costs under the Rule.  First, under the American Rule, each litigant generally pays his own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, but the Court has long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in a narrow set of circumstances, e.g., when a party brings an action in bad faith.  The statute is thus best read as codifying a court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing authority to award both attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  Next, \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence must be understood in light of its first, which provides an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, but to prevailing plaintiffs.  By adding \xe2\x80\x9cand costs\xe2\x80\x9d to the second sentence, Congress foreclosed the argument that defendants can only recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and removed any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in such cases.  Finally, \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s language sharply contrasts with that of other statutes in which Congress has placed conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants.  See, e.g., \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71928.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(3)\xc2\xa0Even assuming that their surplusage argument is correct, the canon against surplusage is not absolute.  First, the canon \xe2\x80\x9cassists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Here, no interpretation of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) gives effect to every word.  Second, redundancy is not unusual in statutes addressing costs.  See, e.g., \n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72607(d)(5).  Finally, the canon is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.  Because \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) is not part of Rule 54(d)(1), the force of this canon is diminished.

Because Marx did not bring this suit in bad faith, the specific provision is not applicable.

In September 2008, EdFund hired respondent General Revenue Corporation (GRC) to collect the debt.  One month later, Marx filed an FDCPA enforcement action against GRC.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Marx alleged that GRC had violated the FDCPA by harassing her with phone calls several times a day and falsely threatening to garnish up to 50% of her wages and to take the money she owed directly from her bank account.  Shortly after the complaint was filed, GRC made an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 to pay Marx $1,500, plus reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, to settle any claims she had against it.  Marx did not respond to the offer.  She subsequently amended her complaint to add a claim that GRC unlawfully sent a fax to her workplace that requested information about her employment status.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing a 1-day bench trial, the District Court found that Marx had failed to prove any violation of the FDCPA.  As the prevailing party, GRC submitted a bill of costs seeking $7,779.16 in witness fees, witness travel expenses, and deposition transcript fees.  The court disallowed several items of costs and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), ordered Marx to pay GRC $4,543.03.  Marx filed a motion to vacate the award of costs, arguing that the court lacked authority to award costs under Rules 54(d)(1) and 68(d) because \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis for awarding costs in FDCPA cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Section 1692k(a)(3) provides, in relevant part: \xe2\x80\x9cOn a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Marx argued that because the court had not found that she brought the case in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, GRC was not entitled to costs.  The Dis- trict Court rejected Marx\xe2\x80\x99s argument, concluding that \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) does not displace a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs under Rule 54(d)(1) and that costs should also be awarded under Rule 68(d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Tenth Circuit affirmed but agreed only with part of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  In particular, the court disagreed that costs were allowed under Rule 68(d).  668 F.\xc2\xa03d 1174, 1182 (2011).  It explained that \xe2\x80\x9cRule 68 applies only where the district court enters judgment in favor of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d for less than the amount of the settlement offer and not where the plaintiff loses outright.  Ibid. (citing Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, \n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346, \n352 (1981)\n).  Because the District Court had not entered judgment in favor of Marx, the court concluded that costs were not allowed under Rule 68(d).  668 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1182.  Nevertheless, the court found that costs were allowed under Rule 54(d)(1), which grants district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing parties unless a federal statute or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide otherwise.  Id., at 1178, 1182.  After describing the \xe2\x80\x9cvenerable\xe2\x80\x9d presumption that prevailing parties are entitled to costs, id., at 1179, the court concluded that nothing in the text, history, or purpose of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) indicated that it was meant to displace Rule 54(d)(1), id., at 1178\xe2\x80\x931182.  Judge Lucero dissented, arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only sensible reading of [\xc2\xa71692k(a)(3)] is that the district court may only award costs to a defendant\xe2\x80\x9d upon finding that the action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment and that to read it otherwise rendered the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cand costs\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.

Because the Rule grants district courts discretion to award costs, a statute is contrary to the Rule if it limits that discretion.  A statute may limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s dis- cretion in several ways, and it need not expressly state that it is displacing Rule 54(d)(1) to do so.  For instance, a statute providing that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs shall not be liable for costs\xe2\x80\x9d is contrary to Rule 54(d)(1) because it precludes a court from awarding costs to prevailing defendants.  See, e.g., \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718(d)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the district court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, a statute providing that plaintiffs may recover costs only under certain conditions is contrary to Rule 54(d) because it precludes a court from awarding costs to prevailing plaintiffs when those conditions have not been satisfied.  See, e.g., \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71928 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o costs shall be included in such judgment, unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tImportantly, not all statutes that provide for costs are contrary to Rule 54(d)(1).  A statute providing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court may award costs to the prevailing party,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, is not contrary to the Rule because it does not limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  See 10 Moore\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa754.101[1][c], at 54\xe2\x80\x93159 (\xe2\x80\x9cA number of statutes state simply that the court may award costs in its discretion.

Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (hereinafter Brief for United States).  The United States relies on the original 1937 version of Rule 54(d)(1), which provided, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 12 (quoting Rule).

App., p. 734 (2006 ed., Supp. V).  Accordingly, the United States asserts that any \xe2\x80\x9cexpress provision\xe2\x80\x9d for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe are not persuaded, however, that the original version of Rule 54(d) should be interpreted as Marx and the United States suggest.  The original language was meant to ensure that Rule 54(d) did not displace existing costs provisions that were contrary to the Rule.  Under the prior language, statutes that simply permitted a court to award costs did not displace the Rule.  See 6 J. Moore, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Practice \xc2\xa754.71[1], p. 54\xe2\x80\x93304 (2d ed. 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen permissive language is used [in a statute regarding costs] the district court may, pursuant to Rule 54(d), exercise a sound discretion relative to the allowance of costs\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, statutes had to set forth a standard for awarding costs that was different from Rule 54(d)(1) in order to displace the Rule.  See Friedman v. Ganassi, 853 F.\xc2\xa02d 207, 210 (CA3 1988) (holding that \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777k(e) is not an \xe2\x80\x9cexpress provision\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 54(d) because it does not provide an \xe2\x80\x9calternative standard\xe2\x80\x9d for awarding taxable costs).  The original version of Rule 54(d) is consistent with our conclusion that a statute must be contrary to Rule 54(d)(1) in order to displace it.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe now turn to whether \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) is contrary to Rule 54(d)(1).

In its view, Congress intended \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) to deter plaintiffs from bringing nuisance lawsuits.  It, therefore, expressly provided that when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs to the defendant.  The statute does address this type of case\xe2\x80\x94i.e., cases in which the plaintiff brings the action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.  But it is silent where bad faith and purpose of harassment are absent, and silence does not displace the background rule that a court has discretion to award costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMarx and the United States take the contrary view.  They concede that the language does not expressly limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs under Rule 54(d)(1), Brief for Petitioner 10; Brief for United States 19, but argue that it does so by negative implication.  Invoking the expressio unius canon of statutory construction, they contend that by specifying that a court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs when an action is brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, Congress intended to preclude a court from awarding fees and costs when bad faith and purpose of harassment are absent.  They further argue that unless \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis on which a court may award costs, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cand costs\xe2\x80\x9d would be superfluous.  According to this argument, Congress would have had no reason to specify that a court may award costs when a plaintiff brings an action in bad faith if it could have nevertheless awarded costs under Rule 54(d)(1).  Finally, the United States argues that \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) is a more specific cost statute that displaces Rule 54(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s more general rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe context surrounding \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) persuades us that GRC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is correct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe argument of Marx and the United States depends critically on whether \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s allowance of costs creates a negative implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.  The force of any negative implication, however, depends on context.  We have long held that the expressio unius canon does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cunless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149, \n168 (2003)\n, and that the canon can be overcome by \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Vonn, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55, \n65 (2002)\n.  In this case, context persuades us that Congress did not intend \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from awarding costs under Rule 54(d)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the background presumptions governing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs are a highly relevant contextual feature. As already explained, under Rule 54(d)(1) a prevailing party is entitled to recover costs from the losing party unless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or a court order \xe2\x80\x9cprovides otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  The opposite presumption exists with respect to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9cbedrock principle known as the \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach litigant pays his own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hardt, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680, \n683 (1983)\n).  Notwithstanding the American Rule, however, we have long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in a narrow set of circumstances, including when a party brings an action in bad faith.  See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 32\n\xe2\x80\x9346 (1991) (explaining that a court has inherent power to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a party whose litigation efforts directly benefit others, to sanction the willful disobedience of a court order, and to sanction a party who has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons); Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, \n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 240\n\xe2\x80\x93259 (1975) (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is undisputed that \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) leaves the background rules for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees intact.  The statute provides that when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith, the court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the defendant.  But, as noted, a court has inherent power to award fees based on a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s bad faith even without \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3).  See Chambers, supra, at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  Because \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) codifies the background rule for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, it is dubious to infer congressional intent to override the background rule with respect to costs.  The statute is best read as codifying a court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing authority to award both attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNext, the second sentence of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) must be understood in light of the sentence that precedes it.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The first sentence of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) provides that defendants who violate the FDCPA are liable for the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  The second sentence of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) similarly provides that plaintiffs who bring an action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment may be liable for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf Congress had excluded \xe2\x80\x9cand costs\xe2\x80\x9d in the second sen- tence, plaintiffs might have argued that the expression of costs in the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the second meant that defendants could only recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith.  By adding \xe2\x80\x9cand costs\xe2\x80\x9d to the second sentence, Congress foreclosed that argument, thereby removing any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith.

These statutes confirm that Congress knows how to limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion under Rule 54(d)(1) when it so desires.  See Small v.

Both Marx and the United States admit that a court has inherent power to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a defendant when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith.  Because there was, consequently, no need for Congress to specify that courts have this power, \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) is superfluous insofar as it addresses attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.

Marx and the United States contend that Congress intended to limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants because FDCPA plaintiffs are often poor and may be deterred from challenging unlawful debt collection practices by the possibility of being held liable for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s costs.

Although the instruction to take the medication in the morning is not incompatible with taking it twice a day\xe2\x80\x94it could be taken in the evening as well\xe2\x80\x94an ordinary English speaker would interpret \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d to mean that the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s more specific instructions entirely supersede what is printed on the bottle.  Rule 54(d)(1) is just the same: Its default is supplanted whenever Congress provides more specific instructions, not only when they are diametrically opposed to it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, the straightforward question in this case is whether \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) implements a \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d standard with respect to costs than Rule 54(d)(1), and so \xe2\x80\x9cprovides otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  As relevant, \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) states: \xe2\x80\x9cOn a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is readily apparent that this provision is different from the default of Rule 54(d)(1).  In \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3), Congress described with specificity a single circumstance in which costs may be awarded.  Far from merely restating a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs, this provision imposes a prerequisite to the exercise of that discretion: a finding by the court that an action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the text is plain, there is no need to proceed any further.  Even so, relevant canons of statutory interpretation lend added support to reading \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) as having a negative implication.  That reading accords with the expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon, which instructs that when Congress includes one possibility in a statute, it excludes another by implication.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Echazabal, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 73\n\xe2\x80\x9381 (2002).  This rule reinforces what the text makes clear.  By limiting a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs to cases brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, Congress foreclosed the award of costs in other circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute is also strongly favored by the rule that statutes should be read to avoid superfluity.  Under this \xe2\x80\x9cmost basic of interpretative canons, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[a] statute should be constructed so that effect is given to all of its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Corley v. United States, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303, \n314 (2009)\n (quoting Hibbs v. Winn, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 88, \n101 (2004)\n).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reading, as it mostly acknowledges, renders the entire sentence meaningless because it reiterates powers that federal courts already possess with respect to both costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  See Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9324.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority rejects this argument, citing the rule that this canon \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13 (quoting Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12)).  In its view, neither of the available interpretations can eliminate superfluity because the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees provision is redundant under any reading.  Ante, at 13.  But the canon against super- fluity surely counsels against an interpretation that renders the entire provision at issue superfluous when a competing interpretation would at least render part of the provision meaningful.  Nor does the majority\xe2\x80\x99s observation that redundancy is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hardly unusual,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14, in provisions relating to costs make the canon inapplicable.  While Congress sometimes drafts redundant language with respect to costs, Congress did not do so in \xc2\xa71692(a)(3).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Instead, it drafted specific language that permits a court to award costs only on the satisfaction of a condition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInterpreting \xc2\xa71692k(1)(3) as having a negative implication is consistent with our construction of another statute that includes similar language.  In Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157, \n166 (2004)\n (opinion for the Court by Thomas, J.), we considered a provision in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79613(f)(1) that provided: \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person may seek contribution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. during .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any civil action under section 9606 of this title\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  We rejected the argument that the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d indicated that \xe2\x80\x9cduring a civil action\xe2\x80\x9d was one but not the exclusive circumstance in which the right of contribution was available.  543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 166.  We instead adopted the natural reading of the text, holding that a party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to seek contribution was limited by the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cduring any civil action\xe2\x80\x9d and that contribution was only available while a lawsuit is pending.  Ibid.  The same logic applies here, because \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) imposes a closely analogous condition on a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to award costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t The first sentence of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) underscores that Congress implemented a different rule than Rule 54(d)(1).  That sentence provides that a debt collector who violates the FDCPA is \xe2\x80\x9cliable to\xe2\x80\x9d a prevailing plaintiff for \xe2\x80\x9cthe costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as determined by the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  This sentence makes a losing defendant always liable for the \xe2\x80\x9ccosts of the action,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a clear departure from the Rule 54(d)(1) discretionary default.  Cf. Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4).  Because Congress deviated from Rule 54(d)(1) in the first sentence of \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3), the most reasonable reading is that the sentence that immediately follows, which states the rule for prevailing defendants, takes a similar path.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority believes that its reading of the costs provision follows from the first sentence as well, but for a different reason.  Ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  It suggests that if Congress had not included costs in the second sentence, a plaintiff might have been able to argue that the inclusion of costs in the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the second indicated that defendants could recover only fees when an action is brought in bad faith.  The majority then speculates that Congress included costs in the second sentence to foreclose that argument.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text of the previous sentence makes plain, however, that the second sentence departs from the Rule 54(d)(1) default, and the majority offers no evidence in support of its supposition that Congress intended a different meaning.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Moreover, I see no basis for invoking potential confusion or indulging in speculation to explain away the words Congress chose.  Ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Some Members of the majority have expressed doubt about the relevance of legislative history, claiming that relying upon it is analogous to \xe2\x80\x9centering a crowded cocktail party and looking .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for one\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\xe2\x80\x9d Conroy v. Aniskoff, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 511, \n519 (1993)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  But speculating whole cloth about congressional intent, as the majority does, is surely more problematic.  The majority is saved the trouble of having to look for its friends at the party; it simply invites them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tReduced to its essence, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis turns on reading \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) in the context of what it calls the \xe2\x80\x9cvenerable presumption\xe2\x80\x9d that prevailing parties are entitled to costs.  See ante, at 4.  Even if it were appropriate to consider a background presumption rather than reading the plain text at issue, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the presumption is at best incomplete.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the presumption regarding costs is a \xe2\x80\x9cvenerable\xe2\x80\x9d one in American law is an overstatement.  Ibid.  It is true, as the majority points out, that prior to the federal rules, \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing parties were entitled to costs as of right in actions at law while courts had discretion to award costs in equity proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 4, n.\xc2\xa03; see Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa72665, at 199.  But the doctrine governing costs at law carved out an important exception for statutory provisions that set forth a differ- ent rule.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Where there was such a statute, courts would simply apply it.  In its assessment of the background principles underlying its approach, the majority glosses over the longstanding expectation that Congress often enacts different rules with respect to costs, and when it does, these rules govern.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Rule 54(d)(1) embraces this long-recognized exception because it specifies that a statute can displace its default rule.  To repeat, Rule 54(d)(1) merely enacts a default standard that applies unless, among other things, a statute or rule \xe2\x80\x9cprovides otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here, for the reasons explained, Congress enacted exactly such a statute.  That is clear from the text, because \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) conditions the award of costs on the satisfaction of a condition, and because the previous sentence of the same provision breaks from the default.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plain text of Rule 54(d)(1) and \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) dictates the result in this case.  Accordingly, I would reverse the Tenth Circuit and hold that \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) \xe2\x80\x9cprovides otherwise\xe2\x80\x9d than Rule 54(d)(1), such that a district court cannot award costs to a prevailing defendant in an FDCPA action except upon a showing that the action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.
