When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s website.  Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show.  A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet.  A server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved.  The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners, who are television producers, marketers, distributors, and broadcasters that own the copyrights in many of the programs that Aereo streams, sued Aereo for copyright infringement.

In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.,\n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 390\n, the Court determined that a CATV provider was more like a viewer than a broadcaster, because its system \xe2\x80\x9cno more than enhances the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to receive the broadcaster\xe2\x80\x99s signals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s television set.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 399.  Therefore, the Court concluded, a CATV provider did not perform publicly.  The Court reached the same determination in respect to a CATV provider that retransmitted signals from hundreds of miles away in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 394\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe reception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court said.  Id., at 408.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (2)\xc2\xa0In 1976, Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to reject the Fortnightly and Teleprompter holdings.  The Act now clarifies that to \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d an audiovisual work means \xe2\x80\x9cto show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  Thus, both the broadcaster and the viewer \xe2\x80\x9cperform,\xe2\x80\x9d because they both show a television program\xe2\x80\x99s images and make audible the program\xe2\x80\x99s sounds.  Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which specifies that an entity performs when it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Clause makes clear that an entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even when it simply enhances viewers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to receive broadcast television signals.  Congress further created a complex licensing scheme that sets out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts to the public.  \xc2\xa7111.  Congress made all three of these changes to bring cable system activities within the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (3)\xc2\xa0Because Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s activities are substantially similar to those of the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach, Aereo is not simply an equipment provider.  Aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are copyrighted, virtually as they are being broadcast.  Aereo uses its own equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users\xe2\x80\x99 homes.  By means of its technology, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system \xe2\x80\x9creceive[s] programs that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by private channels to additional viewers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fortnightly, supra, at 400.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This Court recognizes one particular difference between Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter: The systems in those cases transmitted constantly, whereas Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.  In other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers, a user\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the operation of the provider\xe2\x80\x99s equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the Act.  But given Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming likeness to the cable companies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0Aereo also performs petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 works \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the Clause, an entity performs a work publicly when it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a per-formance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the work .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  What performance, if any, does Aereo transmit?  Petitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of their works, whereas Aereo says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of transmitting.  This Court assumes arguendo that Aereo is correct and thus assumes, for present purposes, that to transmit a performance of an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumed definition, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        What about the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s further requirement that Aereo transmit a performance \xe2\x80\x9cto the public\xe2\x80\x9d?  Aereo claims that because it transmits from user-specific copies, using individually-assigned antennas, and because each transmission is available to only one subscriber, it does not transmit a performance \xe2\x80\x9cto the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Viewed in terms of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory objectives, these behind-the-scenes technological differences do not distinguish Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system from cable systems, which do perform publicly.  Congress would as much have intended to protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as from those of cable companies.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The text of the Clause effectuates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Under the Clause, an entity may transmit a performance through multiple transmissions, where the performance is of the same work.  Thus when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance\xe2\x80\x9d to them, irrespective of the number of discrete communications it makes and irrespective of whether it transmits using a single copy of the work or, as Aereo does, using an individual personal copy for each viewer. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  This is because Aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other.  In addition, neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers receive performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works.  This is relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people, whether they constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x9d often depends upon their relationship to the underlying work.  Finally, the statute makes clear that the fact that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations is of no consequence.  Aereo transmits a performance of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 works \xe2\x80\x9cto the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0Given the limited nature of this holding, the Court does not believe its decision will discourage the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.

Much of this programming is made up of copyrighted works.  Aereo neither owns the copyright in those works nor holds a license from the copyright owners to perform those works publicly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system is made up of servers, transcoders, and thousands of dime-sized antennas housed in a central warehouse.  It works roughly as follows: First, when a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently being broadcast, he visits Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s website and selects, from a list of the local programming, the show he wishes to see.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, one of Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s servers selects an antenna, which it dedicates to the use of that subscriber (and that subscriber alone) for the duration of the selected show.  A server then tunes the antenna to the over-the-air broadcast carrying the show.  The antenna begins to receive the broadcast, and an Aereo transcoder translates the sig-nals received into data that can be transmitted over the Internet.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Third, rather than directly send the data to the subscriber, a server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s hard drive.  In other words, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system creates a subscriber-specific copy\xe2\x80\x94that is, a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d copy\xe2\x80\x94of the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s program of choice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Fourth, once several seconds of programming have been saved, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s server begins to stream the saved copy of the show to the subscriber over the Internet.  (The subscriber may instead direct Aereo to stream the program at a later time, but that aspect of Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s service is not before us.)  The subscriber can watch the streamed program on the screen of his personal computer, tablet, smart phone, Internet-connected television, or other Internet-connected device.  The streaming continues, a mere few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.  See A Dictionary of Computing 494 (6th ed. 2008) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cstreaming\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he process of providing a steady flow of audio or video data so that an Internet user is able to access it as it is transmitted\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Aereo emphasizes that the data that its system streams to each subscriber are the data from his own personal copy, made from the broadcast signals received by the particular antenna allotted to him.  Its system does not transmit data saved in one subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s folder to any other subscriber.  When two subscribers wish to watch the same program, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system activates two separate antennas and saves two separate copies of the program in two separate folders.  It then streams the show to the subscribers through two separate transmissions\xe2\x80\x94each from the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s personal copy.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners are television producers, marketers, distributors, and broadcasters who own the copyrights in many of the programs that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system streams to its subscribers.  They brought suit against Aereo for copyright infringement in Federal District Court.

Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed.  WNET, Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 712 F.\xc2\xa03d 676 (2013) (citing Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.\xc2\xa03d 121 (2008)).  In the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, Aereo does not perform publicly within the meaning of the Transmit Clause because it does not transmit \xe2\x80\x9cto the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, each time Aereo streams a program to a subscriber, it sends a private transmission that is avail-able only to that subscriber.  The Second Circuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of two judges.  WNET, Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 722 F.\xc2\xa03d 500 (2013).

And second, if so, does Aereo do so \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly\xe2\x80\x9d?

See \xc2\xa7106(4) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he owner of [a] copyright .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has the exclusive righ[t] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to perform the copyrighted work publicly\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa7101 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo perform .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a work \xe2\x80\x98publicly\xe2\x80\x99 means [among other things] to transmit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the work .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the public .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Phrased another way, does Aereo \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance\xe2\x80\x9d when a subscriber watches a show using Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system, or is it only the subscriber who transmits?  In Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s view, it does not perform.  It does no more than supply equipment that \xe2\x80\x9cemulate[s] the operation of a home antenna and [digital video recorder (DVR)].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 41.  Like a home antenna and DVR, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s equipment simply responds to its subscribers\xe2\x80\x99 directives.  So it is only the subscribers who \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d when they use Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s equipment to stream television programs to themselves.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Considered alone, the language of the Act does not clearly indicate when an entity \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d) and when it merely supplies equipment that allows others to do so.  But when read in light of its purpose, the Act is unmistakable: An entity that engages in activities like Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s performs.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        History makes plain that one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 primary purposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to overturn this Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that community antenna television (CATV) systems (the precursors of modern cable systems) fell outside the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.,\n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 390 (1968)\n, the Court considered a CATV system that carried local television broadcasting, much of which was copyrighted, to its subscribers in two cities.  The CATV provider placed antennas on hills above the cities and used coaxial cables to carry the signals received by the antennas to the home television sets of its subscribers.  The system amplified and modulated the signals in order to improve their strength and efficiently transmit them to subscribers.  A subscriber \xe2\x80\x9ccould choose any of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on his own television set.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 392.  The CATV provider \xe2\x80\x9cneither edited the programs received nor originated any programs of its own.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Asked to decide whether the CATV provider infringed copyright holders\xe2\x80\x99 exclusive right to perform their works publicly, the Court held that the provider did not \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  See\n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71(c) (1964 ed.) (granting copyright holder the exclusive right to \xe2\x80\x9cperform .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in public for profit\xe2\x80\x9d a nondramatic literary work), \xc2\xa71(d) (granting copyright holder the exclusive right to \xe2\x80\x9cperform .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. publicly\xe2\x80\x9d a dramatic work).  The Court drew a line: \xe2\x80\x9cBroadcasters perform.  Viewers do not perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 398 (footnote omitted).  And a CATV provider \xe2\x80\x9cfalls on the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s side of the line.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 399.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court reasoned that CATV providers were unlike broadcasters:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cBroadcasters select the programs to be viewed; CATV systems simply carry, without editing, whatever programs they receive.  Broadcasters procure programs and propagate them to the public; CATV systems receive programs that have been released to the public and carry them by private channels to additional viewers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 400.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, CATV providers were more like viewers, for \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic function [their] equipment serves is little different from that served by the equipment generally furnished by\xe2\x80\x9d viewers.  Id., at 399. \xe2\x80\x9cEssentially,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court said, \xe2\x80\x9ca CATV system no more than enhances the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s capac-ity to receive the broadcaster\xe2\x80\x99s signals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s television set.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Viewers do not become performers by using \xe2\x80\x9camplifying equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d and a CATV provider should not be treated differently for providing viewers the same equipment.  Id., at 398\xe2\x80\x93400.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 394 (1974)\n, the Court considered the copyright liability of a CATV provider that carried broadcast television programming into subscribers\xe2\x80\x99 homes from hundreds of miles away.  Although the Court recognized that a viewer might not be able to afford amplifying equipment that would provide access to those distant signals, it nonetheless found that the CATV provider was more like a viewer than a broadcaster.  Id., at 408\xe2\x80\x93409.  It explained: \xe2\x80\x9cThe reception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 408.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court also recognized that the CATV system exercised some measure of choice over what to transmit.  But that fact did not transform the CATV system into a broadcaster.  A broadcaster exercises significant creativity in choosing what to air, the Court reasoned.  Id., at 410.  In contrast, the CATV provider makes an initial choice about which broadcast stations to retransmit, but then \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98simply carr[ies], without editing, whatever programs [it] receive[s].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Fortnightly, supra, at 400 (altera-tions in original)).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 1976 Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to reject the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x931476, pp. 86\xe2\x80\x9387 (1976) (hereinafter H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.) (The 1976 amendments \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely overturned\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrow construction of the Act in Fortnightly and Teleprompter).  Congress enacted new language that erased the Court\xe2\x80\x99s line between broadcaster and viewer, in respect to \xe2\x80\x9cperform[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a work.  The amended statute clarifies that to \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d an audiovisual work means \xe2\x80\x9cto show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101; see ibid. (defining \xe2\x80\x9c[a]udiovisual works\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cworks that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , together with accompanying sounds\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under this new language, both the broadcaster and the viewer of a television program \xe2\x80\x9cperform,\xe2\x80\x9d because they both show the program\xe2\x80\x99s images and make audible the program\xe2\x80\x99s sounds.  See H. R. Rep., at 63 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] broadcasting network is performing when it transmits [a singer\xe2\x80\x99s performance of a song] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and any individual is performing whenever he or she .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which specifies that an entity performs publicly when it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101; see ibid. (defining \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o \xe2\x80\x98transmit\xe2\x80\x99 a performance\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cable system activities, like those of the CATV systems in Fortnightly and Teleprompter, lie at the heart of the activities that Congress intended this language to cover.  See H. R. Rep., at 63 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] cable television system is perform-ing when it retransmits [a network] broadcast to its subscribers\xe2\x80\x9d); see also ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he concep[t] of public performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cover[s] not only the initial rendition or showing, but also any further act by which that rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Clause thus makes clear that an entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even if when doing so, it simply enhances viewers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to receive broadcast television signals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress further created a new section of the Act to regulate cable companies\xe2\x80\x99 public performances of copyrighted works.  See \xc2\xa7111.  Section 111 creates a complex, highly detailed compulsory licensing scheme that sets out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 88 (Section 111 is primarily \xe2\x80\x9cdirected at the operation of cable television systems and the terms and conditions of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress made these three changes to achieve a similar end: to bring the activities of cable systems within the scope of the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This history makes clear that Aereo is not simply an equipment provider.  Rather, Aereo, and not just its subscribers, \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s activities are substantially similar to those of the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach.  See id., at 89 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]able systems are commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are based on the carriage of copyrighted program material\xe2\x80\x9d).  Aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are copyrighted, almost as they are being broadcast.  In providing this service, Aereo uses its own equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users\xe2\x80\x99 homes.  By means of its technology (antennas, transcoders, and servers), Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system \xe2\x80\x9creceive[s] programs that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by private channels to additional viewers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fortnightly, 392 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 400.  It \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ies] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whatever programs [it] receive[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and it offers \xe2\x80\x9call the programming\xe2\x80\x9d of each over-the-air station it carries.  Id., at 392, 400.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s equipment may serve a \xe2\x80\x9cviewer function\xe2\x80\x9d; it may enhance the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to receive a broadcaster\xe2\x80\x99s programs.  It may even emulate equipment a viewer could use at home.  But the same was true of the equipment that was before the Court, and ultimately before Congress, in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We recognize, and Aereo and the dissent emphasize, one particular difference between Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.  The systems in those cases transmitted constantly; they sent continuous programming to each subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s television set.  In contrast, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.  Only at that moment, in automatic response to the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s request, does Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system activate an antenna and begin to transmit the requested program.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This is a critical difference, says the dissent.  It means that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers, not Aereo, \xe2\x80\x9cselec[t] the copy-righted content\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cperform[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 4 (opinion of Scalia,\xc2\xa0J.), and for that reason they, not Aereo, \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit\xe2\x80\x9d the performance.  Aereo is thus like \xe2\x80\x9ca copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 5.  A copy shop is not directly liable whenever a patron uses the shop\xe2\x80\x99s machines to \xe2\x80\x9creproduce\xe2\x80\x9d copyrighted materials found in that library.  See \xc2\xa7106(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cexclusive righ[t] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to reproduce the copyrighted work\xe2\x80\x9d).  And by the same token, Aereo should not be directly liable whenever its patrons use its equipment to \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit\xe2\x80\x9d copyrighted television programs to their screens.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In our view, however, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s copy shop argument, in whatever form, makes too much out of too little.  Given Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming likeness to the cable companies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here.  The subscribers of the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cable systems also selected what programs to display on their receiving sets.  Indeed, as we explained in Fortnightly, such a subscriber \xe2\x80\x9ccould choose any of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on his own television set.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 392.  The same is true of an Aereo subscriber.  Of course, in Fortnightly the television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the screen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.  Here the signals pursue their ordinary course of travel through the universe until today\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cturn of the knob\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a click on a website\xe2\x80\x94activates machinery that intercepts and reroutes them to Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers over the Internet.  But this difference means nothing to the subscriber.  It means nothing to the broadcaster.  We do not see how this single difference, invisible to subscriber and broadcaster alike, could transform a system that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable system into \xe2\x80\x9ca copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers, a user\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the operation of the provider\xe2\x80\x99s equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the Act.  But the many similarities between Aereo and cable companies, considered in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic purposes in amending the Copyright Act, convince us that this difference is not critical here.  We conclude that Aereo is not just an equipment supplier and that Aereo \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Next, we must consider whether Aereo performs petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 works \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly,\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Transmit Clause.  Under the Clause, an entity performs a work publicly when it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the work .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  Aereo denies that it satisfies this definition.  It reasons as follows: First, the \xe2\x80\x9cperformance\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d is the performance created by its act of transmitting.  And second, because each of these performances is capable of being received by one and only one subscriber, Aereo transmits privately, not pub-licly.  Even assuming Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s first argument is correct, its second does not follow.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We begin with Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s first argument.  What performance does Aereo transmit?  Under the Act, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o \xe2\x80\x98transmit\xe2\x80\x99 a performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o \xe2\x80\x98perform\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d an audiovisual work means \xe2\x80\x9cto show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of their works.  Thus when Aereo retransmits a network\xe2\x80\x99s prior broadcast, the underlying broadcast (itself a performance) is the performance that Aereo transmits.  Aereo, as discussed above, says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of transmitting.  That performance comes into existence when Aereo streams the sounds and images of a broadcast program to a subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s screen.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We assume arguendo that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s first argument is correct.  Thus, for present purposes, to transmit a performance of (at least) an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.  Cf. United States v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers, 627 F. 3d 64, 73 (CA2 2010) (holding that a download of a work is not a performance because the data transmitted are not \xe2\x80\x9ccontemporaneously perceptible\xe2\x80\x9d).  When an Aereo subscriber selects a program to watch, Aereo streams the program over the Internet to that subscriber.  Aereo thereby \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to the subscriber, by means of a \xe2\x80\x9cdevice or process,\xe2\x80\x9d the work\xe2\x80\x99s images and sounds.  \xc2\xa7101.  And those images and sounds are contemporaneously visible and audible on the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s computer (or other Internet-connected device).  So under our assumed definition, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But what about the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s further requirement that Aereo transmit a performance \xe2\x80\x9cto the public\xe2\x80\x9d?  As we have said, an Aereo subscriber receives broadcast television signals with an antenna dedicated to him alone.  Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system makes from those signals a personal copy of the selected program.  It streams the content of the copy to the same subscriber and to no one else.  One and only one subscriber has the ability to see and hear each Aereo transmission.  The fact that each transmission is to only one subscriber, in Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s view, means that it does not transmit a performance \xe2\x80\x9cto the public.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In terms of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, these differences do not distinguish Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system from cable systems, which do perform \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Viewed in terms of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regula-tory objectives, why should any of these technological differ-ences matter?  They concern the behind-the-scenes way in which Aereo delivers television programming to its viewers\xe2\x80\x99 screens.  They do not render Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s commercial objective any different from that of cable companies.  Nor do they significantly alter the viewing experience of Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers.  Why would a subscriber who wishes to watch a television show care much whether images and sounds are delivered to his screen via a large multisubscriber antenna or one small dedicated antenna, whether they arrive instantaneously or after a few seconds\xe2\x80\x99 delay, or whether they are transmitted directly or after a personal copy is made?  And why, if Aereo is right, could not modern CATV systems simply continue the same commercial and consumer-oriented activities, free of copyright restrictions, provided they substitute such new technologies for old?  Congress would as much have intended to protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as from those of cable companies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The text of the Clause effectuates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s argument to the contrary relies on the premise that \xe2\x80\x9cto transmit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance\xe2\x80\x9d means to make a single transmission.  But the Clause suggests that an entity may transmit a performance through multiple, discrete transmissions.  That is because one can \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicate\xe2\x80\x9d something through a set of actions.  Thus one can transmit a message to one\xe2\x80\x99s friends, irrespective of whether one sends separate identical e-mails to each friend or a single e-mail to all at once.  So can an elected official communicate an idea, slogan, or speech to her constituents, regardless of whether she communicates that idea, slogan, or speech during individual phone calls to each constituent or in a public square.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The fact that a singular noun (\xe2\x80\x9ca performance\xe2\x80\x9d) follows the words \xe2\x80\x9cto transmit\xe2\x80\x9d does not suggest the contrary.  One can sing a song to his family, whether he sings the same song one-on-one or in front of all together.  Similarly, one\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues may watch a performance of a particular play\xe2\x80\x94say, this season\xe2\x80\x99s modern-dress version of \xe2\x80\x9cMeasure for Measure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whether they do so at separate or at the same showings.  By the same principle, an entity may transmit a performance through one or several transmissions, where the performance is of the same work.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Transmit Clause must permit this interpretation, for it provides that one may transmit a performance to the public \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. receive it .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the same time or at different times.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  Were the words \xe2\x80\x9cto transmit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance\xe2\x80\x9d limited to a single act of communication, members of the public could not receive the performance communicated \xe2\x80\x9cat different times.\xe2\x80\x9d  Therefore, in light of the purpose and text of the Clause, we conclude that when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it transmits a performance to them regardless of the number of discrete communications it makes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We do not see how the fact that Aereo transmits via personal copies of programs could make a difference.  The Act applies to transmissions \xe2\x80\x9cby means of any device or process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  And retransmitting a television program using user-specific copies is a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d of transmitting a performance.  A \xe2\x80\x9ccop[y]\xe2\x80\x9d of a work is simply a \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial objec[t] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which a work is fixed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  So whether Aereo transmits from the same or separate copies, it performs the same work; it shows the same images and makes audible the same sounds.  Therefore, when Aereo streams the same television program to multiple subscribers, it \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a performance\xe2\x80\x9d to all of them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits television programs constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible imagesand sounds to a large number of people who are unre-lated and unknown to each other.  This matters because, although the Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9cthe public,\xe2\x80\x9d it specifies that an entity performs publicly when it performs at \xe2\x80\x9cany place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Act thereby suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x9d consists of a large group of people outside of a family and friends.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Neither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers receive performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works.  This is relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people, whether they constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x9d often depends upon their relationship to the underlying work.  When, for example, a valet parking attendant returns cars to their drivers, we would not say that the parking service provides cars \xe2\x80\x9cto the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  We would say that it provides the cars to their owners.  We would say that a car dealership, on the other hand, does provide cars to the public, for it sells cars to individuals who lack a pre-existing relationship to the cars.  Similarly, an entity that transmits a performance to individuals in their capacities as owners or possessors does not perform to \xe2\x80\x9cthe public,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas an entity like Aereo that transmits to large numbers of paying subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the works does so perform.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, we note that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations.  This fact does not help Aereo, however, for the Transmit Clause expressly provides that an entity may perform publicly \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In other words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x9d need not be situated together, spatially or temporally.  For these reasons, we conclude that Aereo transmits a performance of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 copyrighted works to the public, within the meaning of the Transmit Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Aereo and many of its supporting amici argue that to apply the Transmit Clause to Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s conduct will impose copyright liability on other technologies, including new technologies, that Congress could not possibly have wanted to reach.  We agree that Congress, while intending the Transmit Clause to apply broadly to cable companies and their equivalents, did not intend to discourage or to control the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.  But we do not believe that our limited holding today will have that effect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For one thing, the history of cable broadcast transmissions that led to the enactment of the Transmit Clause informs our conclusion that Aereo \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s],\xe2\x80\x9d but it does not determine whether different kinds of providers in different contexts also \xe2\x80\x9cperform.\xe2\x80\x9d  For another, an entity only transmits a performance when it communicates contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds of a work.  See Brief for Respondent 31 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a distributor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sells [multiple copies of a digital video disc] by mail to consumers, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [its] distribution of the DVDs merely makes it possible for the recipients to perform the work themselves\xe2\x80\x94it is not a \xe2\x80\x98device or process\xe2\x80\x99 by which the distributor publicly performs the work\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Further, we have interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x9d to apply to a group of individuals acting as ordinary members of the public who pay primarily to watch broadcast television programs, many of which are copyrighted.  We have said that it does not extend to those who act as owners or possessors of the relevant product.  And we have not considered whether the public performance right is infringed when the user of a service pays primarily for something other than the transmission of copyrighted works, such as the remote storage of content.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (distinguishing cloud-based storage services because they \xe2\x80\x9coffer consumers more numerous and convenient means of playing back copies that the consumers have already lawfully acquired\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).  In addition, an entity does not trans-mit to the public if it does not transmit to a substantial number of people outside of a family and its social circle.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We also note that courts often apply a statute\xe2\x80\x99s highly general language in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes.  Finally, the doctrine of \xe2\x80\x9cfair use\xe2\x80\x9d can help to prevent inappropriate or inequitable applications of the Clause.  See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417 (1984)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We cannot now answer more precisely how the Transmit Clause or other provisions of the Copyright Act will apply to technologies not before us.  We agree with the Solicitor General that \xe2\x80\x9c[q]uestions involving cloud computing, [remote storage] DVRs, and other novel issues not before the Court, as to which \xe2\x80\x98Congress has not plainly marked [the] course,\xe2\x80\x99 should await a case in which they are squarely presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 34 (quoting Sony, supra, at 431 (alteration in original)).  And we note that, to the extent commercial actors or other interested entities may be concerned with the relationship between the development and use of such technologies and the Copyright Act, they are of course free to seek action from Congress.  Cf. Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7512.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In sum, having considered the details of Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s practices, we find them highly similar to those of the CATV systems in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.  And those are activities that the 1976 amendments sought to bring within the scope of the Copyright Act.  Insofar as there are differences, those differences concern not the nature of the service that Aereo provides so much as the technological manner in which it provides the service.  We conclude that those differences are not adequate to place Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s activities outside the scope of the Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For these reasons, we conclude that Aereo \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s]\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 copyrighted works \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly,\xe2\x80\x9d as those terms are defined by the Transmit Clause.  We therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970966">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 13\xe2\x80\x93461</p><p>_________________</p><p>AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC.,et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

Petitioners, a collection of television networks and affiliates (Networks), broadcast copyrighted programs on the public airwaves for all to see.  Aereo, respondent, operates an automated system that allows subscribers to receive, on Internet-connected devices, programs that they select, including the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 copyrighted programs.  The Networks sued Aereo for several forms of copyright infringement, but we are here concerned with a single claim: that Aereo violates the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive righ[t]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d their programs \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly.\xe2\x80\x9d17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7106(4).  That claim fails at the very outset because Aereo does not \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  The Court manages to reach the opposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted rules for service-provider liability and adopting in their place an improvised standard (\xe2\x80\x9clooks-like-cable-TV\xe2\x80\x9d) that will sow confusion for years to come.</p><p>I. Legal Standard</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        There are two types of liability for copyright infringement: direct and secondary.  As its name suggests, the former applies when an actor personally engages in infringing conduct.  See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417,433 (1984).  Secondary liability, by contrast, is a means of holding defendants responsible for infringement by third parties, even when the defendants \xe2\x80\x9chave not themselves engaged in the infringing activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 435.  It applies when a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally induc[es] or encourag[es]\xe2\x80\x9d infringing acts by others or profits from such acts \xe2\x80\x9cwhile declining to exercise a right to stop or limit [them].\xe2\x80\x9d  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,545 U. S. 913,930 (2005).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Most suits against equipment manufacturers and service providers involve secondary-liability claims.  For ex-ample, when movie studios sued to block the sale ofSony\xe2\x80\x99s Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR), they argued that Sony was liable because its customers were making unauthorized copies.  See Sony, supra, at 434\xe2\x80\x93435.  Record labels and movie studios relied on a similar theory when they sued Grokster and StreamCast, two providers of peer-to-peer file-sharing software.  See Grokster, supra, at 920\xe2\x80\x93921, 927.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        This suit, or rather the portion of it before us here, is fundamentally different.  The Networks claim that Aereo directly infringes their public-performance right.  Accordingly, the Networks must prove that Aereo \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s]\xe2\x80\x9d copyrighted works, \xc2\xa7106(4), when its subscribers log in, select a channel, and push the \xe2\x80\x9cwatch\xe2\x80\x9d button.  That process undoubtedly results in a performance; the question is who does the performing.  See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.\xc2\xa03d 121, 130 (CA2 2008).  If Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s subscribers perform but Aereo does not, the claim necessarily fails.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The Networks\xe2\x80\x99 claim is governed by a simple but profoundly important rule: A defendant may be held directly liable only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that violates the Act.  See 3 W. Patry, Copyright \xc2\xa79:5.50 (2013).  This requirement is firmly grounded in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, which defines \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d in active, affirmative terms: One \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a copyrighted \xe2\x80\x9caudiovisual work,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a movie or news broadcast, by \xe2\x80\x9cshow[ing] its images in any sequence\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] the sounds accompanying it audible.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  And since the Act makes it unlawful to copy or perform copyrighted works, not to copy or perform in general, see \xc2\xa7501(a), the volitional-act requirement demands conduct directed to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s copyrighted material, see Sony, supra, at 434.  Every Court of Appeals to have considered an automated-service provider\xe2\x80\x99s direct liability for copyright infringement has adopted that rule.  See Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network LLC, 747 F. 3d 1060, 1066\xe2\x80\x931068 (CA9 2014); Cartoon Network, supra, at 130\xe2\x80\x93131 (CA2 2008); CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F. 3d 544, 549\xe2\x80\x93550 (CA4 2004).[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  Although we have not opined on the issue, our cases are fully consistent with a volitional-conduct requirement.  For example, we gave several examples of direct infringement in Sony, each of which involved a volitional act directed to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s copyrighted material.  See 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 437, n.\xc2\xa018.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The volitional-conduct requirement is not at issue in most direct-infringement cases; the usual point of dispute is whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is infringing (e.g., Does the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s design copy the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s?), rather than whether the defendant has acted at all (e.g., Did this defendant create the infringing design?).  But it comes right to the fore when a direct-infringement claim is lodged against a defendant who does nothing more than operate an automated, user-controlled system.  See, e.g., Fox Broadcasting, supra, at 1067; Cartoon Network, supra, at 131.  Internet-service providers are a prime example.  When one user sends data to another, the provider\xe2\x80\x99s equipment facilitates the transfer automatically.  Does that mean that the provider is directly liable when the transmission happens to result in the \xe2\x80\x9creproduc[tion],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7106(1), of a copyrighted work?  It does not.  The provider\xe2\x80\x99s system is \xe2\x80\x9ctotally indifferent to the material\xe2\x80\x99s content,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas courts require \xe2\x80\x9csome aspect of volition\xe2\x80\x9d directed at the copyrighted material before direct liability may be imposed.  CoStar, 373 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 550\xe2\x80\x93551.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  The defendant may be held directly liable only if the defendant itself \xe2\x80\x9ctrespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright owner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 550.  Most of the time that issue will come down to who selects the copyrighted content: the defendant or its customers.  See Cartoon Network, supra, at131\xe2\x80\x93132.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        A comparison between copy shops and video-on-demand services illustrates the point.  A copy shop rents out photocopiers on a per-use basis.  One customer might copy his 10-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s drawings\xe2\x80\x94a perfectly lawful thing to do\xe2\x80\x94while another might duplicate a famous artist\xe2\x80\x99s copyrighted photographs\xe2\x80\x94a use clearly prohibited by \xc2\xa7106(1).  Either way, the customer chooses the content and activates the copying function; the photocopier does nothing except in response to the customer\xe2\x80\x99s commands.  Because the shop plays no role in selecting the content, it cannot be held directly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy.  See CoStar, supra, at 550.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Video-on-demand services, like photocopiers, respond automatically to user input, but they differ in one crucial respect: They choose the content.  When a user signs in to Netflix, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. movies [and] TV episodes\xe2\x80\x9d carefully curated by Netflix are \xe2\x80\x9cavailable to watch instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d  See How [D]oes Netflix [W]ork?, online at http://help.netflix.com/en/node/412 (as visited June 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  That selection and arrangement by the service provider constitutes a volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works and thus serves as a basis for direct liability.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The distinction between direct and secondary liability would collapse if there were not a clear rule for deter-mining whether the defendant committed the infringing act.  See Cartoon Network, 536 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 132\xe2\x80\x93133.  The volitional-conduct requirement supplies that rule; its purpose is not to excuse defendants from accountability, but to channel the claims against them into the correct analytical track.  See Brief for 36 Intellectual Property and Copyright Law Professors as Amici Curiae 7.  Thus, in the example given above, the fact that the copy shop does not choose the content simply means that its culpability will be assessed using secondary-liability rules rather than direct-liability rules.  See Sony, supra, at 434\xe2\x80\x93442; Cartoon Network, supra, at 132\xe2\x80\x93133.</p><p>II. Application to Aereo</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        So which is Aereo: the copy shop or the video-on-demand service?  In truth, it is neither.  Rather, it is akin to a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.  Aereo offers access to an automated system consisting of routers, servers, transcoders, and dime-sized antennae.  Like a photocopier or VCR, that system lies dormant until a subscriber activates it.  When a subscriber selects a program, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s system picks up the relevant broadcast signal, translates its audio and video components into digital data, stores the data in a user-specific file, and transmits that file\xe2\x80\x99s contents to the subscriber via the Internet\xe2\x80\x94at which point the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s laptop, tablet, or other device displays the broadcast just as an ordinary television would.  The result of that process fits the statutory definition of a performance to a tee: The subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s device \xe2\x80\x9cshow[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the broadcast\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimages\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmake[s] the sounds accompanying\xe2\x80\x9d the broadcast \xe2\x80\x9caudible.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101.  The only question is whether those performances are the product of Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s volitional conduct.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        They are not.  Unlike video-on-demand services, Aereo does not provide a prearranged assortment of movies and television shows.  Rather, it assigns each subscriber an antenna that\xe2\x80\x94like a library card\xe2\x80\x94can be used to obtain whatever broadcasts are freely available.  Some of those broadcasts are copyrighted; others are in the public domain.  The key point is that subscribers call all the shots: Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s automated system does not relay any program, copyrighted or not, until a subscriber selects the program and tells Aereo to relay it.  Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s operation of that system is a volitional act and a but-for cause of the resulting performances, but, as in the case of the copy shop, that degree of involvement is not enough for direct liability.  See Grokster, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 960 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he producer of a technology which permits unlawful copying does not himself engage in unlawful copying\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        In sum, Aereo does not \xe2\x80\x9cperform\xe2\x80\x9d for the sole and simple reason that it does not make the choice of content.  And because Aereo does not perform, it cannot be held directly liable for infringing the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 public-performance right.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  That conclusion does not necessarily mean that Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s service complies with the Copyright Act.  Quite the contrary.  The Networks\xe2\x80\x99 complaint alleges that Aereo is directly and secondarily liable for infringing their public-performance rights (\xc2\xa7106(4)) and also their reproduction rights (\xc2\xa7106(1)).  Their request for a preliminary injunction\xe2\x80\x94the only issue before this Court\xe2\x80\x94is based exclusively on the direct-liability portion of the public-performance claim (and further limited to Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwatch\xe2\x80\x9d function, as opposed to its \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d function).  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a\xe2\x80\x9361a.  Affirming the judgment below would merely return this case to the lower courts for consideration of the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 remaining claims.</p><p>III. Guilt By Resemblance</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Aereo performs boils down to the following syllogism: (1) Congress amended the Act to overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not perform when they retransmit over-the-air broadcasts;[<a href="#F4">4</a>] (2) Aereo looks a lot like a cable system; therefore (3) Aereo performs.  Ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x9310.  That reasoning suffers from a trio of defects.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        First, it is built on the shakiest of foundations.  Perceiving the text to be ambiguous, ante, at 4, the Court reaches out to decide the case based on a few isolated snippets of legislative history, ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (citing H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x931476 (1976)).  The Court treats those snippets as authoritative evidence of congressional intent even though they come from a single report issued by a committee whose members make up a small fraction of one of the two Houses of Congress.  Little else need be said here about the severe shortcomings of that interpretative methodology.  See Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in principal part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning fails on its own terms because there are material differences between the cable systems at issue in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 394 (1974), and Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.,392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 390 (1968), on the one hand and Aereo on the other.  The former (which were then known as community-antenna television systems) captured the full range of broadcast signals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all times, whereas Aereo transmits only specific programs selected by the user, at specific times selected by the user.  The Court acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes that it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not make a critical difference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  Even if that were true, the Court fails to account for other salient differences between the two technologies.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  Though cable systems started out essentially as dumb pipes that routed signals from point A to point B, see ante, at 5, by the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, that kind of service \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no longer exist[ed],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners in Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Teleprompter Corp., O. T. 1973, No. 72\xe2\x80\x931633, p. 22.  At the time of our Teleprompter decision, cable companies \xe2\x80\x9cperform[ed] the same functions as \xe2\x80\x98broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99 by deliberately selecting and importing distant signals, originating programs, [and] selling commercials,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 20, thus making them curators of content\xe2\x80\x94more akin to video-on-demand services than copy shops.  So far as the record reveals, Aereo does none of those things.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Third, and most importantly, even accepting that the 1976 amendments had as their purpose the overruling of our cable-TV cases, what they were meant to do and how they did it are two different questions\xe2\x80\x94and it is the latter that governs the case before us here.  The injury claimed is not violation of a law that says operations similar to cable TV are subject to copyright liability, but violation of \xc2\xa7106(4) of the Copyright Act.  And whatever soothing reasoning the Court uses to reach its result (\xe2\x80\x9cthis looks like cable TV\xe2\x80\x9d), the consequence of its holding is that someone who implements this technology \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under that provision.  That greatly disrupts settled jurisprudence which, before today, applied the straightforward, bright-line test of volitional conduct directed at the copyrighted work.  If that test is not outcome determinative in this case, presumably it is not outcome determinative elsewhere as well.  And it is not clear what the Court proposes to replace it.  Perhaps the Court means to adopt (invent, really) a two-tier version of the Copyright Act, one part of which applies to \xe2\x80\x9ccable companies and their equivalents\xe2\x80\x9d while the other governs everyone else.  Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 16.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The rationale for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ad\xc2\xa0hoc rule for cable-system lookalikes is so broad that it renders nearly a third of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion superfluous.  Part II of the opinion concludes that Aereo performs because it resembles a cable company, and Congress amended the Act in 1976 \xe2\x80\x9cto bring the activities of cable systems within [its] scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  Part III of the opinion purports to address separately the question whether Aereo performs \xe2\x80\x9cpub-licly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9315.  Trouble is, that question cannot remain open if Congress\xe2\x80\x99s supposed intent to regulate whatever looks like a cable company must be given legal effect (as the Court says in Part II).  The Act reaches only public performances, see \xc2\xa7106(4), so Congress could not have regulated \xe2\x80\x9cthe activities of cable systems\xe2\x80\x9d without deeming their retransmissions public performances.  The upshot is this: If Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s similarity to a cable company means that it performs, then by necessity that same characteristic means that it does so publicly, and Part III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion discusses an issue that is no longer relevant\xe2\x80\x94though discussing it certainly gives the opinion the \xe2\x80\x9cfeel\xe2\x80\x9d of real textual analysis.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Making matters worse, the Court provides no criteria for determining when its cable-TV-lookalike rule applies.  Must a defendant offer access to live television to qualify?  If similarity to cable-television service is the measure, then the answer must be yes.  But consider the implications of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly what it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory time shifting into its \xe2\x80\x9cwatch\xe2\x80\x9d function.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  Aereo would not be providing live television if it made subscribers wait to tune in until after a show\xe2\x80\x99s live broadcast ended.  A subscriber could watch the 7 p.m. airing of a 1-hour program any time after 8 p.m.  Assuming the Court does not intend to adopt such a do-nothing rule (though it very well may), there must be some other means of identifying who is and is not subject to its guilt-by-resemblance regime.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        Two other criteria come to mind.  One would cover any automated service that captures and stores live television broadcasts at a user\xe2\x80\x99s direction.  That can\xe2\x80\x99t be right, since it is exactly what remote storage digital video recorders (RS\xe2\x80\x93DVRs) do, see Cartoon Network, 536 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 124\xe2\x80\x93125, and the Court insists that its \xe2\x80\x9climited holding\xe2\x80\x9d does not decide the fate of those devices, ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  The other potential benchmark is the one offered by the Government: The cable-TV-lookalike rule embraces any entity that \xe2\x80\x9coperates an integrated system, substantially dependent on physical equipment that is used in common by [its] subscribers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.  The Court sensibly avoids that approach because it would sweep in Internet service providers and a host of other entities that quite obviously do not perform.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        That leaves as the criterion of cable-TV-resemblance nothing but th\xe2\x80\x99ol\xe2\x80\x99 totality-of-the-circumstances test (which is not a test at all but merely assertion of an intent to perform test-free, ad\xc2\xa0hoc, case-by-case evaluation).  It will take years, perhaps decades, to determine which automated systems now in existence are governed by the tradi-tional volitional-conduct test and which get the Aereo treatment.  (And automated systems now in contemplation will have to take their chances.)  The Court vows that its ruling will not affect cloud-storage providers and cable-television systems, see ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, but it cannot deliver on that promise given the imprecision of its result-driven rule.  Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s makeshift approach will become apparent in this very case.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision addresses the legality of Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwatch\xe2\x80\x9d function, which provides nearly contemporaneous access to live broadcasts.  On remand, one of the first questions the lower courts will face is whether Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d function, which allows subscribers to save a program while it is airing and watch it later, infringes the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 public-performance right.  The volitional-conduct rule provides a clear answer to that question: Because Aereo does not select the programs viewed by its users, it does not perform.  But it is impossible to say how the issue will come out under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, since cable companies did not offer remote recording and playback services when Congress amended the Copyright Act in 1976.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        I share the Court\xe2\x80\x99s evident feeling that what Aereo is doing (or enabling to be done) to the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 copyrighted programming ought not to be allowed.  But perhaps we need not distort the Copyright Act to forbid it.  As discussed at the outset, Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s secondary liability for performance infringement is yet to be determined, as is its primary and secondary liability for reproduction infringement.  If that does not suffice, then (assuming one shares the majority\xe2\x80\x99s estimation of right and wrong) what we have before us must be considered a \xe2\x80\x9cloophole\xe2\x80\x9d in the law.  It is not the role of this Court to identify and plug loopholes.  It is the role of good lawyers to identify and exploit them, and the role of Congress to eliminate them if it wishes.  Congress can do that, I may add, in a much more targeted, better informed, and less disruptive fashion than the crude \xe2\x80\x9clooks-like-cable-TV\xe2\x80\x9d solution the Court invents today.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        We came within one vote of declaring the VCR contraband 30 years ago in Sony.  See 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 441, n. 21.  The dissent in that case was driven in part by the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 prediction that VCR technology would wreak all manner of havoc in the television and movie industries.  See id., at 483 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also Brief for CBS, Inc., as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1982, No. 81\xe2\x80\x931687, p. 2 (arguing that VCRs \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly threatened\xe2\x80\x9d the bottom line of \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very broadcaster\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        The Networks make similarly dire predictions about Aereo.  We are told that nothing less than \xe2\x80\x9cthe very existence of broadcast television as we know it\xe2\x80\x9d is at stake.  Brief for Petitioners 39.  Aereo and its amici dispute those forecasts and make a few of their own, suggesting that a decision in the Networks\xe2\x80\x99 favor will stifle technological innovation and imperil billions of dollars of investments in cloud-storage services.  See Brief for Respondents 48\xe2\x80\x9351; Brief for BSA, The Software Alliance as Amicus Curiae 5\xe2\x80\x9313.  We are in no position to judge the validity of those self-interested claims or to foresee the path of future technological development.  See Sony, supra, at 430\xe2\x80\x93431; see also Grokster, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 958 (Breyer, J., concurring).  Hence, the proper course is not to bend and twist the Act\xe2\x80\x99s terms in an effort to produce a just outcome, but to apply the law as it stands and leave to Congress the task of deciding whether the Copyright Act needs an upgrade.  I conclude, as the Court concluded in Sony: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this new technology, just as it so often has examined other innovations in the past.  But it is not our job to apply laws that have not yet been written.  Applying the copyright statute, as it now reads, to the facts as they have been developed in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be [affirmed].\xe2\x80\x9d  464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 456.</p><p>        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0        I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"><span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span><span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0An unpublished decision of the Third Circuit is to the same effect.  v. , 242 Fed.
