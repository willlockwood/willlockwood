This last contract was made for the express purpose of making the complainants a compensation for the loss they had sustained, by the nonperformance of the other, and was evidently received as an equivalent or substitute therefor.  By this latter contract, then, they were placed, as it respected the holders of all their notes, precisely in the same situation as if there had been no want or failure of consideration of the agreement made in 1795.  Whether the agreement of 1798 has been complied with it is not material to inquire, because, previous thereto, this note was held by Grundy, who cannot be affected by any claim which the complainant may have against the other Defendants in consequence of any subsequent transactions between the parties.</p>\n<p>The Court is of opinion that the decree of the circuit court be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
