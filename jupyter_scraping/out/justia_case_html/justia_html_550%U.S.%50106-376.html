In 1996, Congress added what is now \xc2\xa76404(h), which states that the Tax Court has \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction over any action brought by a taxpayer who meets the requirements referred to in section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) to determine whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s failure to abate \xe2\x80\xa6 was an abuse of discretion, and may order an abatement, if such action is brought within 180 days after the date of the mailing of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s final determination not to abate \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76404(h)(1).

The IRS denied petitioner Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 request for abatement of interest assessed in 1999 for the period March 21, 1989, to April 1, 1993.  The Hincks then filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking review of the refusal to abate.  The court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, and the Federal Circuit affirmed, holding that \xc2\xa76404(h) vests exclusive jurisdiction to review interest abatement claims in the Tax Court.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for judicial review of a failure to abate interest under \xc2\xa76404(e)(1).

Board of Univ. and School Lands</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/273/index.html">461 U. S. 273</a>, 285.  Section 6404(h) fits the bill on both counts.  In a single sentence, it provides a forum for adjudication, a limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limitations, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial relief; it was also enacted against a backdrop of decisions uniformly rejecting the possibility of any review of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determinations.  Though Congress failed explicitly to define the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction as exclusive, it is quite plain that the terms of \xc2\xa76404(h)\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\xe2\x80\x9d filling a perceived hole in the law\xe2\x80\x94control all requests for review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) decisions, including the forum for adjudication.  The Hincks correctly argue that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s provision of an abuse of discretion standard removed one of the obstacles courts had held foreclosed judicial review of such determinations, but Congress did not simply supply this single missing ingredient in enacting \xc2\xa76404(h).  Rather, it set out a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific provision, which also precisely defined the appropriate forum.  This Court will not isolate one feature of this statute and use it to permit taxpayers to circumvent the other limiting features in the <em>same</em> statute, such as a shorter statute of limitations than in general refund suits or a net-worth ceiling for plaintiffs eligible to bring suit.  Taxpayers could \xe2\x80\x9ceffortlessly evade\xe2\x80\x9d these specific limitations by bringing interest abatement claims as tax refund actions in the district courts or the Court of Federal Claims, disaggregating a statute Congress plainly envisioned as a package deal.  <em>EC Term of Years Trust</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___.  Equally unavailing are the Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 contentions that reading \xc2\xa76404(h) to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Tax Court impliedly repeals the pre-existing jurisdiction of the district courts and Court of Federal Claims, runs contrary to the structure of tax controversy jurisdiction, and would lead to the \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d result that taxpayers with net worths exceeding the specified ceilings would be foreclosed from seeking judicial review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) refusals to abate.

One of them is that interest accrues on the unpaid amount.  Sometimes it takes a while for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine that taxes should have been paid that were not.  Section 6404(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code permits the Secretary of the Treasury to abate interest\xe2\x80\x94to forgive it, partially or in whole\xe2\x80\x94if the assessment of interest on a deficiency is attributable to unreasonable error or delay on the part of the IRS.  Section 6404(h) allows for judicial review of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to grant such relief.  The question presented in this case is whether this review may be obtained only in the Tax Court, or may also be secured in the district courts and the Court of Federal Claims.  We hold that the Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for judicial review of a refusal to abate interest under \xc2\xa76404(e)(1), and affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Internal Revenue Code provides that if any amount of assessed federal income tax is not paid \xe2\x80\x9con or before the last date prescribed for payment,\xe2\x80\x9d interest \xe2\x80\x9cshall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76601(a).  Section 6404 of the Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to abate any tax or related liability in certain circumstances.  As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress amended \xc2\xa76404 to add subsection (e)(1), which, as enacted, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of any assessment of interest on \xe2\x80\xa6 any deficiency attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service (acting in his official capacity) in performing a ministerial act \xe2\x80\xa6 the Secretary may abate the assessment of all or any part of such interest for any period.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the years following passage of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1), the federal courts uniformly held that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to grant an abatement was not subject to judicial review.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Argabright</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 35 F.\xc2\xa03d 472, 476 (CA9 1994); <em>Selman</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 941 F.\xc2\xa02d 1060, 1064 (CA10 1991); <em>Horton Homes, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 936 F.\xc2\xa02d 548, 554 (CA11 1991); see also <em>Bax</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 13 F.\xc2\xa03d 54, 58 (CA2 1993).  These decisions recognized that \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) gave the Secretary complete discretion to determine whether to abate interest, \xe2\x80\x9cneither indicat[ing] that such authority should be used universally nor provid[ing] any basis for distinguishing between the instances in which abatement should and should not be granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Selman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1063.  Any decision by the Secretary was accordingly \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to agency discretion by law\xe2\x80\x9d under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701(a)(2), and thereby insulated from judicial review.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/592/index.html">486 U. S. 592</a>, 599 (1988); <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Chaney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/821/index.html">470 U. S. 821</a>, 830 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1996, as part of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2, Congress again amended \xc2\xa76404, adding what is now subsection (h).  As relevant, that provision states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cReview of denial of request for abatement of interest.\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82In general.\xe2\x80\x94The Tax Court shall have jurisdiction over any action brought by a taxpayer who meets the requirements referred to in section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) to determine whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s failure to abate interest under this section was an abuse of discretion, and may order an abatement, if such action is brought within 180 days after the date of the mailing of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s final determination not to abate such interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(2)(B), which refers to individuals with a net worth not exceeding $2 million and businesses with a net worth not exceeding $7 million.  Congress made subsection (h) effective for all requests for abatement submitted to the IRS after July 30, 1996, regardless of the tax year involved.  \xc2\xa7302(b), 110 Stat. 1458.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1986, petitioner John Hinck was a limited partner in an entity called Agri-Cal Venture Associates (ACVA).  Along with his wife, petitioner Pamela Hinck, Hinck filed a joint return for 1986 reporting his share of losses from the partnership.  The IRS later examined the tax returns for ACVA and proposed adjustments to deductions that the partnership had claimed for 1984, 1985, and 1986.  In 1990, the IRS issued a final notice regarding the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s returns, disallowing tens of millions of dollars of deductions.  While the partnership sought administrative review of this decision, the Hincks, in May 1996, made an advance remittance of $93,890 to the IRS toward any personal deficiency that might result from a final adjustment of ACVA\xe2\x80\x99s returns.  In March 1999, the Hincks reached a settlement with the IRS concerning the ACVA partnership adjustments, to the extent they affected the Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 return.  Shortly thereafter, as a result of the adjustments, the IRS imposed additional liability against the Hincks: $16,409 in tax and $21,669.22 in interest.  The IRS applied the Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 advance remittance to this amount and refunded them the balance of $55,811.78.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hincks filed a claim with the IRS contending that, because of IRS errors and delays, the interest assessed against them for the period from March 21, 1989, to April 1, 1993, should be abated under \xc2\xa76404(e)(1).  The IRS denied the request.  The Hincks then filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking review of the refusal to abate.  That court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, 64 Fed. Cl. 71, 81 (2005), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, 446 F.\xc2\xa03d 1307, 1313\xe2\x80\x931314 (2006), holding that \xc2\xa76404(h) vests exclusive jurisdiction to review interest abatement claims under \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) in the Tax Court.  Because this decision conflicted with the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Beall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 336 F.\xc2\xa03d 419, 430 (2003) (holding that \xc2\xa76404(h) grants concurrent rather than exclusive jurisdiction to the Tax Court), we granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis is governed by the well-established principle that, in most contexts, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>EC Term of Years Trust</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 4) (quoting <em>Brown</em> v. <em>GSA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/820/index.html">425 U. S. 820</a>, 834 (1976)); see also <em>Block</em> v. <em>North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/273/index.html">461 U. S. 273</a>, 284\xe2\x80\x93286 (1983).  We are also guided by our past recognition that when Congress enacts a specific remedy when no remedy was previously recognized, or when previous remedies were \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic,\xe2\x80\x9d the remedy provided is generally regarded as exclusive.  <em>Id.,</em> at 285; <em>Brown</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 826\xe2\x80\x93829.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 6404(h) fits the bill on both counts.  It is a \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\xe2\x80\x9d that, in a single sentence, provides a forum for adjudication, a limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limitations, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial relief.  And Congress enacted this provision against a backdrop of decisions uniformly rejecting the possibility of any review for taxpayers wishing to challenge the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determination.  Therefore, despite Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure explicitly to define the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction as exclusive, we think it quite plain that the terms of \xc2\xa76404(h)\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\xe2\x80\x9d filling a perceived hole in the law\xe2\x80\x94control all requests for review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determinations.  Those terms include the forum for\nadjudication.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 primary argument against exclusive Tax Court jurisdiction is that by providing a standard of review\xe2\x80\x94abuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x94in \xc2\xa76404(h), Congress eliminated the primary barrier to judicial review that courts had previously recognized; accordingly, they maintain, taxpayers may seek review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determinations under statutes granting jurisdiction to the district courts and the Court of Federal Claims to review tax refund actions.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1); 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77422(a).  Or, as the Fifth Circuit reasoned: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he federal district courts have always possessed <em>jurisdiction</em> over challenges brought to section 6404(e)(1) denials[;] they simply determined that the taxpayers had no <em>substantive right</em> whatever to a favorable exercise of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretion\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0[I]n enacting section 6404(h), Congress indicated that such is no longer the case, and thereby removed any impediment to district court review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beall</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 428 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that by providing an abuse of discretion standard, Congress removed one of the obstacles courts had held foreclosed judicial review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determinations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Argabright</em>, 35 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 476 (noting an absence of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicially manageable standards\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Heckler</em>, 470 U. S., at 830)).  But in enacting \xc2\xa76404(h), Congress did not simply supply this single missing ingredient; rather, it set out a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific provision, which also precisely defined the appropriate forum.  We cannot accept the Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to isolate one feature of this \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the portion specifying a standard of review\xe2\x80\x94and use it to permit taxpayers to circumvent the other limiting features Congress placed in the <em>same</em> statute\xe2\x80\x94restrictions such as a shorter statute of limitations than general refund suits, compare \xc2\xa76404(h) (180-day limitations period) with \xc2\xa76532(a)(1) (2-year limitations period), or a net-worth ceiling for plaintiffs eligible to bring suit.  Taxpayers could \xe2\x80\x9ceffortlessly evade\xe2\x80\x9d these specific limitations by bringing interest abatement claims as tax refund actions in the district courts or the Court of Federal Claims, disaggregating a statute Congress plainly envisioned as a package deal.  <em>EC Term of Years Trust, supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 5); see also <em>Block, supra</em>, at 284\xe2\x80\x93285; <em>Brown, supra</em>, 425 U. S., at 832\xe2\x80\x93833.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hincks\xe2\x80\x99 other contentions are equally unavailing.  First, they claim that reading \xc2\xa76404(h) to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Tax Court impliedly repeals the pre-existing jurisdiction of the district courts and Court of Federal Claims, despite our admonition that \xe2\x80\x9crepeals by implication are not favored.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/535/index.html">417 U. S. 535</a>, 549 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the implied-repeal doctrine is not applicable here, for when Congress passed \xc2\xa76404(h), \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) had been interpreted not to provide <em>any</em> right of review for taxpayers.  There is thus no indication of any \xe2\x80\x9clanguage on the statute books that [Congress] wishe[d] to change,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Fausto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/439/index.html">484 U. S. 439</a>, 453 (1988), implicitly or explicitly.  Congress simply prescribed a limited form of review where none had previously been found to exist.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Hincks assert that vesting jurisdiction over \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) abatement decisions exclusively in the Tax Court runs contrary to the \xe2\x80\x9centire structure of tax controversy jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 30, under which the Tax Court generally hears prepayment challenges to tax liability, see \xc2\xa76213(a), while postpayment actions are brought in the district courts or Court of Federal Claims.  In a related vein, the Hincks point out that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position would force taxpayers seeking postpayment review of their tax liabilities to separate their \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) abatement claims from their refund claims and bring each in a different court.  Even assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that we were inclined to depart from the face of the statute, these arguments are undercut on two fronts.  To begin with, by expressly granting to the Tax Court <em>some</em> jurisdiction over \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) decisions, Congress has already broken with the general scheme the Hincks identify.  No one doubts that an action seeking review of a \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determination may be maintained in the Tax Court even if the interest has already been paid, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Dadian</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 87 TCM 1344 (2004), \xc2\xb62004\xe2\x80\x93121 RIA Memo TC, p. 790\xe2\x80\x932004; <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 79 TCM 2213 (2000), \xc2\xb62000\xe2\x80\x93195 RIA Memo TC, p. 1120\xe2\x80\x932000, aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 310 F.\xc2\xa03d 640 (CA9 2002), and the Hincks point to no case where the Tax Court has refused to exercise jurisdiction under such circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, an interest abatement claim under \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) involves no questions of substantive tax law, but rather is premised on issues of bureaucratic administration (whether, for example, there was \xe2\x80\x9cerror or delay\xe2\x80\x9d in the performance of a \xe2\x80\x9cministerial\xe2\x80\x9d act, \xc2\xa76404(e)(1)(A)).  Judicial review of decisions not to abate requires an evaluation of the internal processes of the IRS, not the underlying tax liability of the taxpayer.  We find nothing tellingly awkward about channeling such discrete and specialized questions of administrative operations to one particular court, even if in some respects it \xe2\x80\x9cmay not appear to be efficient\xe2\x80\x9d as a policy matter to separate refund and interest abatement claims.  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1316.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last, the Hincks contend that Congress would not have intended to vest jurisdiction exclusively in the Tax Court because it would lead to the \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d result that taxpayers with net worths greater than $2 million (for individuals) or $7 million (for businesses) would be foreclosed from seeking judicial review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) refusals to abate.  Brief for Petitioners 46; see also <em>Beall</em>, 336 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 430.  But we agree with the Federal Circuit that this outcome \xe2\x80\x9cwas contemplated by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1316.  The net-worth limitation in \xc2\xa76404(h) reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that wealthier taxpayers are more likely to be able to pay a deficiency before contesting it, thereby avoiding accrual of interest during their administrative and legal challenges.  In contrast, taxpayers with comparatively fewer resources are more likely to contest their assessed deficiency before first paying it, thus exposing themselves to interest charges if their challenge is ultimately unsuccessful.  There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grant the possibility of judicial relief only to those taxpayers most likely to be in need of it.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 also modified  26 U.
