JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Appellants are an exhibitor and the distributor of a motion picture named "Viva Maria," which, pursuant to a city ordinance, the Motion Picture Classification Board of the appellee City of Dallas classified as "not suitable for young persons."  A county court upheld the Board\'s determination and enjoined exhibition of the film without acceptance by appellants of the requirements imposed by the restricted classification.  The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and we noted probable jurisdiction, 387 U.S. 903, to consider the First and Fourteenth Amendment issues raised by appellants with respect to appellee\'s classification ordinance.</p>\n<p>That ordinance, adopted in 1965, may be summarized as follows. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It establishes a Motion Picture Classification Board, composed of nine appointed members, all of whom serve without pay.  The Board classifies films as "suitable for young persons" or as "not suitable for young persons," young persons being defined as children who have not reached their 16th birthday.  An exhibitor must be specially licensed to show "not suitable" films.</p>\n<p>The ordinance requires the exhibitor, before any initial showing of a film, to file with the Board a proposed classification of the film together with a summary of its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 390 U. S. 679</a></p><p> plot and similar information.  The proposed classification is approved if the Board affirmatively agrees with it, or takes no action upon it within five days of its filing.</p>\n<p>If a majority of the Board is dissatisfied with the proposed classification, the exhibitor is required to project the film before at least five members of the Board at the earliest practicable time.  At the showing, the exhibitor may also present testimony or other support for his proposed classification.  Within two days, the Board must issue its classification order.  Should the exhibitor disagree, he must file within two days [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] a notice of nonacceptance.  The Board is then required to go to court within three days to seek a temporary injunction, and a hearing is required to be set on that application within five days thereafter; if the exhibitor agrees to waive notice and requests a hearing on the merits of a permanent injunction, the Board is required to waive its application for a temporary injunction and join in the exhibitor\'s request.  If an injunction does not issue within 10 days of the exhibitor\'s notice of nonacceptance, the Board\'s classification order is suspended. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The ordinance does not define the scope of judicial review of the Board\'s determination, but the Court of Civil Appeals held that <em>de novo</em> review in the trial court was required. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  If an injunction issues and the exhibitor seeks appellate review, or if an injunction is refused and the Board appeals, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 390 U. S. 680</a></p><p> Board must waive all statutory notices and times, and join a request of the exhibitor to advance the case on the appellate court\'s docket, <em>i.e.,</em> do everything it can to assure a speedy determination.</p>\n<p>The ordinance is enforced primarily by a misdemeanor penalty:  an exhibitor is subject to a fine of up to $200 if he exhibits a film that is classified "not suitable for young persons" without advertisements clearly stating its classification or without the classification being clearly posted, exhibits on the same program a suitable and a not suitable film, knowingly admits a youth under age 16 to view the film without his guardian or spouse accompanying him, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] makes any false or willfully misleading statement in submitting a film for classification, or exhibits a not suitable film without having a valid license therefor.</p>\n<p>The same penalty is applicable to a youth who obtains admission to a not suitable film by falsely giving his age as 16 years or over, and to any person who sells or gives to a youth under 16 a ticket to a not suitable film, or makes any false statements to enable such a youth to gain admission. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Other means of enforcement, as against the exhibitor, are provided.  Repeated violations of the ordinance, or persistent failure</p>\n<p>"to use reasonable diligence to determine whether those seeking admittance to the exhibition of a film classified \'not suitable for young persons\' are below the age of sixteen,"</p>\n<p>may be the basis for revocation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 390 U. S. 681</a></p><p> of a license to show not suitable films. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Such a persistent failure, or exhibition of a not suitable film by an exhibitor with three convictions under the ordinance, <em>inter alia,</em> are defined as "public nuisances," which the Board may seek to restrain by a suit for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The substantive standards governing classification are as follows:</p>\n<p>"\'Not suitable for young persons\' means:  "</p>\n<p>"(1) Describing or portraying brutality, criminal violence or depravity in such a manner as to be, in the judgment of the Board, likely to incite or encourage crime or delinquency on the part of young persons; or"</p>\n<p>"(2) Describing or portraying nudity beyond the customary limits of candor in the community, or sexual promiscuity or extramarital or abnormal sexual relations in such a manner as to be, in the judgment of the Board, likely to incite or encourage delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the part of young persons or to appeal to their prurient interest."</p>\n<p>"A film shall be considered \'likely to incite or encourage\' crime delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the part of young persons, if, in the judgment of the Board, there is a substantial probability that it will create the impression on young persons that such conduct is profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, praiseworthy or commonly accepted.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="682">Page 390 U. S. 682</a></p><p> A film shall be considered as appealing to \'prurient interest\' of young persons if in the judgment of the Board, its calculated or dominant effect on young persons is substantially to arouse sexual desire.  In determining whether a film is \'not suitable for young persons,\' the Board shall consider the film as a whole, rather than isolated portions, and shall determine whether its harmful effects outweigh artistic or educational values such film may have for young persons."</p>\n<p>Appellants attack those standards as unconstitutionally vague.  We agree.  Motion pictures are, of course, protected by the First Amendment, <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/case.html">343 U. S. 495</a></span> (1952), and thus we start with the premise that "[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone," <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#438">371 U. S. 438</a></span> (1963).  And while it is true that this Court refused to strike down, against a broad and generalized attack, a prior restraint requirement that motion pictures be submitted to censors in advance of exhibition, <em>Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/43/case.html">365 U. S. 43</a></span> (1961), there has been no retreat in this area from rigorous insistence upon procedural safeguards and judicial superintendence of the censor\'s action.  <em>See Freedman v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html">380 U. S. 51</a></span> (1965). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Winters v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/case.html">333 U. S. 507</a></span> (1948), this Court struck down as vague and indefinite a statutory standard interpreted by the state court to be "criminal news or stories of deeds of bloodshed or lust, so massed as to become vehicles for inciting violent and depraved crimes. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/case.html#518">333 U. S. 518</a></span>.  In <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, supra,</em> the Court dealt with a film licensing standard of "sacrilegious," which was found to have such an all-inclusive definition as to result in "substantially unbridled censorship."  343 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/case.html#502">343 U.

Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/960/case.html">343 U. S. 960</a></span> (1952); "moral, educational or amusing and harmless," <em>Superior Films, Inc. v.

Regents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/684/case.html">360 U. S. 684</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/684/case.html#699">360 U. S. 699</a></span>-702 (Clark, J., concurring in result).</p>\n<p>The vice of vagueness is particularly pronounced where expression is sought to be subjected to licensing.  It may be unlikely that what Dallas does in respect to the licensing of motion pictures would have a significant effect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 390 U. S. 684</a></p><p> upon film makers in Hollywood or Europe.  But what Dallas may constitutionally do, so may other cities and States.  Indeed, we are told that this ordinance is being used as a model for legislation in other localities.  Thus, one who wishes to convey his ideas through that medium, which, of course, includes one who is interested not so much in expression as in making money, must consider whether what he proposes to film, and how he proposes to film it, is within the terms of classification schemes such as this.  If he is unable to determine what the ordinance means, he runs the risk of being foreclosed, in practical effect, from a significant portion of the movie-going public.  Rather than run that risk, he might choose nothing but the innocuous, perhaps save for the so-called "adult" picture.  Moreover, a local exhibitor who cannot afford to risk losing the youthful audience when a film may be of marginal interest to adults -- perhaps a "Viva Maria" -- may contract to show only the totally inane.  The vast wasteland that some have described in reference to another medium might be a verdant paradise in comparison.  The First Amendment interests here are, therefore, broader than merely those of the film maker, distributor, and exhibitor, and certainly broader than those of youths under 16.</p>\n<p>Of course, as the Court said in <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson,</em> 343 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/case.html#502">343 U. S. 502</a></span>,</p>\n<p>"[i]t does not follow that the Constitution requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places."</p>\n<p>What does follow, at the least, as the cases above illustrate, is that the restrictions imposed cannot be so vague as to set "the censor . . . adrift upon a boundless sea . . . ," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/case.html#504">343 U. S. 504</a></span>.  In short, as Justice Frankfurter said, "legislation must not be so vague, the language so loose, as to leave to those who have to apply it too wide a discretion . . . ," <em>Kingsley Int\'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents,</em> 360 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/684/case.html#694">360 U. S. 694</a></span> (concurring in result), one reason being </p><p><a class="page-number" name="685">Page 390 U. S. 685</a></p><p> that</p>\n<p>"where licensing is rested, in the first instance, in an administrative agency, the available judicial review is, in effect, rendered inoperative [by vagueness],"</p>\n<p><em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/case.html#532">343 U. S. 532</a></span> (concurring opinion).  Thus, to the extent that vague standards do not sufficiently guide the censor, the problem is not cured merely by affording <em>de novo</em> judicial review.  Vague standards, unless narrowed by interpretation, encourage erratic administration whether the censor be administrative or judicial;</p>\n<p>"individual impressions become the yardstick of action, and result in regulation in accordance with the beliefs of the individual censor, rather than regulation by law,"</p>\n<p><em>Kingsley Int\'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/684/case.html#701">360 U. S. 701</a></span> (Clark, J., concurring in result). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The dangers inherent in vagueness are strikingly illustrated in these cases.  Five members of the Board viewed "Viva Maria."  Eight members voted to classify it as "not suitable for young persons," the ninth member not voting.  The Board gave no reasons for its determination. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Appellee alleged in its petition for an injunction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 390 U. S. 686</a></p><p> that the classification was warranted because the film portrayed</p>\n<p>"sexual promiscuity in such a manner as to be in the judgment of the Board likely to incite or encourage delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the part of young persons or to appeal to their prurient interests."</p>\n<p>Two Board members, a clergyman and a lawyer, testified at the hearing.  Each adverted to several scenes in the film which, in their opinion, portrayed male-female relationships in a way contrary to "acceptable and approved behavior."  Each acknowledged, in reference to scenes in which clergymen were involved in violence, most of which was farcical, that "sacrilege" might have entered into the Board\'s determination.  And both conceded that the asserted portrayal of "sexual promiscuity" was implicit, rather than explicit, <em>i.e.,</em> that it was a product of inference by, and imagination of, the viewer.</p>\n<p>So far as "judicial superintendence" [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and <em>de novo</em> review are concerned, the trial judge, after viewing the film and hearing argument, stated merely:</p>\n<p>"Oh, I realize you gentlemen might be right.  There are two or three features in this picture that look to me would be unsuitable to young people. . . .  So I enjoin the exhibitor . . . from exhibiting it. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]"</p>\n<p>Nor did the Court of Civil Appeals provide much enlightenment or a narrowing definition of the ordinance.  United Artists argued that the obscenity standards similar to those set forth in <em>Roth v.  United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span> (1957), and other decisions of this Court ought to be controlling. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The majority of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 390 U. S. 687</a></p><p> the Court of Civil Appeals held, alternatively, (1) that such cases were not applicable because the legislation involved in them resulted in suppression of the offending expression, rather than its classification; (2) that, if obscenity standards were applicable, then "Viva Maria" was obscene as to adults (a patently untenable conclusion), and therefore entitled to no constitutional protection, and (3) that, if obscenity standards were modified as to children, the film was obscene as to them, a conclusion which was not in terms given as a narrowing interpretation of any specific provision of the ordinance.  402 S.W.2d 770, 775-776.  In regard to the last alternative holding, we must conclude that the court in effect ruled that the "portrayal . . . of sexual promiscuity as acceptable," <em>id.</em> at 775, is, in itself, obscene as to children. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The court also held that the standards of the ordinance were "sufficiently definite."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Thus, we are left merely with the film and directed to the words of the ordinance.  The term "sexual promiscuity" is not there defined, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and was not interpreted in the state courts.  It could extend, depending upon one\'s moral judgment, from the obvious to any sexual contacts outside a marital relationship.  The determinative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 390 U.

Nonetheless,</p>\n<p>"[w]hat may be to one viewer the glorification of an idea as being \'desirable, acceptable or proper\' may to the notions of another be entirely devoid of such a teaching.  The only limits on the censor\'s discretion is his understanding of what is included within the term \'desirable, acceptable or proper.\'  This is nothing less than a roving commission. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Kingsley Int\'l Pictures Corp. v.

The Board shall examine such proposed classification, and if it approves same, shall mark it \'approved\' and file it as its own classification order.  If the Board fails to act, that is, either file a classification order or hold a hearing within five (5) days after such proposed classification is filed, the proposed classification shall be considered approved."</p>\n<p>"(b) If upon examination of the proposed classification a majority of the Board is not satisfied that it is proper, the Chairman shall direct the exhibitor to project the film before any five (5) or more members of the Board, at a suitably equipped place and at a specified time, which shall be the earliest time practicable with due regard to the availability of the film.  The exhibitor, or his designated representative, may at such time make such statement to the Board in support of his proposed classification and present such testimony as he may desire.  Within two (2) days, the Board shall make and file its classification of the film in question."</p>\n<p>"(c) Any initial or subsequent exhibitor may file an application for a change in the classification of any film previously classified.

Such application shall contain a sworn statement of the grounds upon which the application </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 390 U. S. 695</a></p><p> is based.  Upon filing of such application, the City Secretary shall bring it immediately to the attention of the Chairman of the Board, who upon application by the exhibitor shall set a time and place for a hearing and shall notify the applicants and all interested parties, including all exhibitors who may be exhibiting or preparing to exhibit the film.  The Board shall view the film and at such hearing, hear the statements of all interested parties, and any proper testimony that may be offered, and shall within two (2) days thereafter make and file its order approving or changing such classification.  If the classification of a film is changed as a result of such hearing to the classification \'not suitable for young persons,\' the exhibitors showing the film shall have seven (7) days in which to alter their advertising and audience policy to comply with such classification."</p>\n<p>"(d) Upon filing by the Board of any classification order, the City Secretary shall immediately issue and mail a notice of classification to the exhibitor involved and to any other exhibitor who shall request such notice."</p>\n<p>"(e) A classification shall be binding on any subsequent exhibitor unless and until he obtains a change of classification in the manner above provided."</p>\n<p>"Section 4A-4.  <em>Offenses:</em>  "</p>\n<p>"(a) It shall be unlawful for any exhibitor or his employee:  "</p>\n<p>"(1) To exhibit any film which has not been classified as provided in this ordinance."</p>\n<p>"(2) To exhibit any film classified \'not suitable for young persons\' if any current advertisement of such film by such exhibitor fails to state clearly the classification of such film."</p>\n<p>"(3) To exhibit any film classified \'not suitable for young persons\' without keeping such classification posted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 390 U.

In the event the defendant-exhibitor does not waive notice and/or does not request an early hearing on the Board\'s application for permanent injunction, it shall nevertheless be the duty of the board to obtain the earliest possible setting for such hearing under the provisions of State law and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure."</p>\n<p>"(3) If the injunction is granted by the trial court and the defendant-exhibitor appeals to the Court of Civil Appeals, the Board shall waive any and all statutory notices and times as provided for in the Texas State Statutes and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall within five (5) days after receiving a copy of appealing exhibitor\'s brief, file its reply brief, if required, and be prepared to submit the case upon oral submission or take any other reasonable action requested by the appealing exhibitor to expedite the submission of the case to the Court of Civil Appeals, and shall upon request of the appealing exhibitor, jointly with such exhibitor, request the Court of Civil Appeals to advance the cause upon the docket and to give it a preferential setting the same as is afforded an appeal from a temporary injunction or other preferential matters.

The assurance of a "prompt final judicial decision" (380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#59">380 U. S. 59</a></span>) is made here, we think, by the guaranty of a speedy determination in the trial court (in this case, nine days after the Board\'s classification).  <em>See Teitel Film Corp. v Cusack, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/139/case.html">390 U. S. 139</a></span>.  Nor is <em>Freedman</em> violated by the requirement that the exhibitor file a notice of nonacceptance of the Board\'s classification.  To be sure, it is emphasized in <em>Freedman</em> that "only a procedure requiring a judicial determination suffices to impose a valid final restraint" (380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#58">380 U. S. 58</a></span>), and here, if the exhibitor chooses not to file the notice of nonacceptance, the Board\'s determination is final without judicial approval.  But we are not constrained to view that procedure as invalid in the absence of a showing that it has any significantly greater effect than would the exhibitor\'s decision not to contest in court the Board\'s suit for a temporary injunction.  The ordinance provides that the Board has the burden of going to court to seek a temporary injunction, once the exhibitor has indicated his nonacceptance, and there it has the burden of sustaining its classification.</p>\n<p>Finally, appellant United Artists contends the ordinance unconstitutionally infringes upon its rights by not providing for participation by a distributor, who might wish to contest where an exhibitor would not.  Of course, the distributor must be permitted to challenge the classification, <em>cf. Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/58/case.html">372 U.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in No. 47, <em>ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/case.html">390 U. S. 629</a></span>, and dissenting in Nos. 56 and 64.</p>\n<p>These cases usher the Court into a new phase of the intractable obscenity problem:  may a State prevent the dissemination of obscene or other obnoxious material to juveniles upon standards less stringent than those which would govern its distribution to adults?</p>\n<p>In No. 47, the <em>Ginsberg</em> case, the Court upholds a New York statute applicable only to juveniles which, as construed by the state courts, in effect embodies in diluted form the "adult" obscenity standards established by <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span>, and the prevailing opinion in <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/413/case.html">383 U. S. 413</a></span>. In Nos. 56 and 64, the <em>Interstate Circuit</em> and <em>United Artists</em> cases, the Court strikes down on the ground of vagueness a similar Dallas ordinance, not couched, however, entirely in obscenity terms.  In none of these cases does the Court pass judgment on the particular material condemned by the state courts.</p>\n<p>As the Court enters this new area of obscenity law, it is well to take stock of where we are at present in this constitutional field.  The subject of obscenity has produced a variety of views among the members of the Court unmatched in any other course of constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="705">Page 390 U. S. 705</a></p><p> adjudication. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Two members of the Court steadfastly maintain that the First and Fourteenth Amendments render society powerless to protect itself against the dissemination of even the filthiest materials. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  No other member of the Court, past or present, has ever stated his acceptance of that point of view.  But there is among present members of the Court a sharp divergence as to the proper application of the standards in <em>Roth, supra,</em> [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] <em>Memoirs, supra,</em> [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] and <em>Ginzburg v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/463/case.html">383 U. S. 463</a></span>, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] for judging whether given material is constitutionally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="706">Page 390 U. S. 706</a></p><p> protected or unprotected.  Most of the present Justices who believe that "obscenity" is not beyond the pale of governmental control seemingly consider that the <em>Roth-Memoirs-Ginzburg</em> tests permit suppression of material that falls short of so-called "hard core pornography," on equal terms as between federal and state authority. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Another view is that only "hard core pornography" may be suppressed, whether by federal or state authority. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  And still another view, that of this writer, is that only "hard core pornography" may be suppressed by the Federal Government, whereas, under the Fourteenth Amendment, States are permitted wider authority to deal with obnoxious matter than might be justifiable under a strict application of the <em>Roth-Memoirs-Ginzburg</em> rules. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>There are also differences among us as to how our appellate process should work in reviewing obscenity determinations.  One view is that we should simply examine the proceedings below to ascertain whether the lower federal or state courts have made a genuine effort to apply the <em>Roth-Memoirs-Ginzburg</em> tests, and that, if such is the case, their determinations that the questioned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="707">Page 390 U. S. 707</a></p><p> material is obscene should be accepted, much as would any findings of fact. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Another view is that the question of whether particular material is obscene inherently entails a constitutional judgment for which the Court has ultimate responsibility, and hence that it is incumbent upon us to judge for ourselves, <em>de novo,</em> as it were, the obscenity <em>vel non</em> of the challenged matter. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The upshot of all this divergence in viewpoint is that anyone who undertakes to examine the Court\'s decisions since <em>Roth</em> which have held particular material obscene or not obscene would find himself in utter bewilderment. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  From the standpoint of the Court itself, the current approach has required us to spend an inordinate amount of time in the absurd business of perusing and viewing the miserable stuff that pours into the Court, mostly in state cases, all to no better end than second-guessing state judges.  In all except rare instances, I venture to say, no substantial free speech interest is at stake, given the right of the States to control obscenity.</p>\n<p>I believe that no improvement in this chaotic state of affairs is likely to come until it is recognized that this whole problem is primarily one of state concern, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="708">Page 390 U. S. 708</a></p><p> that the Constitution tolerates much wider authority and discretion in the States to control the dissemination of obscene materials than it does in the Federal Government.  Reiterating the viewpoint that I have expressed in earlier opinions, I would limit federal control of obscene materials to those which all would recognize as what has been called "hard core pornography," and would withhold the federal judicial hand from interfering with state determinations except in instances where the state action clearly appears to be but the product of prudish overzealousness.  <em>See Roth v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#496">354 U. S. 496</a></span>; <em>Manual Enterprises v. Day,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/478/case.html">370 U. S. 478</a></span>; <em>Jacobellis v.

And in the juvenile field, I think that the Constitution is still more tolerant of state policy and its applications.  If current doctrinaire views as to the reach of the First Amendment into state affairs are thought to stand in the way of such a functional approach, I would revert to basic constitutional concepts that until recent times have been recognized and respected as the fundamental genius of our federal system, namely the acceptance of wide state autonomy in local affairs.</p>\n<p>I come now to the cases at hand.  In No. 47, <em>Ginsberg,</em> I concur in the judgment and join the opinion of the Court, fully preserving, however, the views repeatedly expressed in my earlier opinions in this field.</p>\n<p>In Nos. 56 and 64, the <em>Interstate Circuit</em> and <em>United Artists</em> cases, I respectfully dissent.  I do not agree that the Dallas ordinance can be struck down, as the Court now holds, on the score of vagueness.  The ambiguities about which the Court expresses concern are essentially two. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  First, the ordinance does not include a definition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 390 U. S. 709</a></p><p> of "sexual promiscuity." [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Second, the ordinance provides that a film</p>\n<p>"shall be considered \'likely to incite or encourage\' crime delinquency or sexual promiscuity . . . if, in the judgment of the Board, there is a substantial probability that it will create the impression on young persons that such conduct is profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, praiseworthy or commonly accepted."</p>\n<p>The Court is concerned that many may disagree as to whether any specific materials create such impressions on young persons.</p>\n<p>These seem to me entirely inadequate grounds on which to strike down the ordinance.  It must be granted, of course, that people may differ as to the application of these standards; but the central lesson of this Court\'s efforts in this area is that, under all verbal formulae, including even this Court\'s own definition of obscenity, reasonable men can, and ordinarily do, differ as to the proper assessment of challenged materials.  The truth is that the Court has demanded greater precision of language from the City of Dallas than the Court can itself give, or even than can sensibly be expected in this area of the law.</p>\n<p>The Court has not always asked so much. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  In <em>Roth,</em> the federal statute under which the petitioner had been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 390 U. S. 710</a></p><p> sentenced to five years\' imprisonment forbade the mailing of material that was "obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy . . . or other publication of an indecent character."

California,</em> the companion case to <em>Roth,</em> the California statute provided that the materials must have a "tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#498">354 U. S. 498</a></span>.  No definitions were included in either statute, yet the Court there explicitly rejected the argument that they did not "provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#491">354 U. S. 491</a></span>.  The Court recognized that the terms of obscenity statutes are necessarily imprecise, but emphasized, quoting <em>United States v. Petrillo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/1/case.html">332 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/1/case.html#7">332 U. S. 7</a></span>-8, that the</p>\n<p>"\'Constitution does not require impossible standards;\' all that is required is that the language \'conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common </p><p><a class="page-number" name="711">Page 390 U. S. 711</a></p><p> understanding and practices. . . .\' [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>   Yet it should be repeated that the <em>Interstate Circuit</em> cases, unlike <em>Roth</em> and <em>Alberts,</em> involve merely the classification, not the proscription by criminal prosecution, of objectionable materials.  In my opinion, the ordinance does not fail either to give adequate notice of the films that are to be restricted, or to provide sufficiently definite standards for its administration. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the Court finds it unnecessary to pass judgment upon the materials involved in these cases, I consider it preferable to face that question.

The statute forbade the exhibition of a film "which portrays acts of sexual immorality . . . or . . . presents such acts as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/684/case.html#685">360 U.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter went on to say that</p>\n<p>"\'[s]exual immorality\' is not a new phrase in this branch of law, and its implications dominate the context.  I hardly conceive it possible that the Court would strike down as unconstitutional the federal statute against mailing lewd, obscene and lascivious matter, which has been the law of the land for nearly a hundred years, <em>see</em> the Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 507, and March 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 599, whatever specific instances may be found not within its allowable prohibition.  In sustaining this legislation, this Court gave the words \'lewd, obscene and lascivious\' concreteness by saying that they concern \'sexual immorality.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/684/case.html#695">360 U.

Precisely similar reasoning should be applicable to boards like that created by the Dallas ordinance, although the cost of differences in result is here measured (at least initially) by film classifications, and not by lengthy terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>It is difficult to see how the Court could suppose that its <em>Memoirs</em> formula offers more precise warnings to film makers than does the Dallas ordinance.  Surely the Court cannot now believe that "redeeming social value," "patent offensiveness," and "prurient interest" are, particularly as modified so as to apply to children, terms of common understanding and clarity.  Moreover, one wonders whether the pandering rationale adopted in <em>Ginzburg v. United States, supra,</em> is thought to give more "guidance to those who seek to adjust their conduct" than does the Dallas ordinance.  It is difficult to imagine any standard more vague, or more overbroad, than the "new subjectivity" created by the Court\'s search for the "leer of the sensualist."  <em>See</em> Magrath, The Obscenity Cases:  Grapes of <em>Roth,</em> 1966 Sup.Ct.Rev. 7, 61.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
