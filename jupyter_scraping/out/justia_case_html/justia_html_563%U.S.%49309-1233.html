The resulting conditions are the subject of two federal class actions.  In <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>filed in 1990, the District Court found that prisoners with serious mental illness do not receive minimal, adequate care.  A Special Master appointed to oversee remedial efforts reported 12 years later that the state of mental health care in California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons was deteriorating due to increased overcrowding.  In <em>Plata </em>v. <em>Brown</em>, filed in 2001, the State conceded that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 Eighth Amendment rights and stipulated to a remedial injunction.  But when the State had not complied with the injunction by 2005, the court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts.  Three years later, the Receiver described continuing deficiencies caused by overcrowding.  Believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care could not be achieved without reducing overcrowding, the <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata</em> plaintiffs moved their respective District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) to order reductions in the prison population.  The judges in both actions granted the request, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge court.  After hearing testimony and making extensive findings of fact, the court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity within two years.  Finding that the prison population would have to be reduced if capacity could not be increased through new construction, the court ordered the State to formulate a compliance plan and submit it for court approval.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The court-mandated population limit is necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights and is authorized by the PLRA.

Both orders were intended to remedy constitutional violations and were given ample time to succeed\xe2\x80\x9412 years in <em>Coleman</em>, and 5 years in <em>Plata.</em>  Contrary to the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim, \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable time requirement did not require the District Courts to give more time for subsequent remedial efforts to succeed.  Such a reading would in effect require courts to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit, which would delay an eventual remedy, prolong the courts\xe2\x80\x99 involvement, and serve neither the State nor the prisoners.  The <em>Coleman</em> and <em>Plata</em> courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy, given the ongoing deficiencies recently reported by both the Special Master and the Receiver.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The three-judge court did not err in finding that \xe2\x80\x9ccrowding [was] the primary cause of the violation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(E)(i).  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The trial record documents the severe impact of burgeoning demand on the provision of care.  The evidence showed that there were high vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff, <em>e.g.,</em> 20% for surgeons and 54.1% for psychiatrists; that these numbers understated the severity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted sufficient staff to meet demand; and that even if vacant positions could be filled, there would be insufficient space for the additional staff.  Such a shortfall contributes to significant delays in treating mentally ill prisoners, who are housed in administrative segregation for extended periods while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds.  There are also backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see a doctor for physical care.  Crowding creates unsafe and unsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and mental health care.  It also promotes unrest and violence and can cause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.  Increased violence requires increased reliance on lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective delivery of care.  Overcrowding\xe2\x80\x99s effects are particularly acute in prison reception centers, which process 140,000 new or returning prisoners annually, and which house some prisoners for their entire incarceration period.  Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary cause of the constitutional violations.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Contrary to the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the three-judge court properly admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison conditions as relevant to the issues before it.  Expert witnesses based their conclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court admitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Special Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current conditions.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s orders cutting off discovery a few months before trial and excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a population limit is appropriate under the PLRA were within the court\xe2\x80\x99s sound discretion.  Orderly trial management may require discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the merits and the remedy.  The State points to no significant evidence that it was unable to present and that would have changed the outcome here.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that overcrowding was the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary,\xe2\x80\x9d but not the only, cause of the violations, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the violations.  This understanding of the primary cause requirement is consistent with the PLRA.  Had Congress intended to require that crowding be the only cause, the PLRA would have said so.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The evidence supports the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that \xe2\x80\x9cno other relief [would] remedy the violation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(E)(ii).  The State\xe2\x80\x99s claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail because requiring transfers is a population limit under the PLRA.  Even if they could be regarded as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve overcrowding.  The court also found no realistic possibility that California could build itself out of this crisis, particularly given the State\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing fiscal problems.  Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realistic alternative, since the prison system was chronically understaffed and would have insufficient space were adequate personnel retained.  The court also did not err when it concluded that, absent a population reduction, the Receiver\xe2\x80\x99s and Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s continued efforts would not achieve a remedy.  Their reports are persuasive evidence that, with no reduction, any remedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least require vast expenditures by the State.  The State asserts that these measures would succeed if combined, but a long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evidence of overcrowding\xe2\x80\x99s deleterious effects on the provision of care, compels a different conclusion here.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0The prospective relief ordered here was narrowly drawn, extended no further than necessary to correct the violation, and was the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation.  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9341.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply because prisoners beyond the plaintiff class will have to be released through parole or sentencing reform in order to meet the required reduction.  While narrow tailoring requires a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d between the [remedy\xe2\x80\x99s] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/469/index.html">492 U. S. 469</a>, 480, a narrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not invalid simply because it will have collateral effects.  Nor does the PLRA require that result.  The order gives the State flexibility to determine who should be released, and the State could move the three-judge court to modify its terms.  The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than separately assessing each institution\xe2\x80\x99s need for a population limit.  The <em>Coleman </em>court found a systemwide violation, and the State stipulated to systemwide relief in <em>Plata</em>.  Assuming no constitutional violation results, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the 137.5% limit provided others fall sufficiently below it so the system as a whole remains in compliance with the order.  This will afford the State flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.  The order may shape or control the State\xe2\x80\x99s authority in the realm of prison administration, but it leaves much to the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  The order\xe2\x80\x99s limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional violation.  The State may move the three-judge court to modify its order, but it has proposed no realistic alternative remedy at this time.  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The three-judge court gave \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight\xe2\x80\x9d to any potential adverse impact on public safety from its order.  The PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight\xe2\x80\x9d requirement does not require the court to certify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the public.  Here, statistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered without adversely affecting public safety in some California counties, several States, and Canada.  The court found that various available methods of reducing overcrowding\xe2\x80\x94good time credits and diverting low-risk offenders to community programs\xe2\x80\x94would have little or no impact on public safety, and its order took account of such concerns by giving the State substantial flexibility to select among the means of reducing overcrowding.  The State complains that the court approved the State\xe2\x80\x99s population reduction plan without considering whether its specific measures would substantially threaten public safety.  But the court left state officials the choice of how best to comply and was not required to second-guess their exercise of discretion.  Developments during the pendency of this appeal, when the State has begun to reduce the prison population, support the conclusion that a reduction can be accomplished without an undue negative effect on public safety.  Pp.\xc2\xa037\xe2\x80\x9341.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order, subject to the State\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek its modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.  Pp.\xc2\xa041\xe2\x80\x9348. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0To comply with the PLRA, a court must set a population limit at the highest level consistent with an efficacious remedy, and it must order the population reduction to be achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably consistent with public safety.  Pp.\xc2\xa041\xe2\x80\x9342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the prison population should be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly erroneous.  The court concluded that the evidence supported a limit between the 130% limit supported by expert testimony and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State Corrections Independent Review Panel.  The PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied so long as such equitable, remedial judgments are made with the objective of releasing the fewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious remedy.  Pp.\xc2\xa042\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year deadline for relief, especially in light of the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to contest the issue at trial.  The State has not asked this Court to extend the deadline, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility, to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.  Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes require that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State considerable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public safety.  The court may, <em>e.g., </em>grant a motion to extend the deadline if the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that the plan will be implemented without undue delay.  Such observations reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not intended to cast doubt on the validity of the order\xe2\x80\x99s basic premise.

The violations have persisted for years.  They remain uncorrected.  The appeal comes to this Court from a three-judge District Court order directing California to remedy two ongoing violations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a guarantee binding on the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The violations are the subject of two class actions in two Federal District Courts.  The first involves the class of prisoners with serious mental disorders.  That case is <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Brown</em>.  The second involves prisoners with serious medical conditions.  That case is <em>Plata </em>v. <em>Brown</em>.  The order of the three-judge District Court is applicable to both cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After years of litigation, it became apparent that a remedy for the constitutional violations would not be ef-fective absent a reduction in the prison system popula-tion.  The authority to order release of prisoners as a remedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth Amendment is a power reserved to a three-judge district court, not a single-judge district court.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a).  In accordance with that rule, the <em>Coleman </em>and<em> Plata</em> District Judges independently requested that a three-judge court be convened.  The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit convened a three-judge court composed of the <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata </em>District Judges and a third, Ninth Circuit Judge.  Because the two cases are interrelated, their limited consolidation for this purpose has a certain utility in avoiding conflicting decrees and aiding judicial consideration and enforcement.  The State in this Court has not objected to consolidation, although the State does argue that the three-judge court was prematurely convened.  The State also objects to the substance of the three-judge court order, which requires the State to reduce overcrowding in its prisons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The appeal presents the question whether the remedial order issued by the three-judge court is consistent with requirements and procedures set forth in a congressional statute, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA).  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626; see Appendix A, <em>infra</em>.  The order leaves the choice of means to reduce overcrowding to the discretion of state officials.  But absent compliance through new construction, out-of-state transfers, or other means\xe2\x80\x94or modification of the order upon a further showing by the State\xe2\x80\x94the State will be required to release some number of prisoners before their full sentences have been served.  High recidivism rates must serve as a warning that mistaken or premature release of even one prisoner can cause injury and harm.  The release of prisoners in large numbers\xe2\x80\x94assuming the State finds no other way to comply with the order\xe2\x80\x94is a matter of undoubted, grave concern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time of trial, California\xe2\x80\x99s correctional facilities held some 156,000 persons.  This is nearly double the number that California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons were designed to hold, and California has been ordered to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity.  By the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s own estimate, the required population reduction could be as high as 46,000 persons.  Although the State has reduced the population by at least 9,000 persons dur-ing the pendency of this appeal, this means a further reduction of 37,000 persons could be required.  As will be noted, the reduction need not be accomplished in an indiscriminate manner or in these substantial numbers if sat-isfactory, alternate remedies or means for compliance\nare devised.  The State may employ measures, including good-time credits and diversion of low-risk offenders and technical parole violators to community-based programs, that will mitigate the order\xe2\x80\x99s impact.  The population reduction potentially required is nevertheless of unprecedented sweep and extent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm resulting from these serious constitutional violations.  For years the medical and mental health care provided by California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements and has failed to meet prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 basic health needs.  Needless suffering and death have been the well-documented result.  Over the whole course of years during which this litigation has been pending, no other remedies have been found to be sufficient.  Efforts to remedy the violation have been frustrated by severe overcrowding in California\xe2\x80\x99s prison system.  Short term gains in the provision of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of severe and pervasive overcrowding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Overcrowding has overtaken the limited resources of prison staff; imposed demands well beyond the capacity\nof medical and mental health facilities; and created unsan-itary and unsafe conditions that make progress in the provision of care difficult or impossible to achieve.  The overcrowding is the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary cause of the violation of a Federal right,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically the severe and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners through grossly inadequate provision of medical and mental health care.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court now holds that the PLRA does authorize the relief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated population limit is necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights.  The order of the three-judge court, subject to the right of the State to seek\nits modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The degree of overcrowding in California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons is exceptional.  California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons are designed to house a population just under 80,000, but at the time of the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s decision the population was almost double that.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s prisons had operated at around 200% of design capacity for at least 11 years.  Prisoners are crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to house inmates.

Because of a shortage of treatment beds, suicidal inmates may be held for prolonged periods in telephone-booth sized cages without toilets.  See Appendix C, <em>infra</em>.  A psychiatric expert reported observing an inmate who had been held in such a cage for nearly 24 hours, standing in a pool of his own urine, unresponsive and nearly catatonic.  Prison officials explained they had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no place to put him.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 593.  Other inmates awaiting care may be held for months in administrative segregation, where they endure harsh and isolated conditions and receive only limited mental health services.  Wait times for mental health care range as high as 12 months.  <em>Id.,</em> at 704.  In 2006, the suicide rate\nin California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons was nearly 80% higher than the national average for prison populations; and a court-appointed Special Master found that 72.1% of suicides involved \xe2\x80\x9csome measure of inadequate assessment, treatment, or intervention, and were therefore most probably foreseeable and/or preventable.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 1781.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prisoners suffering from physical illness also receive severely deficient care.

The first to commence, <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Brown</em>, was filed in 1990.  <em>Coleman</em> involves the class of seriously mentally ill persons in California prisons.  Over 15 years ago, in 1995, after a 39-day trial, the <em>Coleman </em>District Court found \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence of the systematic failure to deliver necessary care to mentally ill inmates\xe2\x80\x9d in California prisons.  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 912 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1282, 1316 (ED Cal.).  The prisons were \xe2\x80\x9cseriously and chronically understaffed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1306, and had \xe2\x80\x9cno effective method for ensuring \xe2\x80\xa6 the competence of their staff,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1308.  The prisons had failed to implement necessary suicide-prevention procedures, \xe2\x80\x9cdue in large measure to the severe understaffing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1315.  Mentally ill inmates \xe2\x80\x9clanguished for months, or even years, without access to necessary care.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1316.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey suffer from severe hallucinations, [and] they decompensate into catatonic states.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court appointed a Special Master to oversee development and implementation of a remedial plan of action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2007, 12 years after his appointment, the Special Master in <em>Coleman </em>filed a report stating that, after years of slow improvement, the state of mental health care\nin California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons was deteriorating.  App. 489.  The Special Master ascribed this change to increased overcrowding.  The rise in population had led to greater\ndemand for care, and existing programming space and staffing levels were inadequate to keep pace.  Prisons had retained more mental health staff, but the \xe2\x80\x9cgrowth of the resource [had] not matched the rise in demand.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 482.  At the very time the need for space was rising, the need to house the expanding population had also caused a \xe2\x80\x9creduction of programming space now occupied by inmate bunks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 479.  The State was \xe2\x80\x9cfacing a four to five-year gap in the availability of sufficient beds to meet the treatment needs of many inmates/patients.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 481.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]ncreasing numbers of truly psychotic inmate/patients are trapped in [lower levels of treatment] that cannot meet their needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Special Master concluded that many early \xe2\x80\x9cachievements have succumbed to the inexorably rising tide of population, leaving behind growing frustration and despair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 489.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second action, <em>Plata </em>v. <em>Brown</em>, involves the class of state prisoners with serious medical conditions.  After this<em> </em>action commenced in 2001, the State conceded that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 Eighth Amendment rights.  The State stipulated to a remedial injunction.  The State failed to comply with that injunction, and in 2005 the court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts.  The court found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe California prison medical care system is broken beyond repair,\xe2\x80\x9d resulting in an \xe2\x80\x9cunconscionable degree of suffering and death.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 917.  The court found: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is an uncontested fact that, on average, an inmate in one of California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons needlessly dies every six to seven days due to constitutional deficiencies in the [California prisons\xe2\x80\x99] medical delivery system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And the court made findings regarding specific instances of neglect, including the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] San Quentin prisoner with hypertension, diabetes and renal failure was prescribed two different medications that actually served to exacerbate his renal failure.  An optometrist noted the patient\xe2\x80\x99s retinal bleeding due to very high blood pressure and referred him for immediate evaluation, but this evaluation never took place.  It was not until a year later that the patient\xe2\x80\x99s renal failure was recognized, at which point he was referred to a nephrologist on an urgent basis;\nhe should have been seen by the specialist within 14 days but the consultation never happened and the patient died three months later.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 928 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPrisons were unable to retain sufficient numbers of competent medical staff, <em>id.</em>, at 937, and would \xe2\x80\x9chire any doctor who had \xe2\x80\x98a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 926.

Indeed, it is a misnomer to call the existing chaos a \xe2\x80\x98medical delivery system\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it is more an act of desperation than a system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record in No. 3:01\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9301351\xe2\x80\x93TEH (ND Cal.), Doc. 1136, p.\xc2\xa05.</p>\n<p align="left">\nA report by the Receiver detailed the impact of overcrowding on efforts to remedy the violation.  The Receiver explained that \xe2\x80\x9covercrowding, combined with staffing shortages, has created a culture of cynicism, fear, and despair which makes hiring and retaining competent clinicians extremely difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1031.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]vercrowding, and the resulting day to day operational chaos of the [prison system], creates regular \xe2\x80\x98crisis\xe2\x80\x99 situations which \xe2\x80\xa6 take time [and] energy \xe2\x80\xa6 away from important remedial programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1035.  Overcrowding had increased the incidence of infectious disease, <em>id</em>., at 1037\xe2\x80\x931038, and had led to rising prison violence and greater reliance by custodial staff on lockdowns, which \xe2\x80\x9cinhibit the delivery of medical care and increase the staffing necessary for such care.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1037.  \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day,\xe2\x80\x9d the Receiver reported, \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia prison wardens and health care managers make the difficult decision as to which of the class actions, <em>Coleman</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 or <em>Plata</em> they will fail to comply with because of staff shortages and patient loads.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1038.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata</em> plaintiffs, believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care could not be achieved without reducing overcrowding, moved their respective District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered under the PLRA to order reductions in the prison population.  The judges in both actions granted the request, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge court.  The State has not challenged the validity of the consolidation in proceedings before this Court, so its propriety is not presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court heard 14 days of testimony and issued a 184-page opinion, making extensive findings of fact.  The court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of the prisons\xe2\x80\x99 design capacity within two years.  Assuming the State does not increase capacity through new construction, the order requires a population reduction of 38,000 to 46,000 persons.  Because it appears all but certain that the State cannot complete sufficient construction to comply fully with the order, the prison population will have to be reduced to at least some extent.  The court did not order the State to achieve this reduction in any particular manner.  Instead, the court ordered the State to formulate a plan for compliance and submit its plan for approval by the court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U.

Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U.

Prisoners are dependent on the State for food, clothing, and necessary medical care.

A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If government fails to fulfill this obligation, the courts have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amendment violation.  See <em>Hutto</em> v. <em>Finney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/678/index.html">437 U. S. 678</a>, 687, n. 9 (1978).  Courts must be sensitive to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as well as the need for deference to experienced and expert prison administrators faced with the difficult and dangerous task of housing large numbers of convicted criminals.

Courts may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts faced with the sensitive task of remedying unconstitutional prison conditions must consider a range of available options, including appointment of special masters or receivers and the possibility of consent decrees.  When necessary to ensure compliance with a constitutional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on a prison\xe2\x80\x99s population.  By its terms, the PLRA restricts the circumstances in which a court may enter an order \xe2\x80\x9cthat has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(g)(4).  The order in this case does not necessarily require the State to release any prisoners.  The State may comply by raising the design capacity of its prisons or by transferring prisoners to county facilities or facilities in other States.  Because the order limits the prison population as a percentage of design capacity, it nonetheless has the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect of reducing or limiting the prison population.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the PLRA, only a three-judge court may enter an order limiting a prison population.  \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(B).  Before a three-judge court may be convened, a district court first must have entered an order for less intrusive relief that failed to remedy the constitutional violation and must have given the defendant a reasonable time to comply with its prior orders.  \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(A).  The party requesting a three-judge court must then submit \xe2\x80\x9cmaterials sufficient to demonstrate that [these requirements] have been met.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(C).

Together, these requirements ensure that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98last resort remedy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a population limit is not imposed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as a first step.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Inmates of Occoquan</em> v. <em>Barry</em>, 844 F.\xc2\xa02d 828, 843 (CADC 1988).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first of these conditions, the previous order requirement of \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(A)(i), was satisfied in <em>Coleman</em> by\xc2\xa0appointment of a Special Master in 1995, and it was satisfied in <em>Plata </em>by approval of a consent decree and stipulated injunction in 2002.  Both orders were intended to remedy the constitutional violations.  Both were given ample time to succeed.  When the three-judge court was convened, 12 years had passed since the appointment of the <em>Coleman </em>Special Master, and 5 years had passed since the approval of the <em>Plata </em>consent decree.  The State does not claim that either order achieved a remedy.  Although the PLRA entitles a State to terminate remedial orders such as these after two years unless the district court finds that the relief \xe2\x80\x9cremains necessary to correct a\ncurrent and ongoing violation of the Federal right,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(b)(3), California has not attempted to obtain relief on this basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State claims instead that the second condition, the reasonable time requirement of \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(A)(ii), was not met because other, later remedial efforts should have been given more time to succeed.  In 2006, the <em>Coleman</em> District Judge approved a revised plan of action calling for construction of new facilities, hiring of new staff, and im-plementation of new procedures.  That same year, the <em>Plata</em> District Judge selected and appointed a Receiver to oversee the State\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing remedial efforts.  When the three-judge court was convened, the Receiver had filed a preliminary plan of action calling for new construction, hiring of additional staff, and other procedural reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although both the revised plan of action in <em>Coleman </em>and the appointment of the Receiver in <em>Plata </em>were new developments in the courts\xe2\x80\x99 remedial efforts, the basic plan to solve the crisis through construction, hiring, and procedural reforms remained unchanged.  These efforts had been ongoing for years; the failed consent decree in <em>Plata </em>had called for implementation of new procedures and hiring of additional staff; and the <em>Coleman </em>Special Master had issued over 70 orders directed at achieving a remedy through construction, hiring, and procedural reforms.  The <em>Coleman </em>Special Master and <em>Plata </em>Receiver were unable to provide assurance that further, substantially similar efforts would yield success absent a population reduction.  Instead, the <em>Coleman </em>Special Master explained that \xe2\x80\x9cmany of the clinical advances \xe2\x80\xa6  painfully accomplished over the past decade are slip-sliding away\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of overcrowding.  App. 481\xe2\x80\x93482.  And the <em>Plata </em>Receiver indicated that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, a successful remedial effort could \xe2\x80\x9call but bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d the State of California.  App. 1053.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having engaged in remedial efforts for 5 years in <em>Plata </em>and 12 in <em>Coleman</em>, the District Courts were not required to wait to see whether their more recent efforts would yield equal disappointment.  When a court attempts to remedy an entrenched constitutional violation through reform of a complex institution, such as this statewide prison system, it may be necessary in the ordinary course to issue multiple orders directing and adjusting ongoing remedial efforts.  Each new order must be given a reasonable time to succeed, but reasonableness must be assessed in light of the entire history of the court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial efforts.  A contrary reading of the reasonable time requirement would in effect require district courts to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit.  This unnecessary period of inaction would delay an eventual remedy and would prolong the courts\xe2\x80\x99 involvement, serving neither the State nor the prisoners.  Congress did not require this unreasonable result when it used the term \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata </em>courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy.  Indeed, although 5 years have now passed since the appointment of the <em>Plata\n</em>Receiver and approval of the revised plan of action in <em>Coleman</em>, there is no indication that the constitutional violations have been cured.  A report filed by the <em>Coleman </em>Special Master in July 2009 describes ongoing violations, including an \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of timely access to appropriate levels of care at every point in the system.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 807.  A report filed by the <em>Plata </em>Receiver in October 2010 likewise describes ongoing deficiencies in the provision of medical care and concludes that there are simply \xe2\x80\x9ctoo many prisoners for the healthcare infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1655.  The <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata </em>courts acted reasonably when they convened a three-judge court without further delay.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a three-judge court has been convened, the court must find additional requirements satisfied before it may impose a population limit.  The first of these requirements is that \xe2\x80\x9ccrowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U.

The court found that overcrowding strains inadequate medical and mental health facilities; overburdens limited clinical and custodial staff; and creates violent, unsanitary, and chaotic conditions that contribute to the constitutional violations and frustrate efforts to fashion a remedy.  The three-judge court also found that \xe2\x80\x9cuntil the problem of overcrowding is overcome it will be impossible to provide constitutionally compliant care to California\xe2\x80\x99s prison population.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 141a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties dispute the standard of review applicable to this determination.  With respect to the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review is necessarily deferential.  It is not this Court\xe2\x80\x99s place to \xe2\x80\x9cduplicate the role\xe2\x80\x9d of the trial court.  <em>Anderson</em>, 470 U. S., at 573.  The ultimate issue of primary cause presents a mixed question of law and fact; but there, too, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mix weighs heavily on the \xe2\x80\x98fact\xe2\x80\x99 side.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lilly</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/116/index.html">527 U.

Because the \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict court is \xe2\x80\x98better positioned\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 to decide the issue,\xe2\x80\x9d our review of the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s primary cause determination is deferential.  <em>Salve Regina College</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/225/index.html">499 U. S. 225</a>, 233 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning demand on the provision of care.  At the time of trial, vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff ranged as high as 20% for surgeons, 25% for physicians, 39% for nurse practitioners, and 54.1% for psychiatrists.  Juris. App. 105a, 108a.  These percentages are based on the number of positions budgeted by the State.  Dr. Ronald Shansky, former medical director of the Illinois prison system, concluded that these numbers understate the se-verity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted sufficient staff to meet demand.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  According to Dr. Shansky, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the prisons were able to fill all of their vacant health care positions, which they have not been able to do to date, \xe2\x80\xa6 the prisons would still be unable to handle the level of need given the current overcrowding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record in No. 2:90\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300520\xe2\x80\x93LKK\xe2\x80\x93JFM (ED Cal.), Doc. 3231\xe2\x80\x9313, p.\xc2\xa016 (hereinafter Doc. 3231\xe2\x80\x9313).  Dr. Craig Haney, a professor of psychology, reported that mental health staff are \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging far larger caseloads than is appropriate or effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 596.  A prison psychiatrist told Dr. Haney that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98we are doing about 50% of what we should be doing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In the context of physical care Dr. Shansky agreed that \xe2\x80\x9cdemand for care, particularly for the high priority cases, continues to overwhelm the resources available.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1408.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even on the assumption that vacant positions could be filled, the evidence suggested there would be insufficient space for the necessary additional staff to perform their jobs.  The <em>Plata</em> Receiver, in his report on overcrowding, concluded that even the \xe2\x80\x9cnewest and most modern prisons\xe2\x80\x9d had been \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned with clinic space which is only one-half that necessary for the real-life capacity of the prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1023 (emphasis deleted).  Dr. Haney reported that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach one of the facilities I toured was short of significant amounts of space needed to perform otherwise critical tasks and responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 597\xe2\x80\x93598.  In one facility, staff cared for 7,525 prisoners in space designed for one-third as many.  Juris. App. 93a.  Staff operate out of converted storage rooms, closets, bathrooms, shower rooms, and visiting centers.  These makeshift facilities impede the effective delivery of care and place the safety of medical professionals in jeopardy, compounding the difficulty of hiring additional staff.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This shortfall of resources relative to demand contributes to significant delays in treatment.  Mentally ill prisoners are housed in administrative segregation while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds for appropriate care.  One correctional officer indicated that he had kept mentally ill prisoners in segregation for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x986 months or more.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 594.  Other prisoners awaiting care are held in tiny, phone-booth sized cages.  The record documents instances of prisoners committing suicide while awaiting treatment.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Delays are no less severe in the context of physical care.  Prisons have backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see a doctor.  Doc. 3231\xe2\x80\x9313, at\xc2\xa018.  A review of referrals for urgent specialty care at one prison revealed that only 105 of 316 pending referrals had a scheduled appointment, and only 2 had an appointment scheduled to occur within 14 days.  <em>Id., </em>at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  Urgent specialty referrals at one prison had been pending for six months to a year.  <em>Id.,\n</em>at 27.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Crowding also creates unsafe and unsanitary living conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and mental health care.  A medical expert described living quarters in converted gymnasiums or dayrooms, where large numbers of prisoners may share just a few toilets and showers, as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98breeding grounds for disease.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Juris. App. 102a.  Cramped conditions promote unrest and violence, making it difficult for prison officials to monitor and control the prison population.  On any given day, prisoners in the general prison population may become ill, thus entering the plaintiff class; and overcrowding may prevent immediate medical attention necessary to avoid suffering, death, or spread of disease.  After one prisoner was assaulted in a crowded gymnasium, prison staff did not even learn of the injury until the prisoner had been dead for several hours.  Tr. 382.  Living in crowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions can cause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.  Crowding may also impede efforts to improve delivery of care.  Two prisoners committed suicide by hanging after being placed in cells that had been identified as requiring a simple fix to remove attachment points that could support a noose.  The repair was not made because doing so would involve removing prisoners from the cells, and there was no place to put them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 769\xe2\x80\x93777.  More gen-erally, Jeanne Woodford, the former acting secretary of California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons, testified that there \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are simply too many issues that arise from such a large number of prisoners,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that, as a result, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98management spends virtually all of its time fighting fires instead of engaging in thoughtful decision-making and planning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the sort needed to fashion an effective remedy for these constitutional violations.  Juris. App. 82a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Increased violence also requires increased reliance on lockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective delivery of care.  In 2006, prison officials instituted 449 lockdowns.  <em>Id.</em>, at 116a.  The average lockdown lasted 12 days, and 20 lockdowns lasted 60 days or longer.  <em>Ibid.</em>  During lockdowns, staff must either escort prisoners to medical facilities or bring medical staff to the prisoners.  Either procedure puts additional strain on already overburdened medical and custodial staff.  Some programming for the mentally ill even may be canceled altogether during lockdowns, and staff may be unable to supervise the delivery of psychotropic medications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The effects of overcrowding are particularly acute in\nthe prisons\xe2\x80\x99 reception centers, intake areas that process 140,000 new or returning prisoners every year.  <em>Id.</em>, at 85a.  Crowding in these areas runs as high as 300% of design capacity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 86a.  Living conditions are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98toxic,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and a lack of treatment space impedes efforts to identify inmate medical or mental health needs and provide even rudimentary care.  <em>Id</em>., at 92a.  The former warden of San Quentin reported that doctors in that prison\xe2\x80\x99s reception center \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98were unable to keep up with physicals or provid[e] any kind of chronic care follow-up.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 90a.  Inmates spend long periods of time in these areas awaiting transfer to the general population.  Some prisoners are held in the reception centers for their entire period of incarceration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary cause of the constitutional violations.  The former warden of San Quentin and former acting secretary of the California prisons concluded that crowding \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it \xe2\x80\x98virtually impossible for the organization to develop, much less implement, a plan to provide prisoners with adequate care.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 83a.  The former executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice testified that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]verything revolves around overcrowding\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98overcrowding is the primary cause of the medical and mental health care violations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 127a.  The former head of corrections in Pennsylvania, Washington, and Maine testified that overcrowding is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98overwhelming the system both in terms of sheer numbers, in terms of the space available, in terms of providing healthcare.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the current secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections testified that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98the biggest inhibiting factor right now in California being able to deliver appropriate mental health and medical care is the severe overcrowding.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 82a.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State attempts to undermine the substantial evidence presented at trial, and the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact, by complaining that the three-judge court did not allow it to present evidence of current prison conditions.  This suggestion lacks a factual basis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court properly admitted evidence of current conditions as relevant to the issues before it.  The three-judge court allowed discovery until a few months before trial; expert witnesses based their conclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court ad-mitted recent reports on prison conditions by the <em>Plata </em>Receiver and <em>Coleman</em> Special Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current conditions, including understaffing, inadequate facilities, and unsanitary and unsafe living conditions.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x938, 19\xe2\x80\x9324.  Dr. Craig Haney, for example, based his expert report on tours of eight California prisons.  App. 539.  These tours occurred as late as August 2008, two weeks before Dr. Haney submitted his report and less than four months before the first day of trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 585; see also <em>id.</em>, at 563, 565, 580 (July tours).  Other experts submitted reports based on similar observations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Doc. 3231\xe2\x80\x9313,\nat 6 (Dr. Shansky); App. 646 (Dr. Stewart); <em>id.</em>, at 1245 (Austin); <em>id.</em>, at 1312 (Lehman).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion cited and relied on this evidence of current conditions.  The court relied extensively on the expert witness reports.  See generally Juris. App. 85a\xe2\x80\x93143a.  The court cited the most current data available on suicides and preventable deaths in the California prisons.  <em>Id.</em>, at 123a, 125a.  The court relied on statistics on staff vacancies that dated to three months before trial, <em>id.</em>, at 105a, 108a, and statistics on shortages of treatment beds for the same period, <em>id.</em>, at 97a.  These are just examples of the extensive evidence of current conditions that informed every aspect of the judgment of the three-judge court.  The three-judge court did not abuse its discretion when it also cited findings made in earlier decisions of the <em>Plata </em>and <em>Coleman </em>District Courts.  Those findings remained relevant to establish the nature of these longstanding, continuing constitutional violations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the three-judge court established a cutoff date for discovery a few months before trial.  The order stated that site inspections of prisons would be allowed until that date, and that evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cchanged prison conditions\xe2\x80\x9d after that date would not be admitted.  App. 1190.  The court also excluded evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a population limit is appropriate under the PLRA, including evidence relevant solely to the existence of an ongoing constitutional violation.  The court reasoned that its decision was limited to the issue of remedy and that the merits of the constitutional violation had already been determined.  The three-judge court made clear that all such evidence would be considered \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the extent that it illuminates questions that are properly before the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 2339.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both rulings were within the sound discretion of the three-judge court.  Orderly trial management may require discovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the merits and the remedy.  The State in fact\nrepresented to the three-judge court that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cap-propriate\xe2\x80\x9d to cut off discovery before trial because \xe2\x80\x9clike plaintiffs, we, too, are really gearing up and going into a pretrial mode.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1683.  And if the State truly believed there was no longer a violation, it could have argued to the <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata </em>District Courts that a three-judge court should not be convened because the District Courts\xe2\x80\x99 prior orders had not \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to remedy the dep-rivation\xe2\x80\x9d of prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(A)(i); see also <em>supra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Once the three-judge court was convened, that court was not required to reconsider the merits.  Its role was solely to consider the propriety and necessity of a population limit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State does not point to any significant evidence that it was unable to present and that would have changed the outcome of the proceedings.  To the contrary, the record and opinion make clear that the decision of the three-judge court was based on current evidence pertaining to ongoing constitutional violations.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court acknowledged that the violations were caused by factors in addition to overcrowding and that reducing crowding in the prisons would not entirely cure the violations.  This is consistent with the reports\nof the <em>Coleman</em> Special Master and <em>Plata</em> Receiver, both\nof whom concluded that even a significant reduction in the prison population would not remedy the violations absent continued efforts to train staff, improve facilities, and reform procedures.  App. 487, 1054.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The three-judge court nevertheless found that overcrowding was the primary cause in the sense of being the foremost cause of the violation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This understanding of the primary cause requirement is consistent with the text of the PLRA.  The State in fact concedes that it proposed this very definition of primary cause to the three-judge court.  \xe2\x80\x9cPrimary\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9c[f]irst or highest in rank, quality, or importance; principal.\xe2\x80\x9d  American Heritage Dictionary<em> </em>1393 (4th ed. 2000); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary<em> </em>1800 (2002) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cfirst in rank or importance\xe2\x80\x9d); 12 Oxford English Dictionary 472 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f the first or highest rank or importance; that claims the first consideration; principal, chief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Overcrowding need only be the foremost, chief, or principal cause of the violation.  If Congress had intended to require that crowding be the only cause, it would have said so, assuming in its judgment that definition would be consistent with constitutional limitations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this case illustrates, constitutional violations in conditions of confinement are rarely susceptible of simple or straightforward solutions.  In addition to overcrowding the failure of California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons to provide adequate medical and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic and worsening budget shortfalls, a lack of political will in favor of reform, inadequate facilities, and systemic administrative failures.  The <em>Plata </em>District Judge, in his order appointing the Receiver, compared the problem to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a spider web, in which the tension of the various strands is determined by the relationship among all the parts of the web, so that if one pulls on a single strand, the tension of the entire web is redistributed in a new and complex pattern.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 966\xe2\x80\x93967 (quoting Fletcher, The Discretionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies and Judicial Legitimacy, 91 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 635, 645 (1982)); see also <em>Hutto</em>, 437 U. S., at 688 (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe interdependence of the con-ditions producing the violation,\xe2\x80\x9d including overcrowd-\ning).  Only a multifaceted approach aimed at many causes, including overcrowding, will yield a solution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The PLRA should not be interpreted to place undue restrictions on the authority of federal courts to fashion practical remedies when confronted with complex and intractable constitutional violations.  Congress limited the availability of limits on prison populations, but it did not forbid these measures altogether.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626.  The House Report accompanying the PLRA explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhile prison caps must be the remedy of last resort, a court still retains the power to order this\nremedy despite its intrusive nature and harmful consequences to the public if, but only if, it is truly\nnecessary to prevent an actual violation of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s federal rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x9321, p.\xc2\xa025 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">\nCourts should presume that Congress was sensitive to the real-world problems faced by those who would remedy constitutional violations in the prisons and that Congress did not leave prisoners without a remedy for violations of their constitutional rights.  A reading of the PLRA that would render population limits unavailable in practice would raise serious constitutional concerns.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/667/index.html">476 U. S. 667</a>, 681, n.\xc2\xa012 (1986).  A finding that overcrowding is the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary cause\xe2\x80\x9d of a violation is therefore permissible, despite the fact that additional steps will be required to remedy the violation.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court was also required to find by clear and convincing evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cno other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(E)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State argues that the violation could have been remedied through a combination of new construction, transfers of prisoners out of State, hiring of medical personnel, and continued efforts by the <em>Plata</em> Receiver and <em>Coleman </em>Special Master.  The order in fact permits the State to comply with the population limit by transferring prisoners to county facilities or facilities in other States, or by constructing new facilities to raise the prisons\xe2\x80\x99 design capacity.  And the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order does not bar the State from undertaking any other remedial efforts.  If the State does find an adequate remedy other than a population limit, it may seek modification or termination of the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order on that basis.  The evidence at trial, however, supports the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that an order limited to other remedies would not provide effective relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail because requiring out-of-state transfers itself qualifies as a population limit under the PLRA.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Such an order \xe2\x80\x9chas the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or \xe2\x80\xa6 directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(g)(4).  The same is true of transfers to county facilities.  Transfers provide a means to reduce the prison population in compliance with the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  They are not a less restrictive alternative to that order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if out-of-state transfers could be regarded as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve overcrowding.  The State complains that the <em>Coleman</em> District Court slowed the rate of transfer by requiring inspections to assure that the receiving institutions were in compliance with the Eighth Amendment, but the State has made no effort to show that it has the resources and the capacity to transfer significantly larger numbers of prisoners absent that condition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Construction of new facilities, in theory, could alleviate overcrowding, but the three-judge court found no realistic possibility that California would be able to build itself out of this crisis.  At the time of the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision the State had plans to build new medical and housing facilities, but funding for some plans had not been secured and funding for other plans had been delayed by the legislature for years.  Particularly in light of California\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing fiscal crisis, the three-judge court deemed \xe2\x80\x9cchimerical\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cremedy that requires significant additional spending by the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 151a.  Events subsequent to the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s decision have confirmed this conclusion.  In October 2010, the State notified the <em>Coleman</em> District Court that a substantial component of its construction plans had been delayed indefinitely by the legislature.  And even if planned construction were to be\ncompleted, the <em>Plata </em>Receiver found that many so-called \xe2\x80\x9cexpansion\xe2\x80\x9d plans called for cramming more prisoners into existing prisons without expanding administrative and support facilities.  Juris. App. 151a\xe2\x80\x93152a.  The former acting secretary of the California prisons explained that these plans would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98compound the burdens imposed on prison administrators and line staff\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by adding to the already overwhelming prison population, creating new barriers to achievement of a remedy.  <em>Id</em>., at 152a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court also rejected additional hiring as a realistic means to achieve a remedy.  The State for years had been unable to fill positions necessary for the adequate provision of medical and mental health care, and the three-judge court found no reason to expect a change.  Although the State points to limited gains in staffing between 2007 and 2008, the record shows that the prison system remained chronically understaffed through trial in 2008.  See <em>supra</em>, at 20.  The three-judge court found that violence and other negative conditions caused by crowding made it difficult to hire and retain needed staff.  The court also concluded that there would be insufficient space for additional staff to work even if adequate personnel could somehow be retained.  Additional staff cannot help to remedy the violation if they have no space in which to see and treat patients.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court also did not err, much less commit clear error, when it concluded that, absent a population reduction, continued efforts by the Receiver and Special Master would not achieve a remedy.  Both the Receiver and the Special Master filed reports stating that overcrowding posed a significant barrier to their efforts.  The <em>Plata </em>Receiver stated that he was determined to achieve\na remedy even without a population reduction, but he warned that such an effort would \xe2\x80\x9call but bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d the State.  App. 1053.  The <em>Coleman</em> Special Master noted even more serious concerns, stating that previous remedial efforts had \xe2\x80\x9csuccumbed to the inexorably rising tide of population.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 489.  Both reports are persuasive evidence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any remedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least require vast expenditures of resources by the State.  Nothing in the long history of the <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Plata </em>actions demonstrates any real possibility that the necessary resources would be made available.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State claims that, even if each of these measures were unlikely to remedy the violation, they would succeed in doing so if combined together.  Aside from asserting this proposition, the State offers no reason to believe it is so.  Attempts to remedy the violations in <em>Plata </em>have been ongoing for 9 years.  In <em>Coleman</em>, remedial efforts<em> </em>have been ongoing for 16.  At one time, it may have been possible to hope that these violations would be cured without a reduction in overcrowding.  A long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evidence of overcrowding\xe2\x80\x99s deleterious effects on the provision of care, compels a different conclusion today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common thread connecting the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed remedial efforts is that they would require the State to expend large amounts of money absent a reduction in overcrowding.  The Court cannot ignore the political and fiscal reality behind this case.  California\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature has not been willing or able to allocate the resources necessary to meet this crisis absent a reduction in overcrowding.  There is no reason to believe it will begin to do so now, when the State of California is facing an unprecedented budgetary shortfall.  As noted above, the legislature recently failed to allocate funds for planned new construction.  <em>Supra</em>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  Without a reduction in overcrowding, there will be no efficacious remedy for the unconsti-tutional care of the sick and mentally ill in California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The PLRA states that no prospective relief shall issue with respect to prison conditions unless it is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of a federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a).  When determining whether these requirements are met, courts must \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court acknowledged that its order \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to affect inmates without medical conditions or serious mental illness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 172a.  This is because reducing California\xe2\x80\x99s prison population will require reducing the number of prisoners outside the class through steps such as parole reform, sentencing reform, use of good-time credits, or other means to be determined by the State.  Reducing overcrowding will also have positive effects beyond facilitating timely and adequate access to medical care, including reducing the incidence of prison violence and ameliorating unsafe living conditions.  According to the State, these collateral consequences are evidence that the order sweeps more broadly than\nnecessary.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The population limit imposed by the three-judge court does not fail narrow tailoring simply because it will have positive effects beyond the plaintiff class.  Narrow tailoring requires a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d between the [remedy\xe2\x80\x99s] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/469/index.html">492 U. S. 469</a>, 480 (1989).  The scope of the remedy must be proportional\nto the scope of the violation, and the order must extend\nno further than necessary to remedy the violation.  This Court has rejected remedial orders that unnecessarily reach out to improve prison conditions other than those that violate the Constitution.  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U. S. 343</a>, 357 (1996).  But the precedents do not suggest that a narrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is invalid simply because it will have collateral effects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does anything in the text of the PLRA require that result.  The PLRA states that a remedy shall extend no further than necessary to remedy the violation of the rights of a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  This means only that the scope of the order must be determined with reference to the consti-tutional violations established by the specific plaintiffs before the court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is unlike cases where courts have impermis-sibly reached out to control the treatment of persons or institutions beyond the scope of the violation.  See <em>Dayton Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Brinkman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/406/index.html">433 U. S. 406</a>, 420 (1977).  Even prisoners with no present physical or mental illness may become afflicted, and all prisoners in California are at risk so long as the State continues to provide inadequate care.  Prisoners in the general population will become sick, and will become members of the plaintiff classes, with rou-\ntine frequency; and overcrowding may prevent the timely diagnosis and care necessary to provide effective treatment and to prevent further spread of disease.  Relief targeted only at present members of the plaintiff classes may therefore fail to adequately protect future class members who will develop serious physical or mental illness.  Prisoners who are not sick or mentally ill do not yet have a claim that they have been subjected to care that violates the Eighth Amendment, but in no sense are they remote bystanders in California\xe2\x80\x99s medical care system.  They are that system\xe2\x80\x99s next potential victims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A release order limited to prisoners within the plaintiff classes would, if anything, unduly limit the ability of State officials to determine which prisoners should be released.  As the State acknowledges in its brief, \xe2\x80\x9crelease of seriously mentally ill inmates [would be] likely to create special dangers because of their recidivism rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consolidated Reply Brief for Appellants 34.  The order of the three-judge court gives the State substantial flexibility to\ndetermine who should be released.  If the State truly be-lieves that a release order limited to sick and mentally ill inmates would be preferable to the order entered by the three-judge court, the State can move the three-judge court for modification of the order on that basis.  The State has not requested this relief from this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than separately assessing the need for a population limit at every institution.  The <em>Coleman </em>court found a systemwide violation when it first afforded relief, and in <em>Plata </em>the State stipulated to systemwide relief when it conceded the existence of a violation.  Both the <em>Coleman</em> Special Master and the <em>Plata</em> Receiver have filed numerous reports detailing systemwide deficiencies in medical and mental health care.  California\xe2\x80\x99s medical care program is run at a systemwide level, and resources are shared among the correctional facilities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order addresses the entire California prison system, it affords the State flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.  There is no requirement that every facility comply with the 137.5% limit.  Assuming no constitutional violation results, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the limit provided other facilities fall sufficiently below it so the system as a whole remains in compliance with the order.  This will allow prison officials to shift prisoners\nto facilities that are better able to accommodate overcrowding, or out of facilities where retaining sufficient medical staff has been difficult.  The alternative\xe2\x80\x94a series of institution-specific population limits\xe2\x80\x94would require federal judges to make these choices.  Leaving this discretion to state officials does not make the order overbroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the order overbroad because it limits the State\xe2\x80\x99s authority to run its prisons, as the State urges in its brief.  While the order does in some respects shape or control the State\xe2\x80\x99s authority in the realm of prison administration, it does so in a manner that leaves much to the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  The State may choose how to allocate prisoners between institutions; it may choose whether to increase the prisons\xe2\x80\x99 capacity through construction or reduce the population; and, if it does reduce the population, it may decide what steps to take to achieve the necessary reduction.  The order\xe2\x80\x99s limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the State implements the order of the three-judge court, time and experience may reveal targeted and effective remedies that will end the constitutional violations even without a significant decrease in the general prison population.  The State will be free to move the three-judge court for modification of its order on that basis, and these motions would be entitled to serious consideration.  See <em>infra</em>, at 45\xe2\x80\x9348.  At this time, the State has not proposed any realistic alternative to the order.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s desire to avoid a population limit, justified as according respect to state authority, creates a certain and unacceptable risk of continuing violations of the rights of sick and mentally ill prisoners, with the result that many more will die or needlessly suffer.  The Constitution does not permit this wrong.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching its decision, the three-judge court gave \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight\xe2\x80\x9d to any potential adverse impact on public safety from its order.  The court devoted nearly 10 days of trial to the issue of public safety, and it gave the question extensive attention in its opinion.  Ultimately, the court concluded that it would be possible to reduce\nthe prison population \xe2\x80\x9cin a manner that preserves public safety and the operation of the criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 247a\xe2\x80\x93248a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a court give \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight\xe2\x80\x9d to public safety does not require the court to certify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the public.  A contrary reading would depart from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text by replacing the word \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whenever a court issues an order requiring the State to adjust its incarceration and criminal justice policy, there is a risk that the order will have some adverse impact on public safety in some sectors.  This is particularly true when the order requires release of prisoners before their sentence has been served.  Persons incarcerated for even one offense may have committed many other crimes prior to arrest and conviction, and some number can be expected to commit further crimes upon release.  Yet the PLRA contemplates that courts will retain authority to issue orders necessary to remedy constitutional violations, including authority to issue population limits when necessary.  See <em>supra</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  A court is required to consider the public safety consequences of its order and to structure, and monitor, its ruling in a way that mitigates those consequences while still achieving an effective remedy of the constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This inquiry necessarily involves difficult predictive judgments regarding the likely effects of court orders.  Although these judgments are normally made by state officials, they necessarily must be made by courts when those courts fashion injunctive relief to remedy serious constitutional violations in the prisons.  These questions are difficult and sensitive, but they are factual questions and should be treated as such.  Courts can, and should, rely on relevant and informed expert testimony when making factual findings.  It was proper for the three-judge court to rely on the testimony of prison officials from California and other States.  Those experts testified on the basis of empirical evidence and extensive experience in\nthe field of prison administration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court credited substantial evidence that prison populations can be reduced in a manner that does not increase crime to a significant degree.  Some evidence indicated that reducing overcrowding in California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons could even improve public safety.  Then-Governor Schwarzenegger, in his emergency proclamation on overcrowding, acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98overcrowding causes harm to people and property, leads to inmate unrest and misconduct, \xe2\x80\xa6 and increases recidivism as shown within this state and in others.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 191a\xe2\x80\x93192a.  The former warden of San Quentin and acting secretary of the California prison system testified that she \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98absolutely believe[s] that we make people worse, and that we are not meeting public safety by the way we treat people.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 129a.  And the head of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s correctional system testified that measures to reduce prison population may \xe2\x80\x9cactually improve on public safety because they address the problems that brought people to jail.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 1552\xe2\x80\x931553.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Expert witnesses produced statistical evidence that prison populations had been lowered without adversely affecting public safety in a number of jurisdictions, including certain counties in California, as well as Wisconsin, Illinois, Texas, Colorado, Montana, Michigan, Florida, and Canada.  Juris. App. 245a.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Washington\xe2\x80\x99s former secretary of corrections testified that his State had implemented population reduction methods, including parole reform and expansion of good time credits, without any \xe2\x80\x9cdeleterious effect on crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 2008\xe2\x80\x932009.  In light of this evidence, the three-judge court concluded that any negative impact on public safety would be \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially offset, and perhaps entirely eliminated, by the public safety benefits\xe2\x80\x9d of a reduction in overcrowding.  Juris. App. 248a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court found that various available methods of reducing overcrowding would have little or no impact on public safety.  Expansion of good-time credits would allow the State to give early release to only those prisoners who pose the least risk of reoffending.  Diverting low-risk offenders to community programs such as drug treatment, day reporting centers, and electronic monitoring would likewise lower the prison population without releasing violent convicts.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The State now sends large numbers of persons to prison for violating a technical term or condition of their parole, and it could reduce the prison population by punishing technical parole violations through community-based programs.  This last measure would be particularly beneficial as it would reduce crowding in the reception centers, which are especially hard hit by overcrowding.  See <em>supra</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s order took account of public safety concerns by giving the State substantial flexibility to select among these and other means of reducing overcrowding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State submitted a plan to reduce its prison population in accordance with the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order, and it complains that the three-judge court approved that\nplan without considering whether the specific measures contained within it would substantially threaten public safety.  The three-judge court, however, left the choice of how best to comply with its population limit to state prison officials.  The court was not required to second-guess the exercise of that discretion.  Courts should presume that state officials are in a better position to gauge how best to preserve public safety and balance competing correctional and law enforcement concerns.  The decision to leave details of implementation to the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretion protected public safety by leaving sensitive policy decisions to responsible and competent state officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact began to implement measures to reduce the prison population.  See Supp. Brief for Appellants 1.  These measures will shift \xe2\x80\x9cthousands\xe2\x80\x9d of prisoners from the state prisons to the county jails by \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] certain felonies punishable by imprisonment in county jail\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] that individuals returned to custody for violating their conditions of parole \xe2\x80\x98serve any custody term in county jail.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  These developments support the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the prison population can be reduced in\na manner calculated to avoid an undue negative effect on public safety.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Establishing the population at which the State could begin to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care, and the appropriate time frame within which to achieve the necessary reduction, requires a degree of judgment.  The inquiry involves uncertain predictions regarding the effects of population reductions, as well as difficult determinations regarding the capacity of prison officials to provide adequate care at various popu-lation levels.  Courts have substantial flexibility when making these judgments.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Once invoked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe scope of a district court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable powers \xe2\x80\xa6 is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hutto</em>, 437 U.

Of course, courts must not confuse professional standards with constitutional requirements.  Rhodes</em> v. <em>Chapman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/337/index.html">452 U. S. 337</a>, 348, n. 13 (1981).  But expert opinion may be relevant when determining what is obtainable and what is acceptable in corrections philosophy.  See <em>supra</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  Nothing in the record indicates that the experts in this case imposed their own policy views or lost sight of the underlying violations.  To the contrary, the witnesses testified that a 130% population limit would allow the State to remedy the constitutionally inadequate provision of medical and mental health care.  When expert opinion is addressed to the question of how to remedy the relevant constitutional violations, as it was here, federal judges can give it considerable weight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has set 130% as a long-term goal for population levels in the federal prison system.  Brief for Appellants 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  The State suggests the expert witnesses impermissibly adopted this professional standard in their testimony.  But courts are not required to disregard expert opinion solely because it adopts or accords with professional standards.  Professional standards may be \xe2\x80\x9chelpful and relevant with respect to some questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chapman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 348, n.\xc2\xa013.  The witnesses testified that a limit of 130% was necessary to remedy the constitutional violations, not that it should be adopted because it is a BOP standard.  If anything, the fact that the BOP views 130% as a manageable population density bolsters the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a population limit of 130% would alleviate the pressures associated with overcrowding and allow the State to begin to provide constitutionally adequate care.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the three-judge court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cevidence in support of a 130% limit is strong,\xe2\x80\x9d it found that some upward adjustment was warranted in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe caution and restraint required by the PLRA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 183a, 184a.  The three-judge court noted evidence supporting a higher limit.  In particular, the State\xe2\x80\x99s Corrections Independent Review Panel had found that 145% was the maximum \xe2\x80\x9coperable capacity\xe2\x80\x9d of California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons, <em>id</em>., at 181a\xe2\x80\x93182a, although the relevance of that determination was undermined by the fact that the panel had not considered the need to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care, as the State itself concedes.  Brief for Coleman Appellees 45.  After considering, but discounting, this evidence, the three-judge court concluded that the evidence supported a limit lower than 145%, but higher than 130%.  It therefore imposed a limit of 137.5%.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This weighing of the evidence was not clearly erroneous.  The adversary system afforded the court an opportunity\nto weigh and evaluate evidence presented by the parties.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidentiary showing was intended to justify a limit of 130%, and the State made no attempt to show that any other number would allow for a remedy.  There are also no scientific tools available to determine the precise population reduction necessary to remedy a constitutional violation of this sort.  The three-judge court made the most precise determination it could in light of the record before it.  The PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied so long as these equitable, remedial judgments are made with the objective of releasing the fewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious remedy.  In light of substantial evidence supporting an even more drastic remedy, the three-judge court complied with the requirement of the PLRA in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court ordered the State to achieve this reduction within two years.  At trial and closing argument before the three-judge court, the State did not argue that reductions should occur over a longer period of time.  The State later submitted a plan for court approval that would achieve the required reduction within five years, and that would reduce the prison population to 151% of design capacity in two years.  The State represented that this plan would \xe2\x80\x9csafely reach a population level of 137.5% over time.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Juris. Statement 32a.  The three-judge court rejected this plan because it did not comply with the deadline set by its order.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State first had notice that it would be required to reduce its prison population in February 2009, when the three-judge court gave notice of its tentative ruling after trial.  The 2-year deadline, however, will not begin to run until this Court issues its judgment.  When that happens, the State will have already had over two years to begin complying with the order of the three-judge court.  The State has used the time productively.  At oral argument, the State indicated it had reduced its prison population\nby approximately 9,000 persons since the decision of the three-judge court.  After oral argument, the State filed a supplemental brief indicating that it had begun to implement measures to shift \xe2\x80\x9cthousands\xe2\x80\x9d of additional prisoners to county facilities.  Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Particularly in light of the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to contest the issue at trial, the three-judge court did not err when\nit established a 2-year deadline for relief.  Plaintiffs proposed a 2-year deadline, and the evidence at trial was intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a 2-year deadline.  See Tr. 2979.  Notably, the State has not asked this Court to extend the 2-year deadline at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court, however, retains the authority, and the responsibility, to make further amendments to the existing order or any modified decree it may enter as warranted by the exercise of its sound discretion.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe power of a court of equity to modify a decree of injunctive relief is long-established, broad, and flexible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New York State Assn</em>.<em> for Retarded Children, Inc.</em> v. <em>Carey</em>, 706 F.\xc2\xa02d 956, 967 (CA2 1983) (Friendly, J.).  A court that invokes equity\xe2\x80\x99s power to remedy a constitutional violation by an injunction mandating systemic changes to an institution has the continuing duty and responsibility to assess the efficacy and consequences of its order.  <em>Id</em>., at 969\xe2\x80\x93971.  Experience may teach the necessity for modification or amendment of an earlier decree.  To that end, the three-judge court must remain open to a showing or demonstration by either party that the injunction should be altered to ensure that the rights and interests of the parties are given all due and necessary protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes require that the three-judge court exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State considerable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans to correct the violations in a prompt and effective way consistent with public safety.  In order to \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A), the three-judge court must give due deference to informed opinions as to what public safety requires, including the considered determinations of state officials regarding\nthe time in which a reduction in the prison population can be achieved consistent with public safety.  An extension of time may allow the State to consider changing political, economic, and other circumstances and to take advantage of opportunities for more effective remedies that arise as the Special Master, the Receiver, the prison system, and the three-judge court itself evaluate the progress being made to correct unconstitutional conditions.  At the same time, both the three-judge court and state officials must bear in mind the need for a timely and efficacious remedy for the ongoing violation of prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State may wish to move for modification of the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order to extend the deadline for the required reduction to five years from the entry of the judgment of this Court, the deadline proposed in the State\xe2\x80\x99s first population reduction plan.  The three-judge court may grant such a request provided that the State satisfies necessary and appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that measures are taken to implement the plan without undue delay.  Appropriate preconditions may include a requirement that the State demonstrate that it has the authority and the resources necessary to achieve the required reduction within a 5-year period and to meet reasonable interim directives for population reduction.  The three-judge court may also condition an extension of time on the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to meet interim benchmarks for improvement in provision of medical and mental health care.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court, in its discretion, may also consider whether it is appropriate to order the State to begin without delay to develop a system to identify prisoners who are unlikely to reoffend or who might otherwise be candidates for early release.  Even with an extension of time to construct new facilities and implement other reforms, it may become necessary to release prisoners to comply with the court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  To do so safely, the State should devise systems to select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public safety.  An extension of time may provide the State a greater opportunity to refine and elab-orate those systems.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State has already made significant progress toward reducing its prison population, including reforms that will result in shifting \xe2\x80\x9cthousands\xe2\x80\x9d of prisoners to county jails.  See Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1.  As the State makes further progress, the three-judge court should evaluate whether its order remains appropriate.  If significant progress is made toward remedying the underlying constitutional violations, that progress may demonstrate that further population reductions are not necessary or are less urgent than previously believed.  Were the State to make this showing, the three-judge court in the exercise of its discretion could consider whether it is appropriate to ex-tend or modify this timeline.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Experience with the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order may also lead the State to suggest other modifications.  The three-judge court should give any such requests serious consideration.  The three-judge court should also formulate its orders to allow the State and its officials the authority necessary to address contingencies that may arise during the remedial process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These observations reflect the fact that the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order, like all continuing equitable decrees, must remain open to appropriate modification.  They are not intended to cast doubt on the validity of the basic premise of the existing order.  The medical and mental health care provided by California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons falls below the standard of decency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment.  This extensive and ongoing constitutional violation requires\na remedy, and a remedy will not be achieved without a reduction in overcrowding.  The relief ordered by the three-judge court is required by the Constitution and was authorized by Congress in the PLRA.  The State shall implement the order without further delay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the three-judge court is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left"><font b="1">A<font b="1" caps="1">ppendiXes</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1" caps="1">\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n18 U.

The three-judge court could not have anticipated this development, and it would be inappropriate for this Court to evaluate its significance for the first time on appeal.  The three-judge court should, of course, consider this and any other evidence of improved conditions when considering future requests by the State for modification of its order.  See <em>infra</em>, at 45\xe2\x80\x9348.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Dr. Craig Haney likewise testified that the State had \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly <em>underestimated </em>the staffing needed to implement critical portions of the <em>Coleman </em>Program Guide requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ckey tasks were omitted when determining staffing workloads,\xe2\x80\x9d and that estimates were based on \xe2\x80\x9ckey assumptions\xe2\x80\x9d that caused the State to underestimate demand for mental health care.

The Receiver nevertheless made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe time this process will take, and the cost and the scope of intrusion by the Federal Court cannot help but increase, and increase in a very significant manner, if the scope and characteristics of [California prison] overcrowding continue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1053.  The <em>Coleman </em>Special Master likewise found that a large release of prisoners, without other relief, would leave the violation \xe2\x80\x9clargely unmitigated\xe2\x80\x9d even though deficiencies in care \xe2\x80\x9care unquestionably exacerbated by overcrowding\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdefendants\xe2\x80\x99 ability to provide required mental health services would be enhanced considerably by a reduction in the overall census\xe2\x80\x9d of the prisons.

In light of the State\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding failure to remedy these serious constitutional violations, the three-judge court was under no obligation to consider voluntary population-reduction measures by the State as a workable alternative to injunctive relief.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The former head of correctional systems in Washington, Maine, and Pennsylvania, likewise referred to California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98criminogenic.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris.

One congressional witness testified that released prisoners committed 79 murders and multiple other offenses.  See Hearing on S. 3 et\xc2\xa0al. before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 45 (1995) (statement of Lynne Abraham, District Attorney of Philadelphia).  Lead counsel for the plaintiff class in that case responded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his inflammatory assertion has never been documented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at\n212 (statement of David Richman).  The Philadelphia decree was also different from the order entered in this case.  Among other things, it \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited the City from admitting to its prisons any additional inmates, except for persons charged with, or convicted of, murder, forcible rape, or a crime involving the use of a gun or knife in the commission of an aggravated assault or robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reeves</em>, 761 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 382, 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (ED Pa. 1991); see also Crime and Justice Research Institute, J. Goldkamp &amp; M. White, Restoring Accountability in Pretrial Release: The Philadelphia Pretrial Release Supervision Experiments 6\xe2\x80\x938 (1998).  The difficulty of determining the precise relevance of Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s experience illustrates why appellate courts defer to the trier of fact.  The three-judge court had the opportunity to hear testimony on population reduction measures in other jurisdictions and to ask relevant questions of informed expert witnesses.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Expanding such community-based measures may require an expenditure of resources by the State to fund new programs or expand existing ones.  The State complains that the order therefore requires it to \xe2\x80\x9cdivert\xe2\x80\x9d savings that will be achieved by reducing the prison population and that setting budgetary priorities in this manner is a \xe2\x80\x9csevere, unlawful intrusion on the State authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellants 55.  This argument is not convincing.  The order does not require the State to use any particular approach to reduce its prison population or allocate its resources.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1" caps="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1" caps="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963499">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBROWN V.

One would think that, before allowing the decree of a federal district court to release 46,000 convicted felons, this Court would bend every effort to read the law in such a way as to avoid that outrageous result.  Today, quite to the contrary, the Court disregards stringently drawn provisions of the governing statute, and traditional constitutional limitations upon the power of a federal judge, in order to uphold the absurd.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proceedings that led to this result were a judicial travesty.  I dissent because the institutional reform the District Court has undertaken violates the terms of the gov-\nerning statute, ignores bedrock limitations on the power\nof Article III judges, and takes federal courts wildly\nbeyond their institutional capacity.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) states that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d; that such relief must be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly drawn, [and] exten[d] no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right\xe2\x80\x9d; and that it must be \xe2\x80\x9cthe least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  In deciding whether these multiple limitations have been complied with, it is necessary to identify with precision what is the \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d that has been alleged.  What has been alleged here, and what the injunction issued by the Court is\ntailored (narrowly or not) to remedy is the running of a prison system with inadequate medical facilities.  That may result in the denial of needed medical treatment to \xe2\x80\x9ca particular [prisoner] or [prisoners],\xe2\x80\x9d thereby violating (ac-cording to our cases) his or their<em> </em>Eighth Amendment rights.  But the mere existence of the inadequate system does not subject to cruel and unusual punishment the entire prison population in need of medical care, including those who receive it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges that the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cdo not base their case on deficiencies in care provided on any one occasion\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]laintiffs rely on systemwide deficiencies in the provision of medical and mental health care that, taken as a whole, subject sick and mentally ill prisoners in California to \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk of serious harm\xe2\x80\x99 and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall below the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa03.  But our judge-empowering \xe2\x80\x9cevolving standards of decency\xe2\x80\x9d jurisprudence (with which, by the way, I heartily disagree, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 615\xe2\x80\x93616 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting))<em> </em>does not prescribe (or at least has not until today prescribed) rules for the \xe2\x80\x9cdecent\xe2\x80\x9d running of schools, prisons, and other government institutions.  It forbids \xe2\x80\x9cindecent\xe2\x80\x9d treatment of individuals\xe2\x80\x94in the context of this case, the <em>denial of medical care</em> to those who need it<em>.  </em>And the persons who have a constitutional claim for denial of medical care are those who are denied medical care\xe2\x80\x94not all who face a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d (whatever that is) of being denied medical care.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Coleman</em> litigation involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe class of seriously mentally ill persons in California prisons,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, and the <em>Plata</em> litigation involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe class of state prisoners with serious medical conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9.  The plaintiffs do not appear to claim\xe2\x80\x94and it would absurd to suggest\xe2\x80\x94that every single one of those prisoners has personally experienced \xe2\x80\x9ctorture or a lingering death,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), as a consequence of that bad medical system.  Indeed, it is inconceivable that anything more than a small proportion of prisoners in\nthe plaintiff classes have personally received sufficiently atrocious treatment that their Eighth Amendment right was violated\xe2\x80\x94which, as the Court recognizes, is why the plaintiffs do not premise their claim on \xe2\x80\x9cdeficiencies in care provided on any one occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa03.  Rather, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim is that they are all part of a medical system so defective that some number of prisoners will inevitably be injured by incompetent medical care, and that this number is sufficiently high so as to render the system, as a whole, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what procedural principle justifies certifying a class of plaintiffs so they may assert a claim of systemic unconstitutionality?  I can think of two possibilities, both of which are untenable.  The first is that although some or most plaintiffs in the class do not <em>individually</em> have viable Eighth Amendment claims, the class as a whole has collectively suffered an Eighth Amendment violation.  That theory is contrary to the bedrock rule that the sole purpose of classwide adjudication is to aggregate claims that are individually viable.  \xe2\x80\x9cA class action, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate suits.  And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties\xe2\x80\x99 legal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision unchanged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co.</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second possibility is that every member of the plaintiff class <em>has</em> suffered an Eighth Amendment violation merely by virtue of being a patient in a poorly-run prison system, and the purpose of the class is merely to aggregate all those individually viable claims.  This theory has the virtue of being consistent with procedural principles, but at the cost of a gross substantive departure from our case law.  Under this theory, each and every prisoner who happens to be a patient in a system that has systemic weaknesses\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9chir[ing] any doctor who had a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94has suffered cruel or unusual punishment, even if that person cannot make an individualized showing of mistreatment.  Such a theory of the Eighth Amendment is preposterous.  And we have said as much in the past: \xe2\x80\x9cIf \xe2\x80\xa6 a healthy inmate who had suffered no deprivation of needed medical treatment were able to claim violation of his constitutional right to medical care \xe2\x80\xa6 simply on the ground that the prison medical facilities were inadequate, the essential distinction between judge and executive would have disappeared: it would have become the function of the courts to assure adequate medical care in prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U. S. 343</a>, 350 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether procedurally wrong or substantively wrong, the notion that the plaintiff class can allege an Eighth Amendment violation based on \xe2\x80\x9csystemwide deficiencies\xe2\x80\x9d is assuredly wrong.  It follows that the remedy decreed here is also contrary to law, since the theory of systemic unconstitutionality is central to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case.  The PLRA requires plaintiffs to establish that the systemwide injunction entered by the District Court was \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly drawn\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextends no further than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to correct \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  If (as is the case) the only viable constitutional claims consist of individual instances of mistreatment, then a remedy reforming the system as a whole goes far beyond what the statute allows.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also worth noting the peculiarity that the vast majority of inmates most generously rewarded by the re-lease order\xe2\x80\x94the 46,000 whose incarceration will be ended\xe2\x80\x94do not form part of any aggrieved class even under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansive notion of constitutional violation.  Most of them will not be prisoners with medical conditions or severe mental illness; and many will undoubtedly be fine physical specimens who have developed intimidating muscles pumping iron in the prison gym.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if I accepted the implausible premise that the plaintiffs have established a systemwide violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment, I would dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of a decrowding order.  That order is an example of what has become known as a \xe2\x80\x9cstructural injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  As I have previously explained, structural injunctions are radically different from the injunctions traditionally issued by courts of equity, and presumably part of \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial Power\xe2\x80\x9d conferred on federal courts by Article III:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe mandatory injunctions issued upon termination of litigation usually required \xe2\x80\x98a single simple act.\xe2\x80\x99  H. McClintock, Principles of Equity \xc2\xa715, pp. 32\xe2\x80\x9333 (2d ed. 1948).  Indeed, there was a \xe2\x80\x98historical prejudice of the court of chancery against rendering decrees which called for more than a single affirmative act.\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xa761, at 160.  And where specific performance of contracts was sought, it was the categorical rule that no decree would issue that required ongoing supervision. . . . Compliance with these \xe2\x80\x98single act\xe2\x80\x99 mandates could, in addition to being simple, be quick; and once it was achieved the contemnor\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the court came to an end, at least insofar as the subject of the order was concerned.  Once the document was turned over or the land conveyed, the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to the court, and the court\xe2\x80\x99s coercive power over the litigant, ceased\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The court did not engage in any ongoing supervision of the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, nor did its order continue to regulate its behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mine Workers</em> v. <em>Bagwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/821/index.html">512 U. S. 821</a>, 841\xe2\x80\x93842 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Structural injunctions depart from that historical practice, turning judges into long-term administrators of\ncomplex social institutions such as schools, prisons, and police departments.  Indeed, they require judges to play a role essentially indistinguishable from the role ordinarily played by executive officials.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision not only affirms the structural injunction but vastly expands its use, by holding that an entire system is unconstitutional because it <em>may produce </em>constitutional violations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The drawbacks of structural injunctions have been described at great length elsewhere.  See, <em>e.g., Lewis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 385\xe2\x80\x93393 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/70/index.html">515 U. S. 70</a>, 124\xe2\x80\x93133 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring); Horowitz, Decreeing Organizational Change: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983 Duke L.\xc2\xa0J. 1265.  This case illustrates one of their most pernicious aspects: that they force judges to engage in a form of factfinding-as-policymaking that is outside the traditional judicial role.  The factfinding judges traditionally engage in involves the determination of past or present facts based (except for a limited set of materials of which courts may take \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial notice\xe2\x80\x9d) exclusively upon\na closed trial record.  That is one reason why a district judge\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings are entitled to plain-error review: because having viewed the trial first hand he is in a better position to evaluate the evidence than a judge reviewing a cold record.  In a very limited category of cases, judges have also traditionally been called upon to make some predictive judgments: which custody will best serve the interests of the child, for example, or whether a particular one-shot injunction will remedy the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s grievance.  When a judge manages a structural injunction, however, he will inevitably be required to make very broad empirical predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy views\xe2\x80\x94the sort of predictions regularly made by legis-lators and executive officials, but inappropriate for the Third Branch.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This feature of structural injunctions is superbly illustrated by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding concerning the decrowding order\xe2\x80\x99s effect on public safety.  The PLRA requires that, before granting \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rospective relief in [a] civil action with respect to prison conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d a court must \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  Here, the District Court discharged that requirement by making the \xe2\x80\x9cfactual finding\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe state has available methods by which it could readily reduce the prison population to 137.5% design capacity or less without an adverse impact on public safety or the operation of the criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. Statement App., O. T. 2009, No. 09-416, p. 253a.  It found the evidence \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d that prison overcrowding would \xe2\x80\x9cperpetuate a criminogenic prison system that itself threatens public safety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 186a, and volunteered its opinion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he population could be reduced even further with the reform of California\xe2\x80\x99s antiquated sentencing policies and other related changes to the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 253a.  It \xe2\x80\x9creject[ed] the testimony that inmates released early from prison would commit additional new crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 200a, finding that \xe2\x80\x9cshortening the length of stay through earned credits would give inmates incentives to participate in programming designed to lower recidivism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 204a, and that \xe2\x80\x9cslowing the flow of technical parole violators to prison, thereby substantially reducing the churning of parolees, would by itself improve both\nthe prison and parole systems, and public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 209a.  It found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe diversion of offenders to community correctional programs has significant beneficial effects on public safety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 214a, and that \xe2\x80\x9cadditional rehabilitative programming would result in a significant population reduction while improving public safety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 216a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court cast these predictions (and the Court today accepts them) as \xe2\x80\x9cfactual findings,\xe2\x80\x9d made in reliance on the procession of expert witnesses that testified at trial.  Because these \xe2\x80\x9cfindings\xe2\x80\x9d have support in the record, it is difficult to reverse them under a plain-error standard of review.  <em>Ante</em>, at 38.  And given that the District Court devoted nearly 10 days of trial and 70 pages of its opinion to this issue, it is difficult to dispute that the District Court has discharged its statutory obligation to give \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the idea that the three District Judges in this case relied solely on the credibility of the testifying expert witnesses is fanciful.  <em>Of course</em> they were relying largely on their own beliefs about penology and recidivism.  And <em>of course</em> different district judges, of different policy views, would have \xe2\x80\x9cfound\xe2\x80\x9d that rehabilitation would not work and that releasing prisoners would increase the crime rate.  I am not saying that the District Judges rendered their factual findings in bad faith.  I am saying that it is impossible for judges to make \xe2\x80\x9cfactual findings\xe2\x80\x9d without inserting their own policy judgments, when the factual findings <em>are </em>policy judgments.  What occurred here is no more judicial factfinding in the ordinary sense than would be the factual findings that deficit spending will not lower the unemployment rate, or that the continued occupation of Iraq will decrease the risk of terrorism.  Yet, because they have been branded \xe2\x80\x9cfactual findings\xe2\x80\x9d entitled to deferential review, the policy preferences of three District Judges now govern the operation of California\xe2\x80\x99s penal system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to recognize that the dressing-up of pol-icy judgments as factual findings is not an error pecu-\nliar to this case.  It is an unavoidable concomitant of institutional-reform litigation.  When a district court issues an injunction, it must make a factual assessment of the anticipated consequences of the injunction.  And when the injunction undertakes to restructure a social institution, assessing the factual consequences of the injunction is necessarily the sort of predictive judgment that our system of government allocates to other government officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges to indulge policy preferences.  They invite judges to indulge <em>incompetent</em> policy preferences.  Three years of law school and familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents give no insight whatsoever into the management of social institutions.  Thus, in the proceeding below the District Court determined that constitutionally adequate medical services could be provided if the prison population was 137.5% of design capacity.  This was an empirical finding it was utterly unqualified to make.  Admittedly, the court did not generate that number entirely on its own; it heard the numbers 130% and 145% bandied about by various witnesses and decided to split the difference.  But the ability of judges to spit back or even average-out numbers spoon-fed to them by expert witnesses does not render them competent decisionmakers in areas in which they are otherwise unqualified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court also relied heavily on the views of the Receiver and Special Master, and those reports play a starring role in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today.  The Court notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Receiver and the Special Master filed reports stating that overcrowding posed a significant barrier to their efforts\xe2\x80\x9d and deems those reports \xe2\x80\x9cpersuasive evidence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any remedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least require vast expenditures of resources by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  The use of these reports is even less consonant with the traditional judicial role than the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the expert testimony at trial.  The latter, even when, as here, it is largely the expression of policy judgments, is at least subject to cross-examination.  Relying on the un-cross-examined findings of an investigator, sent into the field to prepare a factual report and give suggestions on how to improve the prison system, bears no resemblance to ordinary judicial decisionmaking.  It is true that the PLRA contemplates the appointment of Special Masters (although not Receivers), but Special Masters are authorized only to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassist in the development of remedial plans,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(f)(6).  This does not authorize them to make factual findings (unconnected to hearings) that are given seemingly wholesale deference.  Neither the Receiver nor the Special Master was selected by California to run its prisons, and the fact that they may be experts in the field of prison reform does not justify the judicial imposition of their perspectives on the state.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My general concerns associated with judges\xe2\x80\x99 running social institutions are magnified when they run prison systems, and doubly magnified when they force prison officials to release convicted criminals.  As we have previously recognized:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and re-\nform\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]he problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Running a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the com-mitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.  Prison is, moreover, a task that has been committed to the responsibility of those branches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.  Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts have \xe2\x80\xa6 additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html">482 U.

As the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explained earlier this Term, granting a writ of habeas corpus \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98disturbs the State\xe2\x80\x99s significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harrington</em> v. <em>Richter</em>, 562 U.

Recognizing that habeas relief must be granted sparingly, we have reversed the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous grant of habeas relief to individual California prisoners four times this Term alone.  <em>Cullen\n</em>v. <em>Pinholster</em>, 563 U.

And yet here, the Court affirms an order granting the functional equivalent of 46,000 writs of habeas corpus, based on its paean to courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial flexibility when making these judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 41.  It seems that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s respect for state sovereignty has vanished in the case where it most matters.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion includes a bizarre coda noting\nthat \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State may wish to move for modification of the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s order to extend the deadline for the required reduction to five years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  The Dis-trict Court, it says, \xe2\x80\x9cmay grant such a request provided that the State satisfies necessary and appropriate preconditions designed to ensure the measures are taken to implement the plan without undue delay\xe2\x80\x9d; and it gives vague suggestions of what these preconditions \xe2\x80\x9cmay include,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9cinterim benchmarks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 47.  It also invites the District Court to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider whether it is appropriate to order the State to begin without delay to develop a system to identify prisoners who are unlikely to reoffend,\xe2\x80\x9d and informs the State that it \xe2\x80\x9cshould devise systems to select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  (What a good idea!)</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legal effect of this passage is unclear\xe2\x80\x94I suspect intentionally so.  If it is nothing but a polite remainder to the State and to the District Court that the injunction is subject to modification, then it is entirely unnecessary.  As both the State and the District Court are undoubtedly aware, a party is <em>always</em> entitled to move to modify an equitable decree, and the PLRA contains an express provision authorizing District Courts to modify or terminate prison injunctions.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I suspect, however, that this passage is a warning shot across the bow, telling the District Court that it had <em>better</em> modify the injunction if the State requests what we invite it to request.  Such a warning, if successful, would achieve the benefit of a marginal reduction in the inevitable murders, robberies, and rapes to be committed by the released inmates.  But it would achieve that at the expense of in-tellectual bankruptcy, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwarning\xe2\x80\x9d is en-\ntirely alien to ordinary principles of appellate review of injunctions.  When a party moves for modification of\nan injunction, the district court is entitled to rule on that motion first, subject to review for abuse of discretion if it declines to modify the order.  <em>Horne</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10, 20).  Moreover, when a district court enters a new decree with new benchmarks, the selection of those benchmarks is also reviewed under\na deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of review\xe2\x80\x94a point the Court appears to recognize.  <em>Ante</em>, at 45.  Appellate courts are not supposed to \xe2\x80\x9caffirm\xe2\x80\x9d injunctions while preemptively noting that the State \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d request, and the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d grant, a request to extend the State\xe2\x80\x99s deadline to release prisoners by three years based on some suggestions on what appropriate preconditions for such a modification \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d include.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course what is really<em> </em>happening here is that the Court, overcome by common sense, disapproves of the results reached by the District Court, but cannot remedy them (it thinks) by applying ordinary standards of appellate review.  It has therefore selected a solution unknown in our legal system:  A deliberately ambiguous set of suggestions on how to modify the injunction, just deferential enough so that it can say with a straight face that it is \xe2\x80\x9caffirming,\xe2\x80\x9d just stern enough to put the District Court on notice that it will likely get reversed if it does not follow them.  In doing this, the Court has aggrandized itself, grasping authority that appellate courts are not supposed to have, and using it to enact a compromise solution with no legal basis other than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s say-so.  That we are driven to engage in these extralegal activities should be a sign that the entire project of permitting district courts to run prison systems is misbegotten.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But perhaps I am being too unkind.  The Court, or at least a majority of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s majority, must be aware that the judges of the District Court are likely to call its bluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly be an abuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed modifications in an injunction that has just been approved <em>(affirmed)</em> in its present form.  An injunction, after all, does not have to be perfect; only good enough for government work, which the Court today says this <em>is.  </em>So perhaps the coda is nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the hands\xe2\x80\x94making it clear for all to see, that if the terrible things sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous order do happen, they will be none of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility.  After all, did we not want, and indeed even suggest, something better? </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In view of the incoherence of the Eighth Amendment claim at the core of this case, the nonjudicial features of institutional reform litigation that this case exemplifies, and the unique concerns associated with mass prisoner releases, I do not believe this Court can affirm this injunction.  I will state my approach briefly: In my view, a court may not order a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s release unless it determines that the prisoner is suffering from a violation of his constitutional rights, and that his release, and no other relief, will remedy that violation.  Thus, if the court determines that a particular prisoner is being denied constitutionally required medical treatment, and the release of that prisoner (and no other remedy) would enable him to obtain medical treatment, then the court can order his release; but a court may not order the release of prisoners who have suffered no violations of their constitutional rights, merely to make it less likely that that will happen to them in the future.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This view follows from the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s text that I discussed at the outset, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]arrowly drawn\xe2\x80\x9d means that the relief applies only to the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular [prisoner] or [prisoners]\xe2\x80\x9d whose constitutional rights are violated; \xe2\x80\x9cextends no further than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d means that prisoners whose rights are not violated will not obtain relief; and \xe2\x80\x9cleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right\xe2\x80\x9d means that no other relief is available.\xc2\xa0*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I acknowledge that this reading of the PLRA would se-verely limit the circumstances under which a court could issue structural injunctions to remedy allegedly unconstitutional prison conditions, although it would not eliminate them entirely.  If, for instance, a class representing all prisoners in a particular institution alleged that the temperature in their cells was so cold as to violate the Eighth Amendment, or that they were deprived of all exercise time, a court could enter a prisonwide injunction ordering that the temperature be raised or exercise time be provided.  Still, my approach may invite the objection that the PLRA appears to contemplate structural injunctions in general and mass prisoner-release orders in particular.  The statute requires courts to \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief\xe2\x80\x9d and authorizes them to appoint Special Masters, \xc2\xa73626 (a)(1)(A), (f), provisions that seem to presuppose the possibility of a structural remedy.  It also sets forth criteria under which courts may issue orders that have \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prisoner population,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73626(g)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not believe that objection carries the day.  In addition to imposing numerous limitations on the ability of district courts to order injunctive relief with respect to prison conditions, the PLRA states that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to \xe2\x80\xa6 repeal or detract from otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(C).  The PLRA is therefore best understood as an attempt to constrain the discretion of courts issuing structural injunctions\xe2\x80\x94not as a mandate for their use.  For the reasons I have outlined, structural injunctions, especially prisoner-release orders, raise grave separation-of-powers concerns and veer significantly from the historical role and institutional capability of courts.  It is appropriate to construe the PLRA so as to constrain courts from entering injunctive relief that would exceed that role and capability.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order that California release 46,000 prisoners extends \xe2\x80\x9cfurther than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d who have been denied needed medical care.  18 U.

Decisions regarding state prisons have profound public safety and financial implications, and the States are generally free to make these decisions as they choose.  See <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a>, 85 (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eighth Amendment imposes an important\xe2\x80\x94but limited\xe2\x80\x94restraint on state authority in this field.  The Eighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from de-\npriving inmates of \xe2\x80\x9cthe minimal civilized measure of life\xe2\x80\x99s necessities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rhodes </em>v.<em> Chapman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/337/index.html">452 U.

Federal courts have the responsibility to ensure that this constitutional standard is met, but undesirable prison conditions that do not violate the Constitution are beyond the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 reach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, a three-judge court exceeded its authority under the Constitution and the PLRA.  The court ordered a radical reduction in the California prison population without finding that the current population level violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two cases were before the three-judge court, and neither targeted the general problem of overcrowding.  Indeed, the plaintiffs in one of those cases readily acknowledge that the current population level is not itself unconstitutional.  Brief for Coleman Appellees 56.  Both of the cases were brought not on behalf of all inmates subjected to overcrowding, but rather in the interests of much more limited classes of prisoners, namely, those needing mental health treatment and those with other serious medical needs.  But these cases were used as a springboard to implement a criminal justice program far different from that chosen by the state legislature.  Instead of crafting a remedy to attack the specific constitutional violations that were found\xe2\x80\x94which related solely to prisoners in the two plaintiff classes\xe2\x80\x94the lower court issued a decree that will at best provide only modest help to those prisoners but that is very likely to have a major and deleterious effect on public safety.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court ordered the premature release of approximately <em>46,000 criminals\xe2\x80\x94the equivalent of three Army divisions.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The approach taken by the three-judge court flies in the face of the PLRA.  Contrary to the PLRA, the court\xe2\x80\x99s remedy is not narrowly tailored to address proven and ongoing constitutional violations.  And the three-judge court violated the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s critical command that any court con-\ntemplating a prisoner release order must give \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  The three-judge court would have us believe that the early release of 46,000 inmates will not imperil\xe2\x80\x94and will actually improve\xe2\x80\x94public safety.  Juris. Statement App., O.\xc2\xa0T. 2009, No. 09\xe2\x80\x93416, pp. 248a\xe2\x80\x93249a (hereinafter Juris. App.).  Common sense and experience counsel greater caution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would reverse the decision below for three interrelated reasons.  First, the three-judge court improperly refused\nto consider evidence concerning present conditions in the California prison system.  Second, the court erred in holding that no remedy short of a massive prisoner release can bring the California system into compliance with the Eighth Amendment.  Third, the court gave inadequate weight to the impact of its decree on public safety.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the PLRA and general principles concerning injunctive relief dictate that a prisoner release order cannot properly be issued unless the relief is necessary to remedy an ongoing violation.  Under the PLRA, a prisoner release may be decreed only if crowding \xe2\x80\x9c<em>is</em> the primary cause\xe2\x80\x9d of an Eighth Amendment violation and only if no other re-\nlief \xe2\x80\x9c<em>will</em> remedy\xe2\x80\x9d the violation.  \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(E) (emphasis added).  This language makes it clear that proof of past violations alone is insufficient to justify a court-ordered prisoner release.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in cases not governed by the PLRA, we have held that an inmate seeking an injunction to prevent a violation of the Eighth Amendment must show that prison officials are \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and unreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of harm, and that they will continue to do so \xe2\x80\xa6 into the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/825/index.html">511 U. S. 825</a>, 846 (1994).  The \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate indifference\xe2\x80\x9d needed to establish an Eighth Amendment violation must be examined \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the prison authorities\xe2\x80\x99 current attitudes and conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Helling </em>v.<em> McKinney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/25/index.html">509 U.

Proof of past violations will not do; nor is it sufficient simply\nto establish that <em>some </em>violations continue.  The scope of permissible relief depends on the scope of any continuing violations, and therefore it was essential for the three-judge court to make a reliable determination of the extent of any violations as of the time its release order was issued.  Particularly in light of the radical nature of its chosen remedy, nothing less than an up-to-date assessment was tolerable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court, however, relied heavily on outdated information and findings and refused to permit California to introduce new evidence.  Despite evidence of improvement,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the three-judge court relied on old findings made by the single-judge courts, see Juris. App. 76a\xe2\x80\x9377a, including a finding made <em>14 years earlier</em>, see <em>id.,</em> at 170a<em> </em>(citing <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 912 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1282, 1316, 1319 (ED Cal. 1995)).

But the State\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to file such a motion did not eliminate the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to ensure that its relief was necessary to remedy ongoing violations.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Moreover, the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning did not properly take into account the potential significance of the evidence that the State sought to introduce.  Even if that evidence did not show that all violations had ceased\xe2\x80\x94the showing needed to obtain the termination of relief under \xc2\xa73626(b)\xe2\x80\x94that evidence was highly relevant with respect to the nature and scope of permissible relief.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority approves the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to receive fresh evidence based largely on the need for \xe2\x80\x9c[o]rderly trial management.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  The majority reasons that the three-judge court had closed the book on the question of constitutional violations and had turned to\nthe question of remedy.  <em>Ibid</em>.  As noted, however, the ex-\ntent of any continuing constitutional violations was highly relevant to the question of remedy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also countenances the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on dated findings.  The majority notes that the lower court considered recent reports by the Special Master and Receiver, <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, but the majority provides no persuasive justification for the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to receive hard, up-to-date evidence about any continuing violations.  With the safety of the people of California in the balance, the record on this issue should not have been closed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority repeats the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s error of reciting statistics that are clearly out of date.  The Court notes\nthe lower court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that as of 2005 \xe2\x80\x9can inmate in one of California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons needlessly dies every six to seven days.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 9.  Yet by the date of the trial before the three-judge court, the death rate had been trending downward for 10 quarters, App. 2257, and the number of likely preventable deaths fell from 18 in 2006 to 3 in 2007, a decline of 83 percent.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Between 2001 and 2007, the California prison system had the 13th lowest average mortality rate of all 50 state systems.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority highlights past instances in which particular prisoners received shockingly deficient medical care.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5, 6\xe2\x80\x937, 10 (recounting five incidents).  But such anecdotal evidence cannot be given undue weight in assessing the current state of the California system.  The population of the California prison system (156,000 inmates at the time of trial) is larger than that of many medium-sized cities,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and an examination of the medical care provided to the residents of many such cities would likely reveal cases in which grossly deficient treatment was provided.  Instances of past mistreatment in the California system are relevant, but prospective relief must be tailored to present and future, not past, conditions.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the PLRA, a court may not grant any prospective relief unless the court finds that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of [a] Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  In addition, the PLRA prohibits the issuance of a prisoner release order unless the court finds \xe2\x80\x9cby clear and convincing evidence that \xe2\x80\xa6 crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cno other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(E).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These statutory restrictions largely reflect general standards for injunctive relief aimed at remedying constitutional violations by state and local governments.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe power of the federal courts to restructure the operation of local and state governmental entities is not plenary. \xe2\x80\xa6 Once a constitutional violation is found, a federal court is required to tailor the scope of the remedy to fit the nature and extent of the constitutional violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dayton Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Brinkman, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/406/index.html">433 U. S. 406</a>, 419\xe2\x80\x93420 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the majority and the court below maintain that no remedy short of a massive release of prisoners from the general prison population can remedy the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide constitutionally adequate health care.  This argument is implausible on its face and is not supported by the requisite clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is instructive to consider the list of deficiencies in the California prison health care system that are highlighted in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for this Court and in the opinion of the court below.  The deficiencies noted by the majority here include the following: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]xam tables and counter tops, where prisoners with \xe2\x80\xa6 communicable diseases are treated, [are] not routinely disinfected,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10; medical facilities \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are in an abysmal state of disrepair,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> medications \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are too often not available when needed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311; \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[b]asic medical equipment is often not available or used,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10; prisons \xe2\x80\x9cwould \xe2\x80\x98hire any doctor who had \xe2\x80\x9ca license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> and medical and mental health staff positions have high vacancy rates, <em>ante,</em> at 20.  The three-judge court pointed to similar problems.  See Juris. App. 93a\xe2\x80\x93121a (citing, among other things, staffing vacancies, too few beds for mentally ill prisoners, and an outmoded records management system).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is it plausible that none of these deficiencies can be remedied without releasing 46,000 prisoners?  Without taking that radical and dangerous step, exam tables and counter tops cannot properly be disinfected?  None of the system\xe2\x80\x99s dilapidated facilities can be repaired?  Needed medications and equipment cannot be purchased and used?  Staff vacancies cannot be filled?  The qualifica-\ntions of prison physicians cannot be improved?  A better records management system cannot be developed and implemented?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not dispute that general overcrowding <em>contributes </em>to many of the California system\xe2\x80\x99s healthcare problems.  But it by no means follows that reducing overcrowding is the only or the best or even a particularly good way to alleviate those problems.  Indeed, it is apparent that the prisoner release ordered by the court below is poorly suited for this purpose.  The release order is not limited to prisoners needing substantial medical care but instead calls for a reduction in the system\xe2\x80\x99s overall population.  Under the order issued by the court below, it is not necessary for\na single prisoner in the plaintiff classes to be released.  Although some class members will presumably be among those who are discharged, the decrease in the number of prisoners needing mental health treatment or other forms of extensive medical care will be much smaller than the total number of prisoners released, and thus the release will produce at best only a modest improvement in the burden on the medical care system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record bears this out.  The Special Master stated dramatically that even releasing 100,000 inmates (two-thirds of the California system\xe2\x80\x99s entire inmate population!) would leave the problem of providing mental health treatment \xe2\x80\x9clargely unmitigated.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 487.  Similarly, the Receiver proclaimed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98those \xe2\x80\xa6 who think that population controls will solve California\xe2\x80\x99s prison health care problems \xe2\x80\xa6 are simply wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 282a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State proposed several remedies other than a massive release of prisoners, but the three-judge court, seemingly intent on attacking the broader problem of general overcrowding, rejected all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposals.  In doing so, the court made three critical errors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the court did not assess those proposals and other remedies in light of conditions proved to exist at the time the release order was framed.  Had more recent evidence been taken into account, a less extreme remedy might have been shown to be sufficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the court failed to distinguish between conditions that fall below the level that may be desirable as a matter of public policy and conditions that do not meet the minimum level mandated by the Constitution.  To take one example, the court criticized the California system because prison doctors must conduct intake exams in areas separated by folding screens rather than in separate rooms, creating conditions that \xe2\x80\x9cdo not allow for appropriate confidentiality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 88a.  But the legitimate privacy expectations of inmates are greatly diminished, see<em> Hudson </em>v.<em> Palmer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/517/index.html">468 U. S. 517</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (1984), and this Court has never suggested that the failure to provide private consultation rooms in prisons amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the court rejected alternatives that would not have provided \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98immediate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d relief.  Juris. App. 148a.  But nothing in the PLRA suggests that public safety may be sacrificed in order to implement an immediate remedy rather than a less dangerous one that requires a more extended but reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the three-judge court had not made these errors, it is entirely possible that an adequate but less drastic remedial plan could have been crafted.  Without up-to-date information, it is not possible to specify what such a plan might provide, and in any event, that is not a task that should be undertaken in the first instance by this Court.  But possible components of such a plan are not hard to identify.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many of the problems noted above plainly could be addressed without releasing prisoners and without in-\ncurring the costs associated with a large-scale prison construction program.  Sanitary procedures could be improved; sufficient supplies of medicine and medical equipment could be purchased; an adequate system of records management could be implemented; and the number of medical and other staff positions could be increased.  Similarly, it is hard to believe that staffing vacancies cannot be reduced or eliminated and that the qualifications of medical personnel cannot be improved by any means short of a massive prisoner release.  Without specific findings backed by hard evidence, this Court should not accept the counterintuitive proposition that these problems cannot be ameliorated by increasing salaries, improving working conditions, and providing better training and monitoring of performance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the cost of a large-scale construction program may well exceed California\xe2\x80\x99s current financial capabilities, a more targeted program, involving the repair and perhaps the expansion of current medical facilities (as opposed to general prison facilities), might be manageable.  After all, any remedy in this case, including the new programs associated with the prisoner release order and other proposed relief now before the three-judge court, will necessarily involve some state expenditures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Measures such as these might be combined with targeted reductions in critical components of the State\xe2\x80\x99s prison population.  A certain number of prisoners in the classes on whose behalf the two cases were brought might be transferred to out-of-state facilities.  The three-judge court rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to transfer prisoners to out-of-state facilities in part because the number of proposed transfers was too small.  See <em>id.,</em> at 160a.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 30.  But this reasoning rested on the court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on a reduction in the State\xe2\x80\x99s general prison population rather than the two plaintiff classes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the State proposed to make a targeted transfer of prisoners in one of the plaintiff classes (<em>i.e.,</em> prisoners needing mental health treatment), one of the District Judges blocked the transfers for fear that the out-of-state facilities would not provide a sufficiently high level of care.  See App. 434\xe2\x80\x93440.  The District Judge even refused to allow out-of-state transfers for prisoners who volunteered for relocation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 437.  And the court did this even though there was not even an allegation, let alone clear evidence, that the States to which these prisoners would have been sent were violating the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Judge presumed that the receiving States might fail to provide constitutionally adequate care, but \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [public officers] have properly discharged their official duties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Armstrong</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/456/index.html">517 U.

Plaintiffs proposed not only a systemwide population cap, but also a lower population cap for inmates in specialized programs.  Tr. 2915:12\xe2\x80\x9315 (Feb. 3, 2009).  The three-judge court rejected this proposal, and its response exemplified what went wrong in this case.  One judge complained that this remedy would be deficient because it would protect only the members of the plaintiff classes.  The judge stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is we would be protecting the class members.  And maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s the appropriate thing to do.  I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this case is about, but it would be \xe2\x80\xa6 difficult for me to say yes, and the hell with everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2915:23\xe2\x80\x932916:2.</p>\n<p align="left">\nOverstepping his authority, the judge was not content to provide relief for the classes of plaintiffs on whose behalf the suit before him was brought.  Nor was he content to remedy the only constitutional violations that were proved\xe2\x80\x94which concerned the treatment of the members of those classes.  Instead, the judge saw it as his responsibility to attack the general problem of overcrowding.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before ordering any prisoner release, the PLRA commands a court to \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A).  This provision unmistakably reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 view that prisoner release orders are inherently risky.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In taking this view, Congress was well aware of the impact of previous prisoner release orders.  The prisoner release program carried out a few years earlier in Philadelphia is illustrative.  In the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, federal courts enforced a cap on the number of inmates in the Philadelphia prison system, and thousands of inmates were set free.  Although efforts were made to release only those prisoners who were least likely to commit violent crimes, that attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful.  During an 18-month period, the Philadelphia police rearrested thousands of these prisoners for committing 9,732 new crimes.  Those defendants were charged with 79 murders, 90 rapes, 1,113 assaults, 959 robberies, 701 burglaries, and 2,748 thefts, not to mention thousands of drug offenses.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Members of Congress were well aware of this experience.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the record of past prisoner release orders, the three-judge court in this case concluded that loosing 46,000 criminals would not produce a tally like that in Philadelphia and would actually improve public safety.  Juris. App. 248a\xe2\x80\x93249a.  In reaching this debatable con-\nclusion, the three-judge court relied on the testimony of selected experts, <em>id</em>., at 248a, and the majority now defers to what it characterizes as the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact on this controversial public policy issue, <em>ante</em>, at 15, 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a fundamental and dangerous error.  When a trial court selects between the competing views of experts on broad empirical questions such as the efficacy of\npreventing crime through the incapacitation of convicted criminals, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s choice is very different from a classic finding of fact and is not entitled to the same degree of deference on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The particular three-judge court convened in this case was \xe2\x80\x9cconfident\xe2\x80\x9d that releasing 46,000 prisoners pursuant to its plan \xe2\x80\x9cwould in fact benefit public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 248a\xe2\x80\x93249a.  According to that court, \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence\xe2\x80\x9d supported this purported finding.  <em>Id., </em>at 232a.  But a more cautious court, less bent on implementing its own criminal justice agenda, would have at least acknowledged that the consequences of this massive prisoner release cannot be ascertained in advance with any degree of certainty and that it is entirely possible that this release will produce results similar to those under prior court-ordered population caps.  After all, the sharp increase in the California prison population that the three-judge court lamented, see <em>id.,</em> at 254a, has been accompanied by an equally sharp decrease in violent crime.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  These California trends mirror similar developments at the national level,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is a general consensus that the decline in crime is, at least in part, due to more and longer prison sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  If increased incarceration in California has led to decreased crime, it is entirely possible that a decrease in imprisonment will have the opposite effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Commenting on the testimony of an expert who stated that he could not be certain about the effect of the massive prisoner discharge on public safety, the three-judge court complained that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch equivocal testimony is not helpful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 247a.  But testimony pointing out the difficulty of assessing the consequences of this drastic remedy would have been valued by a careful court duly mindful of the overriding need to guard public safety.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge court acknowledged that it \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not evaluated the public safety impact of each individual element\xe2\x80\x9d of the population reduction plan it ordered the State to implement.  App. to Juris. Statement 3a.  The majority argues that the three-judge court nevertheless gave substantial weight to public safety because its order left \xe2\x80\x9cdetails of implementation to the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 41.  Yet the State had told the three-judge court that, after studying possible population reduction measures, it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9creducing the prison population to 137.5% within a two-year period cannot be accomplished without unacceptably compromising public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. App. 317a.  The State found that public safety required a 5-year period in which to achieve the ordered reduction.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the three-judge court approved a population reduction plan that neither it nor the State found could be implemented without unacceptable harm to public safety.  And this Court now holds that the three-judge court discharged its obligation to \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73626(a)(1)(A), by deferring to officials who did not believe the reduction could be accomplished in a safe manner.  I do not believe the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s public-safety requirement is so trivial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The members of the three-judge court and the experts on whom they relied may disagree with key elements of the crime-reduction program that the State of California has pursued for the past few decades, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe shift to inflexible determinate sentencing and the passage of harsh mandatory minimum and three-strikes laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 254a.  And experts such as the Receiver are entitled to take the view that the State should \xe2\x80\x9cre-thin[k] the place of incarceration in its criminal justice system,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 489.  But those controversial opinions on matters of criminal justice policy should not be permitted to override the reasonable policy view that is implicit in the PLRA\xe2\x80\x94that prisoner release orders present an inherent risk to the safety of the public.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prisoner release ordered in this case is unprecedented, improvident, and contrary to the PLRA.

See \xc2\xa73626(a)(3)(A)(i).  The District Courts granted plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motions to convene a three-judge court in 2007, three years before the remedial decree here was issued.  Thus, the conditions in the prison system as of the date when the decree was issued were not necessarily the same as those that existed before the three-judge court proceedings began.  Moreover, as noted above, even if all of the violations in the system had not been cured at the time of the remedial decree, an accurate assessment of conditions as of that date was essential in order to ensure that the relief did not sweep more broadly than necessary.  </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa02008 Death Reviews 22.
