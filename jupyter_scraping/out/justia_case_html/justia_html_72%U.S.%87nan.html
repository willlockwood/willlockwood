JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The litigation to establish the liability of the <em>Ross</em> was troublesome and expensive to the Corn Exchange Company.  Mr. Woodworth did not in any manner aid or offer to aid in it.  His interest was against the liability which the company sought to establish, for if the <em>Ross</em> was declared not liable, he received these proceeds and remnants as mortgagee of that vessel.  But after permitting his own libel to sleep during this struggle, he attempts, when it is over, to revive that libel, and claims to share in the fruits of a victory won without his aid, and against his wishes.  The district and circuit courts both thought he was not entitled to do this so long as the Corn Exchange Company remained unpaid.  In this view we concur. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/72/87/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>Our remarks are meant to apply to the libel filed April 1, 1863.  But all that we have said in reference to that libel applies with additional force to the one filed 14 April, 1864, arising from the longer delay in asserting the claim.</p>\n<p><em>Decrees affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n<p>* <em>See The Saracen,</em> 6 Moore P.C. 56; <em>The Clara,</em> 1 Swabey 1.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
