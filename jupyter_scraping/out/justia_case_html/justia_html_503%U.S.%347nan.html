Among its requisite features, an approved plan must provide that it "shall be in effect in all" of a State\'s political subdivisions and "be mandatory upon them," 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671 (a)(3), and that "reasonable efforts will be made" to prevent removal of children from their homes and to facilitate reunification of families where removal has occurred, \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15). Respondents, child beneficiaries of the Act, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that petitioners, the Director and the Guardianship Administrator of the Illinois agency responsible for investigating charges of child abuse and neglect and providing services for abused and neglected children and their families, had failed to make reasonable efforts to preserve and reunite families, in contravention of \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15). The District Court denied petitioners\' motion to dismiss, holding, <i>inter alia, </i>that the Act contained an implied cause of action and that suit could also be brought under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983. The court entered an injunction against petitioners, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. That court relied on <i>Wilder </i>v. <i>Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 </i>U.

Respondents err in basing their \xc2\xa7 1983 argument, in part, on \xc2\xa7 671 (a) (3)\'s "in effect" language, which is directed to the requirement that the plan apply to all of a State\'s political subdivisions and is not intended to otherwise modify the word "plan." Unlike the Medicaid legislation in <i>Wilder, </i>supra-which actually required the States to adopt reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates for health care providers and which, along with regulations, set forth in some detail the factors to be considered in determining the methods for calculating rates-here, the statute provides no further guidance as to how "reasonable efforts" are to be measured, and, within broad limits, lets the State decide how to comply with the directive. Since other sections of the Act provide mechanisms for the Secretary to enforce the "reasonable efforts" clause, the absence of a \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy does not make the clause a dead letter. The regulations also are not specific and provide no notice that failure to do anything other than submit a plan with the requisite features is a further condition on the receipt of federal funds.

S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 620-628, 670-679a, either under the Act itself or through an action under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983.1 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15) contained an implied right of action, and that respondents could enforce this section of the Act through an action brought under \xc2\xa7 1983 as well. We hold that the Act does not create an enforceable right on behalf of respondents.</p><p>The Adoption Act establishes a federal reimbursement program for certain expenses incurred by the States in ad-</p><p>of Washington, and <i>Mario </i><i>J. </i><i>Palumbo, </i>Attorney General of West Virginia; and for the Council of State Governments et al. by <i>Richard Ruda </i>and <i>Charles Rothfeld.</i></p><p>Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the American Association for Protecting Children et al. by James D.

The Act provides that States will be reimbursed for a percentage of foster care and adoption assistance payments when the State satisfies the requirements of the Act. 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 672-674, 675(4)(A) (1988 ed. and Supp. I).</p><p>To participate in the program, States must submit a plan to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for approval by the Secretary. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 670, 671. Section 671 lists 16 qualifications which state plans must contain in order to gain the Secretary\'s approval. As relevant here, the Act provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"(a) Requisite features of State plan</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"In order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(3) provides that the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by them, be mandatory upon them;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(15) effective October 1, 1983, provides that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home .... " \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 671(a)(3), (15).</p></blockquote><p>Petitioners in this action are Sue Suter and Gary T. Morgan, the Director and the Guardianship Administrator, respectively, of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). DCFS is the state agency responsible for, among other things, investigating charges of child abuse and neglect and providing services to abused and neglected children and their families. DCFS is authorized under Illinois law, see Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, , 802-1 <i>et seq. </i>(1989), to gain temporary custody of an abused or neglected child after a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="352">352</a></p><p>hearing and order by the Juvenile Court. Alternatively, the court may order that a child remain in his home under a protective supervisory order entered against his parents. See <i>Artist M. </i>v. <i>Johnson, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/917/980/">917 F.2d 980</a>, 982-983 (CA7 1990). Once DCFS has jurisdiction over a child either in its temporary custody, or in the child\'s home under a protective order, all services are provided to the child and his family by means of an individual caseworker at DCFS to whom the child\'s case is assigned. App. 35-39.</p><p>Respondents filed this class-action suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the Adoption Act.2 They alleged that petitioners, in contravention of 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15), failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of children from their homes and to facilitate reunification of families where removal had occurred.3 This failure occurred, as alleged by respondents, because DCFS failed promptly to assign caseworkers to children placed in DCFS custody and promptly to reassign cases when caseworkers were on leave from DCFS. App. 6-8. The District Court, without objection from petitioners, certified two separate classes seeking relief, including all children who are or will be wards of DCFS and are placed in foster care or remain in their homes under a judicial protective order.4 <i>Artist M. </i>v.</p><p>2 Count III of the complaint alleged that petitioners violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. App. 26. This count was dismissed by the District Court and was not appealed. <i>Artist M. </i>v. <i>Johnson, 917</i></p><p>3 Although DCFS administers the child welfare program for the entire State of Illinois, respondents only alleged violations of the Adoption Act as to Cook County. App. 6.</p><p>4 Specifically, the following classes were certified by the District Court:</p><p>"Class A: Children who are or will be the subjects of neglect, dependency or abuse petitions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Juvenile Division (\'Juvenile Court\'), who are or will be in the custody of [DCFS] or in</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="353">353</a></p><p><i>Johnson, </i>726 F. Supp. 690, 691 (ND Ill. 1989). The District Court denied a motion to dismiss filed by petitioners, holding, as relevant here, that the Adoption Act contained an implied cause of action and that suit could also be brought to enforce the Act under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983. 726 F. Supp., at 696,697.</p><p>The District Court then entered an injunction requiring petitioners to assign a caseworker to each child placed in DCFS custody within three working days of the time the case is first heard in Juvenile Court, and to reassign a caseworker within three working days of the date any caseworker relinquishes responsibility for a particular case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a. The 3-working-day deadline was found by the District Court to "realistically refiec[t] the institutional capabilities of DCFS," <i>id., </i>at 55a, based in part on petitioners\' assertion that assigning caseworkers within that time frame "would not be overly burdensome." <i>Id., </i>at 54a. The District Court, on partial remand from the Court of Appeals, made additional factual findings regarding the nature of the delays in assigning caseworkers and the progress of DCFS reforms at the time the preliminary injunction was entered. App. 28-50.</p><p>The Court of Appeals affirmed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/917/980/">917 F.2d 980</a> (CA7 1990).</p><p>Relying heavily on this Court\'s decision in <i>Wilder </i>v. <i>Virginia Hospital Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html">496 U.

Supp. 690, 691 (ND Ill. 1989).</p><p>The "Class B" plaintiffs only raised a constitutional due process claim, which was dismissed by the District Court.

S. 66</a> (1975), also found that the Adoption Act created an implied right of action such that private individuals could bring suit directly under the Act to enforce the provisions relied upon by respondents. 917 F. 2d, at 989-991. We granted certiorari, 500 U. S. 915 (1991), and now reverse.6</p><p>5 The Court of Appeals also noted that the Fourth Circuit, in <i>L. </i><i>J. </i><i>ex rel.</i></p><p><i>Darr </i>v. <i>Massinga, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/838/118/">838 F.2d 118</a> (1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1018 (1989), had found the substantive requirements listed in \xc2\xa7 671(a) to be enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983. 917 F. 2d, at 988.</p><p>Several cases have addressed the enforceability of various sections of the Adoption Act. See, <i>e. g., Massinga, supra, </i>at 123 (finding case plan requirements enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983); <i>Lynch </i>v. <i>Dukakis, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/719/504/">719 F.2d 504</a> <i>(CA1 </i>1983) (same); <i>Norman </i>v. <i>Johnson, </i>739 F. Supp. 1182 (ND Ill. 1990) (finding "reasonable efforts" clause enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983); <i>B. H. </i>v. <i>Johnson, </i>715 F. Supp. 1387, 1401 (ND Ill. 1989) (finding "reasonable efforts" clause not enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983).</p><p>6 Subsequent to oral argument, respondents notified the Court of the entry of a consent decree in the case of <i>B. H. </i>v. <i>Suter, </i>No. <i>88-C </i>5599 (ND Ill.), which they suggest may affect our decision on the merits, or indeed may make the instant action moot. We find no merit to respondents\' contentions, and conclude that the <i>B. H. </i>consent decree has no bearing on the issue the Court decides today. Sue Suter, petitioner in this case, is the defendant in the <i>B. H. </i>suit, which alleges statewide deficiencies in the operations of DCFS. See <i>B. H. </i>v. <i>Johnson, supra. </i>The class approved in <i>B. H. </i>contains "all persons who are or will be in the custody of [DCFS] and who have been or will be placed somewhere other than with their parents." 715 F. Supp., at 1389.</p><p>Respondents suggest that because petitioner has agreed in the <i>B. H. </i>consent decree to provide "reasonable efforts" to maintain and reunify families, she is somehow precluded from arguing in this case that \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15) does not grant a right for individual plaintiffs to enforce that section by suit.

C. \xc2\xa7 6010 (1976 ed. and Supp. III), did not confer an implied cause of action. That statute, as well as the statute before us today, was enacted by Congress pursuant to its spending power.7 In <i>Pennhurst, </i>we noted that it was well established that Congress has the power to fix the terms under which it disburses federal money to the States. 451 U.

But this, obviously, is not the end of the matter. The opinions in both <i>Wright </i>and <i>Wilder </i>took pains to analyze the statutory provisions in detail, in light of the entire legislative enactment, to determine whether the language in question created "enforceable rights, privileges, or immunities within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983." <i>Wright, supra, </i>at 423. And in <i>Wilder, </i>we caution that" \'[s]ection 1983 speaks in terms of <i>"rights, </i>privileges, or immunities," not violations of federal law.\'" <i>Wilder, supra, </i>at 509, quoting <i>Golden State Transit Corp. </i>v. <i>Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/case.html">493 U.

We turn now to that inquiry.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="358">358</a></p><p>As quoted above, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15) requires that to obtain federal reimbursement, a State have a plan which "provides that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made ... to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and ...  to make it possible for the child to return to his home ... ;"&gt;" As recognized by petitioners, respondents, and the courts below, the Act is mandatory in its terms. However, in the light shed by <i>Pennhurst, </i>we must examine exactly what is required of States by the Act. Here, the terms of \xc2\xa7 671(a) are clear: "In order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary." Therefore the Act does place a requirement on the States, but that requirement only goes so far as to ensure that the State have a plan approved by the Secretary which contains the 16 listed features.8</p><p>Respondents do not dispute that Illinois in fact has a plan approved by the Secretary which provides that reasonable efforts at prevention and reunification will be made. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30.9 Respondents argue, however, that \xc2\xa7 1983</p><p>8 Contrary to respondents\' assertion that finding 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(a) to require only the filing of a plan for approval by the Secretary would add a new "prerequisite for the existence of a right under \xc2\xa7 1983," Brief for Respondents 22, n. 6, our holding today imposes no new "prerequisites" but merely counsels that each statute must be interpreted by its own terms.</p><p>9 The state plan filed by Illinois relies on a state statute and DCFS internal rules to meet the "reasonable efforts" requirement. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Development Services Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Children\'s Bureau, State Plan for Title IV-E of the Social Security Act Foster Care and Adoption Assistance, State Illinois 2-13 (1988).</p><p>The Illinois statute to which the plan refers imposes a requirement that before temporary custody may be ordered, the court must find that reasonable efforts have been made or good cause has been shown why "reasonable efforts cannot prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from his or her home." Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, ,s02-1O(2) (1989). The statute further provides: "The Court shall require documentation by representatives of [DCFS] or the probation department as to the reason-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="359">359</a></p><p>allows them to sue in federal court to obtain enforcement of this particular provision of the state plan. This argument is based, at least in part, on the assertion that 42 U. S. c. \xc2\xa7 671(a)(3) requires that the State have a plan which is "in effect." This section states that the state plan shall "provid[e] that the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by them, be mandatory upon them." But we think that "in effect" is directed to the requirement that the plan apply to all political subdivisions of the State, and is not intended to otherwise modify the word "plan." 10</p><p>In <i>Wilder, </i>the underlying Medicaid legislation similarly required participating States to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a plan for medical assistance describing the State\'s Medicaid program. But in that case we held that the Boren Amendment actually required the States to adopt reasonable and adequate rates, and that this obligation was enforceable by the providers. We relied in part on the fact that the statute and regulations set forth in some detail the factors to be considered in determining the methods for calculating rates. <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 519, n. 17.</p><p>In the present case, however, the term "reasonable efforts" to maintain an abused or neglected child in his home,</p><p>able efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from his or her home, and shall consider the testimony of any person as to those reasonable efforts." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>10 Respondents also based their claim for relief on 42 U.

C. \xc2\xa7 671 (a)(9) which states that the state plan shall "provid[e] that where any agency of the State has reason to believe that the home or institution in which a child resides whose care is being paid for in whole or in part with funds provided under this part or part B of this subchapter is unsuitable for the child because of the neglect, abuse, or exploitation of such child, it shall bring such condition to the attention of the appropriate court or law enforcement agency .... "</p><p>As this subsection is merely another feature which the state plan must include to be approved by the Secretary, it does not afford a cause of action to the respondents anymore than does the "reasonable efforts" clause of \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="360">360</a></p><p>or return the child to his home from foster care, appears in quite a different context. No further statutory guidance is found as to how "reasonable efforts" are to be measured. This directive is not the only one which Congress has given to the States, and it is a directive whose meaning will obviously vary with the circumstances of each individual case. How the State was to comply with this directive, and with the other provisions of the Act, was, within broad limits, left up to the State.</p><p>Other sections of the Act provide enforcement mechanisms for the "reasonable efforts" clause of 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15). The Secretary has the authority to reduce or eliminate payments to a State on finding that the State\'s plan no longer complies with \xc2\xa7 671(a) or that "there is a substantial failure" in the administration of a plan such that the State is not complying with its own plan. \xc2\xa7 671(b). The Act also requires that in order to secure federal reimbursement for foster care payments made with respect to a child involuntarily removed from his home the removal must be "the result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation [in the child\'s home] would be contrary to the welfare of such child and (effective October 1, 1983) that reasonable efforts of the type described in section 671(a)(15) of this title have been made." \xc2\xa7 672(a)(1). While these statutory provisions may not provide a comprehensive enforcement mechanism so as to manifest Congress\' intent to foreclose remedies under \xc2\xa7 1983,11 they do show that the absence of a remedy to pri-</p><p>11 We have found an intent by Congress to foreclose remedies under \xc2\xa7 1983 where the statute itself provides a comprehensive remedial scheme which leaves no room for additional private remedies under \xc2\xa7 1983. <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Robinson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html">468 U.

For example, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 672(e) provides that "[n]o Federal payment may be made under this part" for a child voluntarily placed in foster care for more than 180 days unless within that period there is a judicial determination that the placement is in the best interest of the child. That the "reasonable efforts" clause is not similarly worded buttresses a conclusion that Congress had a different intent with respect to it.</p><p>13 Cf. <i>Wright </i>v. <i>Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 </i>U. S. 418, 430-432 (1987) (statute providing that tenants in low-income housing could only be charged 30% of their income as rent, in conjunction with regulations providing that "reasonable utilities" costs were included in the rental figure, created right under \xc2\xa7 1983 to not be charged more than a "reasonable" amount for utilities).</p><p>14 The regulation, 45 CFR \xc2\xa7 1357. 15(e)(2) (1991), goes on to provide a list of which services may be included in the State\'s proposal:</p><p>"Twenty-four hour emergency caretaker, and homemaker services; day care; crisis counseling; individual and family counseling; emergency shelters; procedures and arrangements for access to available emergency financial assistance; arrangements for the provision of temporary child care to provide respite to the family for a brief period, as part of a plan for preventing children\'s removal from home; other services which the agency identifies as necessary and appropriate such as home-based family serv-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="362">362</a></p><p>significant is that the regulations are not specific and do not provide notice to the States that failure to do anything other than submit a plan with the requisite features, to be approved by the Secretary, is a further condition on the receipt of funds from the Federal Government.

S. Rep. No. 96-336, p. 12 (1979). This Senate Report shows that Congress had confidence in the ability and competency of state courts to discharge their duties under what is now \xc2\xa7 672(a) of the Act. <i>I d., </i>at 16 ("The committee is aware of allegations that the judicial determination requirement can become a mere <i>pro forma </i>exercise in paper shuffling to obtain Federal funding.

I cannot acquiesce in this unexplained disregard for established law. Accordingly, I dissent.</p><p align="center">\nI A</p><p>Section 1983 provides a cause of action for the "deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities, secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United States.

As does the Adoption Act, the Medicaid Act provides federal funding for state programs that meet certain federal standards and requires participating States to file a plan with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Most relevant here, the Medicaid Act, like the Adoption Act, requires that the State undertake a "reasonableness" commitment in its plan. With respect to the rate at which providers are to be reimbursed, the Boren Amendment requires:</p><p>"A State plan for medical assistance must-</p><blockquote><p>\n"provide ... for payment ... [of services] provided under the plan through the use of rates (determined in accordance with methods and standards developed by the State ... ) which the State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary, are <i>reasonable and</i></p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="367">367</a></p><blockquote><p>\n<i>adequate </i>to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards and to assure that individuals eligible for medical assistance have <i>reasonable </i>access ... to inpatient hospital services of <i>adequate </i>quality." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (emphasis supplied).</p></blockquote><p>In <i>Wilder, </i>we had no difficulty concluding that the reimbursement provision of the Boren Amendment "was intend[ed] to benefit" the plaintiff providers of Medicaid services. 496 U. S., at 509. We also concluded that the second part of the test was satisfied. The amendment, we held, does not simply express a "congressional preference" for reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates; rather, it imposes a "binding obligation" on the State to establish and maintain such rates. <i>Id., </i>at 512. In so concluding, we emphasized two features of the Medicaid reimbursement scheme. First, we observed that the language of the provision is "cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms," stating that the plan <i>"must" </i>provide for reasonable and adequate reimbursement. <i>Ibid. </i>Second, we noted that the text of the statute expressly conditions federal funding on state compliance with the amendment and requires the Secretary to withhold funds from noncomplying States. <i>Ibid. </i>In light of these features of the Medicaid Act, we rejected the argument, advanced by the defendant state officials and by the United States as <i>amicus curiae, </i>that the only enforceable state obligation is the obligation to file a plan with the Secretary, to find that its rates are reasonable and adequate, and to make assurances to that effect in the plan. <i>Id., </i>at 512-515. Rather, we concluded, participating States are required actually to provide reasonable and adequate rates, not just profess to the Secretary that they have done so. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Finally, we rejected the State\'s argument that Medicaid providers\' right to "reasonable and adequate" reimburse-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="368">368</a></p><p>ment is "too vague and amorphous" for judicial enforcement. We acknowledged that the State has "substantial discretion" in choosing among various methods of calculating reimbursement rates. <i>Id., </i>at 519; see also <i>id., </i>at 505-508. A State\'s discretion in determining how to calculate what rates are "reasonable and adequate," we concluded, "may affect the standard under which a court reviews" the State\'s reimbursement plan, but it does not make the right to reasonable reimbursement judicially unenforceable. <i>Id., </i>at 519.</p><p align="center">\nc</p><p>These principles, as we applied them in <i>Wilder, </i>require the conclusion that the Adoption Act\'s "reasonable efforts" clause 1 establishes a right enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983. Each of the three elements of our three-part test is satisfied. First, and most obvious, the plaintiff children in this case are clearly the intended beneficiaries of the requirement that the State make "reasonable efforts" to prevent unnecessary removal and to reunify temporarily removed children with their families.</p><p>Second, the "reasonable efforts" clause imposes a binding obligation on the State because it is "cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms," providing that a participating State <i>"shall </i>have a plan approved by the Secretary which <i>... shall be in effect </i>in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by them, be <i>mandatory </i>upon them." Further, the statute requires the plan to "provid[e] that, in each case, reasonable efforts <i>will be made." </i>Moreover, as</p><p>1 "In order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which- ... (3) provides that the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by them, be mandatory upon them; [and] ... (15) ... provides that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671 (a).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="369">369</a></p><p>in <i>Wilder, </i>the statutory text expressly conditions federal funding on state compliance with the plan requirement and requires the Secretary to reduce payments to a State if "in the administration of [the State\'s] plan there is a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the plan." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(b). Under our holding in <i>Wilder, </i>these provisions of the Adoption Act impose a binding obligation on the State. Indeed, neither the petitioner state officials nor <i>amicus </i>United States dispute this point. Brief for Petitioners 17; Reply Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 2; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i><i>13-14.</i></p><p>What petitioners and <i>amicus </i>United States do dispute is whether the third element of the <i>Golden State- WilderDennis </i>test has been satisfied: They argue that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Adoption Act is too "vague and amorphous" to be judicially enforced. Aware that <i>Wilder </i>enforced an apparently similar "reasonableness" clause, they argue that <i>this </i>clause is categorically different.</p><p>According to petitioners, the Court would not have found the Boren Amendment\'s reasonableness clause enforceable had the statute not provided an "objective benchmark" against which "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement rates could be measured. Reasonable and adequate rates, the Boren Amendment provides, are those that meet the costs that would be incurred by "an \'efficiently and economically operated facilit[y]\' providing care in compliance with federal and state standards while at the same time ensuring \'reasonable access\' to eligible participants." <i>Wilder, 496 </i>U. S., at 519 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A)). Petitioners claim that, given this benchmark, "reasonable and adequate" rates can be ascertained by <i>"monetary </i>calculations easily determined based on prevailing rates in the market." Brief for Petitioners 21. By contrast, they observe, there is "no market for \'reasonable efforts\' to keep or return a child home, and such \'reasonable efforts\' cannot be calculated or quantified." <i>Ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="370">370</a></p><p>Petitioners misunderstand the sense in which the "benchmark" in <i>Wilder </i>is "objective." The Boren Amendment does not simply define "reasonable and adequate" rates as market rates. Rather, it defines a "reasonable and adequate" rate by referring to what <i>would </i>be provided by a <i>hypothetical </i>facility-one that operates "efficiently and economically," "compli[es] with federal and state standards," and "ensur[es] \'reasonable access\' to eligible participants." Whether particular existing facilities meet those criteria is not a purely empirical judgment that requires only simple "monetary calculations." Indeed, the Boren Amendment\'s specification of the words "reasonable and adequate" ultimately refers us to a <i>second </i>reasonableness clause: The "benchmark" facility, we are told, is one that "ensure[s] <i>\'reasonable access\' </i>to eligible participants." This second reasonableness clause is left undefined. Contrary to petitioners\' suggestions, then, the "reasonable and adequate" rates provision of the Boren Amendment is not "objective" in the sense of being mechanically measurable. The fact that this Court found the provision judicially enforceable demonstrates that an asserted right is not "vague and amorphous" simply because it cannot be easily "calculated or quantified."</p><p>Petitioners also argue that the right to "reasonable efforts" is "vague and amorphous" because of substantial disagreement in the child-welfare community concerning appropriate strategies. Furthermore, they contend, because the choice of a particular strategy in a particular case necessarily will depend upon the facts of that case, a court-enforced right to reasonable efforts either will homogenize very different situations or else will fragment into a plurality of "rights" that vary from State to State. For both of these reasons, petitioners contend, Congress left the question of what efforts are "reasonable" to state juvenile courts, the recognized experts in such matters.</p><p>Here again, comparison with <i>Wilder </i>is instructive. The Court noted the lack of consensus concerning which of vari-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="371">371</a></p><p>ous possible methods of calculating reimbursable costs would best promote efficient operation of health-care facilities. See <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 506-507. The Court further noted that Congress chose a standard that leaves the States considerable autonomy in selecting the methods they will use to determine which reimbursement rates are "reasonable and adequate." <i>Id., </i>at 506-508, 515. The result, of course, is that the "content" of the federal right to reasonable and adequate rates-the method of calculating reimbursement and the chosen rate-varies from State to State. And although federal judges are hardly expert either in selecting methods of Medicaid cost reimbursement or in determining whether particular rates are "reasonable and adequate," neither the majority nor the dissent found that the right to reasonable and adequate reimbursement was so vague and amorphous as to be "beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce." See <i>id., </i>at 519-520; <i>id., </i>at 524 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). State flexibility in determining what is "reasonable," we held,</p><blockquote><p>\n"may affect the standard under which a court reviews whether the rates comply with the amendment, but it does not render the amendment unenforceable by a court. While there may be a range of reasonable rates, there certainly are <i>some </i>rates outside that range that no State could ever find to be reasonable and adequate under the Act." <i>Id., </i>at 519-520.</p></blockquote><p>The same principles apply here. There may be a "range" of "efforts" to prevent unnecessary removals or secure beneficial reunifications that are "reasonable." <i>Ibid. </i>It may also be that a court, in reviewing a State\'s strategies of compliance with the "reasonable efforts" clause, would owe substantial deference to the State\'s choice of strategies. That does not mean, however, that <i>no </i>State\'s efforts could <i>ever </i>be deemed "unreasonable." As in <i>Wilder, </i>the asserted right in</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="372">372</a></p><p>this case is simply not inherently "beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Petitioners\' argument that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Adoption Act is so vague and amorphous as to be unenforceable assumes that in <i>Wright </i>and <i>Wilder </i>the Court was working at the outer limits of what is judicially cognizable:</p><p>Any deviation from <i>Wright </i>or <i>Wilder, </i>petitioners imply, would go beyond the bounds of judicial competence. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that this is so. See <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 520 (inquiry into reasonableness of reimbursement rates is <i>"well within </i>the competence of the Judiciary") (emphasis supplied). Federal courts, in innumerable cases, have routinely enforced reasonableness clauses in federal statutes. See, <i>e. g., Virginian R. Co. </i>v. <i>Railway Employees, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/515/case.html">300 U. S. 515</a>, 518, 550 (1937) (enforcing "every reasonable effort" provision of the Railway Labor Act and noting that "whether action taken or omitted is ... reasonable [is an] everyday subjec[t] of inquiry by courts in framing and enforcing their decrees"). Petitioners have not shown that the Adoption Act\'s reasonableness clause is exceptional in this respect.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>The Court does not explain why the settled three-part test for determining the enforceability of an asserted right is not applied in this case. Moreover, the reasons the Court does offer to support its conclusion-that the Adoption Act\'s "reasonable efforts" clause creates no enforceable right-were raised and rejected in <i>Wilder.</i></p><p>The Court acknowledges that the Adoption Act is "mandatory in its terms." <i>Ante, </i>at 358. It adopts, however, a narrow understanding of what is "mandatory." It reasons that the language of \xc2\xa7 671(a), which provides that "[i]n order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary," requires participating States only to submit and receive approval for a plan that contains the features listed in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 671(a)(1) to (16). According</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="373">373</a></p><p>to the Court, the beneficiaries of the Act enjoy at most a procedural right under \xc2\xa7 671(a)-the right to require a participating State to prepare and file a plan-not a substantive right to require the State to live up to the commitments stated in that plan, such as the commitment to make "reasonable efforts" to prevent unnecessary removals and secure beneficial reunifications of families. Since the State of Illinois has filed a plan that the Secretary has approved, the Court reasons, the State has violated no right enforceable in federal court.</p><p>The Court\'s reasoning should sound familiar: The state officials in <i>Wilder </i>made exactly the same argument, and this Court rejected it. In <i>Wilder, </i>we noted that the Medicaid Act expressly conditions federal funding on state compliance with the provisions of an approved plan, and that the Secretary is required to withhold payments from noncomplying States. See 496 U. S., at 512 (citing 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1396c).2 In substantially identical language, the Adoption Act, too, requires States to live up to the commitments stated in their plans.3 To be sure, the Court\'s reasoning is consistent with the <i>dissent </i>in <i>Wilder. </i>See 496 U. S., at 524, 527-528 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). But it flatly contradicts what the Court <i>held </i>in that case.</p><p>The Court attempts to fend off this conclusion in two ways, neither of them persuasive. First, the Court seeks to distinguish <i>Wilder, </i>asserting that our conclusion-that the Boren Amendment gave the health-care providers a substantive right to reasonable and adequate reimbursement-"relied in</p><p>2 "If the Secretary ... finds ... that in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with any ... provision [required to be included in the plan,] the Secretary shall notify [the] State agency that further payments will not be made .... " 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1396c.</p><p>3 "[I]n any case in which the Secretary finds ... there is a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of [an approved] plan, the Secretary shall notify the State that further payments will not be made ... , or that such payments will be made to the State but reduced by an amount which the Secretary determines appropriate .... " 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(b).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="374">374</a></p><p>part on the fact that the statute and regulations set forth in some detail the factors to be considered in determining the methods for calculating rates." <i>Ante, </i>at 359 (citing <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 519, n. 17). By contrast, the Court continues, neither the provisions of the Adoption Act nor the implementing regulations offer any guidance as to how the term "reasonable efforts" should be interpreted.</p><p>Even assuming that it is accurate to call the statute and regulations involved in that case "detailed,"4 the Court has misread <i>Wilder. </i>The Court there referred to the relative specificity of the statute and regulations not to demonstrate that the health-care providers enjoyed a substantive right to reasonable and adequate rates-we had already concluded that the State was under a binding obligation to adopt such rates, see <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 514-515-but only to reinforce our conclusion that the providers\' interest was not so "vague and amorphous" as to be "beyond the competence of judicial enforcement." See 496 U. S., at 519, n. 17. Under our three-part test, the Court would not have inquired whether that interest was "vague and amorphous" unless it had <i>al</i><i>ready </i>concluded that the State was required to do more than simply file a paper plan that lists the appropriate factors.</p><p>4 Petitioners suggest a sharp contrast between the implementing regulations considered in <i>Wilder </i>and the implementing regulation for the Adoption Act "reasonable efforts" provision: The former, they say, require the State to consider certain factors, but the latter merely provides "a laundry list of services the States <i>\'may\' </i>provide." Brief for Petitioners 34 (citing 45 CFR \xc2\xa7 1357.15(e) (1991)). Further, petitioners emphasize the Department of Health and Human Services\' remark during rulemaking that States must retain flexibility in administering the Adoption Act\'s "reasonable efforts" requirement. Brief for Petitioners 34-35.</p><p>Neither of these factors marks a significant difference between <i>Wilder </i>and the present case. The difference between <i>requiring </i>States to <i>consider </i>certain factors, as in <i>Wilder, </i>and <i>permitting </i>States to <i>provide </i>certain listed services, as in the present case, is hardly dramatic. As for the second asserted difference, <i>Wilder </i>itself emphasized that States must retain substantial discretion in calculating "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement rates.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="375">375</a></p><p>Second, the Court emphasizes: "Other sections of the [Adoption] Act provide enforcement mechanisms for the reasonable efforts clause of 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15)." <i>Ante, </i>at 360. Such "mechanisms" include the Secretary\'s power to cut off or reduce funds for noncompliance with the state plan, and the requirement of a state judicial finding that "reasonable efforts" have been made before federal funds may be used to reimburse foster care payments for a child involuntarily removed.</p><p>The Court has apparently forgotten that ever since <i>Rosado </i>v. <i>Wyman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a> (1970), the power of the Secretary to enforce congressional spending conditions by cutting off funds has not prevented the federal courts from enforcing those same conditions. See <i>id., </i>at 420, 422-423. Indeed, we reasoned in <i>Wilder </i>that a similar "cutoff" provision <i>supports </i>the conclusion that the Medicaid Act creates an enforceable right, because it puts the State "on notice" that it may not simply adopt the reimbursement rates of its choosing. See 496 U. S., at 514. As for the Court\'s contention that \xc2\xa7 671(a)(15) should be enforced through individual removal determinations in state juvenile court, the availability of a state judicial forum can hardly deprive a \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff of a federal forum. <i>Monroe </i>v. <i>Pape, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a>, 183 (1961). The Court\'s reliance on enforcement mechanisms other than \xc2\xa7 1983, therefore, does not support its conclusion that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Adoption Act creates no enforceable right.</p><p>The Court, without acknowledgment, has departed from our precedents in yet another way. In our prior cases, the existence of other enforcement mechanisms has been relevant not to the question whether the statute at issue creates an enforceable right, but to whether the second exception to \xc2\xa7 1983 enforcement applies-whether, that is, "\'Congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.\'" <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 508 (quoting <i>Wright </i>v. <i>Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, </i>479 U. S., at</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="376">376</a></p><p>423). In determining whether this second exception to \xc2\xa7 1983 enforcement applies, we have required the defendant not merely to point to the existence of alternative means of enforcement, but to demonstrate "by express provision or other specific evidence from the statute itself that Congress intended to foreclose [\xc2\xa7 1983] enforcement." 496 U. S., at 520-521. We have said repeatedly that we will not "lightly" conclude that Congress has so intended. <i>Id., </i>at 520 (quoting <i>Wright, </i>479 U. S., at 423-424, in turn quoting <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Robinson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html">468 U. S. 992</a>, 1012 (1984)). In only two instances, where we concluded that "the statute itself provides a comprehensive remedial scheme which leaves no room for additional private remedies under \xc2\xa7 1983," <i>ante, </i>at 360, n. 11, have we held that Congress has intended to foreclose \xc2\xa7 1983 enforcement. See <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Robinson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html">468 U. S. 992</a> (1984) ("carefully tailored" mixed system of enforcement beginning with local administrative review and culminating in a right to judicial review); <i>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority </i>v. <i>National Sea Clammers Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html">453 U. S. 1</a> (1981) (enforcement scheme authorizing Environmental Protection Agency to bring civil suits, providing for criminal penalties, and including two citizen-suit provisions).</p><p>The Court does not find these demanding criteria satisfied here. See <i>ante, </i>at 360-361, and n. 11. Instead, it simply circumvents them altogether: The Court holds that even if the funding cutoff provision in the Adoption Act is not an "express provision" that "provides a comprehensive remedial scheme" leaving "no room for additional private remedies under \xc2\xa7 1983," <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 520, that provision nevertheless precludes \xc2\xa7 1983 enforcement. In so holding, the Court has inverted the established presumption that a private remedy is available under \xc2\xa7 1983 unless "Congress has affirmatively withdrawn the remedy." 496 U. S., at 509, n. 9 (citing <i>Golden State Transit Corp. </i>v. <i>Los Angeles, </i>493 U. S., at 106-107, and <i>Wright, </i>479 U. S., at 423-424).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="377">377</a></p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>In sum, the Court has failed, without explanation, to apply the framework our precedents have consistently deemed applicable; it has sought to support its conclusion by resurrecting arguments decisively rejected less than two years ago in <i>Wilder; </i>and it has contravened 22 years of precedent by suggesting that the existence of other "enforcement mechanisms" precludes \xc2\xa7 1983 enforcement. At least for this case, it has changed the rules of the game without offering even minimal justification, and it has failed even to acknowledge that it is doing anything more extraordinary than "interpret[ing]" the Adoption Act "by its own terms." <i>Ante, </i>at 358, n. 8. Readers of the Court\'s opinion will not be misled by this hollow assurance. And, after all, we are dealing here with children. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.5 I dissent.</p><p>5 Since I conclude that respondents have a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1983, I need not reach the question, decided in the affirmative by the Court of Appeals, whether petitioners may pursue a private action arising directly under the Adoption Act.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
