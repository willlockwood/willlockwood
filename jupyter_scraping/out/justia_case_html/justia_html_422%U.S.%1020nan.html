Orito, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/139/case.html#147">413 U.S. 139, 147</a>, in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, I expressed the view that \'[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government\'s power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.\' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a> (1973 ), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* </p><p> In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html#494">413 U.S. 483, 494</a> (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Although four of us would grant and reverse, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
