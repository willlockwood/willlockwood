LONG FAMILY LAND &amp; CATTLE CO., INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93411.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 14, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 25, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), a non-Indian bank, sold land it owned in fee simple on a tribal reservation to non-Indians.  Respondents the Longs, an Indian couple who had been leasing the land with an option to purchase, claim the Bank discriminated against them by selling the parcel to nonmembers of the Tribe on terms more favorable than the Bank offered to sell it to them.  The couple sued in Tribal Court, asserting, <em>inter alia</em>, discrimination, breach-of-contract, and bad-faith claims.  Over the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s objection, the Tribal Court concluded that it had jurisdiction and proceeded to trial, where a jury ruled against the Bank on three claims, including the discrimination claim.  The court awarded the Longs damages plus interest.  In a supplemental judgment, the court also gave the Longs an option to purchase that portion of the fee land they still occupied, nullifying the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of the land to non-Indians.  After the Tribal Court of Appeals affirmed, the Bank filed suit in Federal District Court, contending that the tribal judgment was null and void because, as relevant here, the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim.  The District Court granted the Longs summary judgment, finding tribal court jurisdiction proper because the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s consensual relationship with the Longs and their company (also a respondent here) brought the Bank within the first category of tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers outlined in <em>Montana</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/index.html">450 U. S. 544</a>.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of persons voluntarily dealing with tribal members, including a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s sale of fee land.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Bank has Article III standing to pursue this challenge.

This Court is unpersuaded by the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the damages award was premised entirely on their breach-of-contract verdict, which the Bank has not challenged, rather than on their discrimination claim.  Because the verdict form allowed the jury to make a damages award after finding liability as to <em>any</em> of the individual claims, the jury could have based its damages award, in whole or in part, on the discrimination finding.  The Bank was also injured by the option to purchase.  Only the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim sought deed to the land as relief.  The fact that the remedial purchase option applied only to a portion of the total parcel does not eliminate the injury to the Bank, which had no obligation to sell any of the land to the Longs before the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  That judgment effectively nullified a portion of the sale to a third party.  These injuries can be remedied by a ruling that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and that its judgment on the discrimination claim is null and void.

S. 564</a>, 565, restricts tribal authority over nonmember activities taking place on the reservation, and is particularly strong when the nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s activity occurs on land owned in fee simple by non-Indians, <em>Strate</em> v. <em>A-1 Contractors</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/438/index.html">520 U. S. 438</a>, 446.  Once tribal land is converted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary jurisdiction over it.  See <em>County of Yakima</em> v. <em>Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/251/index.html">502 U. S. 251</a>, 267\xe2\x80\x93268.  Moreover, when the tribe or its members convey fee land to third parties, the tribe \xe2\x80\x9closes any former right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of the conveyed lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Bourland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/679/index.html">508 U. S. 679</a>, 689.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tribe has no authority itself \xe2\x80\xa6 to regulate the use of fee land.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Brendale</em> v.<em> Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/408/index.html">492 U. S. 408</a>, 430.  <em>Montana </em>provides two exceptions under which tribes may exercise \xe2\x80\x9ccivil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands,\xe2\x80\x9d 450 U. S., at 565: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cA tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> and (2) a tribe may exercise \xe2\x80\x9ccivil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within the reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 566.  Neither exception authorizes tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear that claim because the Tribe lacks the civil authority to regulate the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of its fee land, and \xe2\x80\x9ca tribe\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Strate, supra</em>, at 453.  <em>Montana </em>does not permit tribes to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land.  Rather, it permits tribal regulation of nonmember <em>conduct </em>inside the reservation that implicates the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interests.  450 U. S., at 564\xe2\x80\x93565.  With only one exception, see <em>Brendale, supra, </em>this Court has never \xe2\x80\x9cupheld under <em>Montana</em> the extension of tribal civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian land,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/353/index.html">533 U. S. 353</a>, 360.  Nor has the Court found that <em>Montana </em>authorized a tribe to regulate the sale of such land.  This makes good sense, given the limited nature of tribal sovereignty and the liberty interests of nonmembers.  Tribal sovereign interests are confined to managing tribal land, see <em>Worcester</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, 6 Pet. 515, 561, protecting tribal self-government, and controlling internal relations, see <em>Montana, supra, </em>at 564.  Regulations approved under <em>Montana </em>all flow from these limited interests.  See, <em>e.g., Duro</em> v. <em>Reina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/676/index.html">495 U. S. 676</a>, 696.  None of these interests justified tribal regulation of a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s sale of fee land.  The Tribe cannot justify regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land by reference to its power to superintend tribal land because non-Indian fee parcels have ceased to be tribal land.  Nor can regulation of fee land sales be justified by the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s interest in protecting internal relations and self-government.  Any direct harm sustained because of a fee land sale is sustained at the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian hands.  Resale, by itself, causes no additional damage.  Regulating fee land sales also runs the risk of subjecting nonmembers to tribal regulatory authority without their consent.  Because the Bill of Rights does not apply to tribes and because nonmembers have no say in the laws and regulations governing tribal territory, tribal laws and regulations may be applied only to nonmembers who have consented to tribal authority, expressly or by action.  Even then the regulation must stem from the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s inherent sovereign authority to set conditions on entry, preserve self-government, or control internal relations.  There is no reason the Bank should have anticipated that its general business dealings with the Longs would permit the Tribe to regulate the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of land it owned in fee simple.  The Longs\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to salvage their position by arguing that the discrimination claim should be read to challenge the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s whole course of commercial dealings with them is unavailing.  Their breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims involve the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s general dealings; the discrimination claim does not.  The discrimination claim is tied specifically to the fee land sale.  And only the discrimination claim is before the Court.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because the second <em>Montana</em> exception stems from the same sovereign interests giving rise to the first, it is also inapplicable here.  The \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d covered by that exception must do more than injure a tribe; it must \xe2\x80\x9cimperil the subsistence\xe2\x80\x9d of the tribal community.  <em>Montana</em>, 450 U. S., at 566.  The land at issue has been owned by a non-Indian party for at least 50 years.  Its resale to another non-Indian hardly \xe2\x80\x9cimperil[s] the subsistence or welfare of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 argument, when the Bank sought the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s aid in serving process on the Longs for the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s pending state-court eviction action, the Bank did not consent to tribal court jurisdiction over the discrimination claim.

Following the sale, an Indian couple, customers of the bank who had defaulted on their loans, claimed the bank discriminated against them by offering the land to non-Indians on terms more favorable than those the bank offered to them.  The couple sued on that claim in tribal court; the bank contested the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  The tribal court concluded that it had jurisdiction and proceeded to hear the case.  It ultimately ruled against the bank and awarded the Indian couple damages and the right to purchase a portion of the fee land.  The question presented is whether the tribal court had jurisdiction to adjudicate a discrimination claim concerning the non-Indian bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of fee land it owned.  We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Long Family Land and Cattle Company, Inc. (Long Company or Company), is a family-run ranching and farming operation incorporated under the laws of South Dakota.  Its lands are located on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation.  Once a massive, 60-million acre affair, the reservation was appreciably diminished by Congress in the 1880s and at present consists of roughly 11 million acres located in Dewey and Ziebach Counties in north-central South Dakota.  The Long Company is a respondent here, along with Ronnie and Lila Long, husband and wife, who together own at least 51 percent of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s shares.  Ronnie and Lila Long are both enrolled members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Tribe.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Longs and their Company have been customers for many years at Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), located some 25 miles off the reservation as the crow flies in Hoven, South Dakota.  The Bank, like the Long Company, is a South Dakota corporation, but has no ties to the reservation other than its business dealings with tribal members.  The Bank made its first commercial loan to the Long Company in 1989, and a series of agreements followed.  As part of those agreements, Kenneth Long\xe2\x80\x94Ronnie Long\xe2\x80\x99s father and a non-Indian\xe2\x80\x94mortgaged to the Bank 2,230 acres of fee land he owned inside the reservation.  At the time of Kenneth Long\xe2\x80\x99s death in the summer of 1995, Kenneth and the Long Company owed the Bank $750,000.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the spring of 1996, Ronnie and Lila Long began negotiating a new loan contract with the Bank in an effort to shore up their Company\xe2\x80\x99s flagging financial fortunes and come to terms with their outstanding debts.  After several months of back-and-forth, the parties finally reached an agreement in December of that year\xe2\x80\x94two agreements, to be precise.  The Company and the Bank signed a fresh loan contract, according to which Kenneth Long\xe2\x80\x99s estate deeded over the previously mortgaged fee acreage to the Bank in lieu of foreclosure.  App. 104.  In return, the Bank agreed to cancel some of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s debt and to make additional operating loans.  The parties also agreed to a lease arrangement: The Company received a two-year lease on the 2,230 acres, deeded over to the Bank, with an option to purchase the land at the end of the term for $468,000.  <em>Id</em>., at 96\xe2\x80\x93103.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is at this point, the Longs claim, that the Bank began treating them badly.  The Longs say the Bank initially offered more favorable purchase terms in the lease agreement, allegedly proposing to sell the land back to the Longs with a 20-year contract for deed.  The Bank eventually rescinded that offer, the Longs claim, citing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possible jurisdictional problems\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that might have been caused by the Bank financing an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Indian owned entity on the reservation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  491 F. 3d 878, 882 (CA8 2007) (case below).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then came the punishing winter of 1996\xe2\x80\x931997.  The Longs lost over 500 head of cattle in the blizzards that season, with the result that the Long Company was unable to exercise its option to purchase the leased acreage when the lease contract expired in 1998.  Nevertheless, the Longs refused to vacate the property, prompting the Bank to initiate eviction proceedings in state court and to petition the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court to serve the Longs with a notice to quit.  In the meantime, the Bank sold 320 acres of the fee land it owned to a non-Indian couple.  In June 1999, while the Longs continued to occupy a 960-acre parcel of the land, the Bank sold the remaining 1,910 acres to two other nonmembers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 1999, the Longs and the Long Company filed suit against the Bank in the Tribal Court, seeking an injunction to prevent their eviction from the property and to reverse the sale of the land.  They asserted a variety of claims, including breach of contract, bad faith, violation of tribal-law self-help remedies, and discrimination.  The discrimination claim alleged that the Bank sold the land to nonmembers on terms more favorable than those offered the Company.  The Bank asserted in its answer that the court lacked jurisdiction and also stated a counterclaim.  The Tribal Court found that it had jurisdiction, denied the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim, and proceeded to trial.  Four causes of action were submitted to the seven-member jury: breach of contract, bad faith, violation of self-help remedies, and discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found for the Longs on three of the four causes, including the discrimination claim, and awarded a $750,000 general verdict.  After denying the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict by finding again that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 claims, the Tribal Court entered judgment awarding the Longs $750,000 plus interest.  A later supplemental judgment further awarded the Longs an option to purchase the 960 acres of the land they still occupied on the terms offered in the original purchase option, effectively nullifying the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s previous sale of that land to non-Indians.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bank appealed to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court.  The Bank then filed the instant action in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, seeking a declaration that the tribal judgment was null and void because, as relevant here, the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Longs.  The court found tribal court jurisdiction proper because the Bank had entered into a consensual relationship with the Longs and the Long Company.  440 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1077\xe2\x80\x931078, 1080\xe2\x80\x931081 (SD 2006).  According to the District Court, this relationship brought the Bank within the first category of tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers outlined in <em>Montana</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/index.html">450 U. S. 544</a> (1981).  See 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077\xe2\x80\x931078.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  491 F.\xc2\xa03d 878.  The Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim, the court held, \xe2\x80\x9carose directly from their preexisting commercial relationship with the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 887.  When the Bank chose to deal with the Longs, it effectively consented to substantive regulation by the tribe: An antidiscrimination tort claim was just another way of regulating the commercial transactions between the parties.  See <em>ibid.</em>  In sum, the Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of persons who \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily deal with tribal members,\xe2\x80\x9d including, here, a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s sale of fee land.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before considering the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to adjudicate the discrimination claim, we must first address the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the Bank lacks standing to raise this jurisdictional challenge in the first place.  Though the Longs raised their standing argument for the first time before this Court, we bear an independent obligation to assure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits.  See <em>Steel Co</em>. v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/index.html">523 U. S. 83</a>, 94\xe2\x80\x9395 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin by noting that whether a tribal court has adjudicative authority over nonmembers is a federal question.  See <em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>LaPlante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/9/index.html">480 U. S. 9</a>, 15 (1987); <em>National Farmers Union Ins. Cos.</em> v. <em>Crow Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/index.html">471 U. S. 845</a>, 852\xe2\x80\x93853 (1985).  If the tribal court is found to lack such jurisdiction, any judgment as to the nonmember is necessarily null and void.  The Longs do not contest this settled principle but argue instead that the Bank has suffered no \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact\xe2\x80\x9d as required by Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy provision.  See <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Longs appear to recognize their argument is somewhat counterintuitive.  They concede the jury found the Bank guilty of discrimination and awarded them $750,000 plus interest.  But the Longs contend the jury\xe2\x80\x99s damages award was in fact premised entirely on their breach-of-contract rather than on their discrimination claim.  The Bank does not presently challenge the breach-of-contract verdict.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of their argument, the Longs point to their amended complaint in the Tribal Court.  The complaint comprised nine counts.  Several of the counts sought damages; the discrimination count did not.  As relief for the discrimination claim, the Longs asked to be granted \xe2\x80\x9cpossession and title to their land.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 173.  The Longs contend that the damage award therefore had nothing to do with the discrimination claim.  As a result, a decision from this Court finding no jurisdiction with respect to that claim\xe2\x80\x94the only claim the Bank appeals\xe2\x80\x94would not change anything.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded.  The jury verdict form consisted of six special interrogatories, covering each claim asserted against the Bank, with another one covering the amount of damages to be awarded.  <em>Id.,</em> at 190\xe2\x80\x93192.  The damages interrogatory specifically allowed the jury to make an award after finding liability as to <em>any</em> of the individual claims: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you answered yes to Numbers 1, 3, 4, <em>or</em> 5 what amount of damages should be awarded to the Plaintiffs?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 192 (emphasis added).  The jury found against the Bank on three of the special interrogatories, including number 4, the discrimination claim.  The Bank, the jurors found, \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally discriminate[d] against the Plaintiffs Ronnie and Lila Long.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 191.  The jury then entered an award of $750,000.  <em>Id.</em>, at 192.  These facts establish that the jury could have based its damages award, in whole or in part, on the finding of discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, in addition, the option to purchase.  The Longs argue that requiring the Bank to void the sale to nonmembers of a 960\xe2\x80\x93acre parcel and sell that parcel to them instead does not constitute injury-in-fact, because the Tribal Court actually <em>denied</em> the relief the Longs sought for the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination.  In its supplemental judgment, the Tribal Court refused to permit the Longs (or the Long Company) to purchase all the land\xe2\x80\x94as they had requested\xe2\x80\x94instead granting an option to purchase only the 960 acres the Longs occupied at the time.  See Supplemental Judgment in No. R\xe2\x80\x93120\xe2\x80\x9399, <em>Long Family Land &amp; Cattle Co.</em> v. <em>Maciejewski, </em>(Feb. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9369 to A\xe2\x80\x9370.  Even this partial relief, the Longs insist, was crafted as an equitable remedy for their breach-of-contract claim, see Brief for Respondents 32\xe2\x80\x9334, and in any event the Bank really suffered no harm, because it would gain as much income selling to the Longs as it did selling to the nonmembers, see <em>id.</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These arguments do not defeat the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s standing.  The Longs requested, as a remedy for the alleged discrimination, \xe2\x80\x9cpossession and title\xe2\x80\x9d to the subject land.  App. 173.  They received an option to acquire a portion of exactly that.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9369 to A\xe2\x80\x9370.  The Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s silence in its supplemental judgment as to which claim, exactly, the option to purchase was meant to remedy is immaterial.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Of the four claims presented to the jury, only the discrimination claim sought deed to the land as relief.  See Amended Complaint (Jan. 3, 2000), App. 158, 173.  Nor does the fact that the remedial purchase option applied only to a portion of the total parcel eliminate the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  The Bank had no obligation to sell the land to the Longs before the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the Bank had already sold the acreage to third parties.  The Tribal Court judgment effectively nullified a portion of that sale.  This judicially imposed burden certainly qualifies as an injury for standing purposes.  As for the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 speculation that the Bank would make as much money selling the land to them as it did selling the parcel to nonmembers, the argument is entirely beside the point.  There is more than adequate injury in being compelled to undo one deed and enter into another\xe2\x80\x94particularly with individuals who had previously defaulted on loans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both with respect to damages and the option to purchase, the Bank was injured by the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction over the discrimination claim.  Those injuries can be remedied by a ruling in favor of the Bank that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and that its judgment on the discrimination claim is null and void.  The ultimate collateral consequence of such a determination, whatever it may be\xe2\x80\x94vacatur of the general damages award, vacatur of the option to purchase, a new trial on the other claims\xe2\x80\x94does not alter the fact that the Bank has shown injury traceable to the challenged action and likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.  <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U.

The burden rests on the tribe to establish one of the exceptions to <em>Montana</em>\xe2\x80\x99s general rule that would allow an extension of tribal authority to regulate nonmembers on non-Indian fee land.  <em>Atkinson,</em> 532 U.

These exceptions are \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d ones, <em>id.</em>, at 647, and cannot be construed in a manner that would \xe2\x80\x9cswallow the rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 655, or \xe2\x80\x9cseverely shrink\xe2\x80\x9d it, <em>Strate</em>, 520 U.

We reaffirm that principle today and hold that the Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim because the Tribe lacks the civil authority to regulate the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of its fee land.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim challenges a non-Indian\xe2\x80\x99s sale of non-Indian fee land.  Despite the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to recharacterize their claim as turning on the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s alleged \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to pay to respondents loans promised for cattle-raising on tribal trust land,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 47, in fact the Longs brought their discrimination claim \xe2\x80\x9cseeking to have the land sales set aside on the ground that the sale to nonmembers \xe2\x80\x98on terms more favorable\xe2\x80\x99 than the bank had extended to the Longs\xe2\x80\x9d violated tribal tort law, 491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 882 (quoting Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Amended Complaint, App. 173).  See also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7.  That discrimination claim thus concerned the sale of a 2,230-acre fee parcel that the Bank had acquired from the estate of a non-Indian.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The status of the land is relevant \xe2\x80\x9cinsofar as it bears on the application of . . . <em>Montana</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions to [this] case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hicks</em>, 533 U. S., at 376 (Souter, J., concurring).  The acres at issue here were alienated from the Cheyenne River Sioux\xe2\x80\x99s tribal trust and converted into fee simple parcels as part of the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312, commonly called the 1908 Allotment Act.  See Brief for Respondents 4, n.\xc2\xa02.  While the General Allotment Act provided for the division of tribal land into fee simple parcels owned by individual tribal members, that Act also mandated that such allotments would be held in trust for their owners by the United States for a period of 25 years\xe2\x80\x94or longer, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s discretion\xe2\x80\x94during which time the parcel owners had no authority to sell or convey the land.  See 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7348 (2000 ed., and Supp. V).  The 1908 Act released particular Indian owners from these restrictions ahead of schedule, vesting in them full fee ownership.  See \xc2\xa71, 35 Stat. 312.  In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7461 <em>et seq.,</em> which \xe2\x80\x9cpu[t] an end to further allotment of reservation land,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not \xe2\x80\x9creturn allotted land to pre-General Allotment status, leaving it fully alienable by the allottees, their heirs, and assigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Yakima</em>, 502 U. S., at 264.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The tribal tort law the Longs are attempting to enforce, however, operates as a restraint on alienation.

It regulates the substantive terms on which the Bank is able to offer its fee land for sale.  Respondents and their principal <em>amicus</em>, the United States, acknowledge that the tribal tort at issue here is a form of regulation.  See Brief for Respondents 52; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25\xe2\x80\x9326; see also <em>Riegel</em> v. <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 11).  They argue the regulation is fully authorized by the first <em>Montana</em> exception.  They are mistaken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Montana</em> does not permit Indian tribes to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land.  <em>Montana</em> and its progeny permit tribal regulation of nonmember <em>conduct</em> inside the reservation that implicates the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interests.  <em>Montana </em>expressly limits its first exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cactivities of nonmembers,\xe2\x80\x9d 450 U.

Each involved regulation of non-Indian activities on the reservation that had a discernable effect on the tribe or its members.  The first concerned a tribal court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over a contract dispute arising from the sale of merchandise by a non-Indian to an Indian on the reservation.  See <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/index.html">358 U. S. 217</a> (1959).  The other three involved taxes on economic activity by nonmembers.

We have upheld as within the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign authority the imposition of a severance tax on natural resources removed by nonmembers from tribal land.  See <em>Merrion</em> v. <em>Jicarilla Apache Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/130/index.html">455 U. S. 130</a> (1982).  We have approved tribal taxes imposed on leasehold interests held in tribal lands, as well as sales taxes imposed on nonmember businesses within the reservation.  See <em>Kerr-McGee</em>, 471 U. S., at 196\xe2\x80\x93197.  We have similarly approved licensing requirements for hunting and fishing on tribal land.

See <em>Atkinson</em>, 532 U. S., at 659 (Tribe may not tax nonmember activity on non-Indian fee land); <em>Strate</em>, 520 U. S., at 454, 457 (tribal court lacks jurisdiction over tort suit involving an accident on non-tribal land); <em>Montana</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 566 (Tribe has no authority to regulate nonmember hunting and fishing on non-Indian fee land).  The exception is <em>Brendale</em> v. <em>Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/408/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/408/index.html">492 U.

While a six-Justice majority held that <em>Montana</em> did <em>not</em> authorize the Yakima Nation to impose zoning regulations on non-Indian fee land located in an area of the reservation where nearly half the acreage was owned by nonmembers, 492 U.

Rather, our <em>Montana</em> cases have always concerned nonmember conduct on the land. See, <em>e.g., Hicks, </em>533 U.

By virtue of their incorporation into the United States, the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interests are now confined to managing tribal land, see <em>Worcester</em>, 6 Pet., at 561 (persons are allowed to enter Indian land only \xe2\x80\x9cwith the assent of the [tribal members] themselves\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[ing] tribal self-government,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol[ling] internal relations,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Montana</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 564.  The logic of <em>Montana</em> is that certain activities on non-Indian fee land (say, a business enterprise employing tribal members) or certain uses (say, commercial development) may intrude on the internal relations of the tribe or threaten tribal self-rule.  To the extent they do, such activities or land uses may be regulated.  See <em>Hicks</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 361 (\xe2\x80\x9cTribal assertion of regulatory authority over nonmembers must be connected to that right of the Indians to make their own laws and be governed by them\xe2\x80\x9d).  Put another way, certain forms of nonmember behavior, even on non-Indian fee land, may sufficiently affect the tribe as to justify tribal oversight.  While tribes generally have no interest in regulating the conduct of nonmembers, then, they may regulate nonmember behavior that implicates tribal governance and internal relations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations we have approved under <em>Montana</em> all flow directly from these limited sovereign interests.  The tribe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional and undisputed power to exclude persons\xe2\x80\x9d from tribal land, <em>Duro</em>, 495 U. S., at 696, for example, gives it the power to set conditions on entry to that land via licensing requirements and hunting regulations.  See <em>Bourland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 691, n. 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cRegulatory authority goes hand in hand with the power to exclude\xe2\x80\x9d).  Much taxation can be justified on a similar basis.  See <em>Colville</em>, 447 U. S., at 153 (taxing power \xe2\x80\x9cmay be exercised over . . . nonmembers, so far as such nonmembers may accept privileges of trade, residence, etc., to which taxes may be attached as <em>conditions</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Powers of Indian Tribes</em>, 55 I.\xc2\xa0D. 14, 46 (1934; emphasis added).  The power to tax certain nonmember activity can also be justified as \xe2\x80\x9ca necessary instrument of self-government and territorial management,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Merrion</em>, 455 U. S., at 137, insofar as taxation \xe2\x80\x9cenables a tribal government to raise revenues for its essential services,\xe2\x80\x9d to pay its employees, to provide police protection, and in general to carry out the functions that keep peace and order,<em> ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg wonders why these sorts of regulations are permissible under <em>Montana</em> but regulating the sale of fee land is not.  See <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The reason is that regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land, unlike the above, cannot be justified by reference to the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interests.  By definition, fee land owned by nonmembers has already been removed from the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control.  See <em>Strate</em>, 520 U. S., at 456 (tribes lack power to \xe2\x80\x9cassert [over non-Indian fee land] a landowner\xe2\x80\x99s right to occupy and exclude\xe2\x80\x9d).  It has already been alienated from the tribal trust.  The tribe cannot justify regulation of such land\xe2\x80\x99s sale by reference to its power to superintend tribal land, then, because non-Indian fee parcels have ceased to <em>be</em> tribal land.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can regulation of fee land sales be justified by the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s interests in protecting internal relations and self-government.  Any direct harm to its political integrity that the tribe sustains as a result of fee land sale is sustained at the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian hands.  It is at that point the tribe and its members lose the ability to use the land for their purposes.  Once the land has been sold in fee simple to non-Indians and passed beyond the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control, the mere resale of that land works no additional intrusion on tribal relations or self-government.  Resale, by itself, causes no additional damage.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to suggest that the sale of the land will have no impact on the tribe.  The <em>uses</em> to which the land is put may very well change from owner to owner, and those uses may well affect the tribe and its members.  As our cases bear out, see <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9316, the tribe may quite legitimately seek to protect its members from noxious uses that threaten tribal welfare or security, or from nonmember conduct on the land that does the same.  But the key point is that any threat to the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interests flows from changed uses or nonmember activities, rather than from the mere fact of resale.  The tribe is able fully to vindicate its sovereign interests in protecting its members and preserving tribal self-government by regulating nonmember <em>activity</em> on the land, within the limits set forth in our cases.  The tribe has no independent interest in restraining alienation of the land itself, and thus, no authority to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only is regulation of fee land sale beyond the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign powers, it runs the risk of subjecting nonmembers to tribal regulatory authority without commensurate consent.  Tribal sovereignty, it should be remembered, is \xe2\x80\x9ca sovereignty outside the basic structure of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lara</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/193/index.html">541 U. S. 193</a>, 212 (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The Bill of Rights does not apply to Indian tribes.  See <em>Talton</em> v. <em>Mayes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/163/376/index.html">163 U. S. 376</a>, 382\xe2\x80\x93385 (1896).  Indian courts \xe2\x80\x9cdiffer from traditional American courts in a number of significant respects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hicks</em>, 533 U. S., at 383 (Souter, J., concurring).  And nonmembers have no part in tribal government\xe2\x80\x94they have no say in the laws and regulations that govern tribal territory.  Consequently, those laws and regulations may be fairly imposed on nonmembers only if the nonmember has consented, either expressly or by his actions.  Even then, the regulation must stem from the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s inherent sovereign authority to set conditions on entry, preserve tribal self-government, or control internal relations.  See <em>Montana</em>, 450 U. S., at 564.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In commenting on the policy goals Congress adopted with the General Allotment Act, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is simply no suggestion\xe2\x80\x9d in the history of the Act \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress intended that the non-Indians who would settle upon alienated allotted lands would be subject to tribal regulatory authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 560, n.\xc2\xa09.  In fact, we said it \xe2\x80\x9cdefies common sense to suppose\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress meant to subject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction simply by virtue of the nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of land in fee simple.  <em>Ibid</em>.  If Congress did not anticipate tribal jurisdiction would run with the land, we see no reason why a nonmember would think so either.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Longs point out that the Bank in this case could hardly have been surprised by the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of regulatory power over the parties\xe2\x80\x99 business dealings.  The Bank, after all, had \xe2\x80\x9clengthy on-reservation commercial relationships with the Long Company.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 40.  Justice Ginsburg echoes this point.  See <em>post</em>, at 4.  But as we have emphasized repeatedly in this context, when it comes to tribal regulatory authority, it is not \xe2\x80\x9cin for a penny, in for a Pound.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkinson</em>, 532 U. S., at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Bank may reasonably have anticipated that its various commercial dealings with the Longs could trigger tribal authority to regulate those transactions\xe2\x80\x94a question we need not and do not decide.  But there is no reason the Bank should have anticipated that its general business dealings with respondents would permit the Tribe to regulate the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of land it owned in fee simple.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the courts below recognized that the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim was a \xe2\x80\x9cnovel\xe2\x80\x9d one.  491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 892.  It arose \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly from Lakota tradition as embedded in Cheyenne River Sioux tradition and custom,\xe2\x80\x9d including the Lakota \xe2\x80\x9csense of justice, fair play and decency to others.\xe2\x80\x9d  440 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1082 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The upshot was to require the Bank to offer the same terms of sale to a prospective buyer who had defaulted in several previous transactions with the Bank as it offered to a different buyer without such a history of default.  This is surely not a typical regulation.  But whatever the Bank anticipated, whatever \xe2\x80\x9cconsensual relationship\xe2\x80\x9d may have been established through the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with the Longs, the jurisdictional consequences of that relationship cannot extend to the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent sale of its fee land.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Longs acknowledge, if obliquely, the critical importance of land status.  They emphasize that the Long Company \xe2\x80\x9coperated on reservation fee and trust lands,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 40, and n. 24, 41, and note that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fee land at issue in the lease-repurchase agreement\xe2\x80\x9d had previously belonged to a tribal member, <em>id</em>., at 47.  These facts, however, do not change the status of the land at the time of the challenged sale.  Regardless of where the Long Company operated, the fee land whose sale the Longs seek to restrain was owned by the Bank at the relevant time.  And indeed, before that, it was owned by Kenneth Long, a non-Indian.  See <em>Hicks</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 382, n.\xc2\xa04 (Souter,\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cLand status . . . might well have an impact under one (or perhaps both) of the <em>Montana</em> exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d), <em>Atkinson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 659 (Souter,\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (status of territory as \xe2\x80\x9ctribal or fee land may have much to do (as it does here) with the likelihood (or not) that facts will exist that are relevant under the [<em>Montana</em>] exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Longs attempt to salvage their position by arguing that the discrimination claim is best read to challenge the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s whole course of commercial dealings with the Longs stretching back over a decade\xe2\x80\x94not just the sale of the fee land.  Brief for Respondents 44.  That argument is unavailing.  The Longs are the first to point out that their breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims, which <em>do</em> involve the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s course of dealings, are not before this Court.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Only the discrimination claim is before us and that claim is tied specifically to the sale of the fee land.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em>  Count six of the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 amended complaint in the Tribal Court alleges that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[i]n selling the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 land</em>, [Plains Commerce Bank] unfairly discriminated against the Company and the Longs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 172\xe2\x80\x93173 (emphasis added).  As relief, the Longs claimed they \xe2\x80\x9cshould get possession and title to their land back.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 173.  The Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim, in short, is an attempt to regulate the terms on which the Bank may sell the land it owns.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such regulation is outside the scope of a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign authority.  Justice Ginsburg asserts that if \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Federal Government and every State, county, and municipality can make nondiscrimination the law governing . . . real property transactions,\xe2\x80\x9d tribes should be able to do so as well.  <em>Post</em>, at 8.  This argument completely overlooks the very reason cases like <em>Montana</em> and this one arise: Tribal jurisdiction, unlike the jurisdiction of the other governmental entities cited by Justice Ginsburg, generally does not extend to nonmembers.  See <em>Montana</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 565.  The sovereign authority of Indian tribes is limited in ways state and federal authority is not.  Contrary to Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, that bedrock principle does not vary depending on the desirability of a particular regulation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Montana</em> provides that, in certain circumstances, tribes may exercise authority over the conduct of nonmembers, even if that conduct takes place on non-Indian fee land.  But conduct taking place on the land and the sale of the land are two very different things.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe lost the authority to restrain the sale of fee simple parcels inside their borders when the land was sold as part of the 1908 Allotment Act.  Nothing in <em>Montana</em> gives it back.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals relied for its decision on the second <em>Montana</em> exception.  The Eighth Circuit declined to address the exception\xe2\x80\x99s applicability, see 491 F. 3d, at 888, n.\xc2\xa07, while the District Court strongly suggested in passing that the second exception would not apply here, see 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077.  The District Court is correct, for the same reasons we explained above.  The second <em>Montana</em> exception stems from the same sovereign interests that give rise to the first, interests that do not reach to regulating the sale of non-Indian fee land.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second exception authorizes the tribe to exercise civil jurisdiction when non-Indians\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d menaces the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Montana</em>, 450 U. S., at 566.  The conduct must do more than injure the tribe, it must \xe2\x80\x9cimperil the subsistence\xe2\x80\x9d of the tribal community.  <em>Ibid</em>.  One commentator has noted that \xe2\x80\x9cth[e] elevated threshold for application of the second <em>Montana</em> exception suggests that tribal power must be necessary to avert catastrophic consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohen \xc2\xa74.02[3][c], at 232, n. 220.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sale of formerly Indian-owned fee land to a third party is quite possibly disappointing to the tribe, but cannot fairly be called \xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophic\xe2\x80\x9d for tribal self-government.  See <em>Strate</em>, 520 U. S., at 459.  The land in question here has been owned by a non-Indian party for at least 50 years, Brief for Respondents 4, during which time the project of tribal self-government has proceeded without interruption.  The land\xe2\x80\x99s resale to another non-Indian hardly \xe2\x80\x9cimperil[s] the subsistence or welfare of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Montana</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 566.  Accordingly, we hold the second <em>Montana</em> exception inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we address the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Bank consented to tribal court jurisdiction over the discrimination claim by seeking the assistance of tribal courts in serving a notice to quit.  Brief for Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9346.  When the Longs refused to vacate the land, the Bank initiated eviction proceedings in South Dakota state court.  The Bank then asked the Tribal Court to appoint a process server able to reach the Longs.  Seeking the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s aid in serving process on tribal members for a pending state-court action does not, we think, constitute consent to future litigation in the Tribal Court.  Notably, when the Longs did file their complaint against the Bank in Tribal Court, the Bank promptly contended in its answer that the court lacked jurisdiction.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>7.  Under these circumstances, we find that the Bank did not consent by its litigation conduct to tribal court jurisdiction over the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg questions this distinction between sales and activities on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ales of land\xe2\x80\x94and related conduct\xe2\x80\x94are surely \xe2\x80\x98activities\xe2\x80\x99 within the ordinary sense of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  We think the distinction is readily understandable.  In any event, the question is not whether a sale is, in some generic sense, an action.

First, we have not said the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over the other claims: That question is not before us and we decline to speculate as to its answer.  Moreover, the claims on which the Longs prevailed concern breach of a loan agreement, see App. 190, and bad faith in connection with Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guarantees, see <em>id</em>., at 192.

Contrary to Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, however, the nature of this remedy does not drive our jurisdictional ruling.  See <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.

Further, I take no issue with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional ruling insofar as it relates to the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s supplemental judgment.  In that judgment, the Tribal Court ordered the Bank to give Ronnie and Lila Long an option to repurchase fee land the Bank had already contracted to sell to non-Indian individuals.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9369 to A\xe2\x80\x9371.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, to the extent that it overturns the Tribal Court\xe2\x80\x99s principal judgment awarding the Longs damages in the amount of $750,000 plus interest.  See App. 194\xe2\x80\x93196.  That judgment did not disturb the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sale of fee land to non-Indians.  It simply responded to the claim that the Bank, in its on-reservation commercial dealings with the Longs, treated them disadvantageously because of their tribal affiliation and racial identity.  A claim of that genre, I would hold, is one the Tribal Court is competent to adjudicate.  As the Court of Appeals correctly understood, the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 case, at heart, is not about \xe2\x80\x9cthe sale of fee land on a tribal reservation by a non-Indian bank to non-Indian individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1.  \xe2\x80\x9cRather, this case is about the power of the Tribe to hold nonmembers like the bank to a minimum standard of fairness when they voluntarily deal with tribal members.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 F.\xc2\xa03d 878, 887 (CA8 2007) (case below).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the basis for their discrimination claim, the Longs essentially asserted that the Bank offered them terms and conditions on land-financing transactions less favorable than the terms and conditions offered to non-Indians.  Although the Tribal Court could not reinstate the Longs as owners of the ranch lands that had been in their family for decades, that court could hold the Bank answerable in damages, the law\xe2\x80\x99s traditional remedy for the tortious injury the Longs experienced.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the pathmarking case, <em>Montana </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/index.html">450 U. S. 544</a>, 564\xe2\x80\x93565 (1981), this Court restated that, absent a treaty or statute, Indian tribes generally lack authority to regulate the activities of nonmembers.  While stating the general rule, <em>Montana</em> also identified two exceptions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.

This Court has since clarified that when a tribe has authority to regulate the activity of nonmembers, tribal courts presumably have adjudicatory authority over disputes arising out of that activity.

Although the Long Company was incorporated in South Dakota, the enterprise \xe2\x80\x9cwas overwhelmingly tribal in character, as were its interactions with the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 886.  All Long Company property was situated\xe2\x80\x94and all operations of the enterprise occurred\xe2\x80\x94within the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation.  The Long Company\xe2\x80\x99s articles of incorporation required Indian ownership of a majority of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s shares.  This requirement reflected the Long Company\xe2\x80\x99s status as an Indian-owned business entity eligible for Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) loan guarantees.  See 25 CFR \xc2\xa7103.25 (2007) (requiring at least 51% Indian ownership).  Loan guarantees are among the incentives the BIA offers to promote the development of on-reservation Indian enterprises.  The Long Company \xe2\x80\x9cwas formed to take advantage of [the] BIA incentives.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 886.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history of the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s commercial dealings with the Long Company and the Long family is lengthy and complex.  The business relationship dates from 1988, when Ronnie Long\xe2\x80\x99s parents\xe2\x80\x94one of them a member of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x94mortgaged some 2,230 acres of land to the Bank to gain working capital for the ranch.  As security for the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s loans over the years, the Longs mortgaged both their land and their personal property.  The Bank benefited significantly from the Long Company\xe2\x80\x99s status as an Indian-owned business entity, for the BIA loan guarantees \xe2\x80\x9callowed [it] to greatly reduce its lending risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Eventually, the Bank collected from the BIA almost $400,000, more than 80% of the net losses resulting from its loans to the Longs.  See 440 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1078 (SD 2007) (case below); App. 135\xe2\x80\x93138.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The discrimination claim here at issue rests on the allegedly unfair conditions the Bank exacted from the Longs when they sought loans to sustain the operation of their ranch.  Following the death of Ronnie\xe2\x80\x99s father, the Bank and the Longs entered into an agreement under which the mortgaged land would be deeded over to the Bank in exchange for the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s canceling some debt and making additional loans to keep the ranch in business.  The Longs were given a two-year lease on the property with an option to buy the land back when the lease term expired.  Negotiating sessions for these arrangements were held at the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s on-reservation offices and were facilitated by tribal officers and BIA employees.  491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 881.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewing the deal they were given in comparative light, the Longs charged that the Bank offered to resell ranch land to them on terms less advantageous than those the Bank offered in similar dealings with non-Indians.  Their claim, all courts prior to this one found, fit within the <em>Montana</em> exception for \xe2\x80\x9cactivities of nonmembers who enter [into] \xe2\x80\xa6 commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d with tribal members.  450 U. S., at 565.  Cf. <em>Strate</em>, 520 U. S., at 457 (citing <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/index.html">358 U. S. 217</a>, 223 (1959)) (<em>Montana</em>\xe2\x80\x99s consensual-relationships exception justifies tribal-court adjudication of claims \xe2\x80\x9carising out of on-reservation sales transaction between nonmember plaintiff and member defendants\xe2\x80\x9d).  I am convinced that the courts below got it right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, it bears emphasis, involves no unwitting outsider forced to litigate under unfamiliar rules and procedures in tribal court.  Cf. <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/353/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/353/index.html">533 U. S. 353</a>, 382\xe2\x80\x93385 (2001) (Souter, J., concurring).  Hardly a stranger to the tribal court system, the Bank regularly filed suit in that forum.  See Brief for Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 29\xe2\x80\x9331.  The Bank enlisted tribal-court aid to serve notice to quit on the Longs in connection with state-court eviction proceedings.  The Bank later filed a counterclaim for eviction and motion for summary judgment in the case the Longs commenced in the Tribal Court.  In its summary judgment motion, the Bank stated, without qualification, that the Tribal Court \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 187\xe2\x80\x93188.  Had the Bank wanted to avoid responding in tribal court or the application of tribal law, the means were readily at hand: The Bank could have included forum selection, choice-of-law, or arbitration clauses in its agreements with the Longs, which the Bank drafted.  See Brief for Respondents 42.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resolving this case on a ground neither argued nor addressed below, the Court holds that a tribe may not impose any regulation\xe2\x80\x94not even a nondiscrimination requirement\xe2\x80\x94on a bank\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with tribal members regarding on-reservation fee lands.  See<em> ante</em>, at 1, 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  I do not read <em>Montana</em> or any other case so to instruct, and find the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position perplexing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, I question the Court\xe2\x80\x99s separation of land sales tied to lending activities from other \xe2\x80\x9cactivities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Montana</em>, 450 U. S., at 565.  Sales of land\xe2\x80\x94and related conduct\xe2\x80\x94are surely \xe2\x80\x9cactivities\xe2\x80\x9d within the ordinary sense of the word.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>County of Yakima</em> v. <em>Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/251/index.html">502 U. S. 251</a>, 269 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe excise tax remains a tax upon the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s <em>activity</em> of selling the land \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)). Cf. 14 Oxford English Dictionary 388 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he action or an act of selling\xe2\x80\x9d (def. 1(a))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court notes the absence of any case \xe2\x80\x9cf[i]nd[ing] that <em>Montana</em> authorized a tribe to regulate the sale of [non-Indian fee] land.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  But neither have we held that <em>Montana </em>prohibits all such regulation.  If the Court in <em>Montana</em>, or later cases, had intended to remove land sales resulting from loan transactions entirely from tribal governance, it could have spoken plainly to that effect.  Instead, <em>Montana</em> listed as examples of consensual relationships that tribes might have authority to regulate \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial dealing, contracts, [and] leases.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 U. S., at 565.  Presumably, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cleases\xe2\x80\x9d includes leases of fee land.  But why should a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s lease of fee land to a member be differentiated, for <em>Montana</em> exception purposes, from a sale of the same land?  And why would the enforcement of an antidiscrimination command be less important to tribal self-rule and dignity, cf. <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318, when the command relates to land sales than when it relates to other commercial relationships between nonmembers and members?</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 1, I agree that the Tribal Court had no authority to grant the Longs an option to purchase the 960-acre parcel the Bank had contracted to sell to individuals unaffiliated with the Tribe.  The third parties\xe2\x80\x99 contracts with the Bank cannot be disturbed based on <em>Montana</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exception for \xe2\x80\x9cthe activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 U. S., at 565.  Although the Tribal Court overstepped in its supplemental judgment ordering the Bank to give the Longs an option to purchase land third parties had contracted to buy, see App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9369 to A\xe2\x80\x9371, it scarcely follows that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim, and to order in its principal judgment, see App. 194\xe2\x80\x93196, monetary relief.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Bank may reasonably have anticipated that its various commercial dealings with the Longs could trigger tribal authority to regulate those transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, furthermore, purports to leave the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims untouched.  <em>Ante,</em> at 21, n.\xc2\xa02.  Noting that the Bank \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not presently challenge the breach-of-contract verdict,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 6, the Court emphasizes that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly the discrimination claim is before us and that claim is tied specifically to the sale of the fee land,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 21.  But if the Tribal Court is a proper forum for the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the Bank has broken its promise or acted deceptively in the land-financing transactions at issue, one is hard put to understand why the Tribe could not likewise enforce in its courts a law that commands: Thou shall not discriminate against tribal members in the terms and conditions you offer them in those same transactions.  The Federal Government and every State, county, and municipality can make nondiscrimination the law governing contracts generally, and real property transactions in particular.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981, 1982.  Why should the Tribe lack comparable authority to shield its members against discrimination by those engaging in on-reservation commercial relationships\xe2\x80\x94including land-secured lending\xe2\x80\x94 with them?</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cfighting issue\xe2\x80\x9d in the tribal trial court, the Eighth Circuit underscored, \xe2\x80\x9cwas whether the bank denied the Longs favorable terms on a deal solely on the basis of their race or tribal affiliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 891.  The Longs maintained that the Bank initially offered them more favorable terms, proposing to sell the mortgaged land back to them with a 20-year contract for deed.  Thereafter, the Bank sent a letter to Ronnie Long withdrawing its initial offer, \xe2\x80\x9cciting\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possible jurisdictional problems\xe2\x80\x99 posed by the Long Company\xe2\x80\x99s status as an \xe2\x80\x98Indian owned entity on the reservation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 882 (quoting Letter from Charles Simon, Vice President, Bank of Hoven, to Ronnie Long (Apr. 26, 1996), App. 91).  In the final agreement, the Bank promised no long-term financing; instead, it gave the Longs only a two-year lease with an option to purchase that required a large balloon payment within 60 days of the lease\xe2\x80\x99s expiration.  When the Longs were unable to make the required payment within the specified deadline, the Bank sold the land to nonmembers on more favorable terms.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In their complaint, the Longs alleged that the Bank allowed the non-Indians \xe2\x80\x9cten years to pay for the land, but the bank would not permit [the] Longs even 60 days to pay for their land,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch unfair discrimination by the bank prevented the Longs and the [Long] Company from buying back their land from the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 173.  Although the allegations about the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s contracts to sell to nonmembers were central to the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 lawsuit, those transactions with third parties were not the wrong about which the Longs complained.  Rather, as the tribal trial court observed, the contracts with nonmembers simply supplied \xe2\x80\x9c<em>evidence</em> that the Bank denied the Longs the privilege of contracting for a deed because of their status as tribal members.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9378 to A\xe2\x80\x9379 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tribal Court instructed the jury to hold the Bank liable on the discrimination claim only if the less favorable terms given to the Longs rested \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d upon the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crace or tribal identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 883 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In response to a special interrogatory, the jury found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Defendant Bank intentionally discriminate[d] against the Plaintiffs Ronnie and Lila Long [in the lease with option to purchase] based solely upon their status as Indians or tribal members.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 191.  Neither the instruction nor the special finding necessitated regulation of, or interference with, the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s fee-land sales to non-Indian individuals.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tellingly, the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s principal jurisdictional argument below bore no relationship to the position the Court embraces.  The Bank recognized that the Longs were indeed complaining about discriminatory conduct of a familiar sort.  Cf. <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/index.html">392 U. S. 409</a>, 413 (1968) (42 U.

That criticism is unfair.  First, the record does not confirm that the Longs were riskier buyers than the nonmembers to whom the Bank eventually sold the land.  Overlooked by the Court, the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s loans to the Longs were sheltered by BIA loan guarantees.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Further, a determination that the Longs had encountered intentional discrimination based solely on their status as tribal members in no way inhibited the Bank from differentiating evenhandedly among borrowers based on their creditworthiness.  The proscription of discrimination simply required the Bank to offer the Longs the same terms it would have offered <em>similarly situated</em> non-Indians.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court types the Longs\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination claim as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98novel,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20 (quoting 491 F. 3d, at 892), because the Tribal Court of Appeals derived the applicable law \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98directly from Lakota tradition,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20 (quoting 440 F.
