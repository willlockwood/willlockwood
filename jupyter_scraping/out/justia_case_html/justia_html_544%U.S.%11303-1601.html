Section 332(c)(7) imposes specific limitations on the traditional authority of state and local governments to regulate the location, construction, and modification of wireless communications facilities, and provides, in \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v), that anyone \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affected by any final action \xe2\x80\xa6 by [such] a \xe2\x80\xa6 government \xe2\x80\xa6 may \xe2\x80\xa6 commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court held that \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v) provided the exclusive remedy for the City\xe2\x80\x99s actions and, accordingly, ordered the City to grant respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application for a conditional-use permit, but refused respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for damages under \xc2\xa71983.  The Ninth Circuit reversed on the latter point.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0An individual may not enforce \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on local zoning authority through a \xc2\xa71983 action.

The TCA adds no remedies to those available under \xc2\xa71983, and limits relief in ways that \xc2\xa71983 does not.  In contrast to a \xc2\xa71983 action, TCA judicial review must be sought within 30 days after the governmental entity has taken \xe2\x80\x9cfinal action,\xe2\x80\x9d and, once the action is filed, the court must \xe2\x80\x9chear and decide\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9con an expedited basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v).  Moreover, unlike \xc2\xa71983 remedies, TCA remedies perhaps do not include compensatory damages, and certainly do not include attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  The Court rejects Abrams\xe2\x80\x99s arguments for borrowing \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v)\xe2\x80\x99s 30-day limitations period, rather than applying the longer statute of limitations authorized under 42 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7332(c)(7), through an action under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), 110 Stat. 56, to promote competition and higher quality in American telecommunications services and to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.<em> </em>One of the means by which it sought to accomplish these goals was reduction of the impediments imposed by local governments upon the installation of facilities for wireless communications, such as antenna towers.  To this end, the TCA amended the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, to include \xc2\xa7332(c)(7), which imposes specific limitations on the traditional authority of state and local governments to regulate the location, construction, and modification of such facilities, 110 Stat. 151, codified at 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7332(c)(7).  Under this provision, local governments may not \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), take actions that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II), or limit the placement of wireless facilities \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(iv).  They must act on requests for authorization to locate wireless facilities \xe2\x80\x9cwithin a reasonable period of time,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii), and each decision denying such a request must \xe2\x80\x9cbe in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(iii).  Lastly, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v), which is central to the present case, provides as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAny person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Mark Abrams owns a home in a low-density, residential neighborhood in the City of Rancho Palos Verdes, California (City).  His property is located at a high elevation, near the peak of the Rancho Palos Verdes Peninsula.  <em>Rancho Palos Verdes </em>v. <em>Abrams</em>, 101 Cal. App. 4th 367, 371, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 80, 82 (2002).  The record reflects that the location is both scenic and, because of its high elevation, ideal for radio transmissions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 371\xe2\x80\x93372, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 82\xe2\x80\x9383.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1989, respondent obtained a permit from the City to construct a 52.5-foot antenna on his property for amateur use.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He installed the antenna shortly thereafter, and in the years that followed placed several smaller, tripod antennas on the property without prior permission from the City.  He used the antennas both for noncommercial purposes (to provide an amateur radio service and to relay signals from other amateur radio operators) and for commercial purposes (to provide customers two-way radio communications from portable and mobile transceivers, and to repeat the signals of customers so as to enable greater range of transmission).  <em>Ibid</em>.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998, respondent sought permission to construct a second antenna tower.  In the course of investigating that application, the City learned that respondent was using his antennas to provide a commercial service, in violation of a City ordinance requiring a \xe2\x80\x9cconditional-use permit\xe2\x80\x9d from the City Planning Commission (Commission) for commercial antenna use.  See Commission Resolution No. 2000\xe2\x80\x9312 (\xe2\x80\x9cA Resolution of the Planning Commission of the City of Rancho Palos Verdes Denying With Prejudice Conditional Use Permit No. 207 for the Proposed Commercial Use of Existing Antennae on an Existing Antenna Support Structure, Located at 44 Oceanaire Drive in the <em>Del Cerro</em> Neighborhood\xe2\x80\x9d), App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.  On suit by the City, Los Angeles County Superior Court enjoined respondent from using the antennas for a commercial purpose.  <em>Rancho Palos Verdes</em>, 101 Cal. App. 4th, at 373, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 84; App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two weeks later, in July of 1999, respondent applied to the Commission for the requisite conditional-use permit.  The application drew strong opposition from several of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors.  The Commission conducted two hearings and accepted written evidence, after which it denied the application.  <em>Id.</em>, at 54a\xe2\x80\x9363a.  The Commission explained that granting respondent permission to operate commercially \xe2\x80\x9cwould perpetuate \xe2\x80\xa6 adverse visual impacts\xe2\x80\x9d from respondent\xe2\x80\x99s existing antennas and establish precedent for similar projects in residential areas in the future.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57a.  The Commission also concluded that denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application was consistent with 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7332(c)(7), making specific findings that its action complied with each of that provision\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a\xe2\x80\x9362a.  The city council denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  <em>Id.</em>, at 52a.  See, generally, No. CV00\xe2\x80\x9309071\xe2\x80\x93SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Jan. 9, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a\xe2\x80\x9323a. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 24, 2000, respondent filed this action against the City in the District Court for the Central District of California, alleging, as relevant, that denial of the use permit violated the limitations placed on the City\xe2\x80\x99s zoning authority by \xc2\xa7332(c)(7).  In particular, respondent charged that the City\xe2\x80\x99s action discriminated against the mobile relay services he sought to provide, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), effectively prohibited the provision of mobile relay services, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II), and was not supported by substantial evidence in the record, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(iii).  Pet. App. 17a.  Respondent sought injunctive relief under \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v), and money damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71983 and 1988.  Plaintiff/Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Brief Re: Remedies and Damages, Case No. 00\xe2\x80\x9309071\xe2\x80\x93SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Feb. 25, 2002), App. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 2a-7a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v)\xe2\x80\x99s direction that courts \xe2\x80\x9chear and decide\xe2\x80\x9d actions \xe2\x80\x9con an expedited basis,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court did not act on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint until January 9, 2002, 16 months after filing; it concluded that the City\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a conditional-use permit was not supported by substantial evidence.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\xe2\x80\x9326a.  The court explained that the City could not rest its denial on aesthetic concerns, since the antennas in question were already in existence and would remain in place whatever the disposition of the permit application.  <em>Id.</em>, at 23a\xe2\x80\x9324a.  Nor, the court said, could the City reasonably base its decision on the fear of setting precedent for the location of commercial antennas in residential areas, since adverse impacts from new structures would always be a basis for permit denial.  <em>Id.</em>, at 25a.  In light of the paucity of support for the City\xe2\x80\x99s action, the court concluded that denial of the permit was \xe2\x80\x9can act of spite by the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 24a.  In an order issued two months later, the District Court held that \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v) provided the exclusive remedy for the City\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  Judgment of Injunction, No. CV00\xe2\x80\x9309071\xe2\x80\x93SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Mar. 18, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a.  Accordingly, it ordered the City to grant respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application for a conditional-use permit, but refused respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for damages under \xc2\xa71983.  Respondent appealed.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the latter point, and remanded for determination of money damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  354 F.\xc2\xa03d 1094, 1101 (2004).  We granted certiorari.  542 U. S. ___ (2004). </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title 42 U.

As a threshold matter, the text of \xc2\xa71983 permits the enforcement of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>rights</em>, not the broader or vaguer \xe2\x80\x98benefits\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98interests.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzaga Univ. </em>v. <em>Doe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/273/index.html">536 U. S. 273</a>, 283 (2002) (emphasis in original).  Accordingly, to sustain a \xc2\xa71983 action, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the federal statute creates an individually enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which he belongs.  See <em>id</em>., at 285.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even after this showing, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under \xc2\xa71983.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blessing </em>v. <em>Freestone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/329/index.html">520 U.

See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/index.html">468 U. S. 992</a>, 1012 (1984).  Our cases have explained that evidence of such congressional intent may be found directly in the statute creating the right, or inferred from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s creation of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under \xc2\xa71983.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blessing</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 341.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See also <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority</em> v. <em>National Sea Clammers Assn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/index.html">453 U.

The critical question, then, is whether Congress meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by \xc2\xa7332(c)(7) to coexist with an alternative remedy available in a \xc2\xa71983 action.  We conclude not.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision of an express, private means of redress in the statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress did not intend to leave open a more expansive remedy under \xc2\xa71983.  As we have said in a different setting, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 290 (2001).  Thus, the existence of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory violations has been the dividing line between those cases in which we have held that an action would lie under \xc2\xa71983 and those in which we have held that it would not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have found \xc2\xa71983 unavailable to remedy violations of federal statutory rights in two cases: <em>Sea Clammers </em>and <em>Smith.</em>  Both of those decisions rested upon the existence of more restrictive remedies provided in the violated statute itself.  See <em>Smith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1011\xe2\x80\x931012 (recognizing a \xc2\xa71983 action \xe2\x80\x9cwould . . . render superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Sea Clammers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 20 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a state official is alleged to have violated a federal statute which provides its own comprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements of that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed by bringing suit directly under \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Moreover, in <em>all</em> of the cases in which we have held that \xc2\xa71983 <em>is </em>available for violation of a federal statute, we have emphasized that the statute at issue, in contrast to those in <em>Sea Clammers </em>and <em>Smith</em>, <em>did not</em> provide a private judicial remedy (or, in most of the cases, even a private administrative remedy) for the rights violated.  See <em>Blessing</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 348 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike the federal programs at issue in <em>[Sea Clammers and Smith]</em>, Title IV\xe2\x80\x93D contains no private remedy\xe2\x80\x94either judicial or administrative\xe2\x80\x94through which aggrieved persons can seek redress\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Livadas</em> v. <em>Bradshaw,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/107/index.html">512 U.

Brief for United States\xc2\xa017; Brief for Petitioners 35.  We decline to do so.  The ordinary inference that the remedy provided in the statute is exclusive can surely be overcome by textual indication, express or implicit, that the remedy is to complement, rather than supplant, \xc2\xa71983.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, however, no such indication in the TCA, which adds no remedies to those available under \xc2\xa71983, and limits relief in ways that \xc2\xa71983 does not.  Judicial review of zoning decisions under \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v) must be sought within 30 days after the governmental entity has taken \xe2\x80\x9cfinal action,\xe2\x80\x9d and, once the action is filed, the court must \xe2\x80\x9chear and decide\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9con an expedited basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v).  The remedies available, moreover, perhaps do not include compensatory damages (the lower courts are seemingly in disagreement on this point[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]), and certainly do not include attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  A \xc2\xa71983 action, by contrast, can be brought much later than 30 days after the final action,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and need not be heard and decided on an expedited basis.  And the successful plaintiff may recover not only damages but reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988.  <em>Thiboutot</em>, 448 U. S., at 9.  Liability for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees would have a particularly severe impact in the \xc2\xa7332(c)(7) context, making local governments liable for the (often substantial) legal expenses of large commercial interests for the misapplication of a complex and novel statutory scheme.  See <em>Nextel Partners Inc. </em>v. <em>Kingston Township</em>, 286 F.\xc2\xa03d 687, 695 (CA3 2002) (Alito, J.)

That response assumes, however, that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to attach attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the remedy that it created in the TCA does not <em>itself</em> represent a congressional choice.  <em>Sea Clammers</em> and <em>Smith</em> adopt the opposite assumption\xe2\x80\x94that limitations upon the remedy contained in the statute are deliberate and are not to be evaded through \xc2\xa71983.  See <em>Smith</em>, 468 U. S., at 1011\xe2\x80\x931012, and n. 5;<em> Sea Clammers</em>, 453 U.

He argues that the rule adopted in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Garcia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/261/index.html">471 U. S. 261</a> (1985), that \xc2\xa71983 claims are governed by the state-law statute of limitations for personal-injury torts, does not apply to \xc2\xa71983 actions to enforce statutes that themselves contain a statute of limitations; in such cases, he argues, the limitations period in the federal statute displaces the otherwise applicable state statute of limitations.  This contention cannot be reconciled with our decision in <em>Wilson</em>, which expressly rejected the proposition that the limitations period for a \xc2\xa71983 claim depends on the nature of the underlying right being asserted.  See <em>id.</em>, at 271\xe2\x80\x93275.  We concluded instead that 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 is \xe2\x80\x9ca directive to select, in each State, the one most appropriate statute of limitations for <em>all</em> \xc2\xa71983 claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U. S., at 275 (emphasis added); see also <em>Owens</em> v. <em>Okure,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/235/index.html"></a><a href="/us/488/235/index.html">488 U.

We acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9ca few \xc2\xa71983 claims are based on statutory rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilson</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 278, but carved out no exception for them.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent also argues that, if 28 U.

This is so, he claims, because \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that actions be filed within 30 days falls within \xc2\xa71658\xe2\x80\x99s prefatory clause, \xe2\x80\x9cExcept as otherwise provided by law.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We think not.  The language of \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v) that imposes the limitations period (\xe2\x80\x9cwithin 30 days after such action or failure to act\xe2\x80\x9d) is inextricably linked to\xe2\x80\x94indeed, is embedded within\xe2\x80\x94the language that creates the right of action (\xe2\x80\x9cmay . . . commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  It cannot possibly be regarded as a statute of limitations generally applicable to <em>any</em> action to enforce the rights created by \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B).  Cf. <em>Agency Holding Corp.</em> v. <em>Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/index.html">483 U.

Indeed, the crux of our holding is that \xc2\xa7332(c)(7) has no effect on \xc2\xa71983 whatsoever: The rights \xc2\xa7332(c)(7) created may not be enforced under \xc2\xa71983 and, conversely, the claims available under \xc2\xa71983 prior to the enactment of the TCA continue to be available after its enactment.  The saving clause of the TCA does not require a court to go farther and permit enforcement under \xc2\xa71983 of the TCA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive standards.  To apply to the present case what we said with regard to a different statute: \xe2\x80\x9cThe right [Abrams] claims under [\xc2\xa7332(c)(7)] did not even arguably exist before the passage of [the TCA].  The only question here, therefore, is whether the rights created by [the TCA] may be asserted within the <em>remedial </em>framework of [\xc2\xa71983].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Great American Fed.

The reviewing court must \xe2\x80\x9chear and decide such action on an expedited basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the court must determine, among other things, whether a zoning board\xe2\x80\x99s decision denying a permit is supported by \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This procedural and judicial review scheme resembles that governing many federal agency decisions.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93458, at 208 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe phrase \xe2\x80\x98substantial evidence contained in a written record\xe2\x80\x99 is the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 1983 suits, however, differ considerably from ordinary review of agency action.  The former involve plenary judicial evaluation of asserted rights deprivations; the latter involves deferential consideration of matters within an agency\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.  And, in my view, to permit \xc2\xa71983 actions here would undermine the compromise\xe2\x80\x94between purely federal and purely local siting policies\xe2\x80\x94that the statute reflects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, and for those set forth by the Court, I agree that Congress, in this statute, intended its judicial remedy as an exclusive remedy.  In particular, Congress intended that remedy to foreclose\xe2\x80\x94not to supplement\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa71983 relief.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961788">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nRANCHO PALOS VERDES V.

The inquiry varies from statute to statute.  Sometimes the question is whether, despite its silence, Congress intended us to recognize an implied cause of action.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a> (1979).  Sometimes we ask whether, despite its silence, Congress intended us to enforce the pre-existing remedy provided in Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  See <em>Maine</em> v. <em>Thiboutot</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/index.html">448 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1980).  And still other times, despite Congress\xe2\x80\x99 inclusion of specific clauses designed specifically to preserve pre-existing remedies, we have nevertheless concluded that Congress impliedly foreclosed the \xc2\xa71983 remedy.  See <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority</em> v. <em>National Sea Clammers Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/index.html">453 U. S. 1</a>, 13 (1981).  Whenever we perform this gap-filling task, it is appropriate not only to study the text and structure of the statutory scheme, but also to examine its legislative history.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id., </em>at 17\xe2\x80\x9318; <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Robinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/index.html">468 U. S. 992</a>, 1009 (1984); <em>Cannon</em>, 441 U. S., at 694.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and history all provide convincing evidence that Congress intended the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA) to operate as a comprehensive and exclusive remedial scheme.  The structure of the statute appears fundamentally incompatible with the private remedy offered by \xc2\xa71983.*<footcall num="*">  Moreover, there is not a shred of evidence in the legislative history suggesting that, despite this structure, Congress intended plaintiffs to be able to recover damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Thus, petitioners have made \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>difficult showing </em>that allowing \xc2\xa71983 actions to go forward in these circumstances \xe2\x80\x98would be inconsistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 carefully tailored scheme.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blessing</em> v. <em>Freestone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/329/index.html">520 U. S. 329</a>, 346 (1997) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Golden State Transit Corp.</em> v. <em>Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/index.html">493 U. S. 103</a>, 107 (1989)).  I therefore join the judgment of the Court without reservation.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two flaws in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, however, persuade me to write separately.  First, I do not believe that the Court has properly acknowledged the strength of our normal presumption that Congress intended to preserve, rather than preclude, the availability of \xc2\xa71983 as a remedy for the enforcement of federal statutory rights.  Title 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 was \xe2\x80\x9cintended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U. S. 658</a>, 700\xe2\x80\x93701 (1978).  \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not lightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on \xc2\xa71983 as a remedy \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Since 1871, when it was passed by Congress, \xc2\xa71983 has stood as an independent safeguard against deprivations of federal constitutional and statutory rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em>, 468 U. S., at 1012.  Although the Court is correct to point out that this presumption is rebuttable, it remains true that only an <em>exceptional</em> case\xe2\x80\x94such as one involving an unusually comprehensive and exclusive statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x94will lead us to conclude that a given statute impliedly forecloses a \xc2\xa71983 remedy.  See <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/279/418/index.html">279 U. S. 418</a>, 452 (1979) (statutory scheme must be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently comprehensive and effective to raise a clear inference that Congress intended to foreclose a \xc2\xa71983 cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d).  While I find it easy to conclude that petitioners have met that heavy burden here, there will be many instances in which \xc2\xa71983 will be available even though Congress has not explicitly so provided in the text of the statute in question.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id., </em>at 424\xe2\x80\x93425; <em>Blessing</em>, 520 U. S., at 346\xe2\x80\x93348.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court incorrectly assumes that the legislative history of the statute is totally irrelevant.  This is contrary to nearly every case we have decided in this area of law, all of which have surveyed, or at least acknowledged, the available legislative history or lack thereof.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wright</em>, 479 U. S., at 424\xe2\x80\x93426 (citing legislative history); <em>Smith</em>, 468 U. S., at 1009\xe2\x80\x931010 (same); <em>Sea Clammers</em>, 453 U. S., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (noting that one of the relevant factors in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[s] the legislative history\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Cannon</em>, 441 U. S., at 694 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, as a general matter of statutory interpretation, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to discuss an issue during prolonged legislative deliberations may itself be probative.  As The Chief Justice has cogently observed: \xe2\x80\x9cIn a case where the construction of legislative language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harrison</em> v. <em>PPG Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/578/index.html">446 U. S. 578</a>, 602 (1980) (dissenting opinion).  The Court has endorsed the view that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence on questions such as this one \xe2\x80\x9ccan be likened to the dog that did not bark.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chisom</em> v. <em>Roemer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/380/index.html">501 U. S. 380</a>, 396, n.\xc2\xa023 (1991) (citing A. Doyle, Silver Blaze, in The Complete Sherlock Holmes 335 (1927)).  Congressional silence is surely probative in this case because, despite the fact that awards of damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees could have potentially disastrous consequences for the likely defendants in most private actions under the TCA, see <em>Primeco Personal Communications </em>v. <em>Mequon</em>, 352 F.\xc2\xa03d 1147, 1152 (CA7 2003), nowhere in the course of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 lengthy deliberations is there any hint that Congress wanted damages or attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to be available.  That silence reinforces every other clue that we can glean from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt>*<footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The evidence supporting this conclusion is substantial.  It includes, <em>inter alia</em>, the fact that the private remedy specified in 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v) requires all enforcement actions to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 30 days after such action or failure to act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Once a plaintiff brings such an action, the statute requires the court both to \xe2\x80\x9chear and decide\xe2\x80\x9d the case \xe2\x80\x9con an expedited basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As the Court properly notes, <em>ante,</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, the TCA\xe2\x80\x99s streamlined and expedited scheme for resolving telecommunication zoning disputes is fundamentally incompatible with the applicable limitations periods that generally govern \xc2\xa71983 litigation, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Garcia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/index.html">471 U. S. 261</a> (1985), as well as the deliberate pace with which civil rights litigation generally proceeds.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93458, p.\xc2\xa0208\xe2\x80\x93209 (1996) (expressing the intent of the congressional Conference that zoning decisions should be \xe2\x80\x9crendered in a reasonable period of time\xe2\x80\x9d and that Congress expected courts to \xe2\x80\x9cact expeditiously in deciding such cases\xe2\x80\x9d that may arise from disputed decisions).  Like the Court, I am not persuaded that the statutory requirements can simply be mapped onto the existing structure of \xc2\xa71983, and there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress would have wanted us to do so.  For these reasons, among others, I believe it is clear that Congress intended \xc2\xa7332(c)(7) to operate as the exclusive remedy by which plaintiffs can obtain judicial relief for violations of the TCA.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
