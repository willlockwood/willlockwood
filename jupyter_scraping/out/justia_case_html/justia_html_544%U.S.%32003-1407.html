JACOWAY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ROUSEY et ux. <em>v.</em> JACOWAY</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931407.Argued December 1, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 4, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Several years after petitioners deposited distributions from their pension plans into Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), they filed a joint petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  They sought to shield portions of their IRAs from their creditors by claiming them as exempt from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E), which provides, <em>inter alia,</em> that a debtor may withdraw from the estate his \xe2\x80\x9cright to receive \xe2\x80\xa6 a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of \xe2\x80\xa6 age.\xe2\x80\x9d  Respondent Jacoway, the Bankruptcy Trustee, objected to the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 exemption and moved for turnover of the IRAs to her.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained her objection and granted her motion, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) agreed.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, even if the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs were \xe2\x80\x9csimilar plans or contracts\xe2\x80\x9d to the plans specified in \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E), their IRAs gave them no right to receive payment \xe2\x80\x9con account of age,\xe2\x80\x9d but were instead savings accounts readily accessible at any time for any purpose.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Rouseys can exempt IRA assets from the bankruptcy estate because the IRAs fulfill both of the \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E) requirements at issue here\xe2\x80\x94they confer a right to receive payment on account of age and they are similar plans or contracts to those enumerated in \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court reaffirms its suggestion in <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Shumate,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/753/index.html">504 U. S. 753</a>, 762\xe2\x80\x93763, that IRAs like the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 can be exempted from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs provide a right to payment \xe2\x80\x9con account of \xe2\x80\xa6 age\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  The quoted phrase requires that the right to receive payment be \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d age.  <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn.</em> v. <em>203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/434/index.html">526 U. S. 434</a>, 450\xe2\x80\x93451.  This meaning comports with the common, dictionary understanding of \xe2\x80\x9con account of,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E)\xe2\x80\x99s context does not suggest another meaning.  The statutes governing IRAs persuade the Court that Jacoway is mistaken in arguing that there is no causal connection between that right and age or any other factor because the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs provide a right to payment on demand.  Their right to receive payment of the entire balance is not in dispute.  Because their accounts qualify as IRAs under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408(a), they have a nonforfeitable right to the balance held in those accounts, \xc2\xa7408(a)(4).  That right is restricted by a 10 percent tax penalty on any withdrawal made before age 59, \xc2\xa772(t).  Contrary to Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s contention, this 10 percent penalty is substantial.  It applies proportionally to any amounts withdrawn and prevents access to the 10 percent that the Rouseys would forfeit should they withdraw early.  It therefore effectively prevents access to the entire balance in their IRAs and limits their right to \xe2\x80\x9cpayment\xe2\x80\x9d of the balance.  And because this condition is removed when the accountholder turns age 59, the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to the balance of their IRAs is a right to payment \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d age.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs are \xe2\x80\x9csimilar plan[s] or contract[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cstock bonus, pension, profitsharing, [or] annuity \xe2\x80\xa6 plan[s]\xe2\x80\x9d listed in \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  To be \xe2\x80\x9csimilar,\xe2\x80\x9d an IRA must be like, though not identical to, the listed plans or contracts, and consequently must share characteristics common to them.  Because the Bankruptcy Code does not define the listed plans, the Court looks to their ordinary meaning.  <em>E.g., United States</em> v. <em>LaBonte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/751/index.html">520 U. S. 751</a>, 757.  Dictionary definitions reveal that, although the listed plans are dissimilar to each other in some respects, their common feature is that they provide income that substitutes for wages earned as salary or hourly compensation.  That the income the Rouseys will derive from their IRAs is likewise income that substitutes for wages lost upon retirement is demonstrated by the facts that (1) regulations require distribution to begin no later than the calendar year after the year the accountholder turns 70; (2) taxation of IRA money is deferred until the year in which it is distributed; (3) withdrawals before age 59 are subject to the 10 percent penalty; and (4) failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a 50 percent tax penalty on funds improperly remaining in the account.  The Court rejects Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s argument that IRAs cannot be similar plans or contracts because the Rouseys have complete access to them.  This argument is premised on her view that the 10 percent penalty is modest, a premise with which the Court does not agree.  The Court also rejects Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the availability of IRA withdrawals exempt from the early withdrawal penalty renders the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs more like savings accounts.  Sections 522(d)(10)(E)(i) through (iii)\xe2\x80\x94which preclude the debtor from using the \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E) exemption if an insider established his plan or contract; the right to receive payment is on account of age or length of service; and the plan does not qualify under specified Internal Revenue Code sections, including the section governing IRAs\xe2\x80\x94not only suggest generally that the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs are exempt, but also support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that they are \xe2\x80\x9csimilar plan[s] or contract[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522.  The question in this case is whether debtors can exempt assets in their Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  We hold that IRAs can be so exempted.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners Richard and Betty Jo Rousey were formerly employed at Northrup Grumman Corp.  At the termination of their employment, Northrup Grumman required them to take lump-sum distributions from their employer-sponsored pension plans.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rousey</em>, 283 B.\xc2\xa0R. 265, 268 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA8 2002); Brief for Petitioners 2.  The Rouseys deposited the lump sums into two IRAs, one in each of their names.  283 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 268<em>.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 accounts qualify as IRAs under a number of requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.  Each account is \xe2\x80\x9ca trust created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  The Internal Revenue Code limits the types of assets in which IRA-holders may invest their accounts, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7408(a)(3), (a)(5), and provides that the balance in IRAs is nonforfeitable, \xc2\xa7408(a)(4).  It also caps yearly contributions to IRAs.  \xc2\xa7408(<em>o</em>)(2).  Withdrawals made before the accountholder turns 59<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2  are, with limited exceptions, subject to a 10 percent tax penalty.  \xc2\xa772(t). </font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IRA contributions receive favorable tax treatment.  In particular, the Internal Revenue Code generally defers taxation of the money placed in IRAs and the income earned from those sums until the assets are withdrawn.  See \xc2\xa7219(a) (contributions to IRAs are tax deductible); \xc2\xa7408(e)(1) (IRA is tax exempt).  Moreover, within a certain timeframe accountholders can, as the Rouseys did here, roll over distributions received from other retirement plans.  \xc2\xa7408(a)(1).  The Internal Revenue Code encourages such rollovers by making them nontaxable.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7408(d)(3), 402(c)(1), 403(b)(8), and 457(e)(16).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRA agreements, as well as relevant regulations, provide that their \xe2\x80\x9centire interest in the custodial account must be, or begin to be, distributed by\xe2\x80\x9d April 1 following the calendar yearend in which they reach age 70<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rousey</em>, 275 B.\xc2\xa0R. 307, 310 (Bkrtcy.

In the schedules and statements accompanying their petition, the Rouseys sought to shield portions of their IRAs from their creditors by claiming them as exempt from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  This exemption provides that a debtor may withdraw from the bankruptcy estate his \xe2\x80\x9cright to receive\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p align="left">.....</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(E) a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service, to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Bankruptcy Court appointed respondent Jill R. Jacoway as the Chapter 7 Trustee.  As Trustee, Jacoway is responsible for overseeing the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate and the distribution of the proceeds.  She objected to the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 claim for the exemption of their IRAs and moved for turnover of those sums to her.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s objection and granted her motion.  275 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 309.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Rouseys appealed.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that the Rouseys could not exempt their IRAs under \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  It concluded that the IRAs were not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98similar plan[s] or contract[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity plans, because, by contrast to the limited access permitted in such plans, the Rouseys had \xe2\x80\x9cunlimited access\xe2\x80\x9d to the funds held in their IRAs.  283 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 272.  That access also meant, the BAP reasoned, that the Rouseys had complete control over the funds in their IRAs, \xe2\x80\x9csubject only to a ten percent tax penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 273.  Because they had such control, the payments from the IRAs were not \xe2\x80\x9con account of any factor listed in 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Rouseys again appealed and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals concluded that, even if the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98similar plans or contracts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity plans, their IRAs gave them no right to receive payment \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98on account of age.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rousey</em>, 347 F.\xc2\xa03d 689, 693 (2003).  Like the BAP, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to payment was conditioned neither on age nor on any of the other statutory factors.  Their IRAs were instead \xe2\x80\x9creadily accessible savings accounts of which the debtors may easily avail themselves (albeit with some discouraging tax consequences) at any time for any purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court of Appeals recognized that several of its sister Circuits had reached a contrary result.  <em>Ibid</em>.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Brucher</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 242, 243\xe2\x80\x93244 (CA6 2001); <em>In\xc2\xa0re McKown</em>, 203 F.\xc2\xa03d 1188, 1190 (CA9 2000); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Dubroff</em>, 119 F.\xc2\xa03d 75, 78 (CA2 1997); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Carmichael</em>, 100 F.\xc2\xa03d 375, 378 (CA5 1996).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve this division among the Courts of Appeals regarding whether debtors can exempt IRAs from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1085/index.html">541 U. S. 1085</a> (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a general matter, upon the filing of a petition for bankruptcy, \xe2\x80\x9call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property\xe2\x80\x9d become the property of the bankruptcy estate and will be distributed to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s creditors.  \xc2\xa7541(a)(1).  To help the debtor obtain a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to withdraw from the estate certain interests in property, such as his car or home, up to certain values.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7522(d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Security Industrial Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/70/index.html">459 U. S. 70</a>, 72, n. 1 (1982).  In this case, the Rouseys claimed their IRAs as exempt under \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  Under the terms of the statute, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to receive payment under their IRAs must meet three requirements to be exempted under this provision: (1) the right to receive payment must be from \xe2\x80\x9ca stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) the right to receive payment must be \xe2\x80\x9con account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) even then, the right to receive payment may be exempted only \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent\xe2\x80\x9d that it is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary to support\xe2\x80\x9d the accountholder or his dependents.  \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispute in this case is whether the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs fulfill the first and second requirements.  This Court implied that IRAs like the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 satisfy both elements in <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Shumate,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/753/index.html">504 U. S. 753</a> (1992).  There, in construing another section of the Bankruptcy Code, this Court stated that IRAs could be exempted pursuant to \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  <em>Id</em>., at 762\xe2\x80\x93763 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest [in an IRA] could not be excluded under \xc2\xa7541(c)(2) \xe2\x80\xa6 , that interest nevertheless could be exempted under \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E)\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  We now reaffirm that statement and conclude that IRAs can be exempted from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn first to the requirement that the payment be \xe2\x80\x9con account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We have interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d elsewhere within the Bankruptcy Code to mean \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby requiring a causal connection between the term that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d modifies and the factor specified in the statute at issue.  <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn.</em> v. <em>203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/434/index.html">526 U. S. 434</a>, 450\xe2\x80\x93451 (1999).  In reaching that conclusion, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly the usage meant for the phrase at other places in the [bankruptcy] statute,\xe2\x80\x9d including the provision at issue here\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  <em>Ibid.</em>  This meaning comports with the common understanding of \xe2\x80\x9con account of.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Random House Dictionary of the English Language 13 (2d ed. 1987) (listing as definitions \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 13 (1981) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 3d) (same).  The context of this provision does not suggest that Congress deviated from the term\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E) requires that the right to receive payment be \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d illness, disability, death, age, or length of service.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jacoway argues that the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to receive payment from their IRAs is not \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d these listed factors.  In particular, she asserts that the Rouseys can withdraw funds from their IRAs for any reason at all, so long as they are willing to pay a 10 percent penalty.  Thus, Jacoway maintains that there is no causal connection between the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to payment and age (or any other factor), because their IRAs provide a right to payment on demand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  The statutes governing IRAs persuade us that the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to payment from IRAs is causally connected to their age.  Their right to receive payment of the entire balance is not in dispute.  Because their accounts qualify as IRAs under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II), the Rouseys have a nonforfeitable right to the balance held in those accounts, \xc2\xa7408(a)(4).  That right is restricted by a 10 percent tax penalty that applies to withdrawals from IRAs made before the accountholder turns 59<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2.  Contrary to Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s contention, this tax penalty is substantial.  The deterrent to early withdrawal it creates suggests that Congress designed it to preclude early access to IRAs.  The low rates of early withdrawals are consistent with the notion that this penalty substantially deters early withdrawals from such accounts.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Because the 10 percent penalty applies proportionally to any amounts withdrawn, it prevents access to the 10 percent that the Rouseys would forfeit should they withdraw early, and thus it effectively prevents access to the entire balance in their IRAs.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It therefore limits the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 right to \xe2\x80\x9cpayment\xe2\x80\x9d of the balance of their IRAs.

Jacoway counters that IRAs are unlike the listed plans because those plans provide \xe2\x80\x9cdeferred compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 22, whereas IRAs allow complete access to deposited funds and are therefore not deferred at all, <em>id.</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  We agree with the Rouseys that IRAs are similar to the plans specified in the statute.  Those plans, like the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs, provide a substitute for wages (by wages, for present purposes, we mean compensation earned as hourly or salary income), and are not mere savings accounts.  The Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs are therefore \xe2\x80\x9csimilar plan[s] or contract[s]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn first to the characteristics the specific plans and contracts listed in \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E) share.  The Bankruptcy Code does not define the terms \xe2\x80\x9cprofitsharing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstock bonus,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpension,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cannuity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, we look to the ordinary meaning of these terms.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>LaBonte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/751/index.html">520 U. S. 751</a>, 757 (1997); <em>Perrin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/37/index.html">444 U. S. 37</a>, 42 (1979).  A \xe2\x80\x9cprofitsharing\xe2\x80\x9d plan, of course, is \xe2\x80\x9c[a] system by which employees receive a share of the profits of a business enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Am. Hert. 1045.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Profitsharing plans may provide deferred compensation, but they may also be \xe2\x80\x9ccash plans\xe2\x80\x9d in which a predetermined percentage of the profits is distributed to employees at set intervals.  J. Langbein &amp; B. Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 48 (3d ed. 2000).  A stock bonus plan is like a profitsharing plan, except that it distributes company stock rather than cash from profits.  <em>Id</em>., at 49.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  A pension is defined as \xe2\x80\x9ca fixed sum \xe2\x80\xa6 paid under given conditions to a person following his retirement from service (as due to age or disability) or to the surviving dependents of a person entitled to such a pension.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 3d 1671.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Finally, an annuity is \xe2\x80\x9can amount payable yearly or at other regular intervals \xe2\x80\xa6 for a certain or uncertain period (as for years, for life, or in perpetuity).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 88.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common feature of all of these plans is that they provide income that substitutes for wages earned as salary or hourly compensation.  This understanding of the plans\xe2\x80\x99 similarities comports with the other types of payments that a debtor may exempt under \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)\xe2\x80\x94all of which concern income that substitutes for wages.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9csocial security benefit, unemployment compensation, or a local public assistance benefit\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9ca veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefit\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(C) (\xe2\x80\x9cdisability, illness, or unemployment benefit\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(D) (\xe2\x80\x9calimony, support, or separate maintenance\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the plans are dissimilar in other respects: Employers establish and contribute to stock bonus, profitsharing, and pension plans or contracts, whereas an individual can establish and contribute to an annuity on terms and conditions he selects.  Moreover, pension plans and annuities provide deferred payment, whereas profitsharing or stock bonus plans may or may not provide deferred payment.  And while a pension provides retirement income, none of these other plans necessarily provides retirement income.  What all of these plans have in common is that they provide income that substitutes for wages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several considerations convince us that the income the Rouseys will derive from their IRAs is likewise income that substitutes for wages.  First, the minimum distribution requirements, as discussed above, require distribution to begin at the latest in the calendar year after the year in which the accountholder turns 70<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2.  Thus, accountholders must begin to withdraw funds when they are likely to be retired and lack wage income.  Second, the Internal Revenue Code defers taxation of money held in accounts qualifying as IRAs under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) until the year in which it is distributed, treating it as income only in such years.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7219, 408(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  This tax treatment further encourages accountholders to wait until retirement to withdraw the funds: The later withdrawal occurs, the longer the taxes on the amounts are deferred.  Third, absent the applicability of other exceptions discussed above, withdrawals before age 59<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2 are subject to a tax penalty, restricting preretirement access to the funds.  Finally, to ensure that the beneficiary uses the IRA in his retirement years, an accountholder\xe2\x80\x99s failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a 50-percent tax penalty on funds improperly remaining in the account.  \xc2\xa74974(a).  All of these features show that IRA income substitutes for wages lost upon retirement and distinguish IRAs from typical savings accounts.</font></font></font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find unpersuasive Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the IRAs cannot be similar plans or contracts because the Rouseys have complete access to them.  At bottom, this contention rests, as did her \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d argument, on the premise that the tax penalty imposed for early withdrawal is modest and hence not a true limit on the withdrawal of funds.  As explained above, however, that penalty erects a substantial barrier to early withdrawal.  <em>Supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Funds in a typical savings account, by contrast, can be withdrawn without age-based penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also reject Jacoway\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the availability of IRA withdrawals exempt from the 10 percent penalty renders the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs more like savings accounts.  While Jacoway is correct that the Internal Revenue Code permits penalty-free early withdrawals in certain limited circumstances, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa772(t)(2), these exceptions do not reduce the IRAs to savings accounts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The exceptions are narrow.  For example, penalty-free early distributions for health insurance premiums are limited to unemployed individuals who have received unemployment compensation for at least 12 consecutive weeks and have taken those distributions during the same year in which the unemployment compensation is made.  \xc2\xa772(t)(2)(D).  These payments are further limited to the actual amount paid for insurance for the accountholder, his spouse, and his dependents.  \xc2\xa772(t)(2)(D)(iii).  The Internal Revenue Code likewise caps the amount of, and sets qualifications for, both the higher education expenses and first-time home purchases for which penalty-free early distributions can be taken.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa772(t)(2)(E), 72(t)(7) (higher education expenses); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa772(t)(2)(F), 72(t)(8) (home purchases).  The Internal Revenue Code also permits penalty-free distributions to a beneficiary on the death of the accountholder or in the event that the accountholder becomes disabled.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa772(t)(2)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x93(iii).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These exceptions are limited in amount and scope.  Even with these carveouts, an early withdrawal without penalty remains the exception, rather than the rule.  And as we explained in discussing the \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, withdrawals from other retirement plans receive similar tax treatment. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion that the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs can be exempt under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E) finds support in clauses (i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii) of \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  These clauses bring into the estate certain rights to payment that otherwise would be exempt under \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).  They provide that a right to receive payment cannot be exempt if: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(i) such plan or contract was established by or under the auspices of an insider that employed the debtor at the time the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s rights under such plan or contract arose;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) such payment is on account of age or length of service; and </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c (iii) such plan or contract does not qualify under section 401(a), 403(a), 403(b) or 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, clauses (i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii) preclude the debtor from using this exemption if an insider established his plan or contract; the right to receive payment is on account of age or length of service; and the plan does not qualify under the specified Internal Revenue Code sections, including the section that governs IRAs, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a general matter, it makes little sense to exclude from the exemption plans that fail to qualify under \xc2\xa7408, unless all plans that do qualify under \xc2\xa7408, including IRAs, are generally within the exemption. If IRAs were not within 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E), Congress would not have referred to them in its exception.  <em>McKown</em>, 203 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1190.  More specifically, clause (iii) suggests that plans qualifying under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7408 (2000 ed. and Supp. II), including IRAs are similar plans or contracts.  The other sections of the Internal Revenue Code cited in clause (iii)\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7401(a), 403(a), and 403(b)\xe2\x80\x94all establish requirements for tax-qualified retirement plans that take the form of, among other things, annuities, profitsharing plans, and stock bonus plans.  By grouping \xc2\xa7408 with these other plans that are of the specific types listed in subparagraph (E), clause (iii) suggests that IRAs are similar to them.  Thus, the text of these clauses not only suggests generally that the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs are exempt, but also supports our conclusion that they are \xe2\x80\x9csimilar plan[s] or contract[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Rouseys\xe2\x80\x99 IRAs fulfill both of \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements at issue here\xe2\x80\x94they confer a right to receive payment on account of age and they are similar plans or contracts to those enumerated in \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E).

But these circumstances are confined to specific and narrow uses.  See <em>infra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Thus, that there are other circumstances in which the Rouseys can receive payment does not change our conclusion that they have a right to payment on account of age, for these exceptions do not undermine the fact that they cannot obtain unrestricted use of their funds until age 59.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7522(d)(10)(E) requires that the right to payment be on account of age\xe2\x80\x94not that it be solely on account of this factor.  </p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/79/index.html">519 U.
