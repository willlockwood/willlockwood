Nor did it conclude that the District Court would have erred had it denied Campbell a hearing altogether.

Although I am concerned about the glacial progress in this case, I have grave doubts about my authority to offer such relief by way of application. After all, most applications seek temporary relief, such as a stay of judgment, vacation of a stay, or a temporary injunction, and only where necessary or appropriate in aid of this Court\'s jurisdiction. See, <i>e. g., Drummond </i>v. <i>Acree, 409 </i>U. S. 1228 (1972) (Powell, J., in chambers) (application for stay); <i>O\'Brien </i>v. <i>Skinner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/1240/case.html">409 U. S. 1240</a> (1972) (Marshall, J., in chambers) (application for stay); see also <i>Coleman </i>v. <i>Paccar Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1301/case.html">424 U. S. 1301</a> (1976) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers) (application to vacate lower court stay); <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. </i>v. <i>Gray, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/1306/case.html">483 U. S. 1306</a> (1987) (BLACKMUN, J., in chambers) (application for injunction requiring that funds be escrowed pending outcome of case). Applicant, however, does not seek <i>interim </i>relief. Nor has he filed with this Court a petition for either a writ of certiorari or an extraordinary writ. Rather, he requests that I act alone to vacate the remand order of the en banc court, thereby barring the case\'s return to district court and prohibiting the taking of more evidence. I have not located a single published order in which a Circuit Justice has vacated or reversed a court of appeals\' order, other than an order providing interim relief; indeed, it appears that such an action would exceed my authority, which is limited to providing or vacating stays and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1304">1304</a></p><p>Opinion in Chambers</p><p>other temporary relief where necessary or appropriate in aid of this Court\'s jurisdiction. See <i>Kimble </i>v. <i>Swackhamer, 439 </i>U. S. 1385 (1978) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers) ("It scarcely requires reference to authority to conclude that a single Circuit Justice has no authority to \'summarily reverse\' a judgment of the highest court of a State; a single Justice has authority only to grant interim relief in order to preserve the jurisdiction of the full Court to consider an applicant\'s claim on the merits"). Because I do not believe I have the authority to vacate the Court of Appeals\' remand order unilaterally in my capacity as Circuit Justice, the application is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
