Similarly, the Court interpreted Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3701 not to prohibit taxes imposed on a discrete transaction, such as an inheritance, even though the value of the inheritance was measured according to the value of the federal obligations transferred.  <em>Plummer v.

Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann., Art. 7166 (Vernon 1960). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="860">Page 463 U. S. 860</a></p><p> It required each bank doing business in the State to report its real estate to the local tax assessor, and to submit a list of its shareholders with the number of shares owned by each.  The shareholders were required to report the actual value of their shares to the assessor in the bank\'s jurisdiction.  To prevent double taxation, each share was to be taxed to the shareholder on the difference between the share\'s cash value and the proportionate amount per share of the bank\'s real estate assessment.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are certain state and national banks and their shareholders.  Respondents are taxing subdivisions of the State of Texas, and officers and Boards of Equalization of those subdivisions, that levied taxes on petitioners\' bank shares pursuant to Art. 7166.  In determining the value of the bank shares subject to the tax, respondents included the value of United States obligations held by the banks.  Petitioners sought mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief against respondents in state court, asserting that \xc2\xa7 3701 required that the value of their bank shares be reduced by the proportionate value of the United States obligations held by the bank.</p>\n<p>In its initial opinion concerning petitioner Bank of Texas, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals held that the plain language of \xc2\xa7 3701, as amended, precludes consideration of United States obligations in the computation of any state or local tax.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a.  On motions for rehearing, the court withdrew its original opinion and, instead, upheld the tax.  <em>Bank of Texas v. Childs,</em> 615 S.W.2d 810 (1981).  The court stated that, prior to the 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701, a different statute, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5219, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 548, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] had authorized state taxation of shares of national </p><p><a class="page-number" name="861">Page 463 U. S. 861</a></p><p> banks without reduction in value for obligations of the United States held by the banks.  615 S.W.2d at 817-820.  The court concluded that the 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701 had not withdrawn this authorization.  615 S.W.2d at 819-820.  The court reasoned that, if the 1959 amendment had withdrawn the authorization granted by \xc2\xa7 5219, in effect it would have repealed a portion of that statute, and that repeals by implication are not favored.  615 S.W.2d at 820-822. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Similar judgments were entered in companion cases.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a, 41a.  The Court of Civil Appeals denied motions for rehearing, 615 S.W.2d at 823-826; App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, 42a.  The Supreme Court of Texas denied applications for writs of error.  <em>Id.</em> at 4a, 39a, 43a.</p>\n<p>Because the decisions of the Court of Civil Appeals appeared to be inconsistent with decisions of the Supreme Court of Montana, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and because of the importance of the issue, we granted certiorari.  459 U.S. 966 (1982). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="862">Page 463 U.

Just as state tax laws relating to corporate or bank shares generally assess the shares according to the value of the corporation\'s assets, <em>see Society for Savings v. Bowers,</em> 349 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/143/case.html#148">349 U.

By expressly exempting franchise and estate and inheritance taxes from the amended \xc2\xa7 3701, Congress manifested its awareness that the new language would broaden significantly the prohibition as it had been construed by the courts.  Congress must have believed that franchise and estate and inheritance taxes required federal obligations to "be considered, directly or indirectly, in the computation of the tax"; otherwise, the specific exemptions for these taxes would have been superfluous.  There is no reason to conclude that shares taxes are any different.</p>\n<p>The language of \xc2\xa7 3701 encompasses "every form of taxation," and is inconsistent with implied exceptions.  <em>Cf. Lewis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html">445 U.

From the specific exceptions for franchise and estate and inheritance taxes, and the conspicuous omission of shares taxes from that group, only one inference is possible:  Congress meant to bar shares taxes to the extent they consider federal obligations in the computation of the tax.  <em>Cf.

Brief for Respondents Dallas County <em>et al.</em> 1011.  In the present litigation, however, the assessors did use the equity capital formula, which is the usual method for assessing the value of bank shares, <em>see Society for Savings v. Bowers,</em> 349 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/143/case.html#148">349 U. S. 148</a></span>, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and is "the usual and customary method used in Texas to arrive at such value."  <em>City of Midland v. Midland National Bank,</em> 607 S.W.2d 303, 304 (1980).  Respondents have not cited a single instance where a different formula was employed.  Section 3701 prohibits any form of tax that would require consideration of federal obligations in computing the tax; it cannot matter whether such consideration is mandated by the tax assessor in practice or by the state statute in so many words. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The taxes at issue therefore violated the plain language of \xc2\xa7 3701.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history of the 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701, while not extensive, supports this construction of the amendment\'s effect.  The catalyst for the amendment was an Idaho tax "upon every individual . . . which shall be according to and measured by his net income."  <em>See</em> Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 63-3011 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="866">Page 463 U. S. 866</a></p><p> (1948).  Despite this Court\'s holding that \xc2\xa7 3701 precluded direct state taxation of the interest on federal obligations, as well as taxation of the underlying obligations, <em>see New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals,</em> 338 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/665/case.html#675">338 U. S. 675</a></span>-676, Idaho\'s position was that its tax need not exempt the interest received on federal obligations, because it was imposed on the individual and was merely measured by his net income, rather than being imposed on the income itself.  <em>See</em> Hearings on Public Debt Ceiling and Interest Rate Ceiling on Bonds before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 69-70 (1959) (supplemental statement of Secretary of the Treasury Anderson) (Hearings).  In presenting the 1959 amendment to Congress, the Secretary described Idaho\'s position as "rest[ing] upon a distinction of words which is without substance."  <em>Id.</em> at 71.  Similar accusations had been leveled at this Court\'s analogous distinctions between shares taxes and franchise taxes on the one hand, and taxes on corporate assets on the other. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Respondents suggest, however, that the 1959 amendment was intended only to make clear that income taxes like Idaho\'s, on interest from federal obligations, were unlawful.  Congress, according to respondents, did not mean to set aside this Court\'s well-established distinction between taxes on assets and taxes on shares.  We, however, have found no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="867">Page 463 U. S. 867</a></p><p> evidence whatsoever in the legislative history to suggest that Congress considered shares taxes to fall outside the scope of the prohibition.  The fact that the 1959 legislative history refers to the Idaho tax, but not specifically to bank shares taxes, does not raise a "negative inference" limiting the amendment to this specific problem.  <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/case.html">462 U. S. 669</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/case.html#679">462 U. S. 679</a></span> (1983).  The amendment plainly did more than make clear that the interest on federal obligations was tax exempt.  Idaho relied on the formal distinction between a tax on an individual, measured by his net income, and a tax on the income itself.  <em>See</em> Hearings at 70.  To answer this argument, the amendment abolished the formalistic inquiry whether the tax is <em>on</em> a distinct interest, and replaced it with the inquiry whether "computation of the tax" requires consideration of federal obligations.</p>\n<p>Nor can the 1959 amendment be read to apply only to income taxes; it reaches "<em>every</em> form of tax . . ." (emphasis supplied).  Indeed, Congress felt compelled to exempt estate and inheritance and franchise taxes from the scope of its amendment precisely because the amendment was <em>not</em> limited to income taxes.  Congress understood the amendment\'s effect; both the Senate and House Reports explained that the amendment</p>\n<p>"makes it clear that both the principal and interest on U.S. obligations are exempt from <em>all State taxes</em> except nondiscriminatory franchise, etc., taxes."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)   Senate Report at 2; House Report at 2.  Congress intended to sweep away formal distinctions and to invalidate all taxes measured directly or indirectly by the value of federal obligations, except those specified in the amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In an effort to avoid this result and to resurrect the formalistic approach, respondents embark on a tour of the history of an entirely different statute, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5219, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 548.  Section 5219, they argue, authorizes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="868">Page 463 U. S. 868</a></p><p> States to tax the full value of bank shares, and the 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701 did not repeal that authorization by implication.  Even if the 1959 Congress abolished the distinction between taxes on and taxes measured by the value of federal obligations, respondents conclude, the Texas tax is valid.</p>\n<p>It is true, of course, that "repeals by implication are not favored."  <em>Posadas v. National City Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/497/case.html">296 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/497/case.html#503">296 U. S. 503</a></span> (1936).  This doctrine flows from the basic principle that</p>\n<p>"courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective."</p>\n<p><em>Morton v. Mancari,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/535/case.html">417 U. S. 535</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/535/case.html#551">417 U. S. 551</a></span> (1974).  But, at the time the taxes at issue were assessed, \xc2\xa7 5219 was clearly capable of coexistence with the plain language of \xc2\xa7 3701 as amended in 1959, and there is no justification for construing \xc2\xa7 5219 to create an inconsistency.</p>\n<p>When the taxes challenged here were assessed, and now, \xc2\xa7 5219 provided only that States could not impose discriminatory taxes on national banks:</p>\n<p>"For the purposes of any tax law enacted under authority of the United States or any State, a national bank shall be treated as a bank organized and existing under the laws of the State or other jurisdiction within which its principal office is located."</p>\n<p>Section 3701\'s requirement that shares taxes on all corporations not consider federal obligations in their computation easily coexists with \xc2\xa7 5219\'s simple ban on discriminatory taxation of national banks.  Giving each statute its common sense meaning, the proper result in these cases could not be more clear.</p>\n<p>Respondents, though, find an unexpressed exception for bank shares taxes in the plain language of \xc2\xa7 3701 by reading into the plain language of \xc2\xa7 5219 an unexpressed congressional authorization to tax bank shares at their full value.  Respondents argue that this silent authorization may be found in \xc2\xa7 5219 by looking to the pre-1969 language of that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="869">Page 463 U. S. 869</a></p><p> section.  Even assuming that such an adventure in statutory revision would be an appropriate exercise of judicial power, respondents\' argument is based on an unnecessary construction of this earlier version of \xc2\xa7 5219.</p>\n<p>From 1926 until 1969, \xc2\xa7 5219 provided that the States could tax national banks in only four ways:  (1) by taxing bank shares, (2) by including bank share dividends in the taxable income of a shareholder, (3) by taxing national banks on their net income, or (4) by levying a franchise tax on national banks "according to or measured by their net income."  Act of Mar. 25, 1926, ch. 88, 44 Stat. 223; <em>see</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em>  Respondents argue that this statute not only permitted these forms of taxation of national banks, but that, in so doing, it also implicitly authorized the taxation of any federal obligations held by national banks, notwithstanding independent limitations placed on taxation of federal obligations. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Although respondents\' reading might be a plausible construction of the prior version of \xc2\xa7 5219, the prior version need not be so construed.  That version did not mention federal obligations; \xc2\xa7 5219 was, and still is, addressed to the concern first considered in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), where this Court declared that any tax on the operation of a national bank unconstitutionally burdened this instrumentality of the Federal Government.  The original predecessor of \xc2\xa7 5219, \xc2\xa7 41 of the 1864 National Bank Act, 13 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="870">Page 463 U. S. 870</a></p><p> Stat. 111, permitted state taxation of national banks only on their real estate and shares; such taxes, <em>McCulloch indicated,</em> did not violate the Constitution\'s protection of national banks.  4 Wheat. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#436">17 U. S. 436</a></span>-437.  But whether a tax imposes an intolerable burden on national banks, and whether it imposes an intolerable burden on federal obligations by threatening to diminish their value, are questions that are historically and analytically distinct.  Section 3701 responds to the latter concern, first addressed in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v. City Council of Charleston,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 449 (1829).  Congress might well conclude that a tax not imposing an undue burden on national banks does unduly burden federal obligations, and \xc2\xa7 5219 and \xc2\xa7 3701 have always been directed to, and have protected, these separate federal interests.</p>\n<p>A state tax affecting national banks holding federal obligations implicates both federal concerns, and therefore confronts both federal barriers to state taxation.  Under the statutory scheme in effect in 1959, the year \xc2\xa7 3701 was amended, a tax not satisfying the requirements of \xc2\xa7 5219 was invalid whether or not it also satisfied the requirements of \xc2\xa7 3701.  <em>Compare Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/173/664/case.html">173 U. S. 664</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/173/664/case.html#676">173 U. S. 676</a></span>, 682-683 (1899) (franchise taxation of national bank violated predecessor to \xc2\xa7 5219 prior to 1926 amendment of that statute, which permitted for the first time franchise taxes on national banks), <em>with Provident Institution v.

S. 630</a></span>-632 (franchise tax on state corporation not unlawful burden on federal obligations).  Similarly, there was no reason to believe that a tax that violated \xc2\xa7 3701 could be imposed on a bank merely because it did not also violate \xc2\xa7 5219.  Indeed, while \xc2\xa7 5219 explicitly had permitted the levying of an income tax on national banks since 1923, <em>see</em> Act of Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 267, 42 Stat. 1499, it was never contended that this permitted the inclusion of interest from federal obligations in the national banks\' taxable income. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="871">Page 463 U. S. 871</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although it might be inferred from dicta in certain cases that the prior version of \xc2\xa7 5219 implicitly authorized a State\'s refusal to deduct the value of federal obligations from the assessed value of national bank shares, <em>see, e.g., Cleveland Trust Co. v. Lander,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/111/case.html">184 U. S. 111</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/115/case.html">184 U.

S. 584</a></span>-588 (1866), this implication has not been necessary for any of the Court\'s decisions in this area.  In the context of bank shares taxes, until the 1959 amendment of \xc2\xa7 3701, the prohibitions of \xc2\xa7 3701 and \xc2\xa7 5219 were coextensive.  Because they were permitted expressly by \xc2\xa7 5219, such taxes did not violate the proscription of taxes on national banks.  And regardless of the manner in which a shares tax was computed, it did not violate \xc2\xa7 3701, because it was assessed on an interest separate from the federal obligations held by the bank.  <em>See, e.g., Society for Savings v. Bowers,</em> 349 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/143/case.html#147">349 U. S. 147</a></span>.  There was therefore no cause to consider whether \xc2\xa7 5219 implicitly granted powers to burden federal obligations held by national banks that otherwise would have been denied by \xc2\xa7 3701. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="872">Page 463 U. S. 872</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The prior version of \xc2\xa7 5219 thus need not be read as giving implied consent to taxation of federal obligations; on its face, it was addressed only to the separate interdiction on taxation of national banks, and it never was necessary to decide whether implicitly it reached further.  The plain language of \xc2\xa7 3701, as amended in 1959, therefore need not be seen as an "implied repeal" of the pre-1969 version of \xc2\xa7 5219.  The 1959 amendment of \xc2\xa7 3701 left \xc2\xa7 5219 entirely intact.  All taxes on national banks except those enumerated in \xc2\xa7 5219 still were unlawful.  A shares tax on a national bank still was lawful.  The 1959 amendment simply limited the ability of States to consider federal obligations when levying any form of tax, taxes on national banks included.  States still could reach the value of federal obligations by imposing the other effective form of taxation permitted by \xc2\xa7 5219, a franchise tax, which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="873">Page 463 U. S. 873</a></p><p> was expressly excepted from the prohibition contained in the amended language of \xc2\xa7 3701.</p>\n<p>The doctrine disfavoring implied repeals thus is irrelevant for these cases.  It does not justify the use of an unnecessary construction of the language of an ambiguous statute that no longer is on the books to defeat the plain language of an effective statute.  This is particularly true when, as here, the "impairment" of the prior statute is minimal even if the prior statute is construed so as to maximize its conflict with the later one.  <em>See Andrus v. Glover Construction Co.,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/608/case.html#618">446 U. S. 618</a></span>-619.  Given its current language, which does not mention or even arguably authorize any form of tax, it would be singularly inappropriate for this Court to hold for the first time that \xc2\xa7 5219 authorizes the imposition of taxes that otherwise would violate \xc2\xa7 3701. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Nothing in the legislative history of the 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701 contradicts its plain language.  Nor is the plain language of the amendment inconsistent with any other federal statute.  In these circumstances, the plain language of \xc2\xa7 3701 is controlling.  The judgments of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals are therefore reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section \xc2\xa7 3701, as so amended, 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742, read:</p>\n<p>"[A]ll stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal or local authority.

Midland National Bank,</em> 607 S.W.2d 303, 304 (1980).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The unenacted 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742, which codified Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3701, included the introductory phrase "Except as otherwise provided by law. . . ."  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3701 itself did not include that phrase, however, and the Statutes at Large prevail over the Code whenever the two are inconsistent.  <em>Stephan v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/423/case.html">319 U.

In fact, Congress was aware that Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3701 did not contain this phrase.  Both the House and Senate Reports, although mentioning the phrase at one point, <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 909, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1959) (Senate Report); H.R.Rep. No. 1148, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1959) (House Report), properly set forth the statute without the introductory clause.  Senate Report at 22; House Report at 26.  Moreover, the Reports summarized the amendment as making clear that, with specified exceptions, "both the principal and interest on U.S. obligations are exempt from all State taxes except . . . "  Senate Report at 2; House Report at 2.  There was no suggestion that some category of state taxes apart from those specifically preserved was to be impliedly excepted.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>At the time the contested taxes were levied, at least six States other than Texas imposed a bank shares tax.  Of the six statutes, five explicitly required that the share\'s value be determined according to the value of the bank\'s assets.  <em>See</em> Ga.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 48-6-90 (1982); La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 47:8 (West 1970) and \xc2\xa7 47:1967(C) (West Cum.

One of the statutes, like Texas\', did not specify the method by which the assessment was to be made.  <em>See</em> W.Va.Code \xc2\xa7 11-3-14 (1974).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we need not decide whether Texas, by the use of some other method of assessing the shares, could avoid the plain prohibition of the statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/573/case.html">70 U.

The drafters probably inserted the language as a cross-reference to the Act of Aug. 13, 1894, ch. 281, 28 Stat. 278, which had legislatively overruled <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/26/case.html">Bank v.

We simply observe that, like the former  6219 itself, these cases were ambiguous about the relationship of \xc2\xa7 5219 to taxation of federal obligations and \xc2\xa7 3701, and that their results in no way turned on an exception to \xc2\xa7 3701 created by \xc2\xa7 6219.  In <em>Van Allen v. Assessors,</em> for example, the Court did not state unambiguously, as the dissent implies, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#875">463 U. S. 875</a></span>, that \xc2\xa7 5219 independently recognized the State\'s power to tax federal obligations "irrespective of \xc2\xa7 3701," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#876">463 U.

S. 586</a></span>.  The <em>Van Allen</em> Court held that a bank shares tax did not illegally tax the United States obligations that constituted the capital of the bank, because the shares were "a distinct independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property that may belong to him."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/573/case.html#584">70 U. S. 584</a></span>.  Similarly, in <em>Cleveland Trust Co. v. Lander,</em> the Court recognized that it was well established that Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3701 did not bar a tax on the separate individuality of shareholders.  184 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/115/case.html#116">184 U.

The <em>Fairweather</em> Court\'s reference to <em>Van Allen\'s</em> ruling as "settled law," 263 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/103/case.html#114">263 U.

S. 113</a></span>-115.  Any oblique suggestions in these cases that \xc2\xa7 5219 independently defined the States\' authority to reach the value of federal obligations held by national banks were wholly superfluous.</p>\n<p>Finally, the "firmly embedded" exception to the general rule of immunity of federal obligations from state taxation noted in <em>Society for Savings v. Bowers,</em> 349 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/143/case.html#148">349 U.

Section 5219 was not mentioned in <em>Bowers.</em>  The <em>Bowers</em> Court referred to an immunity entirely internal to \xc2\xa7 3701, one based on</p>\n<p>"the theory that . . . a tax on the stockholders\' interests is not a tax on the federal obligations which are included in the corporate property."</p>\n<p>349 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/143/case.html#147">349 U. S. 147</a></span>.  The 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701 certainly abolished the relevance of this formalistic theory.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Court of Civil Appeals\' approach would ascribe to Congress the implausible intention to outlaw consideration of federal obligations in computing all taxes on shareholders, except taxes on shareholders of banks.  As discussed above, state taxation of national banks historically has been thought to pose a threat to a federal interest independent of the threat posed by state taxation of federal obligations.  Policy and logic suggest that Congress could not have meant to single out national banks for disfavored treatment.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the plain language of the tax exemption for federal obligations, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3701, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="874">Page 463 U. S. 874</a></p><p> amended, 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742, seems quite broad.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#862">463 U.

If this general provision is viewed in isolation, then the Court\'s argument is persuasive that it proscribes the Texas property tax on bank shares at issue in these cases because that tax is computed without any reduction for federal obligations held by state and national banks.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#862">463 U. S. 862</a></span>-865.  I do not believe, however, that we can take such a detached look at \xc2\xa7 3701 when this Court has, for over 100 years, consistently said that a different statute, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5219, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 548, specifically controls the question presented here.  Since today the Court disregards these precedents, I dissent.</p>\n<p>An entire chapter of American legal history is occupied by efforts to establish different versions of what may be loosely referred to as "national banks."  This chapter is of course reflected in the decisions of this Court, where, in a series of early cases, the Court consistently determined that it was Congress\' intention to protect the National Bank from taxation by the States.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v.

Somewhat later, the Court decided that States could not tax United States securities when those securities were owned by state banks.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/67/620/case.html">New York ex rel.

S. 578</a></span>."</p>\n<p>While the Court did not address this argument in so many words, it implicitly rejected the contention by turning instead to the forerunner of \xc2\xa7 5219, a more specific statute which provided that nothing in the National Bank Act</p>\n<p>"shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person or body corporate, from being included in the valuation of the personal property of such person or corporation in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under State authority. . . ."</p>\n<p>Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, \xc2\xa7 41, 13 Stat. 112.

S. 359</a></span> (1869).</p>\n<p>In 1878, Congress revised the statutes and enacted \xc2\xa7 3701 and \xc2\xa7 5219.  Section 5219 was virtually identical to its immediate predecessor.  The language of the exemption in \xc2\xa7 3701 was somewhat changed to provide:</p>\n<p>"All stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal or local authority."</p>\n<p>In <em>Cleveland Trust Co. v. Lander,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/111/case.html">184 U. S. 111</a></span> (1902), an Ohio trust company, relying on \xc2\xa7 3701, made an argument similar to the one made in <em>Van Allen.</em>  The Court reaffirmed its <em>Van Allen</em> decision, and this time expressly rejected the \xc2\xa7 3701 claim of exemption.  The Court explained:</p>\n<p>"The argument of the plaintiff in error claims a greater immunity from taxation for the shares of the Trust Company than section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States gives to shares in national banks.  That </p><p><a class="page-number" name="876">Page 463 U. S. 876</a></p><p> section permits the States to assess and tax the shares of shareholders in national banks. . . .  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/70/573/case.html">Van Allen v. The Assessors,</a></span></em> 3 Wall. 573, the provision contained in section 5219 -- then a part of the act of Congress of June 3, 1864 -- came up for consideration. . . .  The validity of the statute was sustained, and, interpreting it, the court said that it authorized the taxation of such shares, and shares were defined to be the whole interest of the holder without diminution on account of the kind of property which constituted the capital stock of the bank.  Of the provisions of the act expressing this purpose and the right of the State to tax, the court said nothing \'could be made plainer or more direct and comprehensive.\' . . .  The answer to the contention [that \xc2\xa7 3701 requires a different result] is obvious, and may be brief.  The contention destroys the separate individuality recognized, as we have seen, by this court, of the trust company and its shareholders, and seeks to nullify one provision of the Revised Statutes of the United States (section 5219) by another (section 3701), between which there is no want of harmony."</p>\n<p>184 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/111/case.html#113">184 U. S. 113</a></span>-115.</p>\n<p>Thus, after <em>Van Allen</em> and <em>Cleveland Trust Co.,</em> it was clear that, irrespective of \xc2\xa7 3701, \xc2\xa7 5219 authorized States to tax bank shares without excluding the value of the bank\'s capital vested in federal obligations.  By 1923, the Court said that this principle "is now settled law in this court."  <em>Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/103/case.html">263 U.

But the <em>Van Allen</em> decision rested exclusively on \xc2\xa7 5219, and permits a tax on bank shares regardless of \xc2\xa7 3701 unless there is some indication that, with the 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701, Congress intended to repeal part of \xc2\xa7 5219.  Sensible meaning can be given to the amended \xc2\xa7 3701 without finding a repeal by implication, and there is nothing in the language or history of the amendment to indicate a repeal by implication.  In fact, the history of the amendment indicates that Congress did not intend to change the exemption; Congress amended \xc2\xa7 3701 to make clear that an Idaho tax on interest earned on federal obligations ran afoul of the exemption.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

The latter section now provides:</p>\n<p>"For the purposes of any tax law enacted under authority of the United States or any State, a national bank shall be treated as a bank organized and existing under the laws of the State or other jurisdiction within which its principal office is located."</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court\'s suggestion otherwise, the legislative history of the 1969 amendment indicates that the new provision in \xc2\xa7 5219 was intended to extend the power of States to tax national banks; not to limit their power to tax bank shares.  <em>See</em> 115 Cong.Rec. 38634 (1969) (remarks of Sen. Tower); <em>id.</em> at 35399 (remarks of Sen. Proxmire).  As the Senate Report clearly provided, the "broad statement of the law" now found in \xc2\xa7 5219 is intended to express Congress\' conclusion that</p>\n<p>"there is no longer any justification for Congress\' continuing to grant national banks immunities from State taxation which are not afforded State banks."</p>\n<p>S.Rep.

S. 178</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/178/case.html#194">260 U. S. 194</a></span> (1922):</p>\n<p>"We are asked to conclude that Congress, without the consideration or recommendation of any committee, without a suggestion as to the effect, or a word of debate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="879">Page 463 U. S. 879</a></p><p> as to the desirability, of so fundamental a change, . . . has radically modified a statute always theretofore maintained and considered as of great importance.  It is inconceivable that a rule . . . a part of our history as well as our law, welded into the structure of our national policy by a century of legislative and administrative acts and judicial decisions, would have been deprived of its force in such dubious and casual fashion."</p>\n<p>Since the Court can point to nothing in the amendment to \xc2\xa7 5219 which indicates that Congress intended to change the <em>Van Allen</em> rule, and since there is no basis for finding that Congress repealed the rule by implication when it amended \xc2\xa7 3701, I would affirm the decision of the Texas Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>* The Court attempts to avoid this line of cases by suggesting that almost everything said in several of these decisions was either "dicta," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#871">463 U. S. 871</a></span>, or "ambiguous," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#871">463 U. S. 871</a></span>, n. 14.  Neither characterization can be plausibly made concerning the holding in <em>Cleveland Trust Co. v. Lander,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/111/case.html">184 U. S. 111</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/115/case.html">184 U. S. 115</a></span> (1902), where the Court rejected the argument accepted by the Court today by saying that</p>\n<p>"the trust company . . . seeks to nullify one provision of the Revised Statutes of the United States (section 5219) by another (section 3701), between which there is no want of harmony."</p>\n<p>Likewise, as noted above, while <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/573/case.html">Van Allen v. Assessors,</a></span></em> 3 Wall. 573 (1866), did not expressly reject this argument, reliance on the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 3701 was argued, and the Court necessarily rejected it by basing its holding on \xc2\xa7 5219.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the Court\'s suggestion that the <em>Van Allen</em> and <em>Cleveland Trust Co.</em> decisions were not approved in later cases such as <em>Society for Savings v. Bowers.</em>  Certainly, by the time <em>Society for Savings</em> was decided, the <em>Van Allen</em> doctrine had been carried beyond \xc2\xa7 5219 to shares taxes on corporations other than banks.  349 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/143/case.html#147">349 U. S. 147</a></span>-148.  The Court concludes that "[t]he 1959 amendment to \xc2\xa7 3701 certainly abolished the relevance of this formalistic theory" with regard to nonbank corporations.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/855/case.html#872">463 U. S. 872</a></span>, n. 14.  To the contrary, in light of the legislative history discussed in the text concerning the 1959 amendment, it is, at a minimum, debatable whether a shares tax without a reduction for federal obligations on any corporation is prohibited by \xc2\xa7 3701.  But that is another case; these cases present essentially the same issue presented in <em>Van Allen</em> and <em>Cleveland Trust Co.,</em> and, like those decisions, we need go no further than \xc2\xa7 5219 to decide it.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
