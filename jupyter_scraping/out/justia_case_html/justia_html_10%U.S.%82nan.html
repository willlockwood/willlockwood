Provided and it is to be understood that in case the said Lewis, on application by the said Whetcroft to him, in the Town of Fredericksburg, on or after the said first day of January, shall pay unto the said William, or his attorney, the sum of three thousand pounds in officers\' certificates issued under an act of assembly passed November, 1781, for pay or arrearages of pay and depreciation, or shall well and truly pay the interest of six percentum from the date hereof, on the said certificates if not paid, and shall moreover annually and punctually pay the said six percent when applied to as before mentioned, in doing of which the condition of this bond is dischargeable by payment of the said three thousand pounds officers\' certificates; otherwise the bond shall have its full force and effect."</p>\n<p>This bond was assigned to the defendant on 3 August, 1790, and an action at law was brought on it in the name of the assignee in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Virginia, when judgment was rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p>On this judgment a writ of error has been sued out, and the plaintiff alleges that the same should be reversed because the bond on which this action is brought is not assignable under the laws of Virginia so as to enable the assignee to prosecute at law in his own name.  Other causes of error have been assigned, but the opinion of the Court being with the plaintiff on the first point, it will not be necessary to take any notice of the objections which have been made to the pleadings, or to the imperfect finding of the jury. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 10 U. S. 85</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A bond not being assignable at common law, the present question must turn altogether on the statutes of Virginia.  It seems to have been for a long time doubted, after passing the act of 1748, c. 27, whether any but bonds conditioned to pay money or tobacco were assignable.  That question was, however, at last settled by the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Henderson v. Hepburn,</em> in which it was decided that a bond with a collateral condition was not, within the meaning of this act, assignable.  With this decision the Court not only feels no inclination to interfere, but thinks it a fair and just exposition of the acts which had then been passed on this subject.  The bonds intended by the legislature were most clearly such as were to become void on the payment of a sum certain and where no intervention or assessment of a jury was necessary.  Bonds which require particular breaches to be assigned, damages on which were to be estimated or liquidated by a jury, do not appear to have been contemplated.</p>\n<p>It being then settled that bonds with collateral conditions were not assignable under the laws in force at the time of the making of this assignment, it only remains to ascertain the true character of the condition of the bond on which this action is brought.</p>\n<p>Although by payment of \xef\xbf\xbd3,000 on or before a certain day, the obligor might have discharged himself from the penalty, it was part of the condition that on the application of the obligee by a certain day, a payment in certain certificates, which were not money, might be substituted.  This created an alternative by which the penalty might be discharged either by money or officers\' certificates, and although the consent of both parties might be necessary to a payment in the latter way, still, as it made part of the written contract, the Court cannot but perceive that on a certain contingency, it was to be considered as a bond on which it might, as it did, become necessary to assign breaches and call in a jury to assess damages.  If we look at the record, we shall find the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 10 U. S. 86</a></p><p> parties, their counsel, and the jury treating it as a bond of this description.</p>\n<p>It is the opinion, therefore, of the Court that this bond was not assignable under the laws of Virginia, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court for the District of Virginia must be</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and judgment on the verdict be arrested.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
