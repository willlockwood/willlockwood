McCoy pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, insisting that he was out of State at the time of the killings and that corrupt police killed the victims when a drug deal went wrong.  Although he vociferously insisted on his innocence and adamantly objected to any admission of guilt, the trial court permitted his counsel, Larry English, to tell the jury, during the trial\xe2\x80\x99s guilt phase, McCoy \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted [the] three murders.\xe2\x80\x9d  English\xe2\x80\x99s strategy was to concede that McCoy committed the murders, but argue that McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s mental state prevented him from forming the specific intent necessary for a first-degree murder conviction.  Over McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s repeated objection, English told the jury McCoy was the killer and that English \xe2\x80\x9ctook [the] burden off of [the prosecutor]\xe2\x80\x9d on that issue.  McCoy testified in his own defense, maintaining his innocence and pressing an alibi difficult to fathom.  The jury found him guilty of all three first-degree murder counts.  At the penalty phase, English again conceded McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, but urged mercy in view of McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s mental and emotional issues.  The jury returned three death verdicts.  Represented by new counsel, McCoy unsuccessfully sought a new  trial.  The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s  ruling that English had authority to concede guilt, despite McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s opposition.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The\n \nSixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to choose the objective of his defense and to insist that his counsel refrain from admitting guilt, even when counsel\xe2\x80\x99s experienced-based view is that confessing guilt offers the defendant the best chance to avoid the death penalty.

The lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s province is trial management, but some decisions are reserved for the client\xe2\x80\x94including whether to plead guilty, waive the right to a jury trial, testify in one\xe2\x80\x99s own behalf, and forgo an appeal.  Autonomy to decide that the objective of the defense is to assert innocence belongs in this reserved-for-the-client category.  Refusing to plead guilty in the face of overwhelming evidence against her, rejecting the assistance of counsel, and insisting on maintaining her innocence at the guilt phase of a capital trial are not strategic choices; they are decisions about what the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objectives in fact <i>are</i>.  See <i>Weaver </i>v.<i> Massachusetts</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Counsel may reasonably assess a concession of guilt as best suited to avoiding the death penalty, as English did here.  But the client may not share that objective.  He may wish to avoid, above all else, the opprobrium attending admission that he killed family members, or he may hold life in prison not worth living and prefer to risk death for any hope, however small, of exoneration.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Thus, when a client makes it plain that the objective of \xe2\x80\x9chis defence\xe2\x80\x9d is to maintain innocence of the charged criminal acts and pursue an acquittal, his lawyer must abide by that objective and may not override it by conceding guilt.

Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s attorney did not negate Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy by overriding Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s desired defense objective, for Nixon \xe2\x80\x9cwas generally unresponsive\xe2\x80\x9d during discussions of trial strategy and \xe2\x80\x9cnever verbally approved or protested\xe2\x80\x9d counsel\xe2\x80\x99s proposed approach.  <i>Id.,</i> at 181.  He complained about counsel\xe2\x80\x99s admission of his guilt only after trial.  <i>Id.</i>, at 185.  McCoy, in contrast, opposed English\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of his guilt at every opportunity, before and during trial, both in conference with his lawyer and in open court.  Citing <i>Nix</i> v. <i>Whiteside</i>,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157, the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that English\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to maintain McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s innocence was necessitated by a Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct that prohibits counsel from suborning perjury.  But in <i>Nix</i>, the defendant told his lawyer that he intended to commit perjury.  Here, there was no avowed perjury.  English harbored no doubt that McCoy believed what he was saying; English simply disbelieved that account in view of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s ethical rules might have stopped English from presenting McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s alibi evidence if English knew perjury was involved, but Louisiana has identified no ethical rule requiring English to admit McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s guilt over McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel jurisprudence, see <i>Strickland </i>v.<i> Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668, does not apply here, where the client\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy, not counsel\xe2\x80\x99s competence, is in issue.  To gain redress for attorney error, a defendant ordinarily must show prejudice.  See <i>id.,</i> at 692.  But here, the violation of McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s protected autonomy right was complete when the court allowed counsel to usurp control of an issue within McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s sole prerogative.  Violation of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nSixth Amendment-secured autonomy has been ranked \xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d error; when present, such an error is not subject to harmless-error review.  See,<i> e.g., McKaskle</i> v. <i>Wiggins</i>,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 168, 177, n.\xc2\xa08; <i>United States </i>v.<i> Gonzalez-Lopez</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140; <i>Waller </i>v.<i> Georgia</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 39<i>.  </i>An error is structural if it is not designed to protect defendants from erroneous conviction, but instead protects some other interest, such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental legal principle that a defendant must be allowed to make his own choices about the proper way to protect his own liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Weaver</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S., at __ (citing <i>Faretta</i>, 422 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 834).  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s admission of a client\xe2\x80\x99s guilt over the client\xe2\x80\x99s express objection is error structural in kind, for it blocks the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to make a fundamental choice about his own defense.

The three victims were the mother, stepfather, and son of Robert McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s estranged wife, Yolanda.  Several days later, police arrested McCoy in Idaho.  Extradited to Louisiana, McCoy was appointed counsel from the public defender\xe2\x80\x99s office.  A Bossier Parish grand jury indicted McCoy on three counts of first-degree murder, and the prosecutor gave notice of intent to seek the death penalty.  McCoy pleaded not guilty.  Throughout the proceedings, he insistently maintained he was out of State at the time of the killings and that corrupt police killed the victims when a drug deal went wrong.  App. 284\xe2\x80\x93286.  At defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s request, a court-appointed sanity commission examined McCoy and found him competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In December 2009 and January 2010, McCoy told the court his relationship with assigned counsel had broken down irretrievably.  He sought and gained leave to represent himself until his parents engaged new counsel for him.  In March 2010, Larry English, engaged by McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s parents, enrolled as McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.  English eventually concluded that the evidence against McCoy was overwhelming and that, absent a concession at the guilt stage that McCoy was the killer, a death sentence would be impossible to avoid at the penalty phase.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  McCoy, English reported, was \xe2\x80\x9cfurious\xe2\x80\x9d when told, two weeks before trial was scheduled to begin, that English would concede McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s commission of the triple murders.  <i>Id.</i>, at 286.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  McCoy told English \xe2\x80\x9cnot to make that concession,\xe2\x80\x9d and English knew of McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomplet[e] oppos[ition] to [English] telling the jury that [McCoy] was guilty of killing the three victims\xe2\x80\x9d; instead of any concession, McCoy pressed English to pursue acquittal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 286\xe2\x80\x93287.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At a July 26, 2011 hearing, McCoy sought to terminate English\xe2\x80\x99s representation, <i>id.</i>, at 449, and English asked to be relieved if McCoy secured other counsel, <i>id.</i>, at 458.  With trial set to start two days later, the court refused to relieve English and directed that he remain as counsel of record.  <i>Id.</i>, at 461.  \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou are the attorney,\xe2\x80\x9d the court told English when he expressed disagreement with McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s wish to put on a defense case, and \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to make the trial decision of what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to proceed with.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 469.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the beginning of his opening statement at the guilt phase of the trial, English told the jury there was \xe2\x80\x9cno way reasonably possible\xe2\x80\x9d that they could hear the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and reach \xe2\x80\x9cany other conclusion than Robert McCoy was the cause of these individuals\xe2\x80\x99 death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 504.  McCoy protested; out of earshot of the jury, McCoy told the court that English was \xe2\x80\x9cselling [him] out\xe2\x80\x9d by maintaining that McCoy \xe2\x80\x9cmurdered [his] family.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 505\xe2\x80\x93506.

Continuing his opening statement, English told the jury the evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmy client committed three murders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 509.  McCoy testified in his own defense, maintaining his innocence and pressing an alibi difficult to fathom.  In his closing argument, English reiterated that McCoy was the killer.  On that issue, English told the jury that he \xe2\x80\x9ctook [the] burden off of [the prosecutor].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 647.  The jury then returned a unanimous verdict of guilty of first-degree murder on all three counts.  At the penalty phase, English again conceded \xe2\x80\x9cRobert McCoy committed these crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 751, but urged mercy in view of McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cserious mental and emotional issues,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 755.  The jury returned three death verdicts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Represented by new counsel, McCoy unsuccessfully moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by allowing English to concede McCoy \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted three murders,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 509, over McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that defense counsel had authority so to concede guilt, despite the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to any admission of guilt.  See 2014\xe2\x80\x931449 (La. 10/19/16), 218 So. 3d 535.  The concession was permissible, the court concluded, because counsel reasonably believed that admitting guilt afforded McCoy the best chance to avoid a death sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari in view of a division of opinion among state courts of last resort on the question whether it is unconstitutional to allow defense counsel to concede guilt over the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intransigent and unambiguous objection.  582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).

English harbored no doubt that McCoy believed what he was saying, see App. 285\xe2\x80\x93286; English simply disbelieved McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s account in view of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.

In this stark scenario, we agree with the majority of state courts of last resort that counsel may not admit her client\xe2\x80\x99s guilt of a charged crime over the client\xe2\x80\x99s intransigent objection to that admission.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because a client\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy, not counsel\xe2\x80\x99s competence, is in issue, we do not apply our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel jurisprudence, <i>Strickland </i>v.<i> Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984), or <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cronic</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648 (1984), to McCoy\xe2\x80\x99s claim.

The evidence against his client was truly \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Louisiana Supreme Court aptly noted.  2014\xe2\x80\x931449 (La. 10/19/16), 218 So.\xc2\xa03d 535, 565 (2016).  Among other things, the evidence showed the following.  Before the killings took place, petitioner had abused and threatened to kill his wife, and she was therefore under police protection.  On the night of the killings, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mother-in-law made a 911 call and was heard screaming petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first name.

The officers saw a man who fit petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s description fleeing in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s car.  They chased the suspect, but he abandoned the car along with critical evidence linking him to the crime: the cordless phone petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mother-in-law had used to call 911 and a receipt for the type of ammunition used to kill the victims.  Petitioner was eventually arrested while hitchhiking in Idaho, and a loaded gun found in his possession was identified as the one used to shoot the victims.  In addition to all this, a witness testified that petitioner had asked to borrow money to purchase bullets shortly before the shootings, and surveillance footage showed petitioner purchasing the ammunition on the day of the killings.  And two of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s friends testified that he confessed to killing at least one person.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite all this evidence, petitioner, who had been found competent to stand trial and had refused to plead guilty by reason of insanity, insisted that he did not kill the victims.

At that point\xe2\x80\x94aware of English\xe2\x80\x99s strong views\xe2\x80\x94petitioner could have discharged English and sought new counsel willing to pursue his conspiracy defense; under the\n \nSixth Amendment, that was his right.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gonzalez-Lopez</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140, 144 (2006).  But petitioner stated \xe2\x80\x9cseveral different times\xe2\x80\x9d that he was \xe2\x80\x9cconfident with Mr. English.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 411, 437.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The weekend before trial, however, petitioner changed his mind.  He asked the trial court to replace English, and English asked for permission to withdraw.  Petitioner stated that he had secured substitute counsel, but he was unable to provide the name of this new counsel, and no new attorney ever appeared.  The court refused these requests and also denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s last-minute request to represent himself.  (Petitioner does not challenge these decisions here.)  So petitioner and English were stuck with each other, and petitioner availed himself of his right to take the stand to tell his wild story.  Under those circumstances, what was English supposed to do?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Louisiana Supreme Court held that English could not have put on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s desired defense without violating state ethics rules, see 218 So.\xc2\xa03d, at 564\xe2\x80\x93565, but this Court effectively overrules the state court on this issue of state law, <i>ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  However, even if it is assumed that the Court is correct on this ethics issue, the result of mounting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy defense almost certainly would have been disastrous.  That approach stood no chance of winning an acquittal and would have severely damaged English\xe2\x80\x99s credibility in the eyes of the jury, thus undermining his ability to argue effectively against the imposition of a death sentence at the penalty phase of the trial.  As English observed, taking that path would have only \xe2\x80\x9chelp[ed] the District Attorney send [petitioner] to the death chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 396.  (In <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Nixon</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 175, 191\xe2\x80\x93192 (2004), this Court made essentially the same point.)  So, again, what was English supposed to do?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When pressed at oral argument before this Court, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current counsel eventually provided an answer: English was not required to take any affirmative steps to support petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre defense, but instead of conceding that petitioner shot the victims, English should have ignored that element entirely.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  So the fundamental right supposedly violated in this case comes down to the difference between the two statements set out below.</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin"><i>Constitutional</i>: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst-degree murder requires proof both that the accused killed the victim and that he acted with the intent to kill.  I submit to you that my client did not have the intent required for conviction for that offense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd"><i>Unconstitutional</i>: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst-degree murder requires proof both that the accused killed the victim and that he acted with the intent to kill.  I admit that my client shot and killed the victims, but I submit to you that he did not have the intent required for conviction for that offense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The practical difference between these two statements is negligible.  If English had conspicuously refrained from endorsing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s story and had based his defense solely on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s dubious mental condition, the jury would surely have gotten the message that English was essentially conceding that petitioner killed the victims.  But according to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current attorney, the difference is fundamental.  The first formulation, he admits, is perfectly fine.  The latter, on the other hand, is a violation so egregious that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction must be reversed even if there is no chance that the misstep caused any harm.  It is no wonder that the Court declines to embrace this argument and instead turns to an issue that the case at hand does not actually present.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The constitutional right that the Court has now discovered\xe2\x80\x94a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to insist that his attorney contest his guilt with respect to all charged offenses\xe2\x80\x94is like a rare plant that blooms every decade or so.  Having made its first appearance today, the right is unlikely to figure in another case for many years to come.  Why is  this so?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First, it is hard to see how the right could come into play in any case other than a capital case in which the jury must decide both guilt and punishment.  In all other cases, guilt is almost always the only issue for the jury, and therefore admitting guilt of all charged offenses will achieve nothing.  It is hard to imagine a situation in which a competent attorney might take that approach.  So the right that the Court has discovered is effectively confined to capital cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, few rational defendants facing a possible death sentence are likely to insist on contesting guilt where there is no real chance of acquittal and where admitting guilt may improve the chances of avoiding execution.  Indeed, under such circumstances, the odds are that a rational defendant will plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.  By the same token, an attorney is unlikely to insist on admitting guilt over the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objection unless the attorney believes that contesting guilt would be futile.  So the right is most likely to arise in cases involving irrational capital defendants.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, where a capital defendant and his retained attorney cannot agree on a basic trial strategy, the attorney and client will generally part ways unless, as in this case, the court is not apprised until the eve of trial.  The client will then either search for another attorney or decide to represent himself.  So the field of cases in which this right might arise is limited further still\xe2\x80\x94to cases involving irrational capital defendants who disagree with their attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 proposed strategy yet continue to retain them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, if counsel is appointed, and unreasonably insists on admitting guilt over the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, a capable trial judge will almost certainly grant a timely request to appoint substitute counsel.  And if such a request is denied, the ruling may be vulnerable on appeal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, even if all the above conditions are met, the right that the Court now discovers will not come into play unless the defendant expressly protests counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of admitting guilt.  Where the defendant is advised of the strategy and says nothing, or is equivocal, the right is deemed to have been waived.  See <i>Nixon</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 192.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, the right that the Court now discovers is likely to appear only rarely,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] and because the present case is so unique, it is hard to see how it meets our stated criteria for granting review.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rules 10(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  Review would at least be understandable if the strategy that English pursued had worked an injustice, but the Court does not make that claim\xe2\x80\x94and with good reason.  Endorsing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre defense would have been extraordinarily unwise, and dancing the fine line recommended by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current attorney would have done no good.  It would have had no effect on the outcome of the trial, and it is hard to see how that approach would have respected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cautonomy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 6, 7, 8, 11, any more than the more straightforward approach that English took.  If petitioner is retried, it will be interesting to see what petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current counsel or any other attorney to whom the case is handed off will do.  It is a safe bet that no attorney will put on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy defense.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While the question that the Court decides is unlikely to make another appearance for quite some time, a related\xe2\x80\x94and difficult\xe2\x80\x94question may arise more frequently: When guilt is the sole issue for the jury, is it ever permissible for counsel to make the unilateral decision to concede an element of the offense charged?  If today\xe2\x80\x99s decision were understood to address that question, it would have important implications.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under current precedent, there are some decisions on which a criminal defendant has the final say.  For example, a defendant cannot be forced to enter a plea against his wishes.  See <i>Brookhart</i> v. <i>Janis</i>,\n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 5\xe2\x80\x937 (1966).  Similarly, no matter what counsel thinks best, a defendant has the right to insist on a jury trial and to take the stand and testify in his own defense.  See <i>Harris</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222, 225 (1971).  And if, as in this case, a defendant and retained counsel do not see eye to eye, the client can always attempt to find another attorney who will accede to his wishes.  See <i>Gonzalez-Lopez</i>, 548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144.  A defendant can also choose to dispense with counsel entirely and represent himself.  See <i>Faretta</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806, 819 (1975).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While these fundamental decisions must be made by a criminal defendant, most of the decisions that arise in criminal cases are the prerogative of counsel.  (Our adversarial system would break down if defense counsel were required to obtain the client\xe2\x80\x99s approval for every important move made during the course of the case.)  Among the decisions that counsel is free to make unilaterally are the following: choosing the basic line of defense, moving to suppress evidence, delivering an opening statement and deciding what to say in the opening, objecting to the admission of evidence, cross-examining witnesses, offering evidence and calling defense witnesses, and deciding what to say in summation.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>New York</i> v. <i>Hill</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 110, 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (2000).  On which side of the line does conceding some but not all elements of the charged offense fall?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Some criminal offenses contain elements that the prosecution can easily prove beyond any shadow of a doubt.  A prior felony conviction is a good example.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g) (possession of a firearm by a convicted felon).  Suppose that the prosecution is willing to stipulate that the defendant has a prior felony conviction but is prepared, if necessary, to offer certified judgments of conviction for multiple prior violent felonies.  If the defendant insists on contesting the convictions on frivolous grounds, must counsel go along?  Does the same rule apply to all elements?  If there are elements that may not be admitted over the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, must counsel go further and actually contest those elements?  Or is it permissible if counsel refrains from expressly conceding those elements but essentially admits them by walking the fine line recommended at argument by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current attorney?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What about conceding that a defendant is guilty, not of the offense charged, but of a lesser included offense?  That is what English did in this case.  He admitted that petitioner was guilty of the noncapital offense of second-degree murder in an effort to prevent a death sentence.  App. 651.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Is admitting guilt of a lesser included offense over the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objection always unconstitutional?  Where the evidence strongly supports conviction for first-degree murder, is it unconstitutional for defense counsel to make the decision to admit guilt of any lesser included form of homicide\xe2\x80\x94even manslaughter?  What about simple assault?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These are not easy questions, and the fact that they have not come up in this Court for more than two centuries suggests that they will arise infrequently in the future.  I would leave those questions for another day and limit our decision to the particular (and highly unusual) situation in the actual case before us.  And given the situation in which English found himself when trial commenced, I would hold that he did not violate any fundamental right by expressly acknowledging that petitioner killed the victims instead of engaging in the barren exercise that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current counsel now recommends.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having discovered a new right not at issue in the real case before us, the Court compounds its error by summarily concluding that a violation of this right \xe2\x80\x9cranks as error of the kind our decisions have called \xe2\x80\x98structural.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>,  at 11.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court concedes that the Louisiana Supreme Court did not decide the structural-error question and that we \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98did not grant certiorari to review\xe2\x80\x99 that question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa04.
