Today, one of the most important places to exchange views is cyberspace, particularly social media, which offers \xe2\x80\x9crelatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Reno</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 844\n, to users engaged in a wide array of protected\n \nFirst Amendment activity on any number of diverse topics.  The Internet\xe2\x80\x99s forces and directions are so new, so protean, and so far reaching that courts must be conscious that what they say today may be obsolete tomorrow.  Here, in one of the first cases the Court has taken to address the relationship between the\n \nFirst Amendment and the modern Internet, the Court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the\n \nFirst Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium.

Like other inventions heralded as advances in human progress, the Internet and social media will be exploited by the criminal mind.  It is also clear that \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ashcroft </i>v. <i>Free Speech Coalition</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234\n, and that a legislature \xe2\x80\x9cmay pass valid laws to protect children\xe2\x80\x9d and other sexual assault victims, <i>id.,</i> at 245.

First, while the Court need not decide the statute\xe2\x80\x99s precise scope, it is enough to assume that the law applies to commonplace social networking sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  Second, the Court assumes that the\n \nFirst Amendment permits a State to enact specific, narrowly-tailored laws that prohibit a sex offender from engaging in conduct that often presages a sexual crime, like contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Even with these assumptions, the statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of\n \nFirst Amendment speech it burdens.  Social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another on any subject that might come to mind.  With one broad stroke, North Carolina bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.  Foreclosing access to social media altogether thus prevents users from engaging in the legitimate exercise of\n \nFirst Amendment rights.  Even convicted criminals\xe2\x80\x94and in some instances especially convicted criminals\xe2\x80\x94might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, particularly if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The State has not met its burden to show that this sweeping law is necessary or legitimate to serve its purpose of keeping convicted sex offenders away from vulnerable victims.  No case or holding of this Court has approved of a statute as broad in its reach.  The State relies on <i>Burson </i>v. <i>Freeman</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 191\n, but that case considered a more limited restriction\xe2\x80\x94prohibiting campaigning within 100 feet of a polling place\xe2\x80\x94in order to protect the fundamental right to vote.  The Court noted, moreover, that a larger buffer zone could \xe2\x80\x9cbecome an impermissible burden\xe2\x80\x9d under the\n \nFirst Amendment.  <i>Id., </i>at 210.  The better analogy is<i> Board of Airport Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Jews for Jesus, Inc.</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569\n.  If an ordinance prohibiting any \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFirst Amendment activities\xe2\x80\x9d at a single Los Angeles airport could be struck down because it covered all manner of protected, nondisruptive behavior, including \xe2\x80\x9ctalking and reading, or the wearing of campaign buttons or symbolic clothing,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 571, 575, it follows with even greater force that the State may not enact this complete bar to the exercise of\n \nFirst Amendment rights on websites integral to the fabric of modern society and culture.

Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(a), (e) (2015).  A \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial social networking Web site\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as a website that meets four criteria.  First, it \xe2\x80\x9c[i]s operated by a person who derives revenue from membership fees, advertising, or other sources related to the operation of the Web site.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(b).

Brief for Petitioner 6\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 2002, petitioner Lester Gerard Packingham\xe2\x80\x94then a 21-year-old college student\xe2\x80\x94had sex with a 13-year-old girl.  He pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a child.  Because this crime qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9can offense against a minor,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner was required to register as a sex offender\xe2\x80\x94a status that can endure for 30 years or more.  See \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93208.6A; see \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93208.7(a).  As a registered sex offender, petitioner was barred under \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5 from gaining access to commercial social networking sites.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2010, a state court dismissed a traffic ticket against petitioner.  In response, he logged on to Facebook.com and posted the following statement on his personal profile:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cMan God is Good!  How about I got so much favor they dismissed the ticket before court even started?  No fine, no court cost, no nothing spent. . . . . .Praise be to GOD, WOW!  Thanks JESUS!\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 136.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the time, a member of the Durham Police Department was investigating registered sex offenders who were thought to be violating \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5.  The officer noticed that a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98J.\xc2\xa0R. Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d had posted the statement quoted above.  368 N.\xc2\xa0C. 380, 381, 777 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 738, 742 (2015).  By checking court records, the officer discovered that a traffic citation for petitioner had been dismissed around the time of the post.  Evidence obtained by search warrant confirmed the officer\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions that petitioner was J.\xc2\xa0R. Gerrard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner was indicted by a grand jury for violating \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5.  The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the charge against him violated the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Petitioner was ultimately convicted and given a suspended prison sentence.  At no point during trial or sentencing did the State allege that petitioner contacted a minor\xe2\x80\x94or committed any other illicit act\xe2\x80\x94on the Internet.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.  That court struck down \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5 on\n \nFirst Amendment grounds, explaining that the law is not narrowly tailored to serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in protecting minors from sexual abuse.  229 N.\xc2\xa0C. App. 293, 304, 748 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 146, 154 (2013).  Rather, the law \xe2\x80\x9carbitrarily burdens all registered sex offenders by preventing a wide range of communication and expressive activity unrelated to achieving its purported goal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the law is \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional in all respects.\xe2\x80\x9d  368 N.\xc2\xa0C., at 381, 777 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 741.  Among other things, the court explained that the law is \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully tailored .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to prohibit registered sex offenders from accessing only those Web sites that allow them the opportunity to gather information about minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 389, 777 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 747.  The court also held that the law leaves open adequate alternative means of communication because it permits petitioner to gain access to websites that the court believed perform the \xe2\x80\x9csame or similar\xe2\x80\x9d functions as social media, such as the Paula Deen Network and the website for the local NBC affiliate.  <i>Id.</i>, at 390, 777 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 747.  Two justices dissented.  They stated that the law impermissibly \xe2\x80\x9ccreates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth and extends well beyond the evils the State seeks to combat.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 401, 777 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 754 (opinion of Hudson, J.)

The Court has sought to protect the right to speak in this spatial context.  A basic rule, for example, is that a street or a park is a quintessential forum for the exercise of\n \nFirst Amendment rights.  See <i>Ward </i>v. <i>Rock Against Racism</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 781,\n796 (1989)\n.<i> </i>Even in the modern era, these places are still essential venues for public gatherings to celebrate some views, to protest others, or simply to learn and inquire.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear.  It is cyberspace\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cvast democratic forums of the Internet\xe2\x80\x9d in general, <i>Reno</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 844,\n868 (1997)\n, and social media in particular.  Seven in ten American adults use at least one Internet social networking service.  Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 5\xe2\x80\x936.  One of the most popular of these sites is Facebook, the site used by petitioner leading to his conviction in this case.  According to sources cited to the Court in this case, Facebook has 1.79 billion active users.  <i>Id.,</i> at 6.  This is about three times the population of North America.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Social media offers \xe2\x80\x9crelatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reno</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 870.  On Facebook, for example, users can debate religion and politics with their friends and neighbors or share vacation photos.  On LinkedIn, users can look for work, advertise for employees, or review tips on entrepreneurship.  And on Twitter, users can petition their elected representatives and otherwise engage with them in a direct manner.  Indeed, Governors in all 50 States and almost every Member of Congress have set up accounts for this purpose.  See Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation<i> </i>15\xe2\x80\x9316.  In short, social media users employ these websites to engage in a wide array of protected\n \nFirst Amendment activity on topics \xe2\x80\x9cas diverse as human thought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reno</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 870 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The nature of a revolution in thought can be that, in its early stages, even its participants may be unaware of it.  And when awareness comes, they still may be unable to know or foresee where its changes lead.  Cf. D. Hawke, Benjamin Rush: Revolutionary Gadfly 341 (1971) (quoting Rush as observing: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The American war is over; but this is far from being the case with the American revolution.  On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  So too here.  While we now may be coming to the realization that the Cyber Age is a revolution of historic proportions, we cannot appreciate yet its full dimensions and vast potential to alter how we think, express ourselves, and define who we want to be.  The forces and directions of the Internet are so new, so protean, and so far reaching that courts must be conscious that what they say today might be obsolete tomorrow.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case is one of the first this Court has taken to address the relationship between the\n \nFirst Amendment and the modern Internet.  As a result, the Court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the\n \nFirst Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This background informs the analysis of the North Carolina statute at issue.  Even making the assumption that the statute is content neutral and thus subject to intermediate scrutiny, the provision cannot stand.  In order to survive intermediate scrutiny, a law must be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCullen </i>v. <i>Coakley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, the law must not \xe2\x80\x9cburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 19) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For centuries now, inventions heralded as advances in human progress have been exploited by the criminal mind.  New technologies, all too soon, can become instruments used to commit serious crimes.  The railroad is one example, see M. Crichton, The Great Train Robbery, p. xv (1975), and the telephone another, see\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343.  So it will be with the Internet and social media.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is also no doubt that, as this Court has recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ashcroft </i>v. <i>Free Speech Coalition</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234,\n244 (2002)\n.  And it is clear that a legislature \xe2\x80\x9cmay pass valid laws to protect children\xe2\x80\x9d and other victims of sexual assault \xe2\x80\x9cfrom abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at 245; accord, <i>New York </i>v. <i>Ferber</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 747,\n757 (1982)\n.<i> </i>The government, of course, need not simply stand by and allow these evils to occur.  But the assertion of a valid governmental interest \xe2\x80\x9ccannot, in every context, be insulated from all constitutional protections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stanley </i>v. <i>Georgia</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557,\n563 (1969)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is necessary to make two assumptions to resolve this case.  First, given the broad wording of the North Carolina statute at issue, it might well bar access not only to commonplace social media websites but also to websitesas varied as Amazon.com, Washingtonpost.com, and Webmd.com.  See <i>post,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x939; see also Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation 24\xe2\x80\x9327; Brief for Cato Institute et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 10\xe2\x80\x9312, and n.\xc2\xa06.  The Court need not decide the precise scope of the statute.  It is enough to assume that the law applies (as the State concedes it does) to social networking sites \xe2\x80\x9cas commonly understood\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  See Brief for Respondent 54; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, this opinion should not be interpreted as barring a State from enacting more specific laws than the one at issue.  Specific criminal acts are not protected speech even if speech is the means for their commission.  See <i>Brandenburg </i>v. <i>Ohio</i>,\n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 444\n\xe2\x80\x93449 (1969) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  Though the issue is not before the Court, it can be assumed that the\n \nFirst Amendment permits a State to enact specific, narrowly tailored laws that prohibit a sex offender from engaging in conduct that often presages a sexual crime, like contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor.  Cf. Brief for Respondent 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  Specific laws of that type must be the State\xe2\x80\x99s first resort to ward off the serious harm that sexual crimes inflict.  (Of importance, the troubling fact that the law imposes severe restrictions on persons who already have served their sentence and are no longer subject to the supervision of the criminal justice system is also not an issue before the Court.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even with these assumptions about the scope of the law and the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest, the statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of\n \nFirst Amendment speech it burdens.  Social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another about it on any subject that might come to mind.  <i>Supra, </i>at 5.  By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.  These websites can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.  They allow a person with an Internet connection to \xe2\x80\x9cbecome a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reno</i>, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 870.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, to foreclose access to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of\n \nFirst Amendment rights.  It is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have completed their sentences.  Even convicted criminals\xe2\x80\x94and in some instances especially convicted criminals\xe2\x80\x94might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, in particular if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The primary response from the State is that the law must be this broad to serve its preventative purpose of keeping convicted sex offenders away from vulnerable victims.  The State has not, however, met its burden to show that this sweeping law is necessary or legitimate to serve that purpose.  See <i>McCullen</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 28).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is instructive that no case or holding of this Court has approved of a statute as broad in its reach.  The closest analogy that the State has cited is <i>Burson </i>v. <i>Freeman</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 191 (1992)\n.  There, the Court upheld a prohibition on campaigning within 100 feet of a polling place.  That case gives little or no support to the State.  The law in <i>Burson </i>was a limited restriction that, in a context consistent with constitutional tradition, was enacted to protect another fundamental right\xe2\x80\x94the right to vote.  The restrictions there were far less onerous than those the State seeks to impose here.  The law in <i>Burson</i> meant only that the last few seconds before voters entered a polling place were \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own, as free from interference as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 210.  And the Court noted that, were the buffer zone larger than 100 feet, it \xe2\x80\x9ccould effectively become an impermissible burden\xe2\x80\x9d under the\n \nFirst Amendment.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The better analogy to this case is<i> Board of Airport Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Jews for Jesus, Inc.</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569 (1987)\n, where the Court struck down an ordinance prohibiting any \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFirst Amendment activities\xe2\x80\x9d at Los Angeles International Airport because the ordinance covered all manner of protected, nondisruptive behavior including \xe2\x80\x9ctalking and reading, or the wearing of campaign buttons or symbolic clothing,\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>id.,</i> at 571, 575.  If a law prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9call<i> </i>protected expression\xe2\x80\x9d at a single airport is not constitutional, <i>id.</i>, at 574 (emphasis deleted), it follows with even greater force that the State may not enact this complete bar to the exercise of\n \nFirst Amendment rights on websites integral to the fabric of our modern society and culture.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is well established that, as a general rule, the Government \xe2\x80\x9cmay not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ashcroft </i>v. <i>Free Speech Coalition</i>, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255.

It makes it a felony for a registered sex offender simply to visit a vast array of websites, including many that appear to provide no realistic opportunity for communications that could facilitate the abuse of children.

The Court is unable to resist musings that seem to equate the entirety of the internet with public streets and parks.  <i>Ante</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.

Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(a), (e) (2015).  And as I will explain, the statutory definition of a \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial social networking Web site\xe2\x80\x9d is very broad.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Packingham and the State debate the analytical framework that governs this case.  The State argues that the law in question is content neutral and merely regulates a \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d (<i>i.e.</i>, the internet) where convicted sex offenders may wish to engage in speech.  See Brief for Respondent 20\xe2\x80\x9325.  Therefore, according to the State, the standard applicable to \xe2\x80\x9ctime, place, or manner\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions should apply.  See <i>Ward</i> v. <i>Rock Against Racism</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 781,\n791 (1989)\n.  Packingham responds that the challenged statute is \xe2\x80\x9cunlike any law this Court has considered as a time, place, or manner restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 37, and he advocates a more demanding standard of review, <i>id.</i>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Like the Court, I find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute because the law in question cannot satisfy the standard applicable to a content-neutral regulation of the place where speech may occur.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A content-neutral \xe2\x80\x9ctime, place, or manner\xe2\x80\x9d restriction must serve a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d government interest, <i>Ward</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 798, and the North Carolina law easily satisfies this requirement.  As we have frequently noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ferber</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 757.  \xe2\x80\x9cSex offenders are a serious threat,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe victims of sexual assault are most often juveniles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McKune</i> v. <i>Lile</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 24,\n32 (2002)\n (plurality opinion); see <i>Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety</i> v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n4 (2003)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interest [of] safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a compelling one,\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Globe Newspaper Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, County of Norfolk</i>,\n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 596,\n607 (1982)\n, and \xe2\x80\x9cwe have sustained legislation aimed at protecting the physical and emotional well-being of youth even when the laws have operated in the sensitive area of constitutionally protected rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ferber</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 757.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Repeat sex offenders pose an especially grave risk to children.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McKune</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 33 (plurality opinion); see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kebodeaux</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (slip op.,at 8\xe2\x80\x939).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in protecting children from recidivist sex offenders plainly applies to internet use.  Several factors make the internet a powerful tool for the would-be child abuser.  First, children often use the internet in a way that gives offenders easy access to their personal information\xe2\x80\x94by, for example, communicating with strangers and allowing sites to disclose their location.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Second, the internet provides previously unavailable ways of communicating with, stalking, and ultimately abusing children.  An abuser can create a false profile that misrepresents the abuser\xe2\x80\x99s age and gender.  The abuser can lure the minor into engaging in sexual conversations, sending explicit photos, or even meeting in person.  And an abuser can use a child\xe2\x80\x99s location posts on the internet to determine the pattern of the child\xe2\x80\x99s day-to-day activities\xe2\x80\x94and even the child\xe2\x80\x99s location at a given moment.  Such uses of the internet are already well documented, both in research[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] and in reported decisions.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because protecting children from abuse is a compelling state interest and sex offenders can (and do) use the internet to engage in such abuse, it is legitimate and entirely reasonable for States to try to stop abuse from occurring before it happens.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It is not enough, however, that the law before us is designed to serve a compelling state interest; it also must not \xe2\x80\x9cburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ward</i>, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 798\xe2\x80\x93799; see also <i>McCullen</i> v. <i>Coakley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319).  The North Carolina law fails this requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A straightforward reading of the text of N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5 compels the conclusion that it prohibits sex offenders from accessing an enormous number of websites.  The law defines a \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial social networking Web site\xe2\x80\x9d as one with four characteristics.  First, the website must be \xe2\x80\x9coperated by a person who derives revenue from membership fees, advertising, or other sources related to the operation of the Web site.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(b)(1).  Due to the prevalence of advertising on websites of all types, this requirement does little to limit the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the website must \xe2\x80\x9c[f]acilitat[e] the social introduction between two or more persons for the purposes of friendship, meeting other persons, or information exchanges.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(b)(2).  The term \xe2\x80\x9csocial introduction\xe2\x80\x9d easily encompasses any casual exchange, and the term \xe2\x80\x9cinformation exchanges\xe2\x80\x9d seems to apply to any site that provides an opportunity for a visitor to post a statement or comment that may be read by other visitors.  Today, a great many websites include this feature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, a website must \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llo[w] users to create Web pages or personal profiles that contain information <i>such as</i> the name or nickname of the user, photographs placed on the personal Web page by the user, other personal information about the user, and links to other personal Web pages on the commercial social networking Web site of friends or associates of the user that may be accessed by other users or visitors to the Web site.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(b)(3) (emphasis added).  This definition covers websites that allow users to create anything that can be called a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal profile,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, a short description of the user.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Con-trary to the argument of the State, Brief for Respondent 26\xe2\x80\x9327, everything that follows the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csuch as\xe2\x80\x9d is an illustration of features that a covered website or personal profile may (but need not) include.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, in order to fit within the statute, a website must \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rovid[e] users or visitors .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. mechanisms to communicate with other users, <i>such as</i> a message board, chat room, electronic mail, or instant messenger.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(b)(4) (emphasis added).  This requirement seems to demand no more than that a website allow back-and-forth comments between users.  And since a comment function is undoubtedly a \xe2\x80\x9cmechanis[m] to communicate with other users,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, it appears to follow that any website with such a function satisfies this requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The fatal problem for \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5 is that its wide sweep precludes access to a large number of websites that are most unlikely to facilitate the commission of a sex crime against a child.  A handful of examples illustrates this point.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take, for example, the popular retail website Amazon.com, which allows minors to use its services[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] and meets all four requirements of \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a commercial social networking website.  First, as a seller of products, Amazon unquestionably derives revenue from the operation of its website.  Second, the Amazon site facilitates the social introduction of people for the purpose of information exchanges.  When someone purchases a product on Amazon, the purchaser can review the product and upload photographs, and other buyers can then respond to the review.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  This information exchange about products that Amazon sells undoubtedly fits within the definition in \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5.  It is the equivalent of passengers on a bus comparing notes about products they have purchased.  Third, Amazon allows a user to create a personal profile, which is then associated with the product reviews that the user uploads.  Such a profile can contain an assortment of information, including the user\xe2\x80\x99s name, e-mail address, and picture.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  And fourth, given its back-and-forth comment function, Amazon satisfies the final statutory requirement.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many news websites are also covered by this definition.  For example, the Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s website gives minors access[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>] and satisfies the four elements that define a commercial social networking website.  The website (1) derives revenue from ads and (2) facilitates social introductions for the purpose of information exchanges.  Users of the site can comment on articles, reply to other users\xe2\x80\x99 comments, and recommend another user\xe2\x80\x99s comment.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  Users can also (3) create personal profiles that include a name or nickname and a photograph.  The photograph and name will then appear next to every comment the user leaves on an article.  Finally (4), the back-and-forth comment section is a mechanism for users to communicate among themselves.  The site thus falls within \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5 and is accordingly off limits for registered sex offenders in NorthCarolina.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Or consider WebMD\xe2\x80\x94a website that contains health-related resources, from tools that help users find a doctor to information on preventative care and the symptoms associated with particular medical problems.  WebMD, too, allows children on the site.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  And it exhibits the four hallmarks of a \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial social networking\xe2\x80\x9d website.  It obtains revenue from advertisements.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  It facilitates information exchanges\xe2\x80\x94via message boards that allow users to engage in public discussion of an assortment of health issues.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]  It allows users to create basic profile pages: Users can upload a picture and some basic information about themselves, and other users can see their aggregated comments and \xe2\x80\x9clikes.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  WebMD also provides message boards, which are specifically mentioned in the statute as a \xe2\x80\x9cmechanis[m] to communicate with other users.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93202.5(b)(4).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As these examples illustrate, the North Carolina law has a very broad reach and covers websites that are ill suited for use in stalking or abusing children.  The focus of the discussion on these sites\xe2\x80\x94shopping, news, health\xe2\x80\x94does not provide a convenient jumping off point for conversations that may lead to abuse.  In addition, the social exchanges facilitated by these websites occur in the open, and this reduces the possibility of a child being secretly lured into an abusive situation.  These websites also give sex offenders little opportunity to gather personal details about a child; the information that can be listed in a profile is limited, and the profiles are brief.  What is more, none of these websites make it easy to determine a child\xe2\x80\x99s precise location at a given moment.  For example, they do not permit photo streams (at most, a child could upload a single profile photograph), and they do not include up-to-the minute location services.  Such websites would provide essentially no aid to a would-be child abuser.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Placing this set of websites categorically off limits from registered sex offenders prohibits them from receiving or engaging in speech that the\n \nFirst Amendment protects and does not appreciably advance the State\xe2\x80\x99s goal of protecting children from recidivist sex offenders.  I am therefore compelled to conclude that, while the law before us addresses a critical problem, it sweeps far too broadly to satisfy the demands of the Free Speech Clause.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While I thus agree with the Court that the particular law at issue in this case violates the\n \nFirst Amendment, I am troubled by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s loose rhetoric.  After noting that \xe2\x80\x9ca street or a park is a quintessential forum for the exercise of\n \nFirst Amendment rights,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court states that \xe2\x80\x9ccyberspace\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csocial media in particular\xe2\x80\x9d are now \xe2\x80\x9cthe most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The Court declines to explain  what this means with respect to free speech law, and the Court holds no more than that the North Carolina law fails the test for content-neutral  \xe2\x80\x9ctime, place, and manner\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions.  But if the entirety of the internet or even just \xe2\x80\x9csocial media\xe2\x80\x9d sites[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>] are the 21st century equivalent of public streets and parks, then States may have little ability to restrict the sites that may be visited by even the most dangerous sex offenders.  May a State preclude an adult previously convicted of molesting children from visiting a dating site for teenagers?  Or a site where minors communicate with each other about per-sonal problems?  The Court should be more attentive to the implications of its rhetoric for, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, there are important differences between cyberspace and the physical world.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I will mention a few that are relevant to internet use by sex offenders.  First, it is easier for parents to monitor the physical locations that their children visit and the individuals with whom they speak in person than it is to monitor their internet use.  Second, if a sex offender is seen approaching children or loitering in a place fre-quented by children, this conduct may be observed by parents, teachers, or others.  Third, the internet offers an unprecedented degree of anonymity and easily permits a would-be molester to assume a false identity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court is correct that we should be cautious in applying our free speech precedents to the internet.  <i>Ante</i>, at 6.  Cyberspace is different from the physical world, and if it is true, as the Court believes, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot appreciate yet\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cfull dimensions and vast potential\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Cyber Age,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, we should proceed circumspectly, taking one step at a time.  It is regrettable that the Court has not heeded its own admonition of caution.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See Pew Research Center, Teens, Social Media, and Privacy 5(May 21, 2013), http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2013/05/PIP_TeensSocialMediaandPrivacy_PDF.pdf<u> (all internet materials as last visited June 16, 2017)</u>; J.
