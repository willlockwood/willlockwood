Rahim\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorizes a cause of action against \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n individual\xe2\x80\x9d for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation.  \n\n106Stat.\n73, note following \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0As used in the TVPA, the term \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses only natural persons.

The Dictionary Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include certain artificial entities \xe2\x80\x9cas well as individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71, thereby marking \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d as distinct from artificial entities.  Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d and an organizational entity.  See, e.g., 7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa792(k), 511.  And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d in a separate Act to include \xe2\x80\x9cany individual or entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72331(3).

There are no such indications in the TVPA.  To the contrary, the statutory context confirms that Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons alone.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s liability provision uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d five times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four times to refer to the victim.  See TVPA \xc2\xa72(a).  Since only a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difficult to conclude that Congress used \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d four times in the same sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural person and any nonsovereign organization.  In addition, the TVPA holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to \xe2\x80\x9cany person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.\xe2\x80\x9d  See TVPA \xc2\xa72(a)(2).  \xe2\x80\x9cPersons\xe2\x80\x9d often has a broader meaning in the law than \xe2\x80\x9cindividual,\xe2\x80\x9d and frequently includes non-natural persons.  Construing \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act to encompass solely natural persons credits Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of disparate terms.

First, they rely on definitions that frame \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of \xe2\x80\x9coneness,\xe2\x80\x9d but these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA.  Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to the legal systems of other nations.  But while \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles,\xe2\x80\x9d Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104\n, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to subject organizations to liability.  Petitioners next argue that the TVPA\xe2\x80\x99s scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing.  But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs the term \xe2\x80\x9cindividual,\xe2\x80\x9d as the TVPA, to describe the covered defendant.  Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not follow that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations.

We decline to read \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d so unnaturally.

See FCC v.

As a noun, \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily means \xe2\x80\x9c[a] human being, a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Oxford English Dictionary 880 (2d ed. 1989); see also, e.g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 974 (2d ed. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9ca person\xe2\x80\x9d); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1152 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9ca particular person\xe2\x80\x9d) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s).  After all, that is how we use the word in everyday parlance.  We say \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual went to the store,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual left the room,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual took the car,\xe2\x80\x9d each time re-ferring unmistakably to a natural person.  And no one, we hazard to guess, refers in normal parlance to an organization as an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Evidencing that common usage, this Court routinely uses \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d to denote a natural person, and in particular to distinguish between a natural person and a corporation.

Indeed, the very same Congress that enacted the TVPA also established a cause of action for U.\xc2\xa0S. nationals injured \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of an act of interna-tional terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d and defined \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in the statute to include \xe2\x80\x9cany individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992, 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72333(a), 2331(3) (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not to say that the word \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d invariably means \xe2\x80\x9cnatural person\xe2\x80\x9d when used in a statute.  Congress remains free, as always, to give the word a broader or different meaning.  But before we will assume it has done so, there must be some indication Congress intended such a result.  Perhaps it is the rare statute (petitioners point to only one such example, located in the Internal Revenue Code) in which Congress expressly defines \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d to include corporate entities.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7542(a)(2).  Or perhaps, as was the case in Clinton v. City of New York, \n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417, \n429 (1998)\n, the statutory context makes that intention clear, because any other reading of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d would lead to an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98absurd\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d result Congress could not plausibly have intended.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are no such indications in the TVPA.  As noted, the Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9cindividual,\xe2\x80\x9d much less do so in a manner that extends the term beyond its ordinary usage.  And the statutory context strengthens\xe2\x80\x94not undermines\xe2\x80\x94the conclusion that Congress intended to create a cause of action against natural persons alone.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s liability provision uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d five times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator (i.e., the defendant) and four times to refer to the victim.  See \xc2\xa72(a).  Only a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing.  \xe2\x80\x9cSince there is a presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute, a presumption surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown v. Gardner, \n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115, \n118 (1994)\n (citation omitted), it is difficult indeed to conclude that Congress employed the term \xe2\x80\x9cin-dividual\xe2\x80\x9d four times in one sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural person and any nonsovereign organization.  See also \xc2\xa73(b)(1) (using term \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d six times in referring to victims of torture).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also revealing that the Act holds perpetrators lia-ble for extrajudicial killing to \xe2\x80\x9cany person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(a)(2) (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cPerson,\xe2\x80\x9d we have recognized, often has a broader meaning in the law than \xe2\x80\x9cindividual,\xe2\x80\x9d see Clinton, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 428, n.\xc2\xa013, and frequently includes nonnatural persons, see, e.g., \n\n1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  We generally seek to respect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to use different terms to de-scribe different categories of people or things.  See Sosa v.

We are not convinced, however, that any such \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic and international presumption of organi-zational liability\xe2\x80\x9d in tort actions overcomes the ordi- nary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 16.  It is true that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104, \n108 (1991)\n.  But Congress plainly can override those principles, see, e.g., id., at 108\xe2\x80\x93109, and, as explained supra, the TVPA\xe2\x80\x99s text evinces a clear intent not to subject nonsovereign organizations to liability.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe also decline petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion to construe the TVPA\xe2\x80\x99s scope of liability to conform with other federal statutes that petitioners contend provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing.  None of the three statutes petitioners identify employs the term \xe2\x80\x9cin-dividual\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the covered defendant, and so none assists in the interpretive task we face today.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983; 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71603(a), 1605A(c) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72333, 2334(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b), 2337.  The same is true of the Alien Tort Statute, \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350, so it offers no comparative value here regardless of whether corporate entities can be held liable in a federal common-law action brought under that statute.  Compare Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F.\xc2\xa03d 11 (CADC 2011), with Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.\xc2\xa03d 111 (CA2 2010), cert. granted, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  Finally, al-though petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, see, e.g., Chavez v. Carranza, 559 F.\xc2\xa03d 486 (CA6 2009), it does not follow (as petitioners argue) that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations.  An officer who gives an order to torture or kill is an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d in that word\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary usage; an organization is not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners also contend that legislative history supports their broad reading of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual.\xe2\x80\x9d  But \xe2\x80\x9creliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.\xc2\xa0A. v.

Petitioners note that the Senate Report states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he legislation uses the term \xe2\x80\x98individual\xe2\x80\x99 to make crystal clear that foreign states or their entities cannot be sued under this bill under any circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

(\xe2\x80\x9cOnly \xe2\x80\x98individuals,\xe2\x80\x99 not foreign states, can be sued\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet that statement, while clarifying that the Act does not encompass liability against foreign states, says nothing about liability against nonsovereign organizations.  The other excerpts petitioners cite likewise are not probative of the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual,\xe2\x80\x9d for they signal only that the Act does not impose liability on perpetrators who act without authority or color of law of a foreign state.  See, e.g., H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe bill does not attempt to deal with torture or killing by purely private groups\xe2\x80\x9d); S.

A materially identical version of the bill was enacted as the TVPA by the 102d Congress.  Although we are cognizant of the limitations of this drafting history, cf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 546, \n568 (2005)\n, we nevertheless find it telling that the sole explanation for substituting \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d confirms what we have concluded from the text alone.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 final argument is that the Act would be rendered toothless by a construction of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d that limits liability to natural persons.  They contend that pre-cluding organizational liability may foreclose effective remedies for victims and their relatives for any number of reasons.  Victims may be unable to identify the men and women who subjected them to torture, all the while knowing the organization for whom they work.  Personal jurisdiction may be more easily established over corporate than human beings.  And natural persons may be more likely than organizations to be judgment proof.  Indeed, we are told that only two TVPA plaintiffs have been able to re-cover successfully against a natural person\xe2\x80\x94one only after the defendant won the state lottery.  See Jean v.

The word \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d is open to multiple interpretations, permitting it, linguistically speaking, to include natural persons, corporations, and other entities.  Thus, I do not believe that word alone is sufficient to decide this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe legislative history of the statute, however, makes up for whatever interpretive inadequacies remain after con- sidering language alone.  See, e.g., ante, at 9 (describ- ing markup session in which one of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors proposed an amendment containing the word \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmake it clear\xe2\x80\x9d that the statute applied to \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals and not to corporations\xe2\x80\x9d); Hearing on S. 1629 et\xc2\xa0al. be- fore the Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 65 (1990) (witness explaining to committee that there would be a \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d with suing an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent en- tity or a series of entities that are not governments,\xe2\x80\x9d such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization); id., at 75 (allaying concerns that there will be a flood of lawsuits \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the requirement [in the statute] that an individual has to identify his or her precise torture[r] and they have to be both in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); see also ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (making clear that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 citations to the legislative history \xe2\x80\x9cdo not help their cause\xe2\x80\x9d).  After examining the history in detail, and considering it along with the reasons that the Court provides, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
