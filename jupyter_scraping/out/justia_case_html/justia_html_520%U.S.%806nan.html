The NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund (Fund), which administers a plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), owns and operates New York treatment centers for longshore workers, retirees, and their dependents. Respondents, the Fund\'s trustees, discontinued paying the tax and filed this action to enjoin petitioner state officials from making future assessments and to obtain a refund, alleging that the HFA is a state law that "relates to" the Fund within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(a) of ERISA, and is therefore pre-empted as applied to hospitals run by ERISA plans. The District Court concluded that the HFA is not pre-empted because it is a tax of general application having only an incidental impact on benefit plans. The Second Circuit reversed, reasoning that the HFA relates to the Fund by reducing the amount of Fund assets that would otherwise be available to provide plan members with benefits, and could cause the plan to limit its benefits or to charge plan members higher fees.

See Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a). None of the exceptions in subsection (b) is directly at issue in this case.</p><p>3 N. Y. Pub.

The Fund owns and operates three medical centers-two in New York and one in New Jersey-that provide medical, dental, and other health care benefits primarily to longshore workers, retirees, and their dependents. The New York centers are licensed by the State as "diagnostic and treatment centers," App. 80, and are thus subject to a 0.6 percent tax on gross receipts under the HF A. N. Y. Pub. Health Law \xc2\xa7 2807d(2)(c) (McKinney 1993).</p><p>During the period from January through November of 1991, respondents paid HFA assessments totaling $7,066 based on the two New York hospitals\' patient care income of $1,177,670. At that time, they discontinued the payments and brought this action against appropriate state officials (petitioners) to enjoin future assessments and to obtain a refund of the tax paid in 1991. The complaint alleged that the HF A is a state law that "relates to" the Fund within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(a) of ERISA, and is therefore pre-empted as applied to hospitals run by ERISA plans.</p><p>The District Court denied relief. It concluded that HFA was not pre-empted because it was a "tax of general application" that did not "interfere with the calculation of benefits or the determination of an employee\'s eligibility for benefits" and thus had only an incidental impact on benefit plans.

Health Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2807-d(3)(c), 2807-d(3)(d) (McKinney 1993). The taxation of these activities is not challenged here.</p><p>5 In response to the complaint filed in 1992, petitioners objected to federal jurisdiction, relying on the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1341, which provides that federal courts "shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="811">811</a></p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. It distinguished cases in which we had found that certain "laws of general application" were not pre-empted by ERISA,6 explaining that the HF A "targets only the health care industry," which is, "by definition, the realm where ERISA welfare plans must operate," <i>NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund </i>v. <i>Axelrod, M. D., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/27/823/">27 F.3d 823</a>, 827 (1994). The court reasoned that because the HFA "operates as an immediate tax on payments and contributions which were intended to pay for participants\' medical benefits," it directly affects "the very operations and functions that make the Fund what it is, a provider of medical, surgical, and hospital</p><p>State." Respondents contended that the statute did not apply because the New York courts do not provide the "plain" remedy required to bar federal jurisdiction. The District Court appears to have agreed with respondents, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a, but when it ultimately granted summary judgment and dismissed the complaint, it did not squarely decide the question, <i>id., </i>at 19a, 22a-23a. The Court of Appeals did not address the Tax Injunction Act in either of its two opinions in this case and there is no suggestion anywhere in the papers that the State raised the issue before that court. The Second Circuit had previously held, however, that the Tax Injunction Act is not a bar to actions such as this. See <i>Travelers Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Cuomo, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/14/708/">14 F.3d 708</a>, 713-714 (1993), rev\'d on other grounds, <i>New York State Conference of Blue Cross </i>&amp; <i>Blue Shield Plans </i>v. <i>Travelers Ins. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/645/case.html">514 U. S. 645</a> (1995). In <i>Travelers, </i>we noted, but did not reexamine, that conclusion. See <i>id., </i>at 652-653, n. 4. In the case at bar, the Court of Appeals presumably was satisfied that its jurisdiction was secure for the reasons given in <i>Travelers. </i>Before this Court, no party in either <i>Travelers </i>or the current case has mentioned the Tax Injunction Act or questioned the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that a "plain" remedy is unavailable in the New York courts. Given our settled practice of according respect to the courts of appeals\' greater familiarity with issues of state law, cf. <i>Bishop </i>v. <i>Wood, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/case.html">426 U. S. 341</a>, 346-347, and n. 10 (1976), and the State\'s active participation in nearly four years of federal litigation with no complaint about federal jurisdiction, it is appropriate for us to presume that the Court of Appeals correctly determined that, under these circumstances, New York courts did not provide a "plain" remedy barring federal consideration of the state tax.</p><p>6 See, <i>e. g., Mackey, </i>486 U. S., at 838 (generally applicable garnishment law not pre-empted); <i>Fort Halifax Packing Co., </i>482 U. S., at 19 (state law requiring one-time severance payment not pre-empted).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="812">812</a></p><p>care to its participants and their beneficiaries." <i>Ibid. </i>The HF A, concluded the court, thus "related to" the Fund because it reduced the amount of Fund assets that would otherwise be available to provide plan members with benefits, and could cause the plan to limit its benefits, or to charge plan members higher fees.</p><p>The first petition for certiorari in this case was filed before we handed down our opinion in <i>New York State Conference of Blue Cross </i>&amp; <i>Blue Shield Plans </i>v. <i>Travelers Ins. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/645/case.html">514 U. S. 645</a> (1995). In that case we held that ERISA did not pre-empt a New York statute that required hospitals to collect surcharges from patients covered by a commercial insurer but not from patients insured by a Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan. <i>Id., </i>at 649-651. After deciding <i>Travelers, </i>we vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case and remanded for further consideration in light of that opinion. 514 U. S. 1094 (1995).</p><p>On remand the Court of Appeals reinstated its original judgment. The court distinguished the statute involved in <i>Travelers </i>on the ground that-by imposing a tax on the health insurance carriers who provided coverage to plans and their beneficiaries-it had only an indirect economic influence on the decisions of ERISA plan administrators, whereas the HFA "depletes the Fund\'s assets directly, and thus has an immediate impact on the operations of an ERISA plan," <i>NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund </i>v. <i>Axelrod, M. D., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/74/28/">74 F.3d 28</a>,30 (1996). We granted the New York officials\' second petition for certiorari, 519 U. S. 926 (1996), and now reverse.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>When the Second Circuit initially found the HFA preempted as applied to Fund-operated hospitals, that court relied substantially on an expansive and literal interpretation of the words "relate to" in \xc2\xa7 514(a) of ERISA. 27 F. 3d, at 826. In reconsidering the case on remand, the court appears to have adhered to that approach, failing to give proper</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="813">813</a></p><p>weight to <i>Travelers\' </i>rejection of a strictly literal reading of \xc2\xa7514(a).</p><p>In <i>Travelers, </i>as in our earlier cases, we noted that the literal text of \xc2\xa7 514(a) is "clearly expansive." 514 U. S., at 655. But we were quite clear in that case that the text could not be read to "extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, [or] for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course, for \'[r]eally, universally, relations stop nowhere,\' H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York ed., World\'s Classics 1980)." <i>Ibid.</i>7</p><p>In our earlier ERISA pre-emption cases, it had not been necessary to rely on the expansive character of ERISA\'s literallanguage in order to find pre-emption because the state laws at issue in those cases had a clear "connection with or reference to," <i>Shaw </i>v. <i>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html">463 U. S. 85</a>, 96-97 (1983), ERISA benefit plans. But in <i>Travelers </i>we confronted directly the question whether ERISA\'s "relates to" language was intended to modify "the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law." 514 U.

S., at 333-334. The HFA is a tax on hospitals. Most hospitals are not owned or operated by ERISA funds. This particular ERISA fund has arranged to provide medical benefits for its plan beneficiaries by running hospitals directly, rather than by purchasing the same services at independently run hospitals. If the Fund had made the other choice, and had purchased health care services from a hospital, that facility would have passed the expense of the HF A onto the Fund and its plan beneficiaries through the rates it set for the services provided. The Fund would then have had to decide whether to cover a more limited range of services for its beneficiaries, or perhaps to charge plan members higher rates. Although the tax in such a circumstance would be "indirect," its impact on the Fund\'s decisions would be in all relevant respects identical to the "direct" impact felt here. Thus, the supposed difference between direct and indirect impact-upon which the Court of Appeals relied in distinguishing this case from <i>Travelers-cannot </i>withstand scrutiny. Any state tax, or other law, that increases the cost of providing benefits to covered employees will have some effect on the administration of ERISA plans, but that simply cannot mean that every state law with such an effect is preempted by the federal statute.16</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, dissenting.</p><p>"[I]t is the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which is defined and limited by</p><p>16 As we acknowledged in <i>Travelers, </i>there might be a state law whose economic effects, intentionally or otherwise, were so acute "as to force an ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers" and such a state law "might indeed be pre-empted under \xc2\xa7 514," 514 U.

Despite our obligation to examine federal-court jurisdiction even if the issue is not raised by either party, <i>ibid., </i>and despite the Court\'s explicit acknowledgment, <i>ante, </i>at 810-811, n. 5, of the possibility that jurisdiction over this case is barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.

In my view, neither of these factors justifies our proceeding without resolving the issue of jurisdiction.</p><p>The Tax Injunction Act bars federal-court jurisdiction over an action seeking to enjoin a state tax (such as the one at issue here) where "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State." 28 U.

The only argument in <i>Travelers </i>that supports the conclusion reached here is the argument that "[b]ecause ERISA generally confers exclusive jurisdiction on the federal courts [under 29 U. S.

If this suit were brought before a ... state court, that court might well feel compelled to dismiss the action on the grounds that its jurisdiction had been preempted by federal legislation and the supremacy clause.
