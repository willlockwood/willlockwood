Her pharmacist dispensed a generic form of sulindac manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical.  Respondent soon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.  She is now severely disfigured, has physical disabilities, and is nearly blind.  At the time of the prescription, sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s label did not specifically refer to toxic epidermal necrolysis.  By 2005, however, the FDA had recommended changing all NSAID labeling to contain a more explicit toxic epidermal necrolysis warning.  Respondent sued Mutual in New Hampshire state court, and Mutual removed the case to federal court.  A jury found Mutual liable on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim and awarded her over $21 million.  The First Circuit affirmed.  As relevant, it found that neither the FDCA nor the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations pre-empted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim.  It distinguished PLIVA, Inc. v.

Body Masters Sports Industries, Inc., 147 N.\xc2\xa0H. 150, 153, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d 1178, 1181, the New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a \xe2\x80\x9crisk-utility approach,\xe2\x80\x9d which asks whether the danger\xe2\x80\x99s magnitude outweighs the product\xe2\x80\x99s utility, id., at 154, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1182.  The court has repeatedly identified three factors as germane to that inquiry: \xe2\x80\x9cthe usefulness and desirability of the product to the public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could have been reduced without significantly affecting either the product\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Increasing a drug\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cusefulness\xe2\x80\x9d or reducing its \xe2\x80\x9crisk of danger\xe2\x80\x9d would require redesigning the drug, since those factors are direct results of a drug\xe2\x80\x99s chemical design and active ingredients.  Here, however, redesign was not possible for two reasons.  First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling as its brand-name drug equivalent.  Second, because of sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned.  Accordingly, because redesign was impossible, Mutual could only ameliorate sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crisk-utility\xe2\x80\x9d profile by strengthening its warnings.  Thus, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s law ultimately required Mutual to change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s labeling.

New Hampshire law imposes a duty on manufacturers to ensure that the drugs they market are not unreasonably unsafe, and a drug\xe2\x80\x99s safety is evaluated by reference to both its chemical properties and the adequacy of its warnings.  Because Mutual was unable to change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s composition as a matter of both federal law and basic chemistry, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect cause of action effectively required Mutual to change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s labeling to provide stronger warnings.  But, as this Court recognized just two Terms ago in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), federal law prohibits generic drug manufacturers from independently changing their drugs\xe2\x80\x99 labels.  Accordingly, state law imposed a duty on Mutual not to comply with federal law.  Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that require a private party to violate federal law are pre-empted and, thus, are \xe2\x80\x9cwithout effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Maryland v.

New Hampshire has adopted the former, not the latter.  Indeed, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has consistently held that the manu-facturer of a product has a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to design his product reasonably safely for the uses which he can foresee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 118 N. H. 802, 809, 395 A.\xc2\xa02d 843, 847 (1978).  See also Reid v. Spadone Mach. Co., 119 N.

Determining the content of that duty requires somewhat more analysis.  As discussed below in greater detail, New Hampshire requires manufacturers to ensure that the products they design, manufacture, and sell are not \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d  The New Hampshire Supreme Court has recognized that this duty can be satisfied either by changing a drug\xe2\x80\x99s design or by changing its labeling.  Since Mutual did not have the option of changing sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s design, New Hampshire law ultimately required it to change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s labeling.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent argues that, even if New Hampshire law does impose a duty on drug manufacturers, that duty does not encompass either the \xe2\x80\x9cduty to change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s design\xe2\x80\x9d or the duty \xe2\x80\x9cto change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s labeling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 30 (capitalization and emphasis deleted).  That argument cannot be correct.  New Hampshire imposes design-defect liability only where \xe2\x80\x9cthe design of the product created a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vautour v.

To determine whether a product is \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d the New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a \xe2\x80\x9crisk-utility approach\xe2\x80\x9d under which \xe2\x80\x9ca product is defective as designed if the magnitude of the danger outweighs the utility of the product.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1182 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That risk-utility approach requires a \xe2\x80\x9cmultifaceted balancing process involving evaluation of many conflicting factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

See 21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.66(b)(2) (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cActive ingredient means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitiga- tion, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure of any function of the body of humans\xe2\x80\x9d (italics deleted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the present case, however, redesign was not possible for two reasons.  First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same active ingredients, route of adminis-tration, dosage form, strength, and labeling as the brand-name drug on which it is based.  21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7355(j)(2)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x93(v) and (8)(B); 21 CFR \xc2\xa7320.1(c).  Consequently, the Court of Appeals was correct to recognize that \xe2\x80\x9cMutual cannot legally make sulindac in another composition.\xe2\x80\x9d  678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 37.  Indeed, were Mutual to change the composition of its sulindac, the altered chemical would be a new drug that would require its own NDA to be marketed in interstate commerce.  See 21 CFR \xc2\xa7310.3(h) (giving examples of when the FDA considers a drug to be new, including cases involving \xe2\x80\x9cnewness for drug use of any substance which composes such drug, in whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, because of sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned.  See 678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 37 (\xe2\x80\x9cMutual cannot legally make sulindac in another composition (nor it is apparent how it could alter a one-molecule drug anyway)\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven the impossibility of redesigning sulindac, the only way for Mutual to ameliorate the drug\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crisk-utility\xe2\x80\x9d profile\xe2\x80\x94and thus to escape liability\xe2\x80\x94was to strengthen \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence and efficacy of [sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s] warning\xe2\x80\x9d in such a way that the warning \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[ed] an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1182.  See also Chellman, 138 N.\xc2\xa0H., at 78, 637 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 150 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe duty to warn is part of the general duty to design, manufacture and sell products that are reasonably safe for their foreseeable uses.

And, the District Court repeatedly instructed the jury that it should evaluate sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s labeling in determining whether Mutual\xe2\x80\x99s sulindac was unreasonably dangerous.  See App. 514 (jury instruction that the jury should find \xe2\x80\x9ca defect in design\xe2\x80\x9d only if it found that \xe2\x80\x9cSulindac was unreasonably dangerous and that a warning was not present and effective to avoid that unreasonable danger\xe2\x80\x9d); ibid.

Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility pre-emption would be \xe2\x80\x9call but meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe incoherence of the stop-selling theory becomes plain when viewed through the lens of our previous cases.  In every instance in which the Court has found impossibility pre-emption, the \xe2\x80\x9cdirect conflict\xe2\x80\x9d between federal- and state-law duties could easily have been avoided if the regulated actor had simply ceased acting.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPLIVA is an obvious example: As discussed above, the PLIVA Court held that state failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by the FDCA because it was impossible for drug manufacturers like PLIVA to comply with both the state-law duty to label their products in a way that rendered them reasonably safe and the federal-law duty not to change their drugs\xe2\x80\x99 labels.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  It would, of course, have been possible for drug manufacturers like PLIVA to pull their products from the market altogether.  In so doing, they would have avoided liability under both state and federal law: such manufacturers would neither have labeled their products in a way that rendered them unsafe nor impermissibly changed any federally approved label.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cit was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the same,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at ___ (slip op., at 12), the Court was undeterred by the prospect that PLIVA could have complied with both state and federal requirements by simply leaving the market.

Rather, as discussed at length above, see supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x9313, we hold that state-law design-defect claims like New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s that place a duty on manufacturers to render a drug safer by either altering its composition or altering its labeling are in conflict with federal laws that prohibit manufacturers from unilaterally altering drug composition or labeling.  The dissent is quite correct that federal law establishes no safe-harbor for drug companies\xe2\x80\x94but it does prevent them from taking certain remedial measures.  Where state law imposes a duty to take such remedial measures, it \xe2\x80\x9cactual[ly] conflict[s] with federal law\xe2\x80\x9d by making it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impos-sible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Freightliner Corp. v.

The dissent seems to acknowledge that point when it concedes that, \xe2\x80\x9cif federal law requires a particular product label to include a complete list of ingredients while state law specifically forbids that labeling practice, there is little question that state law \xe2\x80\x98must yield.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Post, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (quoting Felder v. Casey, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 131, \n138 (1988)\n).  What the dissent does not see is that that is this case: Federal law requires a very specific label for sulindac, and state law forbids the use of that label.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent responds that New Hampshire law \xe2\x80\x9cmerely create[s] an incentive\xe2\x80\x9d to alter sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s label or composition, post, at 7, but does not impose any actual \xe2\x80\x9clegal obligation,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 13.  The contours of that argument are difficult to discern.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t  Perhaps the dissent is drawing a distinction between common-law \xe2\x80\x9cexposure to liability,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 12, and a statutory \xe2\x80\x9clegal mandate,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  But the distinction between common law and statutory law is irrelevant to the argument at hand: In violating a common-law duty, as surely as by violating a statutory duty, a party contravenes the law.  While it is true that, in a certain sense, common-law duties give a manufacturer the choice \xe2\x80\x9cbetween exiting the market or continuing to sell while knowing it may have to pay compensation to consumers injured by its product,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 16, statutory \xe2\x80\x9cmandate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d do precisely the same thing:  They require a manufacturer to choose between leaving the market and accepting the consequences of its actions (in the form of a fine or other sanction).  See generally Calabresi &amp; Melamed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral, 85 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1089 (1972) (discussing liability rules).  And, in any event, PLIVA\xe2\x80\x94which the dissent agrees involved a state-law \xe2\x80\x9crequirement that conflicted with federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 13\xe2\x80\x94dealt with common-law failure-to-warn claims, see PLIVA, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Because PLIVA controls the instant case, the dissent is reduced to fighting a rearguard action against its reasoning despite ostensibly swearing fealty to its holding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo suggest that Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 431 (2005)\n, is to the contrary is simply misleading.  The dissent is correct that Bates held a Texas state-law design-defect claim not to be pre-empted.  But, it did so because the design-defect claim in question was not a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement \xe2\x80\x98for labeling or packaging\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and thus fell outside the class of claims covered by the express pre-emption provision at issue in that case.  Id., at 443\xe2\x80\x93444 (emphasis in original).  Indeed, contrary to the impression one might draw from the dissent, post, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, the Bates Court actually blessed the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the State\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim imposed a pre-emptable \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Court of Appeals did, however, correctly hold that the term \xe2\x80\x98requirements\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7136v(b) reaches beyond positive enactments, such as statutes and regulations, to embrace common-law duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bates, supra, at 443.  The dissent offers no compelling reason why the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law duty\xe2\x80\x9d in this case should not similarly be viewed as a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  We agree, of course, that \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining precisely what, if any, specific requirement a state common-law claim imposes is important.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 12, n.\xc2\xa05.  As Bates makes clear, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of the common-law duty at issue; it does not call for speculation as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manu-facturer to take any particular action.\xe2\x80\x9d 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 445 (citation omitted).  Here, as we have tried to make clear, the duty to ensure that one\xe2\x80\x99s products are not \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d imposed by New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect cause of action, Vautour, 147 N. H., at 153, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1181, involves a duty to make one of several changes.  In cases where it is impossible\xe2\x80\x94in fact or by law\xe2\x80\x94to alter a product\xe2\x80\x99s design (and thus to increase the product\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cusefulness\xe2\x80\x9d or decrease its \xe2\x80\x9crisk of danger\xe2\x80\x9d), the duty to render a product \xe2\x80\x9creasonably safe\xe2\x80\x9d boils down to a duty to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 154, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1182.  The duty to redesign sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s label was thus a part of the common-law duty at issue\xe2\x80\x94not merely an action Mutual might have been prompted to take by the adverse jury verdict here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t  Finally, the dissent laments that we have ignored \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 explicit efforts to preserve state common-law liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 26.  We have not.  Suffice to say, the Court would welcome Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit\xe2\x80\x9d resolution of the difficult pre-emption questions that arise in the prescription drug context.  That issue has repeatedly vexed the Court\xe2\x80\x94and produced widely divergent views\xe2\x80\x94in recent years.  See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555 (2009)\n; PLIVA, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  As the dissent concedes, however, the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of prescription drugs includes neither an express pre-emption clause (as in the vaccine context, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1)), nor an express non-pre-emption clause (as in the over-the-counter drug context, 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7379r(e), 379s(d)).  In the absence of that sort of \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit\xe2\x80\x9d expression of congressional intent, we are left to divine Congress\xe2\x80\x99 will from the duties the statute imposes.  That federal law forbids Mutual to take actions required of it by state tort law evinces an intent to pre-empt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case arises out of tragic circumstances.  A combination of factors combined to produce the rare and devastating injuries that respondent suffered: the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to approve the sale of sulindac and the warnings that accompanied the drug at the time it was prescribed, the decision by respondent\xe2\x80\x99s physician to prescribe sulindac despite its known risks, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to regulate the manufacture and sale of generic drugs in a way that reduces their cost to patients but leaves generic drug manufacturers incapable of modifying either the drugs\xe2\x80\x99 compositions or their warnings.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s situation is tragic and evokes deep sympathy, but a straightforward application of pre-emption law requires that the judgment below be reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We can thus save for another day the question whether a trueabsolute-liability state-law system could give rise to impossibilitypre-emption.  As we have noted, most common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability do not exist merely to spread risk, but rather impose affirmative duties.  See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., \n\xe2\x80\x93324 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn [Medtronic, Inc. v.

Today, the Court unnecessarily and unwisely extends its holding in Mensing to pre-empt New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s law governing design-defects with respect to generic drugs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court takes this step by concluding that petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical was held liable for a failure-to-warn claim in disguise, even though the District Court clearly rejected such a claim and instead allowed liability on a distinct theory.  See infra, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  Of greater consequence, the Court appears to justify its revision of respondent Karen Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s state-law claim through an im-plicit and undefended assumption that federal law gives pharmaceutical companies a right to sell a federally approved drug free from common-law liability.  Remarkably, the Court derives this proposition from a federal law that, in order to protect consumers, prohibits manufacturers from distributing new drugs in commerce without federal regulatory approval, and specifically disavows any intent to displace state law absent a direct and positive conflict.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKaren Bartlett was grievously injured by a drug that a jury found was unreasonably dangerous.  The jury relied upon evidence that the drug posed a higher than normal risk of causing the serious skin reaction that produced her horrific injuries; carried other risks; and possessed no apparent offsetting benefits compared to similar pain relievers, like aspirin.  See\xc2\xa0760 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 220, 233\xe2\x80\x93241, 243\xe2\x80\x93244 (NH 2011).  The Court laments her \xe2\x80\x9ctragic\xe2\x80\x9d situation, ante, at 20, but responsibility for the fact that Karen Bartlett has been deprived of a remedy for her injuries rests with this Court.  If our established pre-emption principles were properly applied in this case, and if New Hampshire law were correctly construed, then federal law would pose no barrier to Karen Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.

Tracing the history of federal drug regulation from the 1906 Federal Food and Drugs Act, \n\n34Stat.\n768, up to the FDCA and its major amendments, the Court explained that federal drug law and state common-law liability have long been understood to operate in tandem to promote consumer safety.  See Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 566\xe2\x80\x93568, 574.  That basic principle, which the majority opinion elides, is essential to understanding this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FDCA prohibits the \xe2\x80\x9cintroduction into interstate commerce [of\xc2\xa0] any new drug\xe2\x80\x9d without prior approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(a).  Brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are required to make different showings to receive agency approval in this premarketing review process.  See ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But in either case, the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s per- mission to market a drug has never been regarded as a final stamp of approval of the drug\xe2\x80\x99s safety.  Under the FDCA, manufacturers, who have greater \xe2\x80\x9caccess to information about their drugs\xe2\x80\x9d than the FDA, Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 578\xe2\x80\x93579, retain the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the products they sell.  In addition to their ongoing obligations to monitor a drug\xe2\x80\x99s risks and to report adverse drug responses to the FDA, see 21 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314.80, 314.81, 314.98 (2012), manufacturers may not sell a drug that is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to be misbranded\xe2\x80\x9d because it is \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous to health\xe2\x80\x9d when used in the dosage or manner called for in the drug\xe2\x80\x99s label.  \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7352(j); see \xc2\xa7331(a); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30\xe2\x80\x9331 (hereinafter U.\xc2\xa0S.

Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 578.  Federal law in this area was initially intended to \xe2\x80\x9csupplemen[t] the protection for consumers already provided by state regulation and common-law liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 566.

In the 1962 amendments to the FDCA, which established the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s premarketing review in its modern form, Congress adopted a saving clause providing that the amendments should not be construed to invalidate any provision of state law absent \xe2\x80\x9ca direct and positive conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7202, \n\n76Stat.\n793.

Moreover, the FDA, which is tasked with monitoring thousands of drugs on the market and considering new drug applications, faces significant resource constraints that limit its ability to protect the public from dangerous drugs.

Mercury Marine, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 51, \n64 (2002)\n.  While the Court has not always been consistent on this issue, it has repeatedly cautioned against reading federal statutes to \xe2\x80\x9cremove all means of judicial recourse for those injured\xe2\x80\x9d when Congress did not provide a federal remedy.  Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, \n251 (1984)\n; see e.g., Bates, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 449; Lohr, 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487 (plurality opinion).  And in fact, the legislative history of the FDCA suggests that Congress chose not to create a federal cause of action for damages precisely because it believed that state tort law would allow injured consumers to obtain compensation.  See Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 574\xe2\x80\x93575, and n.\xc2\xa07.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of this background, Mutual should face an uphill climb to show that federal law pre-empts a New Hampshire strict-liability claim against a generic drug manufacturer for defective design.  The majority nevertheless accepts Mutual\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance with both federal and state [law was] a physical impossibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132\n\xe2\x80\x93143 (1963); see ante, at 7.  But if state and fed-eral law are properly understood, it is clear that New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim did not impose a legal obligation that Mutual had to violate federal law to satisfy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tImpossibility pre-emption \xe2\x80\x9cis a demanding defense,\xe2\x80\x9d Le-vine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573, that requires the defendant to show an \xe2\x80\x9cirreconcilable conflict\xe2\x80\x9d between federal and state legal obligations, Silkwood, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 256.   The logic underlying true impossibility pre-emption is that when state and federal law impose irreconcilable affirmative requirements, no detailed \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry into congressional de-sign\xe2\x80\x9d is necessary because the inference that Congress would have intended federal law to displace the conflicting state requirement \xe2\x80\x9cis inescapable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida Lime, 373 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 142\xe2\x80\x93143.  So, for example, if federal law requires a particular product label to include a complete list of ingredients while state law specifically forbids that labeling practice, there is little question that state law \xe2\x80\x9cmust yield.\xe2\x80\x9d  Felder v. Casey, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 131, \n138 (1988)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe key inquiry for impossibility pre-emption, then, is to identify whether state and federal law impose directly conflicting affirmative legal obligations such that state law \xe2\x80\x9crequire[s] the doing of an act which is unlawful under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.  California Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Guerra, \n\n479 U.\xc2\xa0S. 272, \n292 (1987)\n.  Impossibility does not exist where the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that the laws of the other sovereign restricts or even prohibits.  See Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.\xc2\xa0A. v. Nelson, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25, \n31 (1996)\n; Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assn., Inc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461, \n478, n. \n21 (1984)\n.  So, to modify the previous example, if federal law permitted (but did not require) a labeling practice that state law prohibited, there would be no irreconcilable conflict; a manufacturer could com- ply with the more stringent regulation.  And by the same logic, impossibility does not exist where one sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s laws merely create an incentive to take an action that the other sovereign has not authorized because it is possible to comply with both laws.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, there are other types of pre-emption.  Courts may find that state laws that incentivize what federal law discourages or forbid what federal law authorizes are pre-empted for reasons apart from impossibility: The state laws may fall within the scope of an express pre-emption provision, pose an obstacle to federal purposes and objectives, or intrude upon a field that Congress intended for federal law to occupy exclusively.  See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 363\n\xe2\x80\x93373 (2000).  But absent a direct conflict between two mutually incompatible legal requirements, there is no impossibility and courts may not automatically assume that Congress intended for state law to give way.  Instead, a more careful inquiry into congressional intent is called for, and that inquiry should be informed by the presumption against pre-emption.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn keeping with the strict standard for impossibility, cases that actually find pre-emption on that basis are rare.  See Abrams, Plenary Power Preemption, 99 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 601, 608 (2013).  Mensing is an outlier, as the Court found impossibility because a generic drug manufacturer could not strengthen its product label to come into line with a state-law duty to warn without the exercise of judgment by the FDA.  See 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  But nothing in Mensing, nor any other precedent, dictates finding impossibility pre-emption here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo assess whether it is physically impossible for Mutual to comply with both federal and state law, it is necessary to identify with precision the relevant legal obligations imposed under New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect cause of action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority insists that Mutual was required by New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect law to strengthen its warning label.  In taking this position, the majority effectively re-characterizes Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim as a de facto failure-to-warn claim.  The majority then relies on that re-characterization to hold that the jury found Mutual liable for failing to fulfill its duty to label sulindac adequately, which Mensing forbids because a generic drug manufacturer cannot independently alter its safety label.  Ante, at 13; see Mensing, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Mutual was held liable in this case for violating a legal obligation to change its label is inconsistent with both New Hampshire state law and the record.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor its part, Mutual, in addition to making the argument now embraced by the majority, contends that New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect law effectively required it to change the chemical composition of sulindac.  Mutual claims that it was physically impossible to comply with that duty consistent with federal law because drug manufacturers may not change the chemical composition of their products so as to create new drugs without submitting a new drug application for FDA approval.  See 21 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7310.3(h), 314.70(b)(2)(i).  But just as New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect law did not impose a legal obligation for Mutual to change its label, it also did not mandate that Mutual change the drug\xe2\x80\x99s design.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\ta\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing blackletter products liability law under \xc2\xa7402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1963\xe2\x80\x931964) (hereinafter Second Restatement), New Hampshire recognizes strict liability for three different types of product defects: manufacturing defects, design defects, and warning defects.  See Cheshire Medical Center v. W.\xc2\xa0R. Grace &amp; Co., 49 F.\xc2\xa03d 26, 29 (CA1 1995).  Because the District Court granted Mutual summary judgment on Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s failure-to-warn claim, only New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect cause of action remains at issue in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA product has a defective design under New Hampshire law if it \xe2\x80\x9cposes unreasonable dangers to consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thibault v.

To determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous, a jury is asked to make a risk-benefit assessment by considering a nonexhaustive list of factors.  See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  In addition, New Hamp-shire has specifically rejected the doctrine, advocated by the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \xc2\xa72(b) (1997) (hereinafter Third Restatement), that a plaintiff must present evidence of a reasonable alternative design to show that a product\xe2\x80\x99s design is defective.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile proof of an alternative design is relevant in a design defect case,\xe2\x80\x9d it is \xe2\x80\x9cneither a controlling factor nor an essential element.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vautour v.

See 678 F.\xc2\xa03d 30, 35 (CA1 2012) (citing Brochu v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 642 F.\xc2\xa02d 652, 655 (CA1 1981)); see also Third Restatement \xc2\xa76, Comment f (collecting cases from other jurisdictions).  Drug manufacturers in New Hampshire have an affirmative defense under comment k to \xc2\xa7402A of the Second Restatement, which exempts \xe2\x80\x9c[u]navoidably unsafe products\xe2\x80\x9d from strict liability if the product is properly manufactured and labeled.  As explained by the lower courts in this case, see 678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 36; 731 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 135, 150\xe2\x80\x93151 (NH 2010), New Hampshire takes a case-by-case approach to comment k under which a defendant seeking to invoke the defense must first show that the product is highly useful and that the dan-ger imposed by the product could not have been avoided through a feasible alternative design.  See Brochu, 642 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 657.  Comment k did not factor into the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of liability in this case because Mutual abandoned a comment k defense before trial.

Specifically, and contrary to the majority, see ante, at 11, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect law did not require Mutual to change its warning label.  A drug\xe2\x80\x99s warning label is just one factor in a nonexclusive list for evaluating whether a drug is unreasonably dangerous, see Vautour, 147 N.\xc2\xa0H., at 156, 784 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1183, and an adequate label is therefore neither a necessary nor a sufficient con-dition for avoiding design-defect liability.  Likewise, New Hampshire law imposed no duty on Mutual to change sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s chemical composition.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court has held that proof of an alternative fea-sible design is not an element of a design-defect claim, see Kelleher v. Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co., 152 N.\xc2\xa0H. 813, 831, 891 A.\xc2\xa02d 477, 492 (2006), and as the majority recognizes, ante, at 11, sulindac was not realistically capable of being redesigned anyway because it is a single-molecule drug.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim creates an incentive for drug manufacturers to make changes to its product, including to the drug\xe2\x80\x99s label, to try to avoid liability.  And respondent overstates her case somewhat when she suggests that New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s strict-liability law is purely compensatory.  See Brief for Respondent 19.  As is typically true of strict-liability regimes, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s law, which mandates compensation only for \xe2\x80\x9cdefective\xe2\x80\x9d products, serves both compensatory and regulatory purposes.  See Heath v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 123 N.\xc2\xa0H. 512, 521\xe2\x80\x93522, 464 A.\xc2\xa02d 288, 293 (1983).  But exposure to liability, and the \xe2\x80\x9cincidental regulatory effects\xe2\x80\x9d that flow from that exposure, Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, \n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 174\n\xe2\x80\x93186 (1988), is not equivalent to a legal mandate for a regulated party to take (or refrain from taking) a specific action.  This difference is a significant one: A mandate leaves no choice for a party that wishes to comply with the law, whereas an incentive may only influence a choice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur cases reflect this distinction.  In Bates, for exam-ple, we rejected an argument that design-defect claims brought against a pesticide manufacturer were pre-empted because they would likely \xe2\x80\x9cinduce\xe2\x80\x9d the manufacturer to change its product label and thus run afoul of an express pre-emption provision forbidding state labeling \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d that were different or in addition to federal requirements.  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444\xe2\x80\x93446.  A requirement, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis a rule of law that must be obeyed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 445.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates an optional decision,\xe2\x80\x9d does not rise to that level.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo too here.  The fact that imposing strict liability for injuries caused by a defective drug design might make a drug manufacturer want to change its label or design (or both) does not mean the manufacturer was actually required by state law to take either action.  And absent such a legal obligation, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s impossibility argument does not get off the ground, because there was no state requirement that it was physically impossible for Mutual to comply with while also following federal law.  The case is therefore unlike Mensing, where it was \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed\xe2\x80\x9d that applicable state tort law \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d] a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of its product\xe2\x80\x99s danger\xe2\x80\x9d to strengthen its label\xe2\x80\x94a requirement that conflicted with federal law preventing the manufacturer from doing so uni-laterally, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 4, 11\xe2\x80\x9312).

App. 102\xe2\x80\x93108; see 659 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 279, 282 (NH 2009).  Pursuing both claims was consistent with New Hampshire law\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cdesign defect and failure to warn claims are separate.\xe2\x80\x9d  LeBlanc v. American Honda Motor Co., 141 N.\xc2\xa0H. 579, 586, 688 A.\xc2\xa02d 556, 562 (1997).  After the District Court granted summary judgment to Mutual on the failure-to-warn claim, the court repeatedly explained that an alleged failure to warn by Mutual could not and did not provide the basis for Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.  See 760 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 248\xe2\x80\x93249.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority notes that the District Court admitted evidence regarding sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s label.  Ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  But the court did so because the label remained relevant for the more limited purpose of assessing, in combination with other factors, whether sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s design was defective because the product was unreasonably dangerous.  See 678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 41.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to the jury adhered to this limited purpose.  The court first told the jury to determine whether sulindac was unreasonably dangerous by weighing its danger against its utility.  App. 513.  The court further instructed the jury that if it determined that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous without reference to the warning label, it could then consider the presence and efficacy of the label to evaluate whether the product was unreasonably dangerous \xe2\x80\x9ceven with its warning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., 513\xe2\x80\x93514.  In other words, to hold Mutual liable, the jury was required to find that sulindac \xe2\x80\x9cwas unreasonably dangerous despite its warning, not because of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 341.  The District Court also explained to the jury that because Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s claim addressed only whether sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s design was defective, Mutual\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich included any failure to change its warning, was \xe2\x80\x98not relevant to this case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  760 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 248.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe distinction drawn by the District Court between permissible and impermissible uses of evidence regarding sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s label is faithful to New Hampshire law.  That law recognizes that the effectiveness of a warning label is just one relevant factor in determining whether a product\xe2\x80\x99s design is unreasonably dangerous, and that design-defect and failure-to-warn claims are \xe2\x80\x9cseparate.\xe2\x80\x9d  LeBlanc, 141 N.\xc2\xa0H., at 586, 688 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 562.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In short, as the District Court made clear, Mutual was not held liable for \xe2\x80\x9cfailing to change\xe2\x80\x9d its warning.  760 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 248\xe2\x80\x93249.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven the distinction that New Hampshire draws between failure-to-warn claims and design-defect claims, as well as the clear and repeated statements by the trial judge that Mutual\xe2\x80\x99s liability was not predicated on breaching a duty to label sulindac adequately, on what basis does the majority reach a contrary conclusion?  Though the majority insists otherwise, ante, at 17, it appears to rely principally on an implicit assumption about rights conferred by federal premarket approval under the FDCA.  After correctly observing that changing sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s chemical composition would create a new drug that would have to go through its own approval process, the majority reasons that Mutual must have been under a state-law duty to change its label because it had no other option to avoid liability while continuing to sell its product.  Ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But that conclusion is based on a false premise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA manufacturer of a drug that is unreasonably dangerous under New Hampshire law has multiple options: It can change the drug\xe2\x80\x99s design or label in an effort to alter its risk-benefit profile, remove the drug from the market, or pay compensation as a cost of doing business.  If federal law or the drug\xe2\x80\x99s chemical properties take the redesign option off the table, then that does not mean the manufacturer suddenly has a legal obligation under state law to improve the drug\xe2\x80\x99s label.  Indeed, such a view of state law makes very little sense here because even if Mutual had strengthened its label to fully account for sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s risks, the company might still have faced liability for having a defective design.  See Thibault, 118 N.\xc2\xa0H., at 808, 395 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 847 (explaining that strict liability \xe2\x80\x9cmay attach even though .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. there was an adequate warning\xe2\x80\x9d).  When a manufacturer cannot change the label or when doing so would not make the drug safe, the manufacturer may still choose between exiting the market or continuing to sell while knowing it may have to pay compensation to consumers injured by its product.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFrom a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, that may be an un-welcome choice.  But it is a choice that a sovereign State may impose to protect its citizens from dangerous drugs or at least ensure that seriously injured consumers receive compensation.  That is, a State may impose such a choice unless the FDCA gives manufacturers an absolute right to sell their products free from common-law liability, or state law otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\xe2\x80\x9d of federal objectives.  Crosby, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the majority does not rely on obstacle pre-emption, it must believe that a manufacturer that received FDA premarket approval has a right not only to keep its drug on the market unless and until the FDA revokes approval, but also to be free from state-law liability that makes doing so more expensive.  That proposition is fundamentally inconsistent with the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, saving clause, and his-tory.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x936; Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 583 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is simply incorrect to say that federal law presupposes that drug manufacturers have a right to continue to sell a drug free from liability once it has been approved.  Nothing in the language of the FDCA, which is framed as a prohibition on distribution without FDA approval, see \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(a), suggests such a right.  Federal law itself bars the sale of previously approved drugs if new information comes to light demonstrating that the drug is \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous to health\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cmisbranded.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7331(a), 352(j); see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Even outside that sce- nario, manufacturers regularly take drugs off the market when evidence emerges about a drug\xe2\x80\x99s risks, particu- larly when safer drugs that provide the same therapeutic benefits are available.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  According to the FDA, while it has formal authority to withdraw approval for a drug based on new adverse information, see \xc2\xa7355(e), it is far more common for a manufacturer to stop selling its product voluntarily after the FDA advises the manufacturer that the drug is unsafe and that its risk-benefit profile cannot be adequately addressed through labeling changes or other measures.

Ante, at 2, 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument is built on the mistaken premise that Mutual is legally obligated by New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect law to modify its label in a way that federal law forbids.  It is not.  See supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  For that reason, rejecting impossibility pre-emption here would not render the doctrine \xe2\x80\x9ca dead letter\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all but meaningless.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2, 15 (quoting Mensing, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)).  On the other hand, it is the major- ity that \xe2\x80\x9cwork[s] a revolution in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s [impossibility] pre-emption case law,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 2, by inferring a state-law requirement from the steps a manufacturer might wish to take to avoid or mitigate its exposure to liability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNot all products can be made safe for sale with an improved warning or a tweak in design.  New Hampshire, through its design-defect law, has made a judgment that some drugs that were initially approved for distribution turn out to be inherently and unreasonably dangerous and should therefore not be sold unless the manufacturer is willing to compensate injured consumers.  Congressional intent to pre-empt such a cause of action cannot be gleaned from the existence of federal specifications that apply to the product if it is sold.  Instead, whether New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect cause-of-action is pre-empted depends on assessing whether it poses an obstacle to a federal policy to approve sulindac for use.  Yet the major-ity skips that analysis and instead finds impossibility where it does not exist by relying on a question-begging assumption that Congress intended for Mutual to have a way to continue selling sulindac without incurring common-law liability.  See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe distinction between impossibility and obstacle pre-emption is an important one.  While obstacle pre-emption can be abused when courts apply an overly broad conception of the relevant federal purpose to find pre-emption, see Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601\xe2\x80\x93602 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), it is a useful framework for a case like this one because it would at least lead the Court to ask the right questions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, properly evaluating the asserted conflict here through the lens of obstacle pre-emption would allow the Court to consider evidence about whether Congress intended the FDA to make an optimal safety determination and set a maximum safety standard (in which case state tort law would undermine the purpose) rather than a minimal safety threshold (in which case state tort law could supplement it).  See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11).  By contrast, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s overbroad impossibility framework takes no account of how federal drug safety review actually works.  Though the majority gestures to the rigorous nature of the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s review of new drug ap-plications, ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, nothing in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning turns on how the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s premarketing review operates or on the agency\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to engage in postmarketing review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn taking the approach it does, the majority replaces careful assessment of regulatory structure with an ipse dixit that pharmaceutical companies must have a way to \xe2\x80\x9cescape liability,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 11, while continuing to sell a drug that received FDA approval.  As a result, the major-ity effectively makes a highly contested policy judgment about the relationship between FDA review and state tort law\xe2\x80\x94treating the FDA as the sole guardian of drug safety\xe2\x80\x94without defending its judgment and without con-sidering whether that is the policy judgment that Congress made.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the majority never addresses obstacle pre-emption, Mutual did argue in the alternative that Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect cause of action is pre-empted because it conflicts with the purposes and objectives of the FDCA, as supplemented by the Hatch-Waxman Act, \n\n98Stat.\n1585.

The FDA, through an amicus brief filed by the United States, generally supports this argument.  The FDA states that the question whether a design-defect claim\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t is pre-empted is \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult and close,\xe2\x80\x9d and it recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]everal factors do weigh in favor of finding no preemption,\xe2\x80\x9d including the absence of textual support in the FDCA for the idea that an approved drug must be made available in any particular State.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Brief 12, 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  But the FDA ultimately contends that design-defect claims are pre-empted unless they parallel the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s misbranding prohibition because the agency be-lieves that permitting juries to balance the health risks and benefits of an FDA-approved drug would undermine the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s drug-safety determinations and could reduce access to drugs that the FDA has determined are safe and effective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur cases have \xe2\x80\x9cgiven \xe2\x80\x98some weight\xe2\x80\x99 to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s views about the impact of tort law on federal objectives when \xe2\x80\x98the subject matter is technica[l] and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 576 (quoting Geier v.

Given the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose of protecting consumers, our recognition in Levine that state tort law generally complements the statute\xe2\x80\x99s safety goals, the practical limits on the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to monitor and promptly address concerns about drug safety once a drug is in the market, see supra, at 5, 20\xe2\x80\x9321, n. 11, and the absence of any federal remedy for injured consumers, I would reject this broad obstacle pre-emption argument as well.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe most troubling aspect of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to once again expand the scope of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s traditionally narrow impossibility pre-emption doctrine is what it implies about the relationship between federal premarket review and state common-law remedies more generally.  Central to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding is an assumption that manufacturers must have a way to avoid state-law lia-bility while keeping particular products in commerce.  See\xc2\xa0ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311, 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  This assumption, it seems, will always create an automatic conflict between a federal premarket review requirement and state-law design-defect liability because premarket review, by definition, prevents manufacturers from unilaterally changing their products\xe2\x80\x99 designs.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F14" name="T14">\n\t\t\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That is true, for example, of the designs (i.e., the chemical composition) of brand-name drugs under the FDCA no less than it is for generic drugs.  See ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the creation of such an automatic conflict is the ultimate end-point of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s continued expansion of impossibility pre-emption, then the result is frankly astonishing.  Congress adopted the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s premarketing approval requirement in 1938 and then strengthened it in 1962 in response to serious public-health episodes involving unsafe drugs.  See Future of Drug Safety 152.  Yet by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s lights, the very act of creating that requirement in order to \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard the consumer,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Sullivan, \n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 689, \n696 (1948)\n, also created by operation of law a shield for drug manufacturers to avoid paying common-law damages under state laws that are also designed to protect consumers.  That is so notwithstanding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to disclaim any intent to pre-empt all state law.  See supra, at 4.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning thus \xe2\x80\x9chas the \xe2\x80\x98perverse effect\xe2\x80\x99 of granting broad immunity \xe2\x80\x98to an entire industry that, in the judgment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Riegel, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 338 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (quoting Lohr, 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487 (plurality opinion)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis expanded notion of impossibility pre-emption threatens to disturb a considerable amount of state law.  The FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s premarket approval process for prescription drugs has provided a model for the regulation of many other products.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F15" name="T15">\n\t\t\t\t\t15\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In some statutes, Congress has paired premarket regulatory review with express pre-emption provisions that limit the application of state common-law remedies, including, in some instances, claims for defective product design.  See, e.g., Riegel, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 323\xe2\x80\x93325; see supra, at 4, and n.\xc2\xa02.  In other instances, such as with prescription drugs, it has not.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, it appears that design-defect claims are categorically displaced either way, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to set the boundaries of pre-emption more precisely were largely academic.  This could have serious consequences for product safety.  State design-defect laws play an important role not only in discovering risks, but also in providing in-centives for manufacturers to\xc2\xa0remove dangerous products from the market promptly.  See Levine, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 578\xe2\x80\x93579; Bates, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 451; see also Conk, Is There a Design Defect in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability? 109 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1087, 1130 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe tort system can encourage FDA regulatory vigor and competence\xe2\x80\x9d).  If manufacturers of products that require preapproval are given de\xc2\xa0facto immunity from design-defect liability, then the public will have to rely exclusively on imperfect federal agencies with limited resources and sometimes limited legal authority to recall approved products.  And consumers injured by those products will have no recourse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe manner in which Congress has addressed pre-emption with respect to vaccines is particularly instructive.  \xe2\x80\x9c[V]accines have been subject to the same federal premarket approval process as prescription drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d and prior to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intervention, \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation for vaccine-related injuries ha[d] been left largely to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1).  In 1986, in response to a rise in tort suits that produced instability in the vaccine market, Congress enacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Vaccine Act), \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1).  The Act established a no-fault compensation program funded through an excise tax on vaccines to compensate individuals injured or killed by vaccine side effects.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe quid pro quo for this\xe2\x80\x9d system, the Court stated in Bruesewitz, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the provision of significant tort-liability protections for vaccine manufacturers.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Members of this Court disagreed on the scope of the tort protections the Vaccine Act was intended to offer, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s history demonstrates that Congress is perfectly capable of responding when it believes state tort law may compromise significant federal objectives under a scheme of premarket regulatory review for products it wants to make available.  And it illustrates that \xe2\x80\x9can important reason to require that preemption decisions be made by Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than by courts on the basis of an expanded implied pre-emption doctrine, is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to tie its pre-emption decisions \xe2\x80\x9cto some alternative means for securing compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Metzger, Federalism and Fed-eral Agency Reform, 111 Colum.

I recognize that, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, common-law duties may qualify as \xe2\x80\x9crequirements,\xe2\x80\x9d at least as that term has been used in express pre-emption provisions in federal law.  See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., \n\xe2\x80\x93324 (2008).  But determining precisely what, if any, specific requirement a state common-law claim imposes is important.  In Bates, the lower court had accepted the same basic argument that the majority advances here: that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 design-defect claim that a pesticide was \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cmerely a disguised claim for failure to warn\xe2\x80\x9d because success on the claim that the pesticide was dangerous to crops in soil above a certain pH level would \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily induce\xe2\x80\x9d a manufacturer to change its product\xe2\x80\x99s label to avoid liability.  Dow Agrosciences LLC v. Bates, 332 F.\xc2\xa03d 323, 332\xe2\x80\x93333 (CA5 2003).  This Court explicitly rejected the notion that because design-defect liability might lead a manufacturer to make a label change, it meant that the State\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect claim imposed a requirement for labeling or packaging.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 445\xe2\x80\x93446.  The majority contends that this case is different because the duty to redesign sulindac\xe2\x80\x99s label was an element of New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s design-defect law.  Ante, at 19.  But it is not.  See supra, at 11.  Rather, altering a product label is merely one step a manufacturer might take to prevent its product from being considered unreasonably dangerous, and it is a step that New Hampshire law recognizes may be insufficient.

In that scenario, the manufacturer would have violated the law, and the fact that the law is enforced through monetary sanctions (rather than through an injunction or imprisonment) would not change that.  Here, no matter how many times the majority insists otherwise, ibid., a manufacturer who sells a drug whose design is found unreasonably dangerous based on a balance of factors has not violated a state law requiring it to change its label.

A company can comply with both either by not doing busi- ness in the relevant State or by paying the state pen- alty, say damages, for failing to comply with, as here, a state-law tort standard.  See post, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  But conflicting state law that requires a company to withdraw from the State or pay a sizable damages remedy in order to avoid the conflict between state and federal law may nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment\xe2\x80\x99 of\xe2\x80\x9d the federal law\xe2\x80\x99s ob- jective, in which case the relevant state law is pre-empted.

Lohr, \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 470, \n503 (1996)\n (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), in deciding whether there is such a conflict I would pay particular attention to the views of the relevant agency, here the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Where the statute contains no clear pre-emption command, courts may infer that the administrative agency has a degree of leeway to determine the extent to which governing statutes, rules, regulations, or other administrative actions have pre-emptive effect.  See id., at 505\xe2\x80\x93506 (citing Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A., \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735\n\xe2\x80\x93741 (1996); Hillsborough County v.

Swift &amp; Co., \n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134, \n140 (1944)\n.  The FDA is responsible for administering the relevant federal statutes.  And the question of pre-emption may call for considerable drug-related expertise.  Indeed, one might infer that, the more medically valuable the drug, the less likely Congress intended to permit a State to drive it from the marketplace.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the agency can develop an informed position on the pre-emption question by providing interested parties with an opportunity to present their views.  It can translate its understandings into particular pre-emptive intentions accompanying its various rules and regulations.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t can communicate those intentions \xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0through statements in \xe2\x80\x98regulations, preambles, interpretive statements, and responses to comments.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Medtronic, supra, at 506 (opinion of Breyer, J.).

For one thing, as far as the briefing reveals, the FDA, in developing its views, has held no hearings on the matter or solicited the opinions, arguments, and views of the public in other ways.  For another thing, the FDA has set forth its positions only in briefs filed in litigation, not in regulations, interpretations, or similar agency work product.  See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204\n\xe2\x80\x93213 (1988) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]gency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations, rulings, or administrative practice\xe2\x80\x9d are entitled to less than ordinary weight).  Cf. Christensen v. Harris County, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 576, \n587 (2000)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the FDA has set forth conflicting views on this general matter in different briefs filed at different times.  Compare Wyeth, supra, at 577, 579, 580, n. 13 (noting that the FDA had previously found no pre-emption, that the United States now argued for pre-emption, and that this new position was not entitled to deference), with PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa03, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa03, 8\xe2\x80\x9311) (declining to defer to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 argument against pre-emption and, instead, finding pre-emption), and with Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (now arguing, again, for pre-emption).  See National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 967, \n981 (2005)\n (agency views that vary over time are accorded less weight); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29\n\xe2\x80\x9342 (1983) (same); Verizon Communications Inc. v.

As two former FDA Commissioners tell us, the FDA has long believed that state tort litigation can \xe2\x80\x9csupplemen[t] the agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory and enforcement activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Donald Ken- nedy et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 5.  See also Wyeth, supra, at 578 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn keeping with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to pre-empt common-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, unlike the federal statute at issue in Medtronic, the statute before us contains no general pre-emption clause.  See 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 481\xe2\x80\x93482.  Cf. Wyeth, supra, at 574 (presence of pre-emption clause could show that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, I have found no con- vincing reason to believe that removing this particular drug from New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s market, or requiring damage payments for it there, would be so harmful that it would seriously undercut the purposes of the federal statutory scheme.
