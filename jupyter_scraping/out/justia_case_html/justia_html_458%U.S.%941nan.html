The challenge presents three questions under the Commerce Clause: [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  (1) whether groundwater is an article of commerce and therefore subject to congressional regulation; (2) whether the Nebraska restriction on the interstate transfer of groundwater imposes an impermissible burden on commerce; and (3) whether Congress has granted the States permission to engage in groundwater regulation that otherwise would be impermissible. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="944">Page 458 U. S. 944</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellants jointly own contiguous tracts of land in Chase County, Nebraska, and Phillips County, Colorado.  A well physically located on the Nebraska tract pumps groundwater for irrigation of both the Nebraska tract and the Colorado tract.  Previous owners of the land registered the well with the State of Nebraska in 1971, but neither they nor the present owners applied for the permit required by Neb.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 (1978).  That section provides:</p>\n<p>"Any person, firm, city, village, municipal corporation or any other entity intending to withdraw groundwater from any well or pit located in the State of Nebraska and transport it for use in an adjoining state shall apply to the Department of Water Resources for a permit to do so.  If the Director of Water Resources finds that the withdrawal of the groundwater requested is reasonable, is not contrary to the conservation and use of groundwater, and is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, he shall grant the permit if the state in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport groundwater from that state for use in the State of Nebraska."</p>\n<p>Appellee brought this action to enjoin appellants from transferring the water across the border without a permit. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The trial court rejected the defense that the statute imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce and granted the injunction.  The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.  208 Neb. 703, 305 N.W.2d 614 (1981).  It held that, under Nebraska law, groundwater is not "a market item freely transferable for value among private parties, and therefore [is] not an article of commerce."  <em>Id.</em> at 705, 305 N.W.2d at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="945">Page 458 U. S. 945</a></p><p> 616. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Chief Justice, while agreeing that the statutory criteria governing the transfer of water to an adjoining State did not violate the Commerce Clause, dissented on the narrow ground that appellee violated both the Federal and Nebraska Constitutions by attempting</p>\n<p>"to absolutely prohibit the transfer of water, without regard to its need or availability, based solely upon the acts of another state over which citizens of this state have no control."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 713, 305 N.W.2d at 20.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In holding that groundwater is not an article of commerce, the Nebraska Supreme Court and appellee cite as controlling precedent <em>Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/349/case.html">209 U. S. 349</a></span> (1908).  In that case, a New Jersey statute prohibited the interstate transfer of any surface water located within the State. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Hudson County Water Co. nevertheless contracted with New York City to supply one of its boroughs with water from the Passaic River in New Jersey.  The State Attorney General sought from the New Jersey courts an injunction against fulfillment of the contract.  Over the water company\'s objections that the statute impaired the obligation of contract, took property without just compensation, interfered with interstate commerce, denied New York citizens the privileges afforded New Jersey citizens, and denied New York citizens the equal protection of the laws, the injunction was granted.  This Court, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, affirmed. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="946">Page 458 U. S. 946</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Most of the Court\'s opinion addresses the just compensation claim.  Justice Holmes refused to ground the Court\'s holding, as did the New Jersey state courts, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] on "the more or less attenuated residuum of title that the State may be said to possess."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/349/case.html#355">209 U. S. 355</a></span>.  For the statute was justified as a regulatory measure that, on balance, did not amount to a taking of property that required just compensation.  Putting aside the "problems of irrigation," the State\'s interest in preserving its waters was well within its police power. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  That interest was not dependent on any demonstration that the State\'s water resources were inadequate for present or future use.  The State "finds itself in possession of what all admit to be a great public good, and what it has it may keep and give no one a reason for its will."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/349/case.html#357">209 U.

S. 947</a></p><p> In one paragraph, he rejected the Contract Clause claim.  In the remaining paragraph of the opinion, he rejected all the other defenses.  His treatment of the Commerce Clause challenge consists of three sentences:</p>\n<p>"A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States.  Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end.  The case is covered in this respect by <em>Geer v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/161/519/case.html">161 U. S. 519</a></span> [(1896)]."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>While appellee relies upon Hudson County, appellants rest on our summary affirmance of a three-judge District Court judgment in <em>City of Altus v. Carr,</em> 255 F.Supp. 828 (WD Tex.), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/35/case.html">385 U. S. 35</a></span> (1966).  The city of Altus is located near the southern border of Oklahoma.  Large population increases rendered inadequate its source of municipal water.  It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the groundwater underlying that land and to transport it across the border.  The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of groundwater without the approval of that body. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>The city relied upon <em>West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/229/case.html">221 U. S. 229</a></span> (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and <em>Pennsylvania v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/553/case.html">262 U. S. 553</a></span> (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="948">Page 458 U. S. 948</a></p><p> that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The Texas Attorney General defended the statute on two grounds.  First, he asserted that its purpose was to conserve and protect the State\'s water resources by regulating the withdrawal of groundwater.  The District Court rejected that defense because similar conservation claims had met defeat in <em>West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., supra,</em> and <em>Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra.</em> [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Second, the State argued that the statute regulated groundwater, and that groundwater is not an article of commerce, citing <em>Geer v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html">161 U. S. 519</a></span> (1896), and <em>Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/349/case.html">209 U. S. 349</a></span> (1908).  The court rejected this argument, since the statute directly regulated the interstate transportation of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="949">Page 458 U. S. 949</a></p><p> water that had been pumped from the ground, and, under Texas law, such water was an article of commerce.  The court then had little difficulty in concluding that the statute imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>In summarily affirming the District Court in <em>City of Altus,</em> we did not necessarily adopt the court\'s reasoning.  Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court.  <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/490/case.html">453 U. S. 490</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/490/case.html#499">453 U. S. 499</a></span> (1981).  That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court\'s holding in this case.  For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to groundwater that he has withdrawn.  According to the District Court in <em>City of Altus,</em> the</p>\n<p>"rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property."</p>\n<p>255 F.Supp. at 833, n. 8.  Since groundwater, once withdrawn, may be freely bought and sold in States that follow this rule, in those States, groundwater is appropriately regarded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="950">Page 458 U. S. 950</a></p><p> as an article of commerce.  In Nebraska, the surface owner has no comparable interest in groundwater.  As explained by the Nebraska Supreme Court,</p>\n<p>"\'the owner of land is entitled to appropriate subterranean waters found under his land, but he cannot extract and appropriate them in excess of a reasonable and beneficial use upon the land which he owns, especially if such use is injurious to others who have substantial rights to the waters, and if the natural underground supply is insufficient for all owners, each is entitled to a reasonable proportion of the whole.\'"</p>\n<p>208 Neb. at 705, 305 N.W.2d at 617 (quoting <em>Olson v. City of Wahoo,</em> 124 Neb. 802, 811, 248 N.W. 304, 308 (1933)).</p>\n<p><em>City of Altus,</em> however, is inconsistent with <em>Hudson County.</em>  For in the latter case, the Court found <em>Geer v. Connecticut, supra,</em> to be controlling on the Commerce Clause issue.  <em>Geer,</em> which sustained a Connecticut ban on the interstate transportation of game birds captured in that State, was premised on the theory that the State owned its wild animals, and therefore was free to qualify any ownership interest it might recognize in the persons who capture them.  One such restriction is a prohibition against interstate transfer of the captured animals.  This theory of public ownership was advanced as a defense in <em>City of Altus.</em>  The State argued that it owned all subterranean water, and therefore could recognize ownership in the surface owner who withdraws the water, but restrict that ownership to use of the water within the State.  That theory, upon which the Commerce Clause issue in <em>Hudson County</em> was decided, was rejected by the District Court in <em>City of Altus.</em> [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In expressly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="951">Page 458 U. S. 951</a></p><p> overruling <em>Geer</em> three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory and definitively recast it as</p>\n<p>"\'but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U.

In <em>Hughes,</em> the Court found the State\'s interests insufficient to sustain a ban on the interstate transfer of natural minnows seined from waters within the State.</p>\n<p>Appellee insists, however, that Nebraska water is distinguishable from other natural resources.  The surface owner who withdraws Nebraska groundwater enjoys a lesser ownership interest in the water than the captor of game birds in Connecticut or minnows in Oklahoma or groundwater in Texas, for in <em>Geer, Hughes,</em> and <em>City of Altus,</em> the States permitted intrastate trade in the natural resources once they were captured.  Although appellee\'s greater ownership interest may not be irrelevant to Commerce Clause analysis, it does not absolutely remove Nebraska groundwater from such scrutiny.  For appellee\'s argument is still based on the legal fiction of state ownership.  The fiction is illustrated by municipal water supply arrangements pursuant to which groundwater is withdrawn from rural areas and transferred to urban areas.  Such arrangements are permitted in Nebraska, <em>see Metropolitan Utilities District v. Merritt Beach Co.,</em> 179 Neb. 783, 140 N.W.2d 626 (1966), but the Nebraska Supreme Court distinguished them on the ground that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="952">Page 458 U. S. 952</a></p><p> transferor was only permitted to charge as a price for the water his costs of distribution and not the value of the water itself.  208 Neb. at 708, 305 N.W.2d at 618.  Unless demand is greater than supply, however, this reasoning does not distinguish minnows, the price of which presumably is derived from the costs of seining and of transporting the catch to market.  Even in cases of shortage, in which the seller of the natural resource can demand a price that exceeds his costs, the State\'s rate structure that requires the price to be cost-justified is economically comparable to price regulation.  A State\'s power to regulate prices or rates has never been thought to depend on public ownership of the controlled commodity.  It would be anomalous if federal power to regulate economic transactions in natural resources depended on the characterization of the payment as compensation for distribution services, on the one hand, or as the price of goods, on the other.  <em>Cf. In re Rahrer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/140/545/case.html">140 U. S. 545</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/140/545/case.html#558">140 U. S. 558</a></span> (1891).</p>\n<p>The second asserted distinction is that water, unlike other natural resources, is essential for human survival.  Appellee, and the <em>amici curiae</em> that are vitally interested in conserving and preserving scarce water resources in the arid Western States, have convincingly demonstrated the desirability of state and local management of groundwater.

Although water is indeed essential for human survival, studies indicate that over 80% of our water supplies is used for agricultural purposes. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The agricultural markets supplied by irrigated farms are worldwide.  They provide the archtypical example of commerce among the several States for which the Framers of our Constitution intended to authorize federal regulation.  The multistate character of the Ogallala aquifer -- underlying appellants\' tracts of land in Colorado and Nebraska, as well as parts of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] -- confirms the view that there is a significant federal interest in conservation, as well as in fair allocation, of this diminishing resource. <em>Cf. Arizona v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/546/case.html">373 U. S. 546</a></span> (1963).</p>\n<p>The Western States\' interests, and their asserted superior competence, in conserving and preserving scarce water resources are not irrelevant in the Commerce Clause inquiry.  Nor is appellee\'s claim to public ownership without significance.  Like Congress\' deference to state water law, <em>see infra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/941/case.html#958">458 U. S. 958</a></span>-960, these factors inform the determination whether the burdens on commerce imposed by state groundwater regulation are reasonable or unreasonable.  But appellee\'s claim that Nebraska groundwater is not an article of commerce goes too far:  it would not only exempt Nebraska groundwater regulation from burden-on-commerce analysis, it would also curtail the affirmative power of Congress to implement its own policies concerning such regulation.  <em>See Philadelphia v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U.

If Congress chooses to legislate in this area under its commerce power, its regulation need not be more limited in Nebraska than in Texas and States with similar property laws.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="954">Page 458 U.

For the existence of unexercised federal regulatory power does not foreclose state regulation of its water resources, of the uses of water within the State, or indeed, of interstate commerce in water.  <em>Southern Pacific Co. v.

Determining the validity of state statutes affecting interstate commerce requires a more careful inquiry:</p>\n<p>"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.  If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will, of course, depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities."</p>\n<p><em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html">397 U.

S. 142</a></span> (1970) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The only purpose that appellee advances for \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 is to conserve and preserve diminishing sources of groundwater.  The purpose is unquestionably legitimate and highly important, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and the other aspects of Nebraska\'s groundwater </p><p><a class="page-number" name="955">Page 458 U. S. 955</a></p><p> regulation demonstrate that it is genuine.  Appellants\' land in Nebraska is located within the boundaries of the Upper Republican Ground Water Control Area, which was designated as such by the Director of the Nebraska Department of Water Resources based upon a determination that there is "[a]n inadequate groundwater supply to meet present or reasonably foreseeable needs for beneficial use of such water supply."  Neb.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 46-658(1) (Supp.1981); <em>see</em> App. 56-60.  Pursuant to \xc2\xa7 46-666(1), the Upper Republican Natural Resources District has promulgated special rules and regulations governing groundwater withdrawal and use.  <em>See</em> App. 61-82.  The rules and regulations define as "critical" those townships in the control area in which the annual decline of the groundwater table exceeds a fixed percentage; appellants\' Nebraska tract is located within a critical township.  The rules and regulations require the installation of flow meters on every well within the control area, specify the amount of water per acre that may be used for irrigation, and set the spacing that is required between wells.  They also strictly limit the intrastate transfer of groundwater:  transfers are only permitted between lands controlled by the same groundwater user, and all transfers must be approved by the District Board of Directors.  <em>Id.</em> at 68-69.</p>\n<p>The State\'s interest in conservation and preservation of groundwater is advanced by the first three conditions in \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 for the withdrawal of water for an interstate transfer.  Those requirements are</p>\n<p>"that the withdrawal of the groundwater requested is reasonable, is not contrary to the conservation and use of groundwater, and is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare."</p>\n<p>Although Commerce Clause concerns are implicated by the fact that \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 applies to interstate transfers but not to intrastate transfers, there are legitimate reasons for the special treatment accorded requests to transport groundwater across state lines.  Obviously, a State that imposes severe </p><p><a class="page-number" name="956">Page 458 U. S. 956</a></p><p> withdrawal and use restrictions on its own citizens is not discriminating against interstate commerce when it seeks to prevent the uncontrolled transfer of water out of the State.  An exemption for interstate transfers would be inconsistent with the ideal of evenhandedness in regulation.  At least in the area in which appellants\' Nebraska tract is located, the first three standards of \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 may well be no more strict in application than the limitations upon intrastate transfers imposed by the Upper Republican Natural Resources District.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in the absence of a contrary view expressed by Congress, we are reluctant to condemn, as unreasonable, measures taken by a State to conserve and preserve for its own citizens this vital resource in times of severe shortage.  Our reluctance stems from the "confluence of [several] realities."  <em>Hicklin v. Orbeck,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/518/case.html">437 U. S. 518</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/518/case.html#534">437 U. S. 534</a></span> (1978).  First, a State\'s power to regulate the use of water in times and places of shortage for the purpose of protecting the health of its citizens -- and not simply the health of its economy -- is at the core of its police power.  For Commerce Clause purposes, we have long recognized a difference between economic protectionism, on the one hand, and health and safety regulation, on the other.  <em>See H. P. Hood &amp; Sons v. Du Mond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/525/case.html">336 U. S. 525</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/525/case.html#533">336 U. S. 533</a></span> (1949).  Second, the legal expectation that, under certain circumstances, each State may restrict water within its borders has been fostered over the years not only by our equitable apportionment decrees, <em>see, e.g., Wyoming v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/953/case.html">353 U. S. 953</a></span> (1957), but also by the negotiation and enforcement of interstate compacts.  Our law therefore has recognized the relevance of state boundaries in the allocation of scarce water resources.  Third, although appellee\'s claim to public ownership of Nebraska groundwater cannot justify a total denial of federal regulatory power, it may support a limited preference for its own citizens in the utilization of the resource.  <em>See Hicklin v. Orbeck, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/518/case.html#533">437 U. S. 533</a></span>-534.  In this regard, it is relevant that appellee\'s claim is logically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="957">Page 458 U. S. 957</a></p><p> more substantial than claims to public ownership of other natural resources.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/941/case.html#950">458 U. S. 950</a></span>-951.  Finally, given appellee\'s conservation efforts, the continuing availability of groundwater in Nebraska is not simply happenstance; the natural resource has some indicia of a good publicly produced and owned in which a State may favor its own citizens in times of shortage.  <em>See Reeves, Inc. v. Stake,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html">447 U. S. 429</a></span> (1980); <em>cf. Philadelphia v. New Jersey,</em> 437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html#627">437 U. S. 627</a></span>-628, and n. 6; <em>Baldwin v. Montana Fish and Game Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/371/case.html">436 U. S. 371</a></span> (1978).  A facial examination of the first three conditions set forth in \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 does not, therefore, indicate that they impermissibly burden interstate commerce.  Appellants, indeed, seem to concede their reasonableness.</p>\n<p>Appellants, however, do challenge the requirement that</p>\n<p>"the state in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport groundwater from that state for use in the State of Nebraska"</p>\n<p>-- the reciprocity provision that troubled the Chief Justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court.  Because Colorado forbids the exportation of its groundwater, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] the reciprocity provision operates as an explicit barrier to commerce between the two States.  The State therefore bears the initial burden of demonstrating a close fit between the reciprocity requirement and its asserted local purpose.  <em>Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html#336">441 U. S. 336</a></span>; <em>Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html">340 U. S. 349</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#354">340 U. S. 354</a></span> (1951).</p>\n<p>The reciprocity requirement fails to clear this initial hurdle.  For there is no evidence that this restriction is narrowly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="958">Page 458 U. S. 958</a></p><p> tailored to the conservation and preservation rationale.  Even though the supply of water in a particular well may be abundant, or perhaps even excessive, and even though the most beneficial use of that water might be in another State, such water may not be shipped into a neighboring State that does not permit its water to be used in Nebraska.  If it could be shown that the State as a whole suffers a water shortage, that the intrastate transportation of water from areas of abundance to areas of shortage is feasible regardless of distance, and that the importation of water from adjoining States would roughly compensate for any exportation to those States, then the conservation and preservation purpose might be credibly advanced for the reciprocity provision.  A demonstrably arid State conceivably might be able to marshal evidence to establish a close means-end relationship between even a total ban on the exportation of water and a purpose to conserve and preserve water.  Appellee, however, does not claim that such evidence exists.  We therefore are not persuaded that the reciprocity requirement -- when superimposed on the first three restrictions in the statute -- significantly advances the State\'s legitimate conservation and preservation interest; it surely is not narrowly tailored to serve that purpose.  The reciprocity requirement does not survive the "strictest scrutiny" reserved for facially discriminatory legislation.  <em>Hughes v. Oklahoma, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html#337">441 U. S. 337</a></span>. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellee\'s suggestion that Congress has authorized the States to impose otherwise impermissible burdens on interstate commerce in groundwater is not well founded.  The suggestion is based on 37 statutes in which Congress has deferred to state water law, and on a number of interstate compacts dealing with water that have been approved by Congress. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="959">Page 458 U. S. 959</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Abstracts of the relevant sections of the 37 statutes relied upon by appellee were submitted in connection with the Hearings on S. 1275 before the Subcommittee on Irrigation and Reclamation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 302-310 (1964).  Appellee refers the Court to that submission, but only discusses \xc2\xa7 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 390.  That section, it turns out, is typical of the other 36 statutes.  It contains two parts.  The first provides that</p>\n<p>"nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting or intended to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any State or Territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation."</p>\n<p>Such language defines the extent of the federal legislation\'s preemptive effect on state law.  <em>New England Power Co. v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/331/case.html">455 U. S. 331</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/331/case.html#341">455 U. S. 341</a></span> (1982); <em>Lewis v.

The second part provides that "the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out the provisions of this Act, shall proceed in conformity with such laws."  Such language mandates that questions of water rights that arise in relation to a federal project are to be determined in accordance with state law.  <em>See California v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/case.html">438 U. S. 645</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>The interstate compacts to which appellee refers are agreements among States regarding rights to surface water.  <em>See</em> The Council of State Governments, Interstate Compacts and Agencies 25-29, 31-32 (1979).  Appellee emphasizes a compact between Nebraska and Colorado involving water rights to the South Platte River, <em>see</em> 44 Stat. (part 2) 195, and a compact among Nebraska, Colorado, and Kansas involving water rights to the Republican River, <em>see</em> 57 Stat. 86.</p>\n<p>Although the 37 statutes and the interstate compacts demonstrate Congress\' deference to state water law, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] they do not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="960">Page 458 U. S. 960</a></p><p> indicate that Congress wished to remove federal constitutional constraints on such state laws.  The negative implications of the Commerce Clause, like the mandates of the Fourteenth Amendment, are ingredients of the valid state law to which Congress has deferred.  Neither the fact that Congress has chosen not to create a federal water law to govern water rights involved in federal projects, nor the fact that Congress has been willing to let the States settle their differences over water rights through mutual agreement, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] constitutes persuasive evidence that Congress consented to the unilateral imposition of unreasonable burdens on commerce.

Obviously, the statute had little relation to the cause of conservation."</p>\n<p>255 F.Supp. at 839-840.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>"This statute, however, seeks to prohibit the production of underground water for the purpose of transporting same in interstate commerce, and has the effect of prohibiting the interstate transportation of such water after it has become personal property.  Whether a statute, by its phraseology, prohibits the interstate transportation of an article of commerce after it has become the personal property of someone as in the Pennsylvania and West cases, or prohibits the withdrawal of such substance where the intent is to transport such in interstate commerce, the result upon interstate commerce is the same.  In both situations, the purpose and intent of the statute and the end result thereof is to prohibit the interstate transportation of an article of commerce."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 840.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>California v.

But instead of confining its opinion to this question, the Court first quite gratuitously undertakes to answer the question of whether the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, conferred by the same provision of the Constitution, would enable it to legislate with respect to groundwater overdraft in some or all of the States.</p>\n<p>That these two questions are quite distinct leaves no room for doubt.  Congress may regulate not only the stream of commerce itself, but also activities which affect interstate commerce, including wholly intrastate activities.  <em>See, e.g., Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/517/case.html">316 U. S. 517</a></span> (1942); <em>United States v. Darby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/case.html">312 U. S. 100</a></span> (1941); <em>Houston &amp; Texas R. Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/342/case.html">234 U. S. 342</a></span> (1914).  The activity upon which the regulatory effect of the congressional statute falls in many of these cases does not directly involve articles of commerce at all.  For example, in <em>Kirschbaum,</em> the employees were engaged in the operation and maintenance of a loft building in which large quantities of goods for interstate commerce were produced; no one contended that these employees themselves, or the work which they actually performed, dealt with articles of commerce.  Nonetheless, the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act were applied to them because Congress extended the terms of the Act not only to those who were "engaged in commerce" but also to those who were engaged "in the production of goods for commerce."  316 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/517/case.html#522">316 U. S. 522</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Thus, the authority of Congress under the power to regulate interstate commerce may reach a good deal further than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="962">Page 458 U. S. 962</a></p><p> the mere negative impact of the Commerce Clause in the absence of any action by Congress.  Upon a showing that groundwater overdraft has a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, for example, Congress arguably could regulate groundwater overdraft, even if groundwater is not an "article of commerce" itself.  <em>See, e.g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html">452 U. S. 264</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#281">452 U. S. 281</a></span>-283 (1981); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#310">452 U. S. 310</a></span>-313 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Wickard v. Filburn,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/case.html">317 U. S. 111</a></span> (1942).  It is therefore wholly unnecessary to decide whether Congress could regulate groundwater overdraft in order to decide this case; since Congress has not undertaken such a regulation, I would leave the determination of its validity until such time as it is necessary to decide that question.</p>\n<p>The question actually involved in this case is whether Neb.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 46-613.01 (1978) runs afoul of the unexercised authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.  While the Court apparently agrees that our equitable apportionment decrees in cases such as <em>Wyoming v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/953/case.html">353 U. S. 953</a></span> (1957), and the execution and approval of interstate compacts apportioning water have given rise to "the legal expectation that, under certain circumstances, each State may restrict water within its borders," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/941/case.html#956">458 U. S. 956</a></span>, it insists on an elaborate balancing process in which the State\'s "interest" is weighed under traditional Commerce Clause analysis.</p>\n<p>I think that, in more than one of our cases in which a State has invoked our original jurisdiction, the unsoundness of the Court\'s approach is manifest.  For example, in <em>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/230/case.html">206 U. S. 230</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/230/case.html#237">206 U. S. 237</a></span> (1907), the Court said:</p>\n<p>"This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of <em>quasi</em>-sovereign.  In that capacity, the State has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.  It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="963">Page 458 U. S. 963</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Five years earlier, in <em>Kansas v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/185/125/case.html">185 U. S. 125</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/185/125/case.html#142">185 U. S. 142</a></span>, 145-146 (1902), the Court had made clear that a State\'s quasi-sovereign interest in the flow of surface and subterranean water within its borders was of the same magnitude as its interest in pure air or healthy forests.</p>\n<p>In my view, these cases appropriately recognize the traditional authority of a State over resources within its boundaries which are essential not only to the wellbeing, but often to the very lives, of its citizens.  In the exercise of this authority, a State may so regulate a natural resource as to preclude that resource from attaining the status of an "article of commerce" for the purposes of the negative impact of the Commerce Clause.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that "commerce" exists in an item that cannot be reduced to possession under state law and in which the State recognizes only a usufructuary right.  "Commerce" cannot exist in a natural resource that cannot be sold, rented, traded, or transferred, but only used.</p>\n<p>Of course, a State may not discriminate against interstate commerce when it regulates even such a resource.  If the State allows indiscriminate intrastate commercial dealings in a particular resource, it may have a difficult task proving that an outright prohibition on interstate commercial dealings is not such a discrimination.  I had thought that this was the basis for this Court\'s decisions in <em>Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a></span> (1979), <em>Pennsylvania v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/553/case.html">262 U. S. 553</a></span> (1923), and <em>West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/229/case.html">221 U. S. 229</a></span> (1911).  In each case, the State permitted a natural resource to be reduced to private possession, permitted an intrastate market to exist in that resource, and either barred interstate commerce entirely or granted its residents a commercial preference. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="964">Page 458 U. S. 964</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By contrast, Nebraska so regulates groundwater that it cannot be said that the State permits any "commerce," intrastate or interstate, to exist in this natural resource.  As with almost all of the Western States, Nebraska does not recognize an absolute ownership interest in groundwater, but grants landowners only a right to <em>use groundwater on the land from which it has been extracted.</em>  Moreover, the landowner\'s right to use groundwater is limited.  Nebraska landowners may not extract groundwater</p>\n<p>"in excess of a reasonable and beneficial use upon the land in which he owns, especially if such use is injurious to others who have substantial rights to the waters, and if the natural underground supply is insufficient for all owners, each is entitled to a reasonable proportion of the whole."</p>\n<p><em>Olson v. City of Wahoo,</em> 124 Neb. 802, 811, 248 N.W. 304, 308 (1933).  With the exception of municipal water systems, Nebraska forbids any transportation of groundwater off the land owned or controlled by the person who has appropriated the water from its subterranean source.  208 Neb. 703, 710, 305 N.W.2d 614, 619 (1981).  <em>See</em> App. 68-69.</p>\n<p>Nebraska places additional restrictions on groundwater users within certain areas, such as the portion of appellants\' land situated in Nebraska, where the shortage of groundwater is determined to be critical.  Water users in appellants\' district are permitted only to irrigate the acreage irrigated in 1977, or the average number of acres irrigated between 1972 and 1976, whichever is greater, and must obtain permission from the water district\'s board before any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="965">Page 458 U. S. 965</a></p><p> additional acreage may be placed under irrigation.  The amount of groundwater that may be extracted is strictly limited on an acre-inch-per-irrigated-acre basis.  There are also detailed regulations as to the spacing of wells and the use and operation of flow meters.  <em>Id.</em> at 71-82.</p>\n<p>Since Nebraska recognizes only a limited right to use groundwater on land owned by the appropriator, it cannot be said that "commerce" in groundwater exists as far as Nebraska is concerned.  Therefore, it cannot be said that Neb.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 46 613.01 (1978) either discriminates against, or "burdens," interstate commerce.  Section 46 613.01 is simply a regulation of the landowner\'s <em>right to use</em> groundwater extracted from lands he owns within Nebraska. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Unlike the Court, I cannot agree that Nebraska\'s limitation upon a landowner\'s right to extract water from his land situated in Nebraska <em>for his own use</em> on land he owns in an adjoining State runs afoul of Congress\' unexercised authority to regulate interstate commerce. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <em>City of Altus v.

S. 35</a></span> (1966), Texas placed no restrictions upon the use or the intrastate sale of groundwater.  The</p>\n<p>"rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property."</p>\n<p>255 F.Supp. at 833, n. 8.  Texas\' absolute ownership rule is an anomaly among the Western States.  <em>See</em> 5 R. Clark, Waters and Water Rights \xc2\xa7 441 (1972 and 1978 Supp.).  In Nebraska, as in most of the Western States, groundwater is not treated as "any other species of property. "</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Unlike several other Western States, Nebraska does not entirely forbid groundwater extracted in Nebraska to be used in other States.  <em>See</em> Brief for City of El Paso as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2, n. 3.  As noted by the Court, Nebraska merely places conditions on such a use of the State\'s groundwater.  A permit must be obtained from the Nebraska Department of Water Resources.  If the requested withdrawal of groundwater is determined to be "reasonable, . . . not contrary to the conservation and use of groundwater, and . . . not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare," a permit will be issued so long as the</p>\n<p>"state in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport groundwater from that state for use in the State of Nebraska."</p>\n<p>Neb.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 46 613.01 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court today invalidates only the reciprocity provision in \xc2\xa7 46 613.01.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/941/case.html#957">458 U.

I see nothing in the Court\'s opinion that would preclude the Nebraska Department of Water Resources from prohibiting appellants from transporting groundwater into the Colorado portion of their land until they obtain the permit required by the statute.  I also see nothing in the Court\'s opinion that would preclude the Department of Water Resources from denying appellants a permit because of a failure to satisfy the remaining conditions in the statute.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
