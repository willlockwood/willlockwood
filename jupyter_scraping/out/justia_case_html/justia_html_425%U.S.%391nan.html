S. 430</a></span>, filed opinions concurring in the judgment.  STEVENS, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the cases.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In these two cases, we are called upon to decide whether a summons directing an attorney to produce documents delivered to him by his client in connection with the attorney-client relationship is enforceable over claims that the documents were constitutionally immune from summons in the hands of the client and retained that immunity in the hands of the attorney.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In each case, an Internal Revenue agent visited the taxpayer or taxpayers [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and interviewed them in connection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 425 U. S. 394</a></p><p> with an investigation of possible civil or criminal liability under the federal income tax laws.  Shortly after the interviews -- one day later in No. 74-611 and a week or two later in No. 74-18 -- the taxpayers obtained from their respective accountants certain documents relating to the preparation by the accountants of their tax returns.  Shortly after obtaining the documents -- later the same day in No. 74-611 and a few weeks later in No. 74-18 -- the taxpayers transferred the documents to their lawyers -- respondent Kasmir and petitioner Fisher, respectively -- each of whom was retained to assist the taxpayer in connection with the investigation.  Upon learning of the whereabouts of the documents, the Internal Revenue Service served summonses on the attorneys directing them to produce documents listed therein.  In No. 74-611, the documents were described as "the following records of Tannebaum Bindler &amp; Lewis [the accounting firm]."</p>\n<p>"1. Accountant\'s work papers pertaining to Dr. E. J. Mason\'s books and records of 1969, 1970 and 1971. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>"2. Retained copies of E. J. Mason\'s income tax returns for 1969, 1970 and 1971."</p>\n<p>"3. Retained copies of reports and other correspondence between Tannebaum Bindler &amp; Lewis and Dr. E. J. Mason during 1969, 1970 and 1971."</p>\n<p>In No. 74-18, the documents demanded were analyses by the accountant of the taxpayers\' income and expenses which had been copied by the accountant from the taxpayers\' canceled checks and deposit receipts. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In No. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 425 U. S. 395</a></p><p> 74-611, a summons was also served on the accountant directing him to appear and testify concerning the documents to be produced by the lawyer.  In each case, the lawyer declined to comply with the summons directing production of the documents, and enforcement actions were commenced by the Government under 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7402(b) and 7604(a).  In No. 74-611, the attorney raised in defense of the enforcement action the taxpayer\'s accountant-client privilege, his attorney-client privilege, and his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.  In No. 74-18, the attorney claimed that enforcement would involve compulsory self-incrimination of the taxpayers in violation of their Fifth Amendment privilege, would involve a seizure of the papers without necessary compliance with the Fourth Amendment, and would violate the taxpayers\' right to communicate in confidence with their attorney.  In No. 74-18 the taxpayers intervened and made similar claims.</p>\n<p>In each case, the summons was ordered enforced by the District Court and its order was stayed pending appeal.  In No. 74-18, 500 F.2d 683 (CA3 1974), petitioners\' appeal raised, in terms, only their Fifth Amendment claim, but they argued in connection with that claim that enforcement of the summons would involve a violation of the taxpayers\' reasonable expectation of privacy and particularly so in light of the confidential relationship of attorney to client.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, after reargument en banc, affirmed the enforcement order, holding that the taxpayers had never acquired a possessory interest in the documents, and that the papers were not immune in the hands of the attorney.  In No. 74-611, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the enforcement order, 499 F.2d 444 (1974).  The court reasoned that, by virtue of the Fifth Amendment, the documents would have been privileged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 425 U. S. 396</a></p><p> from production pursuant to summons directed to the taxpayer had he retained possession and, in light of the confidential nature of the attorney-client relationship, the taxpayer retained, after the transfer to his attorney,</p>\n<p>"a legitimate expectation of privacy with regard to the materials he placed in his attorney\'s custody, that he retained constructive possession of the evidence, and thus . . . retained Fifth Amendment protection. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 453.  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict created.  420 U.S. 906 (1975).  Because, in our view, the documents were not privileged either in the hands of the lawyers or of their clients, we affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit in No. 74-18 and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit in No. 74-611.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>All of the parties in these cases and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit have concurred in the proposition that, if the Fifth Amendment would have excused a taxpayer from turning over the accountant\'s papers had he possessed them, the attorney to whom they are delivered for the purpose of obtaining legal advice should also be immune from subpoena.  Although we agree with this proposition for the reasons set forth in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#402">425 U. S. </a></span> <em>infra</em> we are convinced that, under our decision in <em>Couch v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html">409 U. S. 322</a></span> (1973), it is not the taxpayer\'s Fifth Amendment privilege that would excuse the attorney from production.</p>\n<p>The relevant part of that Amendment provides:</p>\n<p>"No person . . . shall be <em>compelled</em> in any criminal case to be a <em>witness against himself.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 425 U. S. 397</a></p><p> The taxpayer\'s privilege under this Amendment is not violated by enforcement of the summonses involved in these cases because enforcement against a taxpayer\'s lawyer would not "compel" the taxpayer to do anything -- and certainly would not compel him to be a "witness" against himself.  The Court has held repeatedly that the Fifth Amendment is limited to prohibiting the use of "physical or moral compulsion" exerted on the person asserting the privilege, <em>Perlman v.

United States, supra,</em> we recently ruled that the Fifth Amendment rights of a taxpayer were not violated by the enforcement of a documentary summons directed to her accountant and requiring production of the taxpayer\'s own records in the possession of the accountant.  We did so on the ground that, in such a case, "the ingredient of personal compulsion against an accused is lacking."  409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#329">409 U. S. 329</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Here, the taxpayers are compelled to do no more than was the taxpayer in <em>Couch.</em>  The taxpayers\' Fifth Amendment privilege is therefore not violated by enforcement of the summonses directed toward their attorneys.  This is true whether or not the Amendment would have barred a subpoena directing the taxpayer to produce the documents while they were in his hands.</p>\n<p>The fact that the attorneys are agents of the taxpayers does not change this result.  <em>Couch</em> held as much, since the accountant there was also the taxpayer\'s agent, and, in this respect, reflected a longstanding view.  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 425 U. S. 398</a></p><p> <em>Hale v. Henkel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/201/43/case.html">201 U.

S. 69</a></span>-70 (1906), the Court said that the privilege</p>\n<p>"was never intended to permit [a person] to plead the fact that some third person might be incriminated by his testimony, even though he were the agent of such person. . . .  [T]he Amendment is limited to a person who shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against <em>himself.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis in original.)  "It is extortion of information from the accused himself that offends our sense of justice."  <em>Couch v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#328">409 U. S. 328</a></span>.  Agent or no, the lawyer is not the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is the "accused," and nothing is being extorted from him.</p>\n<p>Nor is this one of those situations, which <em>Couch</em> suggested might exist, where constructive possession is so clear or relinquishment of possession so temporary and insignificant as to leave the personal compulsion upon the taxpayer substantially intact.  409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#333">409 U. S. 333</a></span>.  In this respect, we see no difference between the delivery to the attorneys in these cases and delivery to the accountant in the <em>Couch</em> case.  As was true in <em>Couch,</em> the documents sought were obtainable without personal compulsion on the accused.</p>\n<p>Respondents in No. 74-611 and petitioners in No. 74-18 argue, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit apparently agreed, that, if the summons was enforced, the taxpayers\' Fifth Amendment privilege would be, but should not be, lost solely because they gave their documents to their lawyers in order to obtain legal advice.  But this misconceives the nature of the constitutional privilege.  The Amendment protects a person from being compelled to be a witness against himself.  Here, the taxpayers retained any privilege they ever had not to be compelled to testify against themselves and not to be compelled themselves to produce private papers in their possession.  <em>This</em> personal privilege was in no way decreased by the transfer.  It is simply that, by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 425 U. S. 399</a></p><p> reason of the transfer of the documents to the attorneys, those papers may be subpoenaed without compulsion on the taxpayer.  The protection of the Fifth Amendment is therefore not available.  "A party is privileged from producing evidence, but not from its production."  <em>Johnson v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/457/case.html#458">228 U. S. 458</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit suggested that, because legally and ethically the attorney was required to respect the confidences of his client, the latter had a reasonable expectation of privacy for the records in the hands of the attorney, and therefore did not forfeit his Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the records by transferring them in order to obtain legal advice.  It is true that the Court has often stated that one of the several purposes served by the constitutional privilege against compelled testimonial self-incrimination is that of protecting personal privacy.  <em>See, e.g., Murphy v.

But the Court has never suggested that every invasion of privacy violates the privilege.  Within the limits imposed by the language of the Fifth Amendment, which we necessarily observe, the privilege truly serves privacy interests; but the Court has never on any ground, personal privacy included, applied the Fifth Amendment to prevent the otherwise proper acquisition or use of evidence which, in the Court\'s view, did not involve compelled testimonial self-incrimination of some sort.

If the Fifth Amendment protected generally against the obtaining of private information from a man\'s mouth or pen or house, its protections would presumably not be lifted by probable cause and a warrant or by immunity.  The privacy invasion is not mitigated by immunity; and the Fifth Amendment\'s strictures, unlike the Fourth\'s, are not removed by showing reasonableness.  The Framers addressed the subject of personal privacy directly in the Fourth Amendment.  They struck a balance so that, when the State\'s reason to believe incriminating evidence will be found becomes sufficiently great, the invasion of privacy becomes justified and a warrant to search and seize will issue.  They did not seek in still another Amendment -- the Fifth -- to achieve a general protection of privacy, but to deal with the more specific issue of compelled self-incrimination. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 425 U. S. 401</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We cannot cut the Fifth Amendment completely loose from the moorings of its language, and make it serve as a general protector of privacy -- a word not mentioned in its text and a concept directly addressed in the Fourth Amendment.

The taxpayers in these cases, however, have, from the outset, consistently urged that they should not be forced to expose otherwise protected documents to summons simply because they have sought legal advice and turned the papers over to their attorneys.  The Government appears to agree unqualifiedly.  The difficulty is that the taxpayers have erroneously relied on the Fifth Amendment without urging the attorney-client privilege in so many words.  They have nevertheless invoked the relevant body of law and policies that govern the attorney-client privilege.  In this posture of the case, we feel obliged to inquire whether the attorney-client privilege applies to documents in the hands of an attorney which would have been privileged in the hands of the client by reason of the Fifth Amendment.

The purpose of the privilege is to encourage clients to make full disclosure to their attorneys.  8 Wigmore \xc2\xa7 2291, and \xc2\xa7 2306, p. 590; McCormick \xc2\xa7 87, p. 175, \xc2\xa7 92, p. 192; <em>Baird v.

Goldfarb,</em> 328 F.2d 280 (CA6 1964).  As a practical matter, if the client knows that damaging information could more readily be obtained from the attorney following disclosure than from himself in the absence of disclosure, the client would be reluctant to confide in his lawyer and it would be difficult to obtain fully informed legal advice.  However, since the privilege has the effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder, it applies only where necessary to achieve its purpose.  Accordingly it protects only those disclosures -- necessary to obtain informed legal advice -- which might not have been made absent the privilege.  <em>In re Horowitz, supra</em> at 81 (Friendly, J.); <em>United States v. Goldfarb, supra;</em> 8 Wigmore \xc2\xa7 2291, p. 554; McCormick \xc2\xa7 89, p. 185.  This Court and the lower courts have thus uniformly held that preexisting documents which could have been obtained by court process from the client when he was in possession may also be obtained from the attorney by similar process following transfer by the client in order </p><p><a class="page-number" name="404">Page 425 U. S. 404</a></p><p> to obtain more informed legal advice.  <em>Grant v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/227/74/case.html">227 U.

Reed,</em> 208 Ala. 457, 94 So. 910 (1922); <em>Andrews v. Mississippi R. Co.,</em> 14 Ind. 169, 98 N.E. 49 (1860); <em>Palatini v. Sarian,</em> 15 N.J.Super. 34, 83 A.2d 24 (1951); <em>Pearson v.

Pre-existing documents obtainable from the client are not appreciably easier to obtain from the attorney after transfer to him.  Thus, even absent the attorney-client privilege, clients will not be discouraged from disclosing the documents to the attorney, and their ability to obtain informed legal advice will remain unfettered.  It is otherwise if the documents are not obtainable by subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> or summons while in the exclusive possession of the client, for the client will then be reluctant to transfer possession to the lawyer unless the documents are also privileged in the latter\'s hands.  Where the transfer is made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, the purposes of the attorney-client privilege would be defeated unless the privilege is applicable.</p>\n<p>"It follows, then, that, when the client himself would be privileged from production of the document, either as a party at common law . . . or as exempt from self-incrimination, the attorney having possession of the document is not bound to produce."</p>\n<p>8 Wigmore \xc2\xa7 2307, p. 592.  Lower courts have so held.  <em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 2307, p. 592 n. 1, and cases there cited; <em>United States v. Judson,</em> 322 F.2d 460, 466 (CA9 1963); <em>Colton v. United States,</em> 306 F.2d 633, 639 (CA2 1962).  This proposition was accepted by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit below, is asserted by petitioners </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 425 U. S. 405</a></p><p> in No. 74-18 and respondents in No 74-611, and was conceded by the Government in its brief and at oral argument.  Where the transfer to the attorney is for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, we agree with it.</p>\n<p>Since each taxpayer transferred possession of the documents in question from himself to his attorney in order to obtain legal assistance in the tax investigations in question, the papers, if unobtainable by summons from the client, are unobtainable by summons directed to the attorney by reason of the attorney-client privilege.  We accordingly proceed to the question whether the documents could have been obtained by summons addressed to the taxpayer while the documents were in his possession.  The only bar to enforcement of such summons asserted by the parties or the courts below is the Fifth Amendment\'s privilege against self-incrimination. On this question the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in No. 74-611 is at odds with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States v. Beattie,</em> 522 F.2d 267 (1975), <em>cert. pending,</em> Nos. 75-407, 75-700.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The proposition that the Fifth Amendment prevents compelled production of documents over objection that such production might incriminate stems from <em>Boyd v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html">116 U. S. 616</a></span> (1886).  <em>Boyd</em> involved a civil forfeiture proceeding brought by the Government against two partners for fraudulently attempting to import 35 cases of glass without paying the prescribed duty.  The partnership had contracted with the Government to furnish the glass needed in the construction of a Government building.  The glass specified was foreign glass, it being understood that, if part or all of the glass was furnished from the partnership\'s existing duty-paid inventory, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="406">Page 425 U. S. 406</a></p><p> it could be replaced by duty-free imports.  Pursuant to this arrangement, 29 cases of glass were imported by the partnership duty-free.  The partners then represented that they were entitled to duty-free entry of an additional 35 cases which were soon to arrive.  The forfeiture action concerned these 35 cases.  The Government\'s position was that the partnership had replaced all of the glass used in construction of the Government building when it imported the 29 cases.  At trial, the Government obtained a court order directing the partners to produce an invoice the partnership had received from the shipper covering the previous 29-case shipment.  The invoice was disclosed, offered in evidence, and used, over the Fifth Amendment objection of the partners, to establish that the partners were fraudulently claiming a greater exemption from duty than they were entitled to under the contract.  This Court held that the invoice was inadmissible, and reversed the judgment in favor of the Government.  The Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applied to court orders in the nature of subpoenas <em>duces tecum</em> in the same manner in which it applies to search warrants, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html#622">116 U. S. 622</a></span>; and that the Government may not, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, seize a person\'s documents or other property as evidence unless it can claim a proprietary interest in the property superior to that of the person from whom the property is obtained.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html#623">116 U. S. 623</a></span>-624.  The invoice in question was thus held to have been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The Court went on to hold that the accused in a criminal case or the defendant in a forfeiture action could not be forced to produce evidentiary items without violating the Fifth Amendment as well as the Fourth.  More specifically, the Court declared,</p>\n<p>"a compulsory production of the private books and papers of the owner of goods sought to be forfeited . . . is compelling him to be a witness against himself </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 425 U.

S. 634</a></span>-635.  Admitting the partnership invoice into evidence had violated both the Fifth and Fourth Amendments.</p>\n<p>Among its several pronouncements, <em>Boyd</em> was understood to declare that the seizure, under warrant or otherwise, of any purely evidentiary materials violated the Fourth Amendment, and that the Fifth Amendment rendered these seized materials inadmissible.  <em>Gouled v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/298/case.html">255 U. S. 298</a></span> (1921); <em>Agnello v.

Lefkowitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/452/case.html">285 U. S. 452</a></span> (1932).  That rule applied to documents as well as to other evidentiary items --</p>\n<p>"[t]here is no special sanctity in papers, as distinguished from other forms of property, to render them immune from search and seizure, if only they fall within the scope of the principles of the cases in which other property may be seized. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Gouled v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/298/case.html#309">255 U. S. 309</a></span>.  Private papers taken from the taxpayer, like other "mere evidence," could not be used against the accused over his Fourth and Fifth Amendment objections.</p>\n<p>Several of <em>Boyd\'s</em> express or implicit declarations have not stood the test of time.  The application of the Fourth Amendment to subpoenas was limited by <em>Hale v. Henkel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/201/43/case.html">201 U. S. 43</a></span> (1906), and more recent cases.  <em>See, e.g., Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/186/case.html">327 U. S. 186</a></span> (1946).  Purely evidentiary (but "nontestimonial") materials, as well as contraband and fruits and instrumentalities of crime, may now be searched for and seized under proper circumstances, <em>Warden v. Hayden,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/294/case.html">387 U. S. 294</a></span> (1967). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Also, any notion that "testimonial" evidence may never be seized and used in evidence is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 425 U.

To the extent, however, that the rule against compelling production of private papers rested on the proposition that seizures of or subpoenas for "mere evidence," including documents, violated the Fourth Amendment and therefore also transgressed the Fifth, <em>Gouled v. United States, supra,</em> the foundations for the rule have been washed away.  In consequence, the prohibition against forcing the production of private papers has long been a rule searching for a rationale consistent with the proscriptions of the Fifth Amendment against compelling a person to give "testimony" that incriminates him.  Accordingly, we turn to the question of what, if any, incriminating testimony within the Fifth Amendment\'s protection, is compelled by a documentary summons.</p>\n<p>A subpoena served on a taxpayer requiring him to produce an accountant\'s workpapers in his possession without doubt involves substantial compulsion.  But it does not compel oral testimony; nor would it ordinarily compel the taxpayer to restate, repeat, or affirm the truth of the contents of the documents sought.  Therefore, the Fifth Amendment would not be violated by the fact alone that the papers, on their face, might incriminate the taxpayer, for the privilege protects a person only against being incriminated by his own compelled testimonial communications.  <em>Schmerber v. California, supra; United States v. Wade, supra;</em> and <em>Gilbert v. California, supra.</em>  The accountant\'s workpapers are not the taxpayer\'s.  They were not prepared by the taxpayer, and they contain no testimonial declarations by him.  Furthermore, as far as this record demonstrates, the preparation of all of the papers sought in these cases was wholly voluntary, and they cannot be said to contain compelled </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 425 U. S. 410</a></p><p> testimonial evidence, either of the taxpayers or of anyone else. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The taxpayer cannot avoid compliance with the subpoena merely by asserting that the item of evidence which he is required to produce contains incriminating writing, whether his own or that of someone else.</p>\n<p>The act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena nevertheless has communicative aspects of its own, wholly aside from the contents of the papers produced.  Compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer.  It also would indicate the taxpayer\'s belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.  <em>Curcio v.

The elements of compulsion are clearly present, but the more difficult issues are whether the tacit averments of the taxpayer are both "testimonial" and "incriminating" for purposes of applying the Fifth Amendment.  These questions perhaps do not lend themselves to categorical answers; their resolution may instead depend on the facts and circumstances of particular cases or classes thereof.  In light of the records now before us, we are confident that, however incriminating the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 425 U. S. 411</a></p><p> contents of the accountant\'s workpapers might be, the act of producing them -- the only thing which the taxpayer is compelled to do -- would not itself involve testimonial self-incrimination.</p>\n<p>It is doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession of the papers rises to the level of testimony within the protection of the Fifth Amendment.  The papers belong to the accountant, were prepared by him, and are the kind usually prepared by an accountant working on the tax returns of his client.  Surely the Government is in no way relying on the "truthtelling" of the taxpayer to prove the existence of or his access to the documents.  8 Wigmore \xc2\xa7 2264, p. 380.  The existence and location of the papers are a foregone conclusion, and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government\'s information by conceding that he, in fact, has the papers.  Under these circumstances, by enforcement of the summons, "no constitutional rights are touched.  The question is not of testimony, but of surrender."  <em>In re Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/274/case.html">221 U.

But in common experience, the first would be a near truism, and the latter self-evident.  In any event, although the exemplar may be incriminating to the accused and although he is compelled to furnish it, his Fifth Amendment privilege is not violated, because nothing he has said or done is deemed to be sufficiently testimonial for purposes of the privilege.  This Court has also time and again allowed subpoenas against the custodian of corporate documents or those belonging to other collective entities such as unions and partnerships and those of bankrupt businesses over claims that the documents will incriminate the custodian despite the fact that producing the documents tacitly admits their existence and their location in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="412">Page 425 U.

At this juncture, we are quite unprepared to hold that either the fact of existence of the papers or of their possession by the taxpayer poses any realistic threat of incrimination to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p>As for the possibility that responding to the subpoena would authenticate [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] the workpapers, production would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="413">Page 425 U.

The taxpayer would be no more competent to authenticate the accountant\'s workpapers or reports [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] by producing them than he would be to authenticate them if testifying orally.  The taxpayer did not prepare the papers, and could not vouch for their accuracy.  The documents would not be admissible in evidence against the taxpayer without authenticating testimony.  Without more, responding to the subpoena in the circumstances before us would not appear to represent a substantial threat of self-incrimination.  Moreover, in <em>Wilson v.

Given the prior access by accountants retained by the taxpayers to the papers involved in these cases and the wholly business, rather than personal, nature of the papers, I agree that the privilege against compelled self-incrimination did not in either of these cases protect the papers from production in response to the summonses.  <em>See Couch v.

I do not join the Court\'s opinion, however, because of the portent of much of what is said of a serious crippling of the protection secured by the privilege against compelled production of one\'s private books and papers.  Like today\'s decision in <em>United States v. Miller, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/435/case.html">425 U.

This implication that the privilege might not protect against compelled production of tax records that are his "private papers" is so contrary to settled constitutional jurisprudence that this and other like implications throughout the opinion [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] prompt me to conjecture that, once again the Court is laying the groundwork for future decisions that will tell us that the question here formally reserved was actually answered against the availability of the privilege.  <em>Semble, Hudgens v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/507/case.html">424 U. S. 507</a></span> (1976).  It is therefore appropriate to recall that history and this Court have construed the constitutional privilege to safeguard against governmental intrusions of personal privacy to compel either self-incriminating oral statements or the production of self-incriminating evidence recorded in one\'s private books and papers.  Although, as phrased in the Fifth Amendment -- "nor shall [any person] be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself" -- the privilege makes no express reference, as does the Fourth Amendment, to "papers, and effects," private papers have long been held to have the protection of the privilege, designed as it is "to maintain inviolate large areas of personal privacy."  <em>Feldman v.

But this only makes explicit what elsewhere highlights the opinion, namely, the view that protection of personal privacy is merely a byproduct and not, as our precedents and history teach, a factor controlling in part the determination of the scope of the privilege.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>That the privilege does not protect against the production of private information where there is no compulsion, or where immunity is granted, or where there is no threat of incrimination in nowise supports the Court\'s argument demeaning the privilege\'s protection of privacy.

It may therefore be emphatically stated that, until today, there was no room to doubt that it is the Fifth Amendment\'s "historic function [to protect an individual] from compulsory incrimination through his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 425 U. S. 420</a></p><p> own testimony or <em>personal records.</em>"  <em>United States v. White, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/694/case.html#701">322 U. S. 701</a></span> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>The common law and constitutional extension of the privilege to testimonial materials, such as books and papers, was inevitable.  An individual\'s books and papers are generally little more than an extension of his person.  They reveal no less than he could reveal upon being questioned directly.  Many of the matters within an individual\'s knowledge may as easily be retained within his head as set down on a scrap of paper.  I perceive no principle which does not permit compelling one to disclose the contents of one\'s mind but does permit compelling the disclosure of the contents of that scrap of paper by compelling its production.  Under a contrary view, the constitutional protection would turn on fortuity, and persons would, at their peril, record their thoughts and the events of their lives.  The ability to think private thoughts, facilitated as it is by pen and paper, and the ability to preserve intimate memories would be curtailed through fear that those thoughts or the events of those memories would become the subjects of criminal sanctions however invalidly imposed.  Indeed, it was the very reality of those fears that helped provide the historical impetus for the privilege.  <em>See Boyd v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html#631">116 U. S. 631</a></span>-632; E. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today 8-9 (1955); 8 J.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  It is, of course, true "that the Fifth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 425 U.

S. 401</a></span>, but it is also true that governmental compulsion to produce private information that might incriminate violates the protection of the privilege.  Similarly, although it is necessary that the papers "contain no testimonial declarations by [the taxpayer]" in order for the privilege not to operate as a bar to production, <em>ante</em>at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#409">425 U. S. 409</a></span>, it does not follow </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 425 U. S. 423</a></em></p><p><em> that papers are not "testimonial," and thus producible because they contain no declarations.  And while it may be that the unavailability of the privilege depends on a showing that "the preparation of all of the papers sought in these cases was wholly voluntary," <em>ibid.,</em> again it does not follow that the protection is necessarily unavailable if the papers were prepared voluntarily, for it is the compelled <em>production</em> of testimonial evidence, not just the compelled creation of such evidence, against which the privilege protects.\n</em></p>\n<p>Though recognizing that a subpoena served on a taxpayer involves substantial compulsion, the Court concludes that, since the subpoena does not compel oral testimony or require the taxpayer to restate, repeat, or affirm the truth of the contents of the documents sought, compelled production of the documents by the taxpayer would not violate the privilege, even though the documents might incriminate the taxpayer.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#409">425 U. S. 409</a></span>.  This analysis is patently incomplete:  the threshold inquiry is whether the taxpayer is compelled to produce incriminating papers.  That inquiry is not answered in favor of production merely because the subpoena requires neither oral testimony from nor affirmation of the papers\' contents by the taxpayer.  To be sure, the Court correctly observes that</p>\n<p>"[t]he taxpayer cannot avoid compliance with the subpoena <em>merely</em> by asserting that the item of evidence which he is required to produce contains incriminating writing, whether his own or that of someone else."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#410">425 U.

Unless those materials are such as to come within the zone of privacy recognized by the Amendment, the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination does not protect against their production. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 425 U. S. 424</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are not without guideposts for determining what books, papers, and writings come within the zone of privacy recognized by the Amendment.  In <em>Wilson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/361/case.html">221 U. S. 361</a></span> (1911), for example, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not protect against subpoenaing corporate records in the possession and control of the president of a corporation, even though the records might have incriminated him.  Though the evidence was testimonial, though its production was compelled, and though it would have incriminated the party producing it, the Fifth Amendment was no bar.  The Court recognized that the Amendment "[u]ndoubtedly . . . protected [the president] against the compulsory production of his private books and papers," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/361/case.html#377">221 U. S. 377</a></span>, but, with respect to corporate records, the Court held:</p>\n<p>"[T]hey are of a character which subjects them to the scrutiny demanded. . . .  This was clearly implied in the <em>Boyd</em> case, where the fact that the papers involved were the <em>private</em> papers of the claimant was constantly emphasized.  Thus, in the case of public records and official documents, made or kept in the administration of public office, the fact of actual possession or of lawful custody would not justify the officer in resisting inspection, even though the record was made by himself and would supply the evidence of his criminal dereliction."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/361/case.html#380">221 U.

Under <em>Couch,</em> therefore, one criterion is whether or not the information sought to be produced has been disclosed to, or was within the knowledge of, a third party.  409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#332">409 U. S. 332</a></span>-333.  That is to say, one relevant consideration is the degree to which the paper holder has sought to keep private the contents of the papers he desires not to produce.</p>\n<p>Most recently, <em>Bellis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/85/case.html">417 U. S. 85</a></span> (1974), followed the approach taken in <em>Wilson.</em> <em>Bellis</em> held that the partner of a small law firm could not invoke the privilege against self-incrimination to justify his refusal to comply with a subpoena requiring production of the partnership\'s financial records.  <em>Bellis</em> stated:</p>\n<p>"It has long been established . . . that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination protects an individual from compelled production of his personal papers and effects as well as compelled oral testimony. . . .  The privilege applies to the business records of the sole proprietor or sole practitioner as well as to personal documents containing more intimate information about the individual\'s private life."</p>\n<p>417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/85/case.html#87">417 U. S. 87</a></span>-88.  <em>Bellis</em> also recognized that the Court\'s</p>\n<p>"decisions holding the privilege inapplicable to the records of a collective entity also reflect . . . the protection of an individual\'s right to a \'private enclave where he may lead a private life.\' . . .  Protection of individual privacy was the major theme running through the Court\'s decision in <em>Boyd,</em>. . . and it was on this basis that the Court in <em>Wilson</em> distinguished the corporate records involved in that case from the private papers at issue in <em>Boyd.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/85/case.html#91">417 U. S. 91</a></span>-92.  "[C]orporate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 425 U. S. 426</a></p><p> records do not contain the requisite element of privacy or confidentiality essential for the privilege to attach."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/85/case.html#92">417 U. S. 92</a></span>.  <em>Bellis</em> concluded that the same considerations which precluded reliance upon the privilege with respect to corporate records also precluded reliance upon it with respect to partnership records in the circumstances of that case. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>A precise cataloguing of private papers within the ambit of the privacy protected by the privilege is probably impossible.  Some papers, however, do lend themselves to classification.  <em>See generally</em> Comment, The Search and Seizure of Private Papers:  Fourth and Fifth Amendment Considerations, 6 Loyola (LA) L.Rev. 274, 300-303 (1973).  Production of documentary materials created or authenticated by a State or the Federal Government, such as automobile registrations or property deeds, would seem ordinarily to fall outside the protection of the privilege.  They hardly reflect an extension of the person.</p>\n<p>Economic and business records may present difficulty in particular cases.  The records of business entities generally fall without the scope of the privilege.  But, as noted, the Court has recognized that the privilege extends to the business records of the sole proprietor or practitioner.  Such records are at least an extension of an aspect of a person\'s activities, though concededly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 425 U. S. 427</a></p><p> not the more intimate aspects of one\'s life.  Where the privilege would have protected one\'s mental notes of his business affairs in a less complicated day and age, it would seem that that protection should not fall away because the complexities of another time compel one to keep business records.  <em>Cf. Olmstead v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html">277 U. S. 438</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html#474">277 U. S. 474</a></span> (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  Nonbusiness economic records in the possession of an individual, such as canceled checks or tax records, would also seem to be protected.  They may provide clear insights into a person\'s total lifestyle.  They are, however, like business records and the papers involved in these cases, frequently, though not always, disclosed to other parties; and disclosure, in proper cases, may foreclose reliance upon the privilege.  Personal letters constitute an integral aspect of a person\'s private enclave.  And while letters, being necessarily interpersonal, are not wholly private, their peculiarly private nature and the generally narrow extent of their disclosure would seem to render them within the scope of the privilege.  Papers in the nature of a personal diary are <em>a fortiori</em> protected under the privilege.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s treatment in the instant cases of the question whether the evidence involved here is within the protection of the privilege is, with all respect, most inadequate.  The gaping hole is in the omission of any reference to the taxpayer\'s privacy interests and to whether the subpoenas impermissibly invade those interests.  The observations that the "accountant\'s workpapers are not the taxpayer\'s" and "were not prepared by the taxpayer," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#409">425 U. S. 409</a></span>, touch on matters relevant to the taxpayer\'s expectation of privacy, but do not of themselves determine the availability of the privilege.  <em>Wilson v. United States,</em> 221 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/361/case.html#378">221 U. S. 378</a></span>, stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he mere fact that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 425 U. S. 428</a></p><p> the appellant himself wrote, or signed, the [documents], neither conditioned nor enlarged his privilege.  Where one\'s private documents would tend to incriminate him, the privilege exists although they were actually written by another person. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]"</p>\n<p>Thus, although "[t]he fact that the documents may have been written by the person asserting the privilege is insufficient to trigger the privilege," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#410">425 U. S. 410</a></span> n. 11, and "the fact that it was written by him is not controlling . . . ," <em>ibid.,</em> this is not to say that the privilege is available only as to documents written by him.  For the reasons I have stated at the outset, however, I do not believe that the evidence involved in these cases falls within the scope of privacy protected by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>I also question the Court\'s treatment of the question whether the act of producing evidence is "testimonial."  I agree that the act of production implicitly admits the existence of the evidence requested and possession or control of that evidence by the party producing it.  It also implicitly authenticates the evidence as that identified in the order to compel.  I disagree, however, that implicit admission of the existence and possession or control of the papers in this case is not "testimonial" merely because the Government could readily have otherwise proved existence and possession or control in these cases.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 425 U. S. 429</a></p><p> I know of no Fifth Amendment principle which makes the testimonial nature of evidence and, therefore, one\'s protection against incriminating himself, turn on the strength of the Government\'s case against him.</p>\n<p>Nor do I consider the taxpayers\' implicit authentication an insubstantial threat of self-incrimination.  Actually, authentication of the papers as those described in the subpoenas establishes the papers as the taxpayers\', thereby supplying an incriminatory link in the chain of evidence against them.  It is not the less so because the taxpayers\' accountants may also provide the link, since the protection against self-incrimination cannot, I repeat, turn on the strength of the Government\'s case.</p>\n<p>This Court\'s treatment of handwriting exemplars is not supportive of its position.  <em>See Gilbert v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html">388 U. S. 263</a></span> (1967).  The Court has only recognized that "[a] mere handwriting exemplar . . . . like the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside its protection."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html#266">388 U. S. 266</a></span>-267.  It is because handwriting exemplars are viewed as strictly nontestimonial, not because they are insufficiently testimonial, that the Fifth Amendment does not protect against their compelled production.  Also not supportive of the Court\'s position is the principle that the custodian of documents of a collective entity is not protected from the act of producing those documents.  Nothing in the language of those cases, either expressly or impliedly, indicates that the act of production with respect to the records of business entities is insufficiently testimonial for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.  At most, those issues, though considered, were disposed of on the ground not that production was insufficiently testimonial, but that one in control of the records of an artificial organization </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 425 U. S. 430</a></p><p> undertakes an obligation with respect to those records foreclosing any exercise of his privilege.

(One charged with failure to comply with an order to produce, however, may not thereafter be compelled to testify as to the existence or his control of the documents.  <em>See Curcio v.

JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Today the Court adopts a wholly new approach for deciding when the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination can be asserted to bar production of documentary evidence. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  This approach has, in various </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 425 U. S. 431</a></p><p> forms, been discussed by commentators for some time; nonetheless, as I noted a few years ago, the theory "has an odd sound to it."  <em>Couch v.

The Fifth Amendment basis for resisting production of a document pursuant to subpoena, the Court tells us today, lies not in the document\'s contents, as we previously have suggested, but in the tacit verification inherent in the act of production itself that the document exists, is in the possession of the producer, and is the one sought by the subpoena.</p>\n<p>This technical and somewhat esoteric focus on the testimonial elements of production, rather than on the content of the evidence the investigator seeks, is, as MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN demonstrates, contrary to the history and traditions of the privilege against self-incrimination both in this country and in England, where the privilege originated.  A long line of precedents in this Court, whose rationales, if not holdings, are overturned by the Court today, support the notion that "any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man\'s . . . private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime" compels him to be a witness against himself within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.  <em>Boyd v.

S. 432</a></p><p> are certain documents no person ought to be compelled to produce at the Government\'s request.  While I welcome the Court\'s attempt to provide a rationale for this longstanding rule, it is incumbent upon the Court, I believe, to fashion its theory so as to protect those documents that have always stood at the core of the Court\'s concern.  Thus, I would have preferred it had the Court found some room in its theory for recognition of the import of the contents of the documents themselves.  <em>See Couch v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#350">409 U. S. 350</a></span> (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I am hopeful that the Court\'s new theory, properly understood and applied, will provide substantially the same protection as our prior focus on the contents of the documents.  The Court recognizes, as others have argued, that the act of production can verify the authenticity of the documents produced.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Beattie,</em> 522 F.2d 267 (CA2 1975), <em>cert. pending,</em> Nos. 75-407, 75-700.  But the promise of the Court\'s theory lies in its innovative discernment that production may also verify the documents\' very existence and present possession by the producer.  This expanded recognition of the kinds of testimony inherent in production not only rationalizes the cases, but seems to me to afford almost complete protection against compulsory production of our most private papers.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Court\'s rationale provides a persuasive basis for distinguishing between the corporate document cases and those involving the papers of private citizens.  Since the existence of corporate record books is seldom in doubt, the verification of their existence, inherent in their production, may fairly be termed not testimonial at all.  On the other hand, there is little reason to assume the present existence and possession of most private papers, and certainly not those MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN places at the top of his list of documents that the privilege should protect.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#426">425 U. S. 426</a></span>-427 (concurring in judgment).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 425 U. S. 433</a></p><p> Indeed, there would appear to be a precise inverse relationship between the private nature of the document and the permissibility of assuming its existence.  Therefore, under the Court\'s theory, the admission through production that one\'s diary, letters, prior tax returns, personally maintained financial records, or canceled checks exist would ordinarily provide substantial testimony. The incriminating nature of such an admission is clear, for, while it may not be criminal to keep a diary, or write letters or checks, the admission that one does and that those documents are still available may quickly -- or simultaneously -- lead to incriminating evidence.  If there is a "real danger" of such a result, that is enough under our cases to make such testimony subject to the claim of privilege.  <em>See Rogers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html">340 U. S. 367</a></span> (1951); <em>Brown v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/591/case.html">161 U. S. 591</a></span> (1896); <em>Counselman v. Hitchcock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/547/case.html">142 U. S. 547</a></span> (1892).  Thus, in practice, the Court\'s approach should still focus upon the private nature of the papers subpoenaed and protect those about which <em>Boyd</em> and its progeny were most concerned.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s theory will also limit the prosecution\'s ability to use documents secured through a grant of immunity.  If authentication that the document produced is the document demanded were the only testimony inherent in production, immunity would be a useful tool for obtaining written evidence.  So long as a document obtained under an immunity grant could be authenticated through other sources, as would often be possible, reliance on the immunized testimony -- the authentication -- and its fruits would not be necessary, and the document could be introduced.  The Court\'s recognition that the act of production also involves testimony about the existence and possession of the subpoenaed documents mandates a different result.  Under the Court\'s theory, if the document is to be obtained, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 425 U. S. 434</a></p><p> immunity grant must extend to the testimony that the document is presently in existence.  Such a grant will effectively shield the contents of the document, for the contents are a direct fruit of the immunized testimony -- that the document exists -- and cannot usually be obtained without reliance on that testimony. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Accordingly, the Court\'s theory offers substantially the same protection against procurement of documents under grant of immunity that our prior cases afford.</p>\n<p>In short, while the Court sacrifices our pragmatic, if somewhat <em>ad hoc,</em> content analysis for what might seem an unduly technical focus on the act of production itself, I am far less pessimistic than MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN that this new approach signals the end of Fifth Amendment protection for documents we have long held to be privileged.  I am not ready to embrace the approach myself, but I am confident in the ability of the trial judges who must apply this difficult test in the first instance to act with sensitivity to our traditional concerns in this uncertain area.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s theory would appear to apply to real evidence as well.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Court\'s theory affords protection to one who possesses documents that he cannot authenticate.  If authentication were the only relevant testimony inherent in the act of production, such a person would be forced to relinquish his documents, for he provides no authentication testimony of relevance by producing them in response to a subpoena.  <em>See United States v. Beattie,</em> 522 F.2d 267 (CA2 1975), <em>cert. pending,</em> Nos. 75-407, 7700.  Under the Court\'s theory, however, if the existence of these documents were in question, the custodian would still be able to assert a claim of privilege against their production.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
