Upon the trial before the circuit court, the following case was agreed between the parties by their attorneys, to be subject to the opinion of the court as to the law upon the same, <em>viz.:</em></p>\n<p>"On the trial of the above cause, the plaintiffs to maintain the issue on their part joined, offered in evidence the transcripts from the Treasury Department (which are found in pages 12 to 16 of the record), and the said defendant then offered evidence to show that the said intestate was a captain of the United States Corps of Engineers, and as such was ordered to take charge and superintend the works on Fortress Calhoun, and took charge of and continued, the said work, from 7 November 1834, to 10 September 1838, and further offered in evidence the general regulations of the War Department as follows, art. 67, \xc2\xa7 14:"</p>\n<p>"   Where there is no agent for fortifications, the superintending officer shall perform the duties of agent; while performing such duties, the rules and regulations for the government of such agents shall be applicable to him, and as compensation for the performance of that extra duty, he shall be allowed for moneys expended by him in the construction of fortifications </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 41 U.

KEY, for the United States"</p>\n<p>"Jos. H. BRADLEY, for defendant"</p>\n<p>Upon the statement of facts agreed, as above mentioned, the circuit court pronounced the following opinion and judgment:</p>\n<p>"And thereupon, upon the full consideration of the case stated as aforesaid, the said court is of opinion that the proviso in the Act of 3 March 1835, ch. 303, is only applicable to the disbursing of public money appropriated by law during the session of Congress in which that act was passed, and it appearing therein to the satisfaction of the court that no part of the money so as aforesaid disbursed by the said defendant was appropriated at the said session of Congress; the court is also of opinion that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 41 U. S. 299</a></p><p> the said intestate was entitled to the allowances claimed by him for the disbursements as above stated, and do thereupon order the judgment to be entered for the said defendant."</p>\n<p>To this opinion an exception was taken by the plaintiffs, which was sealed by the court and made a part of the record.</p>\n<p>Before considering the questions of law arising upon the agreed statement and upon the exception taken to the opinion and judgment pronounced upon that statement, it is proper to advert to a point which has been made <em>in limine</em> by the counsel for the defendant in error and which, if decided as he has contended it should be, would prove conclusive as to the fate of this cause.  It is insisted by the defendant\'s counsel that this Court cannot take cognizance of the present cause for the reason that, having been tried upon an agreed case, a writ of error will not lie to the decision thereon.  This position of the counsel is founded upon a remark of Mr. Justice Blackstone in his Commentaries which has been transferred to the work of Mr. Tidd, and to some other compilations upon the practice in the English courts of common law.  The passage in Blackstone, which will be found in his chapter on the Trial by jury, vol. 3, 379 (Coleridge\'s edition), is as follows:</p>\n<p>"Another method of finding a species of special verdict is when the jury find a verdict generally for the plaintiff, but subject nevertheless to the opinion of the court above, on a special case stated by the counsel on both sides, with regard to the matter of law, which has this advantage over a special verdict that it is attended with much less expense and obtains a speedier decision, the postea being stayed in the hands of the officer of <em>nisi prius</em> till the question is determined, and the verdict is then entered for the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may happen.  But as nothing appears on the record but the general verdict, the parties are precluded hereby from the benefit of a writ of error if dissatisfied with the judgment of the court of judge upon the point of law, which makes it a thing to be wished that a method could be devised of either lessening the expense of special verdicts or else of entering the cause at length upon the postea."</p>\n<p>It is manifest from this quotation that the reason why, according to the practice in the English courts, a writ of error will not be allowed after a case agreed is this, and this only -- that in those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 41 U. S. 300</a></p><p> courts, the agreed case never appears upon or is made a part of the record, and therefore there is no ground of error set forth upon which an appellate or revising tribunal can act.  In the language of Justice Blackstone, "nothing appears upon the record but the general verdict, whereby the parties are precluded from the benefit of a writ of error . . . , which makes it," says the same learned judge,</p>\n<p>"a thing to be wished that a method could be devised either of lessening the expenses of special verdicts or else of entering the cause at large upon the postea."</p>\n<p>The same rule in the English courts of law, and the same consequence, as resulting solely from their practice, may be seen in the Treatise on Pleading by Stephen, p. 92, where the author, in speaking of the practice of taking special verdicts, and general verdicts, subject to a special case, remarks that a special case is not like a special verdict entered on record, and consequently a writ of error cannot be brought on this decision.  There has been a recent statute enacted in England which, although it is not brought sufficiently to the view of this Court to justify any direct inferences as to its terms or its bearing upon this particular question, may have been designed to remedy the very evil pointed out by Justice Blackstone.  By a note to page 92, of Mr. Stephen\'s Treatise, it is said to have been enacted by 3 &amp; 4 Wm. IV., c. 42, that where the parties, on issue joined, can agree on a statement of facts, they may, by order of a judge, draw up such statement in the form of a special case, for the judgment of the court without proceeding to trial.  By the established practice anterior to this statutory provision, it was in the power of the parties to agree upon a statement of the case; it would seem reasonable and probable, therefore, that the power given to the judge (as an exercise of his judicial functions) to regulate the statement was designed to impart a greater solemnity and permanency to the preparation of the proceeding and to place it in an attitude for the action of some revising power.  But even should a want of familiarity with the detail of English practice induce the hazard of misapprehension of its rules, or of the reasons in which they have their origin, the decisions of our own courts, and the long established practice of our own country, are regarded as having put the point under consideration entirely at rest. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 41 U. S. 301</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By the Act of Congress of 1801, assuming the government of the District of Columbia, in virtue of the cession from Maryland and Virginia, the laws of these states, and, of course, the proceedings in their courts as parts of these laws, were expressly recognized within such portions of the district, respectively, as originally were within the limits of the ceding states.  <em>See</em> 3 Story\'s Laws 2089; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/252/case.html">United States v. Simms,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 252.  At the period of the cession, the practice is believed to have been well settled, both in Virginia and Maryland, that in trials at law, where special or agreed cases have been made, they have been signed by the counsel, as representing their clients, and spread at large upon the record, as a part thereof, and as constituting the only legitimate ground for the action of the court, and as furnishing the regular and proper test to be applied by an appellate or revising tribunal to this action.  The practice is believed to be the same at this day; it has been repeatedly recognized by the decisions of this Court, and if ever heretofore seriously questioned, has never been overruled.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/7/159/case.html#173">Faw v.

Brent,</a></span></em> 6 Cranch 187; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/358/case.html">Brent v.

These are cases arising within the District of Columbia, but the same practice has been sanctioned in cases brought hither from without the district, as will be seen in the decisions of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/15/363/case.html">Ingle v. Coolidge,</a></span></em> 2 Wheat. 363, and of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/311/case.html">Miller v. Nicholls,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 311.  This Court therefore has no hesitancy in declaring that the point of practice raised by the defendant\'s counsel presents no objection to the regularity in the mode of bringing this case before them.</p>\n<p>In considering the exception taken to the opinion of the circuit court in relation to the Act of Congress of March 3, 1835, the order of the War Department of March 13 of the same year, and the rights of the plaintiffs, and of the defendant as connected therewith, this Court has no difficulty in pronouncing the opinion and decision of the circuit court as although untenable.  The power of the executive to establish rules and regulations for the government of the army is undoubted.  The very appeal made by the defendant to the 14th section of the 67th article of the army regulations is a recognition of this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 41 U. S. 302</a></p><p> right.  The power to establish implies necessarily the power to modify or repeal or to create anew.</p>\n<p>The Secretary of War is the regular constitutional organ of the president for the administration of the military establishment of the nation, and rules and orders publicly promulgated through him must be received as the acts of the executive, and as such be binding upon all within the sphere of his legal and constitutional authority.</p>\n<p>Such regulations cannot be questioned or denied because they may be thought unwise or mistaken.  The right of so considering and treating the authority of the executive, vested as it is with the command of the military and naval forces, could not be entrusted to officers of any grade inferior to the commander-in-chief; its consequences, if tolerated, would be a complete disorganization of both the army and navy.  In the present instance, the order was adopted by the proper authority, and by the same authority promulgated to every officer, through the regular official organ, and the question propounded to the circuit court was neither more nor less than this -- whether a subordinate officer of the army, insisting upon a prior regulation, which he thinks either is or ought to be in force, shall obtain from the government emoluments which a subsequent order from his superior had warned him that it was not in his power to require?  This question can need no argument for its solution.  This Court is therefore of opinion that the circuit court erred in allowing to Captain Eliason, a <em>per diem</em> as disbursing officer at Fortress Calhoun subsequently to  March 1835.  Under the 14th section of the 67th article of the army regulations, it does therefore reverse the decision of the circuit court, and directs that a judgment be entered for the plaintiffs for the sum of $2,600.75 as claimed by them, together with their costs.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
