Finding him indigent, the trial court appointed counsel, who requested a psychiatric evaluation of McWilliams.  The court granted the motion and the State convened a commission, which concluded that McWilliams was competent to stand trial and had not been suffering from mental illness at the time of the alleged offense.  A jury convicted McWilliams of capital murder and recommended a death sentence.  Later, while the parties awaited McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 judicial sentencing hearing, McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 counsel asked for neurological and neuropsychological testing of McWilliams.  The court agreed and McWilliams was examined by Dr. Goff.  Dr. Goff filed a report two days before the judicial sentencing hearing.  He concluded that McWilliams was likely exaggerating his symptoms, but nonetheless appeared to have some genuine neuropsychological problems.  Just before the hearing, counsel also received updated records from the commission\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation and previously subpoenaed mental health records from the Alabama Department of Corrections.  At the hearing, defense counsel requested a continuance in order to evaluate all the new material, and asked for the assistance of someone with expertise in psychological matters to review the findings.  The trial court denied defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s requests.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court sentenced McWilliams to death.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">On appeal, McWilliams argued that the trial court denied him the right to meaningful expert assistance guarantee by <i>Ake.</i>  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 conviction and sentence, holding that Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s examination satisfied <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, and McWilliams failed to obtain state postconviction relief.  On federal habeas review, a Magistrate Judge also found that the Goff examination satisfied <i>Ake</i> and, therefore, that the State Court of Criminal Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Adopting the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and recommendation, the District Court denied relief.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0<i>Ake</i> clearly established that when certain threshold criteria are met, the state must provide a defendant with access to a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \xe2\x80\x9cconduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83.  The Alabama courts\xe2\x80\x99 determination that McWilliams received all the assistance to which <i>Ake</i> entitled him was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Three preliminary issues require resolution.  First, the conditions that trigger <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s application are present.  McWilliams is and was an \xe2\x80\x9cindigent defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70, and his \xe2\x80\x9cmental condition\xe2\x80\x9d was both \xe2\x80\x9crelevant to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the punishment he might suffer,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id., </i>at 80, and \xe2\x80\x9cseriously in question,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 70.  Second, this Court rejects Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s claim the State was relieved of its <i>Ake</i> obligations because McWilliams received brief assistance from a volunteer psychologist at the University of Alabama.  Even if the episodic help of an outside volunteer could satisfy <i>Ake</i>, the State does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that the volunteer psychologist was available to the defense at the judicial sentencing proceeding.  Third, contrary to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the record indicates that McWilliams did not get all the mental health assistance that he requested.  Rather, he asked for additional help at the judicial sentencing hearing, but was rebuffed.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0This Court does not have to decide whether <i>Ake </i>requires a State to provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team.  That is because Alabama did not meet even <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s most basic requirements in this case.  <i>Ake</i> requires more than just an examination.  It requires that the State provide the defense with \xe2\x80\x9caccess to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate [1] examination and assist in [2] evaluation, [3] preparation, and [4] presentation of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83.  Even assuming that Alabama met the examination requirement, it did not meet any of the other three.  No expert helped the defense evaluate the Goff report or McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.  No expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, <i>e.g.</i>, have explained that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness.  No expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing.  Since Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s provision of mental health assistance fell so dramatically short of <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, the Alabama courts\xe2\x80\x99 decision affirming McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 sentence was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).

McWilliams challenged his sentence on appeal, arguing that the State had failed to provide him with the expert mental health assistance the Constitution requires, but the Alabama courts refused to grant relief.  We now consider, in this habeas corpus case, whether the Alabama courts\xe2\x80\x99 refusal was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  We hold that it was.  Our decision in <i>Ake</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 68 (1985)\n, clearly established that, when certain threshold criteria are met, the State must provide an indigent defendant with access to a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \xe2\x80\x9cassist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 83.  Petitioner in this case did not receive that assistance.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">McWilliams and the State of Alabama agree that <i>Ake</i> (which this Court decided in February 1985) sets forth the applicable constitutional standards.  Before turning to the circumstances of McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 case, we describe what the Court held in <i>Ake</i>.  We put in italics language that we find particularly pertinent here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court began by stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cissue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination <i>and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition</i>, when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 70 (emphasis added).  The Court said it would consider that issue within the framework of earlier cases granting \xe2\x80\x9can indigent defendant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a fair opportunity to present his defense\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 76.  \xe2\x80\x9cMeaningful access to justice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court added, \xe2\x80\x9chas been the consistent theme of these cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 77.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court then wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the State has made the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to marshal his defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 80.  A psychiatrist may, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cgather facts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9canalyze the information gathered and from it draw plausible conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknow the probative questions to ask of the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  These and related considerations</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9clea[d] inexorably to the conclusion that, <i>without the assistance of a psychiatrist to conduct a professional examination on issues relevant to the defense, to help determine whether the insanity defense is viable, to present testimony, and to assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatric witnesses</i>, the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity issues is extremely high.  With such assistance, the defendant is fairly able to present at least enough information to the jury, in a meaningful manner, as to permit it to make a sensible determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 82 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe therefore hold that when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and <i>assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense</i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist <i>for the[se] purpose[s]</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 83 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Ake </i>thus clearly establishes that when its threshold criteria are met, a State must provide a mental health professional capable of performing a certain role: \xe2\x80\x9cconduct[ing] an appropriate examination and assist[ing] in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Unless a defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cassure[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the assistance of someone who can effectively perform these functions, he has not received the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum\xe2\x80\x9d to which <i>Ake</i> entitles him.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">One month after this Court decided <i>Ake</i>, the State of Alabama charged McWilliams with rape and murder.  The trial court found McWilliams indigent and provided him with counsel.  It also granted counsel\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial motion for a psychiatric evaluation of McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 sanity, including aspects of his mental condition relevant to \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating circumstances to be considered in a capital case in the sentencing stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  T. 1526.  (\xe2\x80\x9cT.\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the certified trial record; \xe2\x80\x9cP. C. T.\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the certified court reporter\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction proceedings transcript.)   The court ordered the State to convene a \xe2\x80\x9cLunacy Commission,\xe2\x80\x9d which would examine McWilliams and file a report with the court.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1528\xe2\x80\x931529.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Subsequently a three-member Lunacy Commission examined McWilliams at a state hospital, the Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility.  The three members, all psychiatrists, concluded that McWilliams was competent to stand trial and that he had not been suffering from mental illness at the time of the alleged offense.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1544\xe2\x80\x931546.  One of them, Dr. Kamal Nagi, wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. McWilliams is grossly exaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1546.  Dr. Nagi noted that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 performance on one of the tests \xe2\x80\x9csuggested that [McWilliams] had exaggerated his endorsement of symptoms of illness and the profile was considered a \xe2\x80\x98fake bad.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 trial took place in late August 1986.  On August 26 the jury convicted him of capital murder.  The prosecution sought the death penalty, which under then-applicable Alabama law required both a jury recommendation (with at least 10 affirmative votes) and a later determination by the judge.  See Ala. Code \xc2\xa713A\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x9346(f) (1986).  The jury-related portion of the sentencing proceeding took place the next day.  The prosecution reintroduced evidence from the guilt phase and called a police officer to testify that McWilliams had a prior conviction.  T. 1297, 1299\xe2\x80\x931303. The defense called McWilliams and his mother.  Both testified that McWilliams, when a child, had suffered multiple serious head injuries. <i>Id.</i>, at 1303\xe2\x80\x931318, 1320\xe2\x80\x931335.  McWilliams also described his history of psychiatric and psychological evaluations, reading from the prearrest report of one psychologist, who concluded that McWilliams had a \xe2\x80\x9cblatantly psychotic thought disorder\xe2\x80\x9d and needed inpatient treatment.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1329\xe2\x80\x931332.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the prosecutor, cross-examining McWilliams, asked about the neurological effects of his head injuries, McWilliams replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a psychiatrist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1328.  Similarly, when the prosecutor asked McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 mother whether her son was \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI am no expert: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether my son is crazy or not.  All I know, that my son do need help.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The prosecution then called two of the mental health professionals who had signed the Lunacy Commission\xe2\x80\x99s report, Dr. Kamal Nagi and Dr. Norman Poythress.  Dr. Nagi testified that he had found no evidence of psychosis, but did not appear to be aware of McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 history of head trauma.  See <i>id.</i>, at 1351\xe2\x80\x931352.  Dr. Poythress testified that one of the tests that McWilliams took was \xe2\x80\x9cclinically invalid\xe2\x80\x9d because the test\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvalidity scales\xe2\x80\x9d indicated that McWilliams had exaggerated or faked his symptoms.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1361\xe2\x80\x931363.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 counsel had subpoenaed further mental health records from Holman State Prison, where McWilliams was being held, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider them, for, though subpoenaed on August 13, the records had not arrived by August 27, the day of the jury hearing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty by a vote of 10 to 2, the minimum required by Alabama law.  The court scheduled its judicial sentencing hearing for October 9, about six weeks later.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Five weeks before that hearing, the trial court ordered the Alabama Department of Corrections to respond to McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s subpoena for mental health records.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1619.  The court also granted McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 motion for neurological and neuropsychological exams.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1615\xe2\x80\x931617.  That motion (apparently filed at the suggestion of a University of Alabama psychologist who had \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteer[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d to help counsel \xe2\x80\x9cin her spare time,\xe2\x80\x9d P. C. T. 251\xe2\x80\x93252) asked the court to \xe2\x80\x9cissue an order requiring the State of Alabama to do complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant in order to have the test results available for his sentencing hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  T. 1615.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consequently, Dr. John Goff, a neuropsychologist employed by the State\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Mental Health, examined McWilliams.  On October 7, two days before the judicial sentencing hearing, Dr. Goff filed his report.  The report concluded that McWilliams presented \xe2\x80\x9csome diagnostic dilemmas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 1635.  On the one hand, he was \xe2\x80\x9cobviously attempting to appear emotionally disturbed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexaggerating his neuropsychological problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But on the other hand, it was \xe2\x80\x9cquite apparent that he ha[d] some genuine neuropsychological problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Tests revealed \xe2\x80\x9ccortical dysfunction attributable to right cerebral hemisphere dysfunction,\xe2\x80\x9d shown by \xe2\x80\x9cleft hand weakness, poor motor coordination of the left hand, sensory deficits including suppressions of the left hand and very poor visual search skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1636.  These deficiencies were \xe2\x80\x9csuggestive of a right hemisphere lesion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccompatible with the injuries [McWilliams] sa[id] he sustained as a child.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1635.  The report added that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cobvious neuropsychological deficit\xe2\x80\x9d could be related to his \xe2\x80\x9clow frustration tolerance and impulsivity,\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested a diagnosis of \xe2\x80\x9corganic personality syndrome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The day before the sentencing hearing defense counsel also received updated records from Taylor Hardin hospital, and on the morning of the hearing he received the records (subpoenaed in mid-August) from Holman Prison.  The prison records indicated that McWilliams was taking an assortment of psychotropic medications including Desyrel, Librium, and an antipsychotic, Mellaril.  See App. 190a\xe2\x80\x93193a.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The judicial sentencing hearing began on the morning of October 9.  Defense counsel told the trial court that the eleventh-hour arrival of the Goff report and the mental health records left him \xe2\x80\x9cunable to present any evidence today.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 194a.  He said he needed more time to go over the new information.  Furthermore, since he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a psychologist or a psychiatrist,\xe2\x80\x9d he needed \xe2\x80\x9cto have someone else review these findings\xe2\x80\x9d and offer \xe2\x80\x9ca second opinion as to the severity of the organic problems discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 192a\xe2\x80\x93196a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The trial judge responded, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.  Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 197a.  The prosecution then presented its case.  Once it had finished, defense counsel moved for a continuance in order \xe2\x80\x9cto allow us to go through the material that has been provided to us in the last 2 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 204a.  The judge offered to give defense counsel until 2 p.m. that afternoon.  He also stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t that time, The Court will entertain any motion that you may have with some other person to review\xe2\x80\x9d the new material.  <i>Id.</i>, at 205a.  Defense counsel protested that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no way that I can go through this material,\xe2\x80\x9d but the judge immediately added, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will give you the opportunity.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. If you do not want to try, then you may not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 206a.  The court then adjourned until 2 p.m.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">During the recess, defense counsel moved to withdraw.  He said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe abritrary [sic] position taken by this Court regarding the Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to present mitigating circumstances is unconscionable resulting in this proceeding being a mockery.\xe2\x80\x9d  T. 1644.  He added that \xe2\x80\x9cfurther participation would be tantamount to exceptance [<i>sic</i>] of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  The trial court denied the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the proceedings resumed, defense counsel renewed his motion for a continuance, explaining,</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the position of the Defense that we have received these records at such a late date, such a late time that it has put us in a position as laymen, with regard to psychological matters, that we cannot adequately make a determination as what to present to The Court with regards to the particular deficiencies that the Defendant has.  We believe that he has the type of diagnosed illness that we pointed out earlier for The Court and have mentioned for The Court.  But we cannot determine ourselves from the records that we have received and the lack of receiving the test and the lack of our own expertise, whether or not such a condition exists; whether the reports and tests that have been run by Taylor Hardin, and the Lunacy Commission, and at Holman are tests that should be challenged in some type of way or the results should be challenged, we really need an opportunity to have the right type of experts in this field, take a look at all of those records and tell us what is happening with him.  And that is why we renew the Motion for a Continuance.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 207a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The prosecutor then offered his closing statement, in which he argued that there were \xe2\x80\x9cno mitigating circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 209a.  Defense counsel replied that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould be pleased to respond to [the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s] remarks that there are no mitigating circumstances in this case if I were able to have time to produce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any mitigating circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 210a.  But, he said, since neither he nor his co-counsel were \xe2\x80\x9cdoctors,\xe2\x80\x9d neither was \xe2\x80\x9creally capable of going through those records on our own.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  The court had thus \xe2\x80\x9cforeclosed by structuring this hearing as it has, the Defendant from presenting any evidence of mitigation in psychological\xe2\x80\x94psychiatric terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 211a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The trial judge then said that he had reviewed the records himself and found evidence that McWilliams was faking and manipulative.  <i>Ibid</i>.  Defense counsel attempted to contest that point, which led to the following exchange:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cMR. SOGOL: I told Your Honor that my looking at those records was not of any value to me; that I needed to have somebody look at those records who understood them, who could interpret them for me.

SOGOL: Your Honor gave me no time in which to do that.  Your Honor told me to be here at 2 o\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon.  Would Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">THE COURT: I want you to approach with your client, please.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 211a\xe2\x80\x93212a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court then sentenced McWilliams to death.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court later issued a written sentencing order.  It found three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.  It found that McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9cwas not and is not psychotic,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe preponderance of the evidence from these tests and reports show [McWilliams] to be feigning, faking, and manipulative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 188a.  The court wrote that even if McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 mental health issues \xe2\x80\x9cdid rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance, the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">McWilliams appealed, arguing that the trial court had denied him the right to meaningful expert assistance guaranteed by <i>Ake</i>.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his argument.  It wrote that <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements \xe2\x80\x9care met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McWilliams</i> v. <i>State</i>, 640 So.\xc2\xa02d 982, 991 (1991).  And Alabama, by \xe2\x80\x9callowing Dr. Goff to examine\xe2\x80\x9d McWilliams, had satisfied those requirements.  <i>Ibid</i>.  The court added that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no indication in the record that [McWilliams] could not have called Dr. Goff as a witness to explain his findings or that he even tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss his findings,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>; that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial court indicated that it would have considered a motion to present an expert to evaluate this report\xe2\x80\x9d had one been made, <i>ibid.</i>; and that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno prejudice by the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of [McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99] motion for continuance,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 993.  The appeals court therefore affirmed McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 conviction and sentence. The Alabama Supreme Court, in turn, affirmed the appeals court (without addressing the <i>Ake</i> issue).  <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte McWilliams</i>, 640 So.\xc2\xa02d 1015 (1993).  After McWilliams failed to obtain postconviction relief from the state courts, he sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In federal habeas court McWilliams argued before a Magistrate Judge that he had not received the expert assistance that <i>Ake </i>required.  The Magistrate Judge recommended against issuing the writ.  He wrote that McWilliams had \xe2\x80\x9creceived the assistance required by <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x9d because Dr. Goff \xe2\x80\x9ccompleted the testing\xe2\x80\x9d that McWilliams requested.  App. 88a.  Hence, the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and recommendation and denied relief.  A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.  See<i> McWilliams</i> v. <i>Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections</i>, 634\xc2\xa0Fed. Appx. 698 (2015) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>); <i>id.,</i> at 711 (Jordan, J., concurring); <i>id.,</i> at 712 (Wilson, J., dissenting).  McWilliams filed a petition for certiorari.  We granted the petition.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The  question before us is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination that McWilliams got all the assistance to which <i>Ake</i> entitled him was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Before turning to the heart of that question, we resolve three preliminary issues.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, no one denies that the conditions that trigger application of <i>Ake</i> are present.  McWilliams is and was an \xe2\x80\x9cindigent defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70.  See <i>supra</i>, at 3.  His \xe2\x80\x9cmental condition\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9crelevant to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the punishment he might suffer,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 80.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  And, that \xe2\x80\x9cmental condition,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, his \xe2\x80\x9csanity at the time of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cseriously in question,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Consequently, the Constitution, as interpreted in <i>Ake</i>, required the State to provide McWilliams with \xe2\x80\x9caccess to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, we reject Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the State was exempted from its obligations because McWilliams already had the assistance of Dr. Rosenszweig, the psychologist at the University of Alabama who \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteer[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d to help defense counsel \xe2\x80\x9cin her spare time\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested the defense ask for further testing, P. C. T. 251\xe2\x80\x93252.  Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested that Dr. Rosenszweig was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.  Alabama does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that she was available to the defense at this time.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, Alabama argues that <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are irrelevant because McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9cnever asked for more expert assistance\xe2\x80\x9d than he got, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the trial court gave him the opportunity to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  The record does not support this contention.  When defense counsel requested a continuance at the sentencing hearing, he repeatedly told the court that he needed \xe2\x80\x9cto have someone else review\xe2\x80\x9d the Goff report and medical records.  App. 193a.  See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 196a (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is just incumbent upon me to have a second opinion<i> </i>as to the severity of the organic problems discovered\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>, at 207a (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e really need an opportunity to have the right type of experts in this field, take a look at all of these records and tell us what is happening with him\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>, at 211a (\xe2\x80\x9cI told Your Honor that my looking at these records was not of any value to me; that I needed to have somebody look at those records who understood them, who could interpret them for me\xe2\x80\x9d).  Counsel also explicitly asked the trial court what else he was supposed to ask for to obtain an expert: \xe2\x80\x9cWould Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 212a.  We have reproduced a lengthier account of the exchanges, <i>supra</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.<i> </i>They make clear that counsel wanted additional expert assistance to review the report and records\xe2\x80\x94that was the point of asking for a continuance.  In response, the court told counsel to approach the bench and sentenced McWilliams to death.  Thus the record, in our view, indicates that McWilliams did request additional help from mental health experts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We turn to the main question before us: whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that <i>Ake</i> requires was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">McWilliams would have us answer \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that <i>Ake</i> clearly established that a State must provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team, not a neutral expert available to both parties.  He points to language in <i>Ake </i>that seems to foresee that consequence.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 81 (\xe2\x80\x9cBy organizing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental history, examination results and behavior, and other information, interpreting it in light of their expertise, and then laying out their investigative and analytic process to the jury, <i>the psychiatrists for each party</i> enable the jury to make its most accurate determination of the truth on the issue before them\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We need not, and do not, decide, however, whether this particular McWilliams claim is correct.  As discussed above, <i>Ake </i>clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \xe2\x80\x9cassist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 83.  As a practical matter, the simplest way for a State to meet this standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team.  This appears to be the approach that the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions have adopted.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8\xe2\x80\x9335 (describing practice in capital-active jurisdictions); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (respondent conceding that \xe2\x80\x9cthis issue really has been mooted over the last 30-some-odd years because of statutory changes\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the Constitution requires States to satisfy <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s demands in this way.  That is because Alabama here did not meet even <i>Ake\xe2\x80\x99s </i>most basic requirements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent calls our unwillingness to resolve the broader question whether <i>Ake </i>clearly established a right to an ex-pert independent from the prosecution a \xe2\x80\x9cmost unseemly maneuver.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion of Alito, J.).  We do not agree.  We recognize that we granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first question presented\xe2\x80\x94which addressed whether <i>Ake</i> clearly established a right to an independent expert\xe2\x80\x94and not his second, which raised more case-specific concerns.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Yet that does not bind us to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.  As we explain below, our determination that <i>Ake</i> clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \xe2\x80\x9cassist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at 83, is sufficient to resolve the case.  We therefore need not decide whether <i>Ake</i> clearly established more.  (Nor do we agree with the dissent that our approach is \xe2\x80\x9cacutely unfair to Alabama\xe2\x80\x9d by not \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[ing] the State a fair chance to respond.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 12.  In fact, the State devoted an entire section of its merits brief to explaining why it thought that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o matter how the Court resolves the [independent expert] question, the court of appeals correctly denied the habeas petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 50.  See also <i>id.,</i> at 14, 52 (referring to the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 case-specific determinations that McWilliams got all the assistance <i>Ake</i> requires).)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Alabama appeals court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe requirements of <i>Ake v. Oklahoma</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist.  The State met this requirement in allowing Dr. Goff to examine [McWilliams].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McWilliams</i>, 640 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 991.  This was plainly incorrect.  <i>Ake</i> does not require just an examination.  Rather, it requires the State to provide the defense with \xe2\x80\x9caccess to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate [1] <i>examination</i> and assist in [2] <i>evaluation</i>, [3] <i>preparation</i>, and [4] <i>presentation</i> of the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ake</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 83 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We are willing to assume that Alabama met the <i>examination</i> portion of this requirement by providing for Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s examination of McWilliams.  See <i>supra</i>, at 6.  But what about the other three parts?  Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate Goff\xe2\x80\x99s report or McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.  Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, for example, have explained that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99 purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness (as an expert later testified in postconviction proceedings, see P. C. T. 936\xe2\x80\x93943).  Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing himself.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent emphasizes that Dr. Goff was never ordered to do any of these things by the trial court.  See <i>post, </i>at 13, n.\xc2\xa05.  But that is precisely the point.  The relevant court order did not ask Dr. Goff or anyone else to provide the defense with help in evaluating, preparing, and presenting its case.  It only required \xe2\x80\x9cthe Department of Corrections\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and send all test materials, results and evaluations to the Clerk of the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  T. 1612.  Nor did the short time frame allow for more expert assistance.  (Indeed, given that timeframe, we do not see how Dr. Goff or any other expert could have satisfied the latter three portions of <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>requirements even had he been instructed to do so.)  Then, when McWilliams asked for the addi-tional assistance to which he was constitutionally entitled at the sentencing hearing, the judge rebuffed his requests.  See <i>supra,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Since Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s provision of mental health assistance fell so dramatically short of what <i>Ake</i> requires, we must conclude that the Alabama court decision affirming McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Eleventh Circuit held in the alternative that, even if the Alabama courts clearly erred in their application of federal law, their \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d nonetheless did not have the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\xe2\x80\x9d required to warrant a grant of habeas relief, <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Ayala</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See 634 Fed. Appx., at 707.  In reaching this conclusion, however, the Eleventh Circuit only considered whether \xe2\x80\x9c[a] few additional days to review Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s findings\xe2\x80\x9d would have made a difference.  <i>Ibid.</i>  It did not specifically consider whether access to the type of meaningful assistance in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense that <i>Ake</i> requires would have mattered.  There is reason to think that it could have.  For example, the trial judge relied heavily on his belief that McWilliams was malingering.  See App. 188a, 211a.  If McWilliams had the assistance of an expert to explain that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]alingering is not inconsistent with serious mental illness,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 20, he might have been able to alter the judge\xe2\x80\x99s perception of the case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Since \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a court of review, not of first view,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cutter</i> v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (2005), we do not now resolve this question.

Did <i>Ake </i>speak with such clarity that it ruled out \xe2\x80\x9cany possibility for fairminded disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d?  <i>Harrington,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 103.  The answer is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ake</i> provides no clear guidance one way or the other.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It is certainly true that there is language in <i>Ake</i> that points toward the position that a defense-team psychiatrist should be provided.  Explaining the need for the appointment of a psychiatric expert, <i>Ake</i> noted that a psychiatrist can \xe2\x80\x9cassist in preparing the cross-examination of a State\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatric witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d and would \xe2\x80\x9cknow the probative questions to ask of the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82, 80.  And when <i>Ake </i>discussed expert assistance during capital sentencing, the Court said that it is important for a defendant to \xe2\x80\x9coffer a well-informed expert\xe2\x80\x99s opposing view\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cresponsive psychiatric testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 84.  <i>Ake</i> also explained that factfinding is improved when evidence is offered by \xe2\x80\x9cpsychiatrists for each party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 81.  While it is possible for a neutral expert to provide these services, in our adversary system they are customarily performed by an expert working exclusively for one of the parties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other language in <i>Ake</i>, however, points at least as strongly in the opposite direction.  <i>Ake</i> was clear that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to \xe2\x80\x9cchoose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. receive funds to hire his own.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 83.  Instead, the Court held only that a defendant is entitled to have \xe2\x80\x9caccess\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cone competent psychiatrist\xe2\x80\x9d chosen by the trial judge.<b> </b><i>Id.</i>, at 83, 79.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These limitations are at odds with the defense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as \xe2\x80\x9cthe norm in our adversarial system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 3.  As McWilliams explains, \xe2\x80\x9cother litigants of means\xe2\x80\x9d screen experts to find one whose tentative views are favorable, and they often hire both consulting and testifying experts.  <i>Id.</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But the <i>Ake </i>Court was clear that it was not holding \xe2\x80\x9cthat a State must purchase for the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier counterpart might buy.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 77.  On the contrary, <i>Ake </i>expressly stated that a State need only provide for a single psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge.  Thus, <i>Ake </i>does not give the defense the right to interview potential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable preliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert.  And if the court-appointed expert reaches a conclusion unfavorable to the defendant on the issue of sanity or future dangerousness, <i>Ake</i> requires the defense team to live with the expert\xe2\x80\x99s unfavorable conclusions.  As McWilliams concedes, when the only expert available to indigent defendants is one selected by the trial court, these defendants \xe2\x80\x9cface a risk that their expert will ultimately be unwilling or unableto offer testimony that will advance their cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Ake</i> also acknowledged that one of our prior cases, <i>United States</i> <i>ex\xc2\xa0rel. Smith </i>v.<i> Baldi</i>,\n\n344 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561 (1953)\n,\xe2\x80\x9csupport[ed] the proposition\xe2\x80\x9d that due process is satisfied if a defendant merely has access to a psychiatrist \xe2\x80\x9cnot beholden to the prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 85.  While <i>Ake</i> also declared that <i>Baldi</i> did not limit the Court \xe2\x80\x9cin considering whether fundamental fairness today requires a different result,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85, <i>Ake</i> did not explicitly overrule <i>Baldi</i>, and ultimately its treatment of that case was \xe2\x80\x9cmost ambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d LaFave \xc2\xa78.2, at 450, n. 124.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is also significant that the <i>Ake</i> Court had no need to decide whether due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert as opposed to a neutral expert because Ake was denied the assistance of <i>any</i> psychiatrist\xe2\x80\x94<i>neutral or otherwise</i>\xe2\x80\x94for purposes of assessing his sanity at the time of the offense or his mental state as it related to capital sentencing.  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 71\xe2\x80\x9373 (state experts who examined Ake and testified he was dangerous evaluated him only in connection with his competency to stand trial).  As Ake\xe2\x80\x99s counsel explained at argument, the Court could rule in his client\xe2\x80\x99s favor without accepting his client\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary submission\xe2\x80\x9d that due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 83\xe2\x80\x935424 p. 21 (arguing that Ake\xe2\x80\x99s rights were violated even under <i>Baldi</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, <i>Ake</i> is ambiguous, perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately\xe2\x80\x9d so.  LaFave \xc2\xa78.2(d), at 449; see <i>ibid. </i>(\xe2\x80\x9c[C]omments supporting a move in either direction appear throughout the majority opinion in the case\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the Justices who joined Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court had agreed that adefense-team expert must be appointed, it would have been a simple matter for the Court to say so expressly.  Justice Marshall demonstrated this a few years later when he dissented from the denial of certiorari in a case that presented the very issue that the Court now dodges.  <i>Granviel</i> v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 963 (1990)\n.  There, Justice Marshall stated unambiguously that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Ake</i> mandates the provision of a psychiatrist who will be part of the defense team and serve the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interests in the context of our adversarial system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  If all the Justices who joined the opinion of the Court in <i>Ake</i> had shared this view, there is no obvious reason for the absence of the sort of clear statement that Justice Marshall would later provide when he wrote only for himself.  The opinion in <i>Ake</i> has all the hallmarks of a compromise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s actions in the aftermath of <i>Ake</i> lend support to this conclusion.  The Court repeatedly denied certiorari in cases that would have permitted it to resolve this question or others left open by <i>Ake</i>.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Norris </i>v.<i> Starr</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 995 (1994)\n; <i>Vickers </i>v.<i> Arizona</i>,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1033 (1990)\n; <i>Brown </i>v.<i> Dodd</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 874 (1987)\n; <i>Johnson </i>v.<i> Oklahoma</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 878 (1987)\n; <i>Granviel</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 963.  And in many of these cases (<i>Vickers</i>, <i>Dodd</i>, <i>Johnson</i>, and <i>Granviel</i>), Justice Marshall dissented.  The most reason-able conclusion to draw from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s silence is that the exact type of expert required by <i>Ake</i> has remained \xe2\x80\x9can open question in our jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Musladin</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70,\n76 (2006)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When the lower courts have \xe2\x80\x9cdiverged widely\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing whether our precedents dictate a legal rule, that is a sign that the rule is not clearly established, <i>ibid.</i>, and that is the situation here.  At the time the Alabama court addressed McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Ake</i> claim on the merits, some courts had held that <i>Ake</i> requires the appointment of a defense-team expert.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Smith </i>v.<i> McCormick</i>, 914 F.\xc2\xa02d 1153, 1156\xe2\x80\x931160 (CA9 1990); <i>United States </i>v.<i> Sloan</i>, 776 F.\xc2\xa02d 926, 929 (CA10 1985).  But others disagreed.  The Fifth Circuit had held that a defense-team expert is not required.  <i>Granviel </i>v.<i> Lynaugh</i>, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 185, 191\xe2\x80\x93192 (1989), cert. denied,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 963 (1990)\n.  And the Oklahoma courts <i>in Ake itself</i> also interpreted our holding this way.  <i>Ake </i>v.<i> State</i>, 778 P.\xc2\xa02d 460, 465 (Okla. Crim. App. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ue process does not entitle [Ake] to a state-funded psychiatric expert to support his claim; rather,due process requires that he have access to a compe-tent and impartial psychiatrist\xe2\x80\x9d).  So had at least seven other state high courts.  <i>Willie </i>v.<i> State</i>, 585 So.\xc2\xa02d 660, 671 (Miss. 1991); <i>State </i>v.<i> Hix</i>, 38 Ohio St. 3d 129, 131\xe2\x80\x93132, 527 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 784, 787 (1988); <i>Dunn </i>v.<i> State</i>, 291 Ark. 131, 132\xe2\x80\x93134, 722 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 595, 595\xe2\x80\x93596 (1987); <i>State </i>v.<i> Indvik</i>, 382 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 623, 625\xe2\x80\x93626 (N.

Two Eleventh Circuit panels held that a neutral expert suffices, see <i>Magwood </i>v.<i> Smith</i>, 791 F.\xc2\xa02d 1438, 1443 (1986) (<i>Ake</i> satisfied where neutral, court-appointed experts examined the defendant and testified); <i>Clisby </i>v.<i> Jones</i>, 907 F.\xc2\xa02d 1047, 1050 (1990) (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe state provided a duly qualified psychiatrist not beholden to the prosecution and, therefore, met its obligation under <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x9d), reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc, 960 F.\xc2\xa02d 925, 928\xe2\x80\x93934 (1992) (rejecting <i>Ake</i> claim on other grounds).  But another Eleventh Circuit panel disagreed.  <i>Cowley </i>v.<i> Stricklin</i>, 929 F.\xc2\xa02d 640, 644 (1991) (holding that due process requires more than a neutral expert).  A Sixth Circuit panel held that <i>Ake</i> does not require appointment of a defense-team expert.  <i>Kordenbrock </i>v.<i> Scroggy</i>, 889 F.\xc2\xa02d 69, 75 (1989).  And when the Sixth Circuit reviewed that decision en banc, its holding was fractured, but 7 of the 13 judges expressed the view that <i>Ake</i> requires only a neutral, court-appointed expert.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  919 F.\xc2\xa02d 1091, 1110, 1117\xe2\x80\x931120, 1131\xe2\x80\x931132 (1990).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguity has been noted time and again by commentators.

Pet. for Cert. i.  The first was the legal question discussed above; the second raised an issue that is tied to the specific facts of McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s case: whether the neutral expert appointed in this case failed to provide the assistance that <i>Ake </i>requires because he \xe2\x80\x9cdistributed his report to all parties just two days before sentencing and was unable to review voluminous medical and psychological records.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Our Rules and practice disfavor questions of this nature, see this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 10, and we denied review.  Heeding our decision, the parties briefed the first question but scarcely mentioned anything related to the second.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court, however, feels no similar obligation to abide by the Rules.  The Court refuses to decide the legal question on which we granted review and instead decides the question on which review was denied.  The Court holds that \xe2\x80\x9cAlabama here did not meet even <i>Ake</i>\xe2\x80\x99s most basic requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  In support of this conclusion, the Court states that neither Dr. Goff (the expert appointed by the trial judge) nor any other expert provided assistance in understanding and evaluating medical reports and records, preparing a legal strategy, presenting evidence, or preparing to cross-examine witnesses.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court does not question Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications or his objectivity.  Instead, the crux of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is that Dr. Goff merely submitted his report and did not provide further assistance to the defense.  <i>Ibid.</i>  But as far as the record shows, Dr. Goff was never asked and never refused to provide assistance to McWilliams.  He did not provide the assistance that the Court finds essential because his report was not given to the parties until two days before sentencing, and arrangements were not made for him to provide the assistance during that brief interlude.  Thus, the question that the Court decides is precisely the question <i>on which we denied review</i>:<i> </i>namely, whether Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s assistance was deficient<b> </b>because he \xe2\x80\x9cdistributed his report to all parties just two days before sentencing and was unable to review voluminous medical and psychological records.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our Rules instruct litigants that we will consider only the questions on which review was granted and \xe2\x80\x9csubsidiary question fairly included therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 14.1(a); <i>Yee </i>v.<i> Escondido</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519,\n535 (1992)\n (The Court will consider an \xe2\x80\x9cunpresented question\xe2\x80\x9d only in \xe2\x80\x9cthe most exceptional cases\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 24.1(a) (parties may not change the substance of the question presented once granted).  And we have not hesitated to enforce these Rules when petitioners who \xe2\x80\x9cpersuaded us to grant certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d on one question instead \xe2\x80\x9cchose to rely on a different argument in their merits briefing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Visa, Inc.</i> v.<i> Osborn</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (dismissing cases as improvidently granted on this ground).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These Rules exist for good reasons.  Among other things, they give the parties notice of the question to be decided and ensure that we receive adversarial briefing, see <i>Yee</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 536, which in turns helps the Court reach sound decisions.  But in this case, the Court feels free to dis-regard our Rules and long-established practice.  If McWilliams, after inducing us to grant certiorari on the first question presented, had decided to ignore that question and instead brief a fact-specific alternative theory, we would have dismissed the case as improvidently granted.  We do not tolerate this sort of bait-and-switch tactic from litigants, and we should not engage in it ourselves.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is acutely unfair to Alabama.  The State surely believed that it did not need to brief the second question presented in McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  The State vigorously opposed review of that question, calling it \xe2\x80\x9can invitation to conduct factbound error correction,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief in Opposition 13, and we denied review.  It will come as a nasty surprise to Alabama that the Court has ruled against it on the very question we declined to review\xe2\x80\x94and without giving the State a fair chance to respond.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is worth remembering that today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling requires the Court to conclude that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Ake</i> claim \xe2\x80\x9cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Harrington</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 103.  This \xe2\x80\x9cstandard is difficult to meet,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 102, and Alabama would surely have appreciated the opportunity to contest whether McWilliams has met it.

So the majority relies on the thinnest of reasons to require the Eleventh Circuit to redo its analysis.  That conclusion is unwarranted, and nothing in the majority opinion prevents the Court of Appeals from reaching the same result on remand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority claims that the Court of Appeals did not \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically consider whether access to the type of meaningful assistance in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense that <i>Ake</i> requires would have mattered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 15.  But the Court of Appeals concluded that, even if Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s performance did not satisfy <i>Ake</i>, the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the outcome of the sentencing proceeding.  <i>McWilliams</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>, <i>Ala.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of this oft-used formulation is utterly inapt because the Eleventh Circuit has already reviewed the question of harmless error.  Moreover, unlike the question that the majority does decide, the harmless-error issue was at least briefed in a meaningful way by the parties.

In 1984, McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9craped, robbed, and murdered Patricia Vallery Reynolds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McWilliams</i> v. <i>State</i>, 640 So.\xc2\xa02d 982, 986 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Reynolds was a clerk at a convenience store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  <i>Ibid.</i>  McWilliams robbed the store, brutally raped Reynolds in a back room, then left her on the floor to die after shooting her six times execution style with a .38 caliber pistol.  <i>Ibid.</i>  After McWilliams was apprehended, he bragged to other jail inmates about what he had done.  <i>Id.</i>, at 987.  The jury needed less than an hour of deliberation to find him guilty, and it recommended the death penalty by a 10-to-2 vote the following day.  <i>Id.</i>, at 986.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Agreeing with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s nonbinding recommendation, the trial court imposed the death penalty based on three aggravating circumstances.  McWilliams had prior violent felony convictions for first-degree robbery and first-degree rape.  App.<i> </i>182a\xe2\x80\x93183a.  He murdered Reynolds in the course of committing a robbery and rape.  <i>Id.</i>, at 183a.  And his crime \xe2\x80\x9cwas especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d: He executed the only potential eyewitness to his robbery, and his conduct during and after the crime showed an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious lack of regard or compassion for the life and human dignity of the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 184a.  Balanced against these three aggravators was McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he was psychotic and suffered from organic brain dysfunction\xe2\x80\x94the mitigating evidence that Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s report supposedly would have supported.  But the sentencing court concluded that this evidence \xe2\x80\x9cdid not rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance,\xe2\x80\x9d in part because of the extensive evidence that McWilliams was feigning symptoms.  <i>Id.,</i> at 188a.  And in any event, the sentencing court found that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority hints that the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s weighing might have been different if McWilliams had been afforded more time to work with Dr. Goff to prepare a mitigation presentation and to introduce Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at the sentencing hearing.  But there is little basis for this belief.  The defense would have faced potential rebuttal testimony from three doctors who evaluated McWilliams and firmly concluded that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s mental state did not reduce his responsibility for his actions.  Certified Trial Record 1545 (Dr. Yumul) (McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9cwas responsible and free of mental illness at the time of the alleged offense\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>, at 1546 (Dr. Nagi) (McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9cwas not suffering from a mental illness\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the crime and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here see[m] to be no mitigating circumstances involved in [his] case\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid.</i> (Dr. Bryant) (finding no \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of psychiatric symptoms of other illness that would provide a basis for mitigating factors at the time of the alleged crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  One of these psychiatrists also concluded that McWilliams was \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly exaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness\xe2\x80\x9d and that he \xe2\x80\x9cobviously\xe2\x80\x9d did so \xe2\x80\x9cto evade criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (Dr. Nagi).  Even Dr. Goff found it \xe2\x80\x9cquite obvious\xe2\x80\x9d that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csymptoms of psychiatric disturbance [were] quite exaggerated and, perhaps, feigned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1635.  In light of all this, the defense would have faced an uphill battle in convincing the sentencing judge that, despite McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s consistent malingering, his mental health was so impaired that it constituted a mitigating circumstance and that it outweighed the three aggravators the State proved.  If the sentencing judge had thought that there was a possibility that hearing from Dr. Goff would change his evaluation of aggravating and mitigating factors, he could have granted a continuance and called for Dr. Goff to appear.  But he did not do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also ignores the fact that McWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have been different if he had been given more expert assistance.  In state postconviction proceedings, McWilliams argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyers did not obtain an expert who would have fully probed his mental state for purposes of mitigation.  McWilliams called an expert, Dr. Woods, who offered the opinion that McWilliams suffered from bipolar disorder at the time of the crime and testified that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s exaggeration of symptoms was not inconsistent with psychiatric problems.  But Dr. Woods also acknowledged that McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9ctr[ied] to malinger for purposes of making himself look worse than he is,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed that this malingering could have been done for the purpose of avoiding the death penalty, and declined to say that McWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s disorder explains why he raped and murdered Reynolds.  Postconviction Tr. 1002\xe2\x80\x931005, 1022\xe2\x80\x931023.  Dr. Woods even endorsed Dr. Goff\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that McWilliams \xe2\x80\x9cexaggerated certain aspects of his impairment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 955 (\xe2\x80\x9cI think Dr. Goff did an excellent job of attempting to separate out what were in fact exaggerations and what was real impairment\xe2\x80\x9d).  The State introduced a psychologist of its own (Dr. Kirkland) who strenuously disagreed with Dr. Woods\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis and concluded that nothing \xe2\x80\x9cindicate[s] that Mr. McWilliams was mentally impaired on the night of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1088.  At the end of a lengthy hearing in which both experts addressed the malingering issue (see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i> <i>id.</i>, at 935\xe2\x80\x93943, 955, 964\xe2\x80\x93966, 1076\xe2\x80\x931077), the state postconviction court found that \xe2\x80\x9cMcWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s claims based upon the testimony of Dr. Woods are without merit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1810.  It credited the \xe2\x80\x9cconsensus opinion\xe2\x80\x9d reached by the three neutral state psychiatrists, who observed and evaluated McWilliams for over a month before his trial and concluded that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not suffer from a mental illness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1812.  It expressly found that \xe2\x80\x9cboth the credibility of Dr. Woods and the reliability of his findings are questionable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1814.  And even if Dr. Woods\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis was accurate, the court stated, it \xe2\x80\x9c[would] not find that a failure to present\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of this sort \xe2\x80\x9cmade a difference in the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, 1815.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, <i>McWilliams </i>v.<i> State</i>, 897 So. 2d 437 (2004), and the Alabama Supreme Court denied review.

This bar is difficult for a habeas petitioner to hurdle, and it is far from clear that McWilliams has done so.
