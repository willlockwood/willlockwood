App. to Pet. for  Cert. 6.  Stanton was familiar with the neighborhood, known for \xe2\x80\x9cviolence associated with the area gangs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The officers\xe2\x80\x94wearing uniforms and driving a marked police vehicle\xe2\x80\x94approached the place where the disturbance had been reported and noticed three men walking in the street.  Upon seeing the police car, two of the men turned into a nearby apartment complex.  The third, Nicholas Patrick, crossed the street about 25 yards in front of Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s car and ran or quickly walked toward a residence.  Id., at 7, 17.  Nothing in the record shows that Stanton knew at the time whether that residence belonged to Patrick or someone else; in fact, it belonged to Drendolyn Sims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStanton did not see Patrick with a baseball bat, but  he considered Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s behavior suspicious and decided  to detain him in order to investigate.  Ibid.; see Terry v. Ohio, \n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1968)\n.  Stanton exited his patrol car, called out \xe2\x80\x9cpolice,\xe2\x80\x9d and ordered Patrick to stop in a voice loud enough for all in the area to hear.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7.  But Patrick did not stop.  Instead, he \xe2\x80\x9clooked directly at Stanton, ignored his lawful orders[,] and quickly went through [the] front gate\xe2\x80\x9d of a fence enclosing Sims\xe2\x80\x99 front yard.  Id., at 17 (alterations omitted).  When the gate closed behind Patrick, the fence\xe2\x80\x94which was more than six feet tall and made of wood\xe2\x80\x94blocked Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s view of the yard.  Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a jailable misdemeanor under California Penal Code \xc2\xa7148 by disobeying his order to stop;\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t Stanton also \xe2\x80\x9cfear[ed] for [his] safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7.  He accordingly made the \xe2\x80\x9csplit-second decision\xe2\x80\x9d to kick open the gate in pursuit of Patrick.  Ibid.  Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to Stanton, Sims herself was standing behind the gate when it flew open.  The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSims filed suit against Stanton in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that Stanton unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the \n \nFourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Stanton, finding that: (1) Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s entry was justified by the potentially dangerous situation, by the need to pursue Patrick as he fled, and by Sims\xe2\x80\x99 lesser expectation of privacy in the curtilage of her home; and (2) even if a constitutional violation had occurred, Stanton was entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law put him on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSims appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  706 F.\xc2\xa03d 954 (2013).  The court held that Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s warrantless entry into Sims\xe2\x80\x99 yard was unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself, because there was no immediate danger, and because Patrick had committed only the minor offense of disobeying a police officer.  Id., at 959\xe2\x80\x93963.  The court also found the law to be clearly established that Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of Patrick did not justify his warrantless entry, given that Patrick was suspected of only a misdemeanor.  Id., at 963\xe2\x80\x93964.  The court accordingly held that Stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity.  Id., at 964\xe2\x80\x93965.  We address only the latter holding here, and now reverse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials \xe2\x80\x98from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pearson v. Callahan, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223, \n231 (2009)\n (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, \n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800, \n818 (1982)\n).  \xe2\x80\x9cQualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprotects \xe2\x80\x98all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335, \n341 (1986)\n).  \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not require a case directly on point\xe2\x80\x9d before concluding that the law is clearly established, \xe2\x80\x9cbut existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton knowingly violated the Constitution; the question is whether, in light of precedent existing at the time, he was \xe2\x80\x9cplainly incompetent\xe2\x80\x9d in entering Sims\xe2\x80\x99 yard to pursue the fleeing Patrick.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  The Ninth Circuit concluded that he was.  It did so despite the fact that federal and state courts nationwide are sharply divided on the question whether an officer with probable cause to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a home without a warrant while in hot pursuit of that suspect.  Compare, e.g., Middletown v. Flinchum, 95 Ohio St. 3d 43, 45, 765 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 330, 332 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. hold today that when officers, having identified themselves, are in hot pursuit of a suspect who flees to a house in order to avoid arrest, the police may enter without a warrant, regardless of whether the offense for which the suspect is being arrested is a misdemeanor\xe2\x80\x9d), and State v. Ricci, 144 N.\xc2\xa0H. 241, 244, 739 A.\xc2\xa02d 404, 407 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe facts of this case demonstrate that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant for the misdemeanor offense of dis- obeying a police officer\xe2\x80\x9d where the defendant had fled  into his home with police officers in hot pursuit), with Mas- corro v. Billings, 656 F.\xc2\xa03d 1198, 1207 (CA10 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe warrantless entry based on hot pursuit was not justified\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he intended arrest was for a traffic misdemeanor committed by a minor, with whom the officer was well acquainted, who had fled into his family home from which there was only one exit\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)), and Butler v. State, 309 Ark. 211, 217, 829 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 412, 415 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9ceven though Officer Sudduth might have been under the impression that he was in continuous pursuit of Butler for what he considered to be the crime of disorderly conduct, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. since the crime is a minor offense, under these circumstances there is no exigent circumstance that would allow Officer Sudduth\xe2\x80\x99s warrantless entry into Butler\xe2\x80\x99s home for what is concededly, at most, a petty disturbance\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther courts have concluded that police officers are at least entitled to qualified immunity in these circumstances because the constitutional violation is not clearly established.  E.g., Grenier v. Champlin, 27 F.\xc2\xa03d 1346, 1354 (CA8 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cPutting firmly to one side the merits of whether the home arrests were constitutional, we cannot say that only a plainly incompetent policeman could have thought them permissible at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d where officers entered a home without a warrant in hot pursuit of misdemeanor suspects who had defied the officers\xe2\x80\x99 order to remain outside (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNotwithstanding this basic disagreement, the Ninth Circuit below denied Stanton qualified immunity.  In its one-paragraph analysis on the hot pursuit point, the panel relied on two cases, one from this Court, Welsh v. Wisconsin, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 740, \n750 (1984)\n, and one from its own, United States v. Johnson, 256 F.\xc2\xa03d 895, 908 (2001) (en banc)  (per curiam).  Neither case clearly establishes that Stanton violated Sims\xe2\x80\x99 \n \nFourth Amendment rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Welsh, police officers learned from a witness that Edward Welsh had driven his car off the road and then left the scene, presumably because he was drunk.  Acting on that tip, the officers went to Welsh\xe2\x80\x99s home without a warrant, entered without consent, and arrested him for driving while intoxicated\xe2\x80\x94a nonjailable traffic offense under state law.  466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 742\xe2\x80\x93743.  Our opinion first noted our precedent holding that hot pursuit of a fleeing felon justifies an officer\xe2\x80\x99s warrantless entry.  Id., at 750 (citing United States v. Santana, \n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 38\n\xe2\x80\x9343 (1976)).  But we rejected the suggestion that the hot pursuit exception applied: \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no immediate or continuous pursuit of [Welsh] from the scene of a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 753.  We went on to conclude that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry violated the \n \nFourth Amendment, finding it \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthere [was] probable cause to believe that only a minor offense . . . ha[d] been committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In those circumstances, we said, \xe2\x80\x9capplication of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But we did not lay down a categorical rule for all cases involving minor offenses, saying only that a warrant is \xe2\x80\x9cusually\xe2\x80\x9d required.  Id., at 750.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Johnson, police officers broke into Michael Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s fenced yard in search of another person (Steven Smith) whom they were attempting to apprehend on five misdemeanor arrest warrants.  256 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 898\xe2\x80\x93900.  The Ninth Circuit was clear that this case, like Welsh, did not involve hot pursuit: \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts of this case simply are not covered by the \xe2\x80\x98hot pursuit\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d because Smith had escaped from the police 30 minutes prior and his where- abouts were unknown.  256 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 908.  The court held that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry required a warrant, in part because Smith was wanted for only misdemeanor offenses.  Then, in a footnote, the court said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn situations where an officer is truly in hot pursuit and the underlying offense is a felony, the \n \nFourth Amendment usually yields [to law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s interest in apprehending a fleeing suspect].  See [Santana, supra, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343].  However, in situations where the underlying offense is only a misdemeanor, law enforcement must yield to the \n \nFourth Amendment in all but the \xe2\x80\x98rarest\xe2\x80\x99 cases.  Welsh, [supra, at 753].\xe2\x80\x9d  Johnson, supra, at 908, n.\xc2\xa06.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn concluding\xe2\x80\x94as it must have\xe2\x80\x94that Stanton was \xe2\x80\x9cplainly incompetent,\xe2\x80\x9d al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12), the Ninth Circuit below read Welsh and the footnote in Johnson far too broadly.  First, both of those cases cited Santana with approval, a case that approved an officer\xe2\x80\x99s warrantless entry while in hot pursuit.  And though Santana involved a felony suspect, we did not expressly limit our holding based on that fact.  See 427 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 42 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe only remaining question is whether [the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s] act of retreating into her house could thwart an otherwise proper arrest.  We hold that it could not\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, to repeat, neither Welsh nor Johnson involved hot pursuit.  Welsh, supra, at 753; Johnson, supra, at 908.  Thus, despite our emphasis in Welsh on the fact that the crime at issue was minor\xe2\x80\x94indeed, a mere nonjailable civil offense\xe2\x80\x94nothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally important in cases of hot pursuit.  Third, even in the portion of Welsh cited by the Ninth Circuit below, our opinion is equivocal: We held not that warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant is never justified, but only that such entry should be rare.  466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 753.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is in fact how two California state courts have read Welsh.  In both People v. Lloyd, 216 Cal. App. 3d 1425, 1430, 265 Cal. Rptr. 422, 425 (1989), and In\xc2\xa0re Lavoyne M., 221 Cal. App. 3d 154, 159, 270 Cal. Rptr. 394, 396 (1990), the California Court of Appeal refused to limit the hot pursuit exception to felony suspects.  The court stated in Lloyd: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the pursuit into the home was based on an arrest set in motion in a public place, the fact that the offenses justifying the initial detention or arrest were misdemeanors is of no significance in determining the validity of the entry without a warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  216 Cal. App. 3d, at 1430, 265 Cal. Rptr., at 425.  It is especially troubling that the Ninth Circuit would conclude that Stanton was plainly incompetent\xe2\x80\x94and subject to personal liability for damages\xe2\x80\x94based on actions that were lawful according  to courts in the jurisdiction where he acted.  Cf. al-Kidd, supra, at ___ (Kennedy, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x934).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, our determination that Welsh and Johnson are insufficient to overcome Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s qualified immunity is bolstered by the fact that, even after Johnson, two different District Courts in the Ninth Circuit have granted qualified immunity precisely because the law regarding warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established.  See Kolesnikov v. Sacramento County, No. S\xe2\x80\x9306\xe2\x80\x932155, 2008 WL 1806193, *7 (ED Cal., Apr. 22, 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9csince Welsh, it has not been clearly established that there can never be warrantless home arrests in the context of a \xe2\x80\x98hot pursuit\xe2\x80\x99 of a suspect fleeing from the commission of misdemeanor offenses\xe2\x80\x9d); Garcia v. Imperial, No. 08\xe2\x80\x932357, 2010 WL 3834020, *6, n.\xc2\xa04 (SD Cal., Sept. 28, 2010).  In Garcia, a case with facts similar to those here, the District Court distinguished Johnson as a case where \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers were not in hot pursuit of the suspect, had not seen the suspect enter the neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s property, and had no real reason to think the suspect was there.\xe2\x80\x9d  2010 WL 3834020, *6, n.\xc2\xa04.  Precisely the same facts distinguish this case from Johnson: Stanton was in hot pursuit of Patrick, he did see Patrick enter Sims\xe2\x80\x99 property, and he had every reason to believe that Patrick was just beyond Sims\xe2\x80\x99 gate.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6\xe2\x80\x937, 17.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo summarize the law at the time Stanton made his split-second decision to enter Sims\xe2\x80\x99 yard: Two opinions of this Court were equivocal on the lawfulness of his entry; two opinions of the State Court of Appeal affirmatively authorized that entry; the most relevant opinion of the Ninth Circuit was readily distinguishable; two Federal District Courts in the Ninth Circuit had granted qualified immunity in the wake of that opinion; and the federal and state courts of last resort around the Nation were sharply divided.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not express any view on whether Officer Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s entry into Sims\xe2\x80\x99 yard in pursuit of Patrick was constitutional.  But whether or not the constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct, it was not \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  al-Kidd, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9).
