Indeed, a judgment is constituted a lien by the constitution and laws of Pennsylvania, in the nature of a mortgage; and it must ultimately be satisfied out of the real estate, without regard to the process, either against person, or goods, to which a plaintiff may first resort. 1 State Laws, 262. The law in England is different. There a ca. sa. was considered so complete a satisfaction, that if the debtor died in prison, the creditor had lost all remedy, till the statute of 21 Jac. 1. c. 24. was enacted to afford him relief. But there are sufficient reasons, for the difference. In England, real estate cannot be sold, for the payment of debts, as it may in Pennsylvania. In England, too, the insolvent acts are gratuitous, and occasional; temporary in duration, and restricted in objects; but in Pennsylvania, they are constitutionally ordained; permanent, and universal. Const. art. 9. s. 16. </p><p> W. Tilghman, for the assignees of Ruston, contended, that Coates had lost the lien of his judgment, by issuing a ca. sa. That a ca. sa. amounts to a legal satisfaction of the debt, is the settled law of England; and there is no reason to depart from it here. 5 Co. Rep. 86. Bloomfield\'s case. Hob. 56-62. Nor can the terms, or the principles, of the insolvent law affect the case. The sheriff\'s sale was made on the 12th of July 1798, and Ruston was not discharged, until the 21st of November following; before which, the greater part of the purchase money had been actually paid to the sheriff. The state of the fact and the law, when the property was sold, and the price received, must govern the decision, not matter arising ex post facto. And the act of assembly, when it provides, for the distribution of the lands of the debtor, at the time of his discharge, can never be fairly construed, retrospectively, to unravel, revise, and cancel sales, and payments, and distributions, all regular at the time that they occurred. It is true, that the 17th section of the act continues in force all judgments, by which the debtor was bound, at the time of his discharge; but if the ca. sa. against the person, extinguished the lien upon the estate (which is the very point to be decided) then Ruston was not bound by Coates\'s judgment, at the time of his discharge; and such is the necessary exposition of the law, when </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 4 U.S. 214, 217</a></p><p> the 17th and 19th sections are considered together, as to the fund, the existing fund at the time of discharge, which is to be distributed among the creditors. The adverse doctrine, would give the execution creditor two remedies, contrary to the principles of the common law: it would open a door for collusion between the debtor, and his ca. sa. creditor: and it would involve the relative rights of creditors, in endless perplexity and uncertainty, whenever an insolvency of a debtor happened, or even the prospect of it was in view. </p><p></p><p> By the COURT: </p><p> The case appears so clear to us, that we do not wish another moment for consideration. The law is settled in England, that a ca. sa. operates as a satisfaction of the debt; as an extinguishment of the lien of the judgment. We have no other rule prescribed to us in Pennsylvania; nor can we conceive that there would be any policy, or justice, in departing from it. Ruston was in actual custody, upon Coates\'s ca. sa. when the land was sold. He had no lien, no claim, to the proceeds of the sale, at that time; and we can perceive nothing, in the fact, or the law, of the case, which has since revived his old right, or given him a new one, to the land itself, or to any part of the purchase money. </p><p> The rule must, therefore, be discharged. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> or at any time thereafter shall or may be any ways seised or possessed of, interested in, or entitled to, in law or equity, except the necessary wearing apparel and bedding for himself and his family; and if he be a mechanic of manufacturer, his tools, not exceeding in value the sum of fifty dollars; and it shall and may be lawful for any of his creditors, or his or their executors or administrators, to take out a new execution against the lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods and chattels of such debtor, except as before excepted, for the satisfaction of their debts respectively, in the same manner and form as they might have done, if the said debtor had never been taken in execution, any act, statute, law or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.\' <p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
