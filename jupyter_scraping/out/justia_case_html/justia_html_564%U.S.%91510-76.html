Alleging that the accident was caused by tire failure, they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and petitioners, three Goodyear USA subsidiaries, organized and operating, respectively, in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 tires are manufactured primarily for European and Asian markets and differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United States.  Petitioners are not registered to do business in North Carolina; have no place of business, employees, or bank accounts in the State; do not design, manufacture, or advertise their products in the State; and do not solicit business in the State or sell or ship tires to North Carolina customers.  Even so, a small percentage of their tires were distributed in North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates.  The trial court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the North Carolina courts had general jurisdiction over petitioners, whose tires had reached the State through \xe2\x80\x9cthe stream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Petitioners were not amenable to suit in North Carolina on claims unrelated to any activity of petitioners in the forum State.

The pathmarking decision of <em>International Shoe Co.</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/310/index.html">326 U. S. 310</a>, provides that state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has \xe2\x80\x9ccertain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \xe2\x80\x98traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 316.  Endeavoring to give specific content to the \xe2\x80\x9cfair play and substantial justice\xe2\x80\x9d concept, the Court in <em>International Shoe</em> classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants.  First, the Court recognized that jurisdiction could be asserted where the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s in-state activity is \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x9d and<em> </em>gave rise to the episode-in-suit.  <em>Id.,</em> at 317.  It also observed that the commission of \xe2\x80\x9csingle or occasional acts\xe2\x80\x9d in a State may be sufficient to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum connections.  <em>Id.</em>, at 318.  These two categories compose what is now known as \xe2\x80\x9cspecific jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A.</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/408/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/408/index.html">466 U. S. 408</a>, 414, n.\xc2\xa08.  <em>International Shoe</em> distinguished from cases that fit within the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d categories, \xe2\x80\x9cinstances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U. S., at 318.  Adjudicatory authority so grounded is now called \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Helicopteros,</em> 466 U. S., at 414, n.\xc2\xa09.  Since <em>International Shoe</em>, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction.  In only two decisions postdating <em>International Shoe</em> has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate defendant\xe2\x80\x99s in-state contacts were sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x9d to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those contacts: <em>Perkins</em> v. <em>Benguet Consol. Mining Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/437/index.html">342 U. S. 437</a>; and <em>Helicopteros</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/408/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/408/index.html">466 U. S. 408</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Petitioners lack \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to allow North Carolina to entertain a suit against them unrelated to anything that connects them to the State.  <em>Helicopteros</em>, 466 U. S., at 416.  The stream-of-commerce cases on which the North Carolina court relied relate to exercises of specific jurisdiction in products liability actions, in which a nonresident defendant, acting <em>outside</em> the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes harm <em>inside</em> the forum.  Many state long-arm statutes authorize courts to exercise specific jurisdiction over manufacturers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred within the forum State.  The North Carolina court\xe2\x80\x99s stream-of-commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case-specific and general jurisdiction.  Flow of a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s products into the forum may bolster an affiliation germane to <em>specific</em> jurisdiction, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</em> v. <em>Woodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/286/index.html">444 U. S. 286</a>, 297; but ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdiction over a defendant.  A corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous activity of some sorts within a state,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>International Shoe </em>instructed, \xe2\x80\x9cis not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U. S., at 318.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Measured against <em>Helicopteros </em>and <em>Perkins</em>, North Carolina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to general jurisdiction.  In the 1952 <em>Perkins </em>case<em>, </em>general jurisdiction was appropriately exercised over a Philippine corporation sued in Ohio, where the company\xe2\x80\x99s affairs were overseen during World War II.  In <em>Helicopteros, </em>however<em>, </em>the survivors of U. S. citizens killed when a helicopter owned by a Colombian corporation crashed in Peru could not maintain wrongful-death actions against that corporation in Texas, where the company\xe2\x80\x99s contacts \xe2\x80\x9cconsisted of sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a Texas enterprise]; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 416.  These links to Texas did not \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts \xe2\x80\xa6 found to exist in <em>Perkins,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and were insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ar[o]se out of\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 no[r] related to\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Texas.  <em>Id.</em>, at 415\xe2\x80\x93416.  This Court sees no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in <em>Helicopteros</em>, the sales of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 tires sporadically made in North Carolina through intermediaries.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 discrete status as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary business,\xe2\x80\x9d so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in the subsidiaries as well.

We address, in particular, this question: Are foreign subsidiaries of a United States parent corporation amenable to suit in state court on claims unrelated to any activity of the subsidiaries in the forum State?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A bus accident outside Paris that took the lives of two 13-year-old boys from North Carolina gave rise to the liti-gation we here consider.  Attributing the accident to a defective tire manufactured in Turkey at the plant of a foreign subsidiary of The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear USA), the boys\xe2\x80\x99 parents commenced an action for damages in a North Carolina state court; they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and three of its subsidiaries, organized and operating, respectively, in Turkey, France, and Luxembourg.  Goodyear USA, which had plants in North Carolina and regularly engaged in commercial activity there, did not contest the North Carolina court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear USA\xe2\x80\x99s foreign subsidiaries, however, maintained that North Carolina lacked adjudicatory authority over them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A state court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants to the State\xe2\x80\x99s coercive power, and is therefore subject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.  <em>International Shoe\nCo.</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/310/index.html"></a><a href="/us/326/310/index.html">326 U.

S. 457</a>, 463 (1940))).  Opinions in the wake of the pathmarking <em>International Shoe</em> decision have differentiated between general or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or case-linked jurisdiction.  <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A.</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/408/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/408/index.html">466 U. S. 408</a>, 414, nn. 8, 9 (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x9d as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.  See <em>International Shoe</em>, 326 U. S., at 317.  Specific jurisdiction, on the other hand, depends on an \xe2\x80\x9caffiliatio[n] between the forum and the underlying controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d principally, activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulation.  von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren &amp; Trautman); see Brilmayer et al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 721, 782 (1988) (hereinafter Brilmayer).  In contrast to general, all-purpose jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of \xe2\x80\x9cissues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1136.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the episode-in-suit, the bus accident, occurred in France, and the tire alleged to have caused the accident was manufactured and sold abroad, North Carolina courts lacked specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals so acknowledged.  <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Meter</em>, 199 N.\xc2\xa0C. App. 50, 57\xe2\x80\x9358, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 382, 388 (2009).  Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless amenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts?  Confusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional inquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes.  Some of the tires made abroad by Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s foreign subsidiaries, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had reached North Carolina through \xe2\x80\x9cthe stream of commerce\xe2\x80\x9d; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed, gave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the exercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corporations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 67\xe2\x80\x9368, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 394\xe2\x80\x93395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A connection so limited between the forum and the for-eign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the exercise of general jurisdiction.  Such a connection does not establish the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x9d affiliation necessary to empower North Carolina courts to entertain claims unrelated to the foreign corporation\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the State.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 18, 2004, a bus destined for Charles de Gaulle Airport overturned on a road outside Paris, France.  Passengers on the bus were young soccer players from North Carolina beginning their journey home.  Two 13-year-olds, Julian Brown and Matthew Helms, sustained fatal injuries.  The boys\xe2\x80\x99 parents, respondents in this Court, filed a suit for wrongful-death damages in the Superior Court of Onslow County, North Carolina, in their capacity as administrators of the boys\xe2\x80\x99 estates.  Attributing the accident to a tire that failed when its plies separated, the parents alleged negligence in the \xe2\x80\x9cdesign, construction, testing, and inspection\xe2\x80\x9d of the tire.  199 N.\xc2\xa0C. App., at 51, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 384 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Goodyear Luxembourg Tires, SA (Goodyear Luxembourg), Goodyear Lastikleri T.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. (Goodyear Turkey), and Goodyear Dunlop Tires France, SA (Goodyear France), petitioners here, were named as defendants.  Incorporated in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France, respectively, petitioners are indirect subsidiaries of Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation also named as a defendant in the suit.  Petitioners manufacture tires primarily for sale in European and Asian markets.  Their tires differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United States.  They are designed to carry significantly heavier loads, and to serve under road conditions and speed limits in the manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 primary markets.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the parent company, Goodyear USA, which does not contest the North Carolina courts\xe2\x80\x99 personal jurisdiction over it, petitioners are not registered to do business in North Carolina.  They have no place of business, employees, or bank accounts in North Carolina.  They do not design, manufacture, or advertise their products in North Carolina.  And they do not solicit business in North Carolina or themselves sell or ship tires to North Carolina customers.  Even so, a small percentage of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 tires (tens of thousands out of tens of millions manufactured between 2004 and 2007) were distributed within North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates.  These tires were typically custom ordered to equip specialized vehicles such as cement mixers, waste haulers, and boat and horse trailers.  Petitioners state, and respondents do not here deny, that the type of tire involved in the accident, a Goodyear Regional RHS tire manufactured\nby Goodyear Turkey, was never distributed in North Carolina.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction.  The trial court denied the motion, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals af-firmed.  Acknowledging that the claims neither \xe2\x80\x9crelated\nto, nor \xe2\x80\xa6 ar[o]se from, [petitioners\xe2\x80\x99] contacts with North Carolina,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals confined its analysis to \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rather than specific jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d which the court recognized required a \xe2\x80\x9chigher threshold\xe2\x80\x9d showing: A defendant must have \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic contacts\xe2\x80\x9d with the forum.  <em>Id.</em>, at 58, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 388 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That threshold was crossed, the court determined, when petitioners placed their tires \xe2\x80\x9cin the stream of interstate commerce without any limitation on the extent to which those tires could be sold in North Carolina.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 67, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 394.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the record, the court observed, indicated\nthat petitioners \xe2\x80\x9ctook any affirmative action to cause tires which they had manufactured to be shipped into North Carolina.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 64, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 392.  The court found, however, that tires made by petitioners reached North Carolina as a consequence of a \xe2\x80\x9chighly-organized distribution process\xe2\x80\x9d involving other Goodyear USA subsidiaries. <em> Id.</em>, at 67, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 394.  Petitioners, the court noted, made \xe2\x80\x9cno attempt to keep these tires from reaching the North Carolina market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 66, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 393.  Indeed, the very tire involved in the accident, the court observed, conformed to tire standards established by the U. S. Department of Transportation and bore markings required for sale in the United States.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  As further support, the court invoked North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in providing a forum in which its citizens are able to seek redress for [their] injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d and noted the hardship North Carolina plaintiffs would experience \xe2\x80\x9c[were they] required to litigate their claims in France,\xe2\x80\x9d a country to which they have no ties.  <em>Id.</em>, at 68, 681 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 394.

For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual\xe2\x80\x99s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.

Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \xc2\xa78640.40, p. 133 (rev. ed. 2007).  Typically, in such cases, a nonresident defendant, acting <em>outside</em> the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes harm <em>inside</em> the forum.  See generally Dayton, Personal Jurisdiction and the Stream of Commerce, 7 Rev.

Flow of a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s products into the forum, we have explained, may bolster an affiliation germane to <em>specific</em> jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>, 444 U. S., at 297 (where \xe2\x80\x9cthe sale of a product \xe2\x80\xa6 is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve \xe2\x80\xa6 the market for its product in [several] States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one\nof those States if its allegedly defective merchandise <em>has there been the source of injury to its owner or to others</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (em-phasis added)).  But ties serving to bolster the exercise\nof specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has <em>general</em> jurisdiction over a defendant.

Although the claim-in-suit did not arise in Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due process for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see <em>Keeton</em> v. <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/770/index.html">465 U.

The Colombian corporation had no place of business in Texas and was not licensed to do business there.  \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, [the company\xe2\x80\x99s] contacts with Texas consisted of sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a\ncontract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a Texas enterprise] for substantial sums; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U.

These links to Texas, we determined, did not \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts \xe2\x80\xa6 found to exist in <em>Perkins,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and were insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither \xe2\x80\x9car[o]se out of \xe2\x80\xa6 no[r] related to\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Texas.  <em>Id.</em>, at 415\xe2\x80\x93416 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Helicopteros </em>concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cmere purchases [made in the forum State], even if occurring at regular intervals, are not enough to warrant a State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of [general] jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 418.  We see no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in <em>Helicopteros</em>, the sales of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 tires sporadically made in North Carolina through intermediaries.  Under the sprawling view of general jurisdiction urged by respondents and embraced by the North Carolina Court of Appeals, any substantial manufacturer or seller of goods would be amenable to suit, on any claim for relief, wherever its products are distributed.  But cf. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>, 444 U.

Unlike the defendant in <em>Perkins</em>, whose sole wartime business activity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at home in North Carolina.  Their attenuated connections to the State, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, fall far short of the \xe2\x80\x9cthe continuous and systematic general business contacts\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against them on claims unrelated to anything that connects them to the State.  <em>Helicopteros</em>, 466 U.
