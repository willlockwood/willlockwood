It is the filing of the writ that removes the record from the inferior to the appellate court, and the period of limitation prescribed by the act of congress must be calculated accordingly."</p>\n<p>This case is cited with approval in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/73/355/case.html">Mussina v.
