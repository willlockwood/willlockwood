S. 416</a>, 448 (1983)-that the limitation to physicians was valid. <i>Casey, supra, </i>at 884-885. We found that "[s]ince there is no evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the information as provided by the statute would amount in practical terms to a <i>substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion, ... </i>it is not an undue burden." 505 U. S., at 884-885 (emphasis added). The District Court, quoting this precise passage, held: "There exists insufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion [that] the requirement that a licensed physician perform an abortion would amount, \'in practical terms, to a <i>substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.\' </i>Accordingly, it is unlikely that [respondents] will prevail upon their suggestion that the requirement constitutes an \'undue burden\' within the meaning of <i>Casey." </i>906 F.

But even assuming the correctness of the Court of Appeals\' implicit premise-that a legislative <i>purpose </i>to interfere with the constitutionally protected right to abortion without the <i>effect </i>of interfering with that right (here it is uncontested that there was insufficient evidence of a "substantial obstacle" to abortion) could render the Montana law invalid-there is no basis for finding a vitiating legislative purpose here. We do not assume unconstitutional legislative intent even when statutes produce harmful results, see, <i>e. g., Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 246 (1976); much less do we assume it when the results are harmless. One searches the Court of Appeals\' opinion in vain for any mention of any evidence suggesting an unlawful motive on the part of the Montana Legislature. If the motion at issue here were a defendant\'s motion for summary judgment, and if the plaintiff\'s only basis for proceeding with the suit were a claim of improper legislative purpose, one would demand <i>some </i>evidence of that improper purpose in order to avoid a nonsuit. And what is at issue here is not even a defendant\'s motion for summary judgment, but a plaintiff\'s motion for preliminary injunctive relief, as to which the requirement for substantial proof is much higher. "It frequently is observed that a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, <i>by </i>a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion." llA C.

Respondents contend that "the only extant study comparing the complication rates for first-trimester abortions performed by [physicianassistants] with those for first-trimester abortions performed by physicians found no significant difference." <i>Ibid. </i>But this line of argument is squarely foreclosed by <i>Casey </i>itself. In the course of upholding the physician-only requirement at issue in that case, we emphasized that "[o]ur cases reflect the fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, <i>even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others." </i>505 U.

The dissent does not claim that this was an unconstitutional bill of attainder, nor was that the basis on which the Court of Appeals relied. (Such a contention would be implausible as applied to a provision so commonplace as to exist in 40 other States, see n. 1, <i>supra.) </i>And the basis on which the Court of Appeals <i>did </i>rely (that the purpose of the law may have been to create a "substantial obstacle" to abortion) is positively contradicted by the fact that only a single practitioner is affected.

All this strongly supports the District Court\'s finding, after hearing testimony, that there was insufficient evidence that the law created a "substantial obstacle" to abortion. And there is simply no evidence that the legislature intended the law to do what it plainly did not do.2</p><p>The Court of Appeals\' decision is also contradicted by our repeated statements in past cases-none of which was so much as cited by the Court of Appeals, despite the District Court\'s discussion of two of them-that the performance of abortions may be restricted to physicians.

First, as already noted, the Court of Appeals\' decision is clearly erroneous under our precedents.3 Second, the lower court\'s judgment has produced immediate consequences for Montana-in the form of a Rule 62(c) injunction against implementation of its law pending the District Court\'s resolution of respondents\' motion for a preliminary injunction-and has created a real threat of such consequences for the six other States in the Ninth Circuit that have physician-only requirements.4 Indeed, plaintiffs</p><p>3 The dissent says that the Court of Appeals did not resolve any important issue of law in this case, but instead merely remanded to the District Court after "determin[ing] that a further inquiry into the facts [was] appropriate." <i>Post, </i>at 981.

Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 458.327(1) (Supp. 1997), but there is no reason to think it would not violate the more specific prohibition on the performance of abortions by persons other than "a doctor of medicine or osteopathic medicine licensed by the state under chapter 458 or chapter 459," Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 390.001(1)(a), 390.001(3) (1993). A formal opinion by the Attorney General of California has reached precisely this conclusion under that State\'s law: "[W]e cannot accept the notion that the Legislature meant to gainsay thEe] carefully tailored and highly specific determination [that abortions should be performed by licensed physicians] when it ... adopted the general language of the Physician Assistant Practice Act." 74 Op.

This statute banned physician assistants from performing abortions, provided that secondtrimester abortions could only be performed in licensed hospitals, and prohibited any form of advertising of abortion services.

The record strongly indicates that the physician assistant provision was aimed at excluding one specific person-respondent Cahillfrom the category of persons who could perform abortions. Although this is not apparent on the face of the statute, the parties agree that because Cahill is the only physician assistant who performs abortions in the State of Montana, she is the only person affected by the ban.

In determining whether the "requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult," within the meaning of <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </i>v. <i>Casey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/case.html">505 U.

The statute removed the only physician assistant in the State who could perform abortions, yet there was no evidence that her practice posed any greater health risks than those performed by doctors with the assistance of unlicensed personnel. When one looks at the totality of circumstances surrounding the legislation, there is evidence from which one could conclude that the legislature\'s predominant motive was to make abortions more difficult.</p><p>In any event, the Court of Appeals did not reach the constitutional issue that is presented by this litigation. The Court of Appeals simply remanded this action to the District Court because it found that the District Court had unduly confined its analysis of what constitutes an impermissible purpose. Although the parties stipulated to the entry of a limited injunction pending appeal that temporarily protects Cahill and no one else, there is no indication yet from either the District Court or the Court of Appeals that either a permanent or preliminary injunction will ever be entered against enforcement of the physician-only provision of the statute.</p><p>As I read the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the District Court, this case involves an extremely narrow issue concerning the State\'s power to reduce by one the small number of professionals in Montana who can lawfully perform abortions in that State. I do not perceive the slightest threat to the 40 "physician only" laws cited at the outset of the Court\'s opinion, particularly since some of these States might allow licensed assistants to perform abortions under the supervision of a physician as was the practice in Montana prior to 1995.7 Because physician assistants working under</p><p>7 Some of the States that have physician-only laws also have statutes that broadly define the medical duties that physicians can delegate to physician assistants.
