When there, he received from McKeon a quantity of fur garments, part of McKeon\'s stock.  The garments had not been purchased of plaintiffs in error, and when they were received by Rothschild, Jr., for plaintiffs in error he knew McKeon was insolvent.</p>\n<p>The furs were sent to the railroad station in trunks, checked and taken to New York as the personal baggage of Rothschild, Jr.  A receipted bill or list of the goods was delivered by McKeon to Rothschild, Jr.  Subsequently, however, in New York it was testified that McKeon</p>\n<p>"tore from the bill the receipt and wrote on the bill the word abbreviation \'Memo.\' to indicate that the goods were on memorandum or consignment, and the defendant said that he would write to his bookkeeper that night and have the entry in his books made to conform with the bill by writing in the word \'Memo.\'"</p>\n<p>This was done by the advice of the attorney of plaintiffs in error, and so stated by him in an affidavit filed in an action brought by plaintiffs in error in the Supreme Court of the City and County of New York against McKeon.</p>\n<p>The advice was given, the attorney deposed, in order to make the transaction appear what it was stated in his presence to be -- that is, for security only, and not for the sale of the goods, and he advised a suit by plaintiffs in error against McKeon and an attachment of the goods.

On October 12, following, defendant in error (plaintiff) moved to amend his declaration, to which counsel for plaintiffs in error consented, and it was allowed.  Plaintiffs in error filed an answer denying each and every allegation in the original and amended declaration.  On June 21, 1897, the defendant in error again amended his declaration with the consent of E. N. Hill, Esq., who was then acting as counsel for plaintiffs in error, having been retained generally by plaintiffs in error, though his written appearance was not entered until June 26.  By virtue of his general authority, he could consent to the allowance of amendments.

JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A motion is made to dismiss the writ of error upon the ground that no federal question was raised in the superior court.  Federal questions were raised, however, on writ of error to the supreme court, and that, we think, was a sufficient claim.  <em>Meyer v. Richmond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/172/82/case.html">172 U. S. 82</a></span>; <em>Arrowsmith v.

American National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/178/289/case.html">178 U. S. 289</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The objection that the writ of error should have been directed to the supreme court, and not to the superior court, is answered by <em>McDonald v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/180/311/case.html">180 U. S. 311</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The constitutional questions raised by plaintiffs in error are (1) that they have been deprived of their property without due process of law; (2) that, if the judgment be allowed to stand, it will impair the obligation of contracts, contrary to the Constitution of the United States; (3) that full faith and credit was not given to certain judicial proceedings had in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.</p>\n<p>(1) (2) These grounds may be considered together.  To sustain them, plaintiffs in error assert the invalidity of certain public statutes of Massachusetts, <em>viz.,</em> chapter 164, relating to absent defendants; chapter 183, relating to the trustee process, and chapter 157, relating to insolvency.</p>\n<p>The sections in regard to insolvency are inserted in the margin. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/334/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 184 U. S. 340</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The provisions relating to trustee process are as follows:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 21. When a person who is summoned as trustee has goods, effects, or credits of the defendant entrusted or deposited in his hands or possession, such goods, effects, and credits shall be thereby attached and held to respond to the final judgment in the suit, in like manner as goods or estate attached by the ordinary process, except as hereinafter provided."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 25.  Any money or other things due to the defendant may be attached, as herein mentioned, before it has become payable, if it is due absolutely and without any contingency; but the trustee shall not be compelled to pay or deliver it before the time appointed by the contract."</p>\n<p>It is difficult to state the argument made to support the contention of plaintiffs in error.  It rests ultimately on a claim of immunity from suit in Massachusetts and a claim of immunity from attachment of debts due plaintiffs in error from citizens of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 184 U. S. 341</a></p><p> Massachusetts.  Argumentatively, it is said that the action originally brought did not justify trustee process, and that the amendments subsequently made to the declaration were not authorized, though consented to by counsel who appeared in and conducted the case.  We do not assent to either proposition.</p>\n<p>To what actions the remedy of attachment may be given is for the legislature of a state to determine and its courts to decide, and the power of counsel certainly extends to consenting to amendments authorized by the laws of the state.  Indeed, it would be novel to hold that the court could not have granted the amendments, even against the opposition of counsel, without violating the Constitution of the United States.  And the contention that the debts due to plaintiffs in error by certain citizens in Massachusetts were not subject to attachment in that state because their situs was in New York cannot be maintained.  We decided adversely to the proposition in <em>Chicago, Rock Island &amp;c. Ry. v. Sturm,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/174/710/case.html">174 U. S. 710</a></span>.  That case was followed and applied in <em>King v. Cross,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/175/396/case.html">175 U. S. 396</a></span>, and we are satisfied with the reasoning of both cases.</p>\n<p>But it is urged that the transaction between McKeon and the agent of the plaintiffs in error did not constitute a debt, but was in the nature of an offense to which a penalty was incident, and to the commission of the offense an intent was necessary, and that the intent of the agent of plaintiffs in error could not be ascribed to them.  The supreme court of the state however, decided that</p>\n<p>"the action is not for the recovery of a penalty, but to recover the value of goods conveyed in fraud of the laws relating to insolvency, and it properly might be commenced by trustee process.  Pub.Sts. c. 157, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 96-98, c. 135, \xc2\xa7 1."</p>\n<p>We need only add that the law would be of little value if its prohibition did not apply to nonresident creditors, whether acting directly or through an agent.  That the conveyance to plaintiffs in error was made to give a fraudulent preference must necessarily have been found as a fact by the jury, and such finding we accept.</p>\n<p>(3) No record was introduced in evidence of the judicial proceedings to which, it is claimed, faith and credit were not given.  The only evidence in regard to the proceedings consisted of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 184 U. S. 342</a></p><p> the affidavit already referred to, and an affidavit of like import made by S. Rothschild, one of the plaintiffs in error.  The affidavits were introduced by defendants in error.  On behalf of plaintiffs in error, Frank J. Rothschild testified as follows:</p>\n<p>"These goods [meaning the goods received from McKeon] were attached by Simon Rothschild &amp; Bro., and were sold by order of the sheriff.  We bought them -- that is, Simon Rothschild &amp; Bro. bought them at the sheriff\'s sale."</p>\n<p>Assuming, but not deciding, that such evidence was sufficient, and that a record properly authenticated was not necessary to give the plaintiffs in error the benefit of the Constitution and statutory provisions, the proceedings, notwithstanding, did not constitute a defense to the action.  The preference given by McKeon to plaintiffs in error was consummated in Massachusetts.  Therefore the proceedings had in New York were immaterial.</p>\n<p>Finding no error in the record, judgment is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* The sections of the insolvency laws of Massachusetts under which the action was originally brought in the Superior Court of Massachusetts are sections 96 and 98 of chapter 157 of the Massachusetts Public Statutes, and are as follows:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 96.  If a person, being insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, within six months before the filing of the petition by or against him, with a view to give a preference to a creditor or person who has a claim against him or is under any liability for him, procures any part of his property to be attached, sequestered, or seized on execution or makes any payment, pledge, assignment, transfer, or conveyance of any part of his property, either directly or indirectly, absolutely or conditionally, the person receiving such payment, pledge, assignment, transfer, or conveyance, or to be benefited thereby, having reasonable cause to believe such person is insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, and that such payment, pledge, assignment, or conveyance is made in fraud of the laws relating to insolvency, the same shall be void, and the assignee may recover the property or the value of it from the person so receiving it or so to be benefited."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 98.  If a person, being insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, within six months before the filing of the petition by or against him, makes a sale, assignment, transfer, or other conveyance of any description, of any part of his property to a person who then has reasonable cause to believe him to be insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, and that such sale, assignment, transfer, or other conveyance is made with a view to prevent the property from coming to his assignee in insolvency, or to prevent the same from being distributed under the laws relating to insolvency, or to defeat the object of, or in any way to impair, hinder, impede, or delay the operation and effect of, or to evade any of said provisions, the sale, assignment, transfer, or conveyance shall be void, and the assignee may recover the property or the value thereof as assets of the insolvency. And if such sale, assignment, transfer, or conveyance is not made in the usual and ordinary course of business of the debtor, that fact shall be <em>prima facie</em> evidence of such cause of belief."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
