The prior act fixed the tax at three per cent. of the market value of the oil at the time and place of severance, and the amendatory act makes it a graduated tax ranging from 4 to 11 cents per barrel according to the gravity of the oil.  As applied to the plaintiff\'s operations, the tax fixed by the amendatory act is about $12,000 more in each period of three months than the tax under the prior act would be for the like period.  While admitting the validity of the prior act and declaring a willingness and readiness to pay the tax imposed thereby, the plaintiff alleges that the changed and enlarged tax imposed by the amendatory act is invalid in that that act, as applied to the plaintiff\'s operations, contravenes the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and also a provision of the Constitution of the state requiring that severance taxes be predicated upon \'"either the quantity or value" of the product at the time and place of its severance.</p>\n<p>The parties are citizens of different states, and the matter in controversy exceeds in value the jurisdictional requirement.
