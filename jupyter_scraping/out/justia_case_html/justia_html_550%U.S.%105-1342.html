OCC is charged with supervision of the NBA and, thus, oversees the banks\xe2\x80\x99 operations and interactions with customers.  See <em>NationsBank of N. C., N. A.</em> v. <em>Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/251/index.html">513 U. S. 251</a>, 254, 256.  The NBA grants OCC, as part of its supervisory authority, visitorial powers to audit the banks\xe2\x80\x99 books and records, largely to the exclusion of other state or federal entities.  See \xc2\xa7484(a); 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4000.  The NBA specifically authorizes federally chartered banks to engage in real estate lending, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o exercise \xe2\x80\xa6 such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa724 Seventh.  Among incidental powers, national banks may conduct certain activities through \xe2\x80\x9coperating subsidiaries,\xe2\x80\x9d discrete entities authorized to engage solely in activities the bank itself could undertake, and subject to the same terms and conditions as the bank.

Michigan law exempts banks, both national and state, from state mortgage lending regulation, but requires their subsidiaries to register with the State\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Insurance and Financial Services (OIFS) and submit to state supervision.  Although Wachovia Mortgage initially complied with Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, it surrendered its Michigan registration once it became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Wachovia Bank.  Subsequently, petitioner Watters, the OIFS Commissioner, advised Wachovia Mortgage it would no longer be authorized to engage in mortgage lending in Michigan.  Respondents sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the NBA and OCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations preempt application of the relevant Michigan mortgage lending laws to a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s operating subsidiary.  Watters responded that, because Wachovia Mortgage was not itself a national bank, the challenged Michigan laws were applicable and were not preempted.  She also argued that the Tenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution prohibits OCC\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive regulation and supervision of national banks\xe2\x80\x99 lending activities conducted through operating subsidiaries.  Rejecting those arguments, the Federal District Court granted the Wachovia plaintiffs summary judgment in relevant part, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage business, whether conducted by the bank itself or through the bank\xe2\x80\x99s operating subsidiary, is subject to OCC\xe2\x80\x99s superintendence, and not to the licensing, reporting, and visitorial regimes of the several States in which the subsidiary operates.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The NBA vests in nationally chartered banks enumerated powers and all \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d incidental powers.  12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724 Seventh.  To prevent inconsistent or intrusive state regulation, the NBA provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law \xe2\x80\xa6 .\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7484(a).  Federally chartered banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or purposes of the NBA.  But when state prescriptions significantly impair the exercise of authority, enumerated or incidental under the NBA, the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulations must give way.  E.g., Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/25/index.html">517 U. S. 25</a>, 32\xe2\x80\x9334.  The NBA expressly authorizes national banks to engage in mortgage lending, subject to OCC regulation, \xc2\xa7371(a).  State law may not significantly burden a bank\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of that power, see, <em>e.g., Barnett Bank</em>, 517 U. S., at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  In particular, real estate lending, when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial control: The NBA specifically vests exclusive authority to examine and inspect in OCC.  12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a).  The Michigan provisions at issue exempt national banks themselves from coverage.  This is not simply a matter of the Michigan Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s grace.  For, as the parties recognize, the NBA would spare a national bank from state controls of the kind here involved.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Since 1966, OCC has recognized national banks\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d authority under \xc2\xa724 Seventh to do business through operating subsidiaries.  See 12 CFR \xc2\xa75.34(e)(1).  That authority is uncontested by Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s Commissioner.  OCC licenses and oversees national bank operating subsidiaries just as it does national banks.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa75.34(e)(3); 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724a(g)(3)(A).  Just as duplicative state examination, supervision, and regulation would significantly burden national banks\xe2\x80\x99 mortgage lending, so too those state controls would interfere with that same activity when engaged in by a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s operating subsidiary.  This Court has never held that the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive reach extends only to a national bank itself; instead, the Court has focused on the exercise of a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s <em>powers</em>, not on its corporate structure, in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of a national bank.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>Barnett Bank</em>, 517 U. S., at 32.<em> </em>And the Court has treated operating subsidiaries as equivalent to national banks with respect to powers exercised under federal law (except where federal law provides otherwise).  See, <em>e.g., NationsBank</em>, 513 U. S., at 256\xe2\x80\x93251.  Security against significant interference by state regulators is a characteristic condition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe business of banking\xe2\x80\x9d conducted by national banks, and mortgage lending is one aspect of that business.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a).  That security should adhere whether the business is conducted by the bank itself or by an OCC-licensed operating subsidiary whose authority to carry on the business coincides completely with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Watters contends that if Congress meant to deny States visitorial powers over operating subsidiaries, it would have written \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on state inspection to apply not only to national banks but also to their affiliates.  She points out that \xc2\xa7481, which authorizes OCC to examine \xe2\x80\x9caffiliates\xe2\x80\x9d of national banks, does not speak to state visitorial powers.  This argument fails for two reasons.  <em>First</em>, any intention regarding operating subsidiaries cannot be ascribed to the 1864 Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7481 and 484, or the 1933 Congress that added the affiliate examination provisions to \xc2\xa7481 and the \xe2\x80\x9caffiliate\xe2\x80\x9d definition to \xc2\xa7221a, because operating subsidiaries were not authorized until 1966.  <em>Second</em>, Watters ignores the distinctions Congress recognized among \xe2\x80\x9caffiliates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike affiliates that may engage in functions not authorized by the NBA, an operating subsidiary is tightly tied to its parent by the specification that it may engage only in \xe2\x80\x9cthe business of banking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa724a(g)(3)(A).  Notably, when Congress amended the NBA to provide that operating subsidiaries may \xe2\x80\x9cengag[e] solely in activities that national banks are permitted to engage in directly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> it did so in an Act providing that other affiliates, authorized to engage in nonbanking financial activities, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>securities and insurance, are subject to state regulation in connection with those activities.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71843(k), 1844(c)(4).  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Recognizing the necessary consequence of national banks\xe2\x80\x99 authority to engage in mortgage lending through an operating subsidiary \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of such activities by national banks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa724a(g)(3)(A), OCC promulgated 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4006: \xe2\x80\x9cUnless otherwise provided by Federal law or OCC regulation, State laws apply to national bank operating subsidiaries to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  Watters disputes OCC\xe2\x80\x99s authority to promulgate this regulation and contends that, because preemption is a legal question for determination by courts, \xc2\xa77.4006 should attract no deference.  This argument is beside the point, for \xc2\xa77.4006 merely clarifies and confirms what the NBA already conveys: A national bank may engage in real estate lending through an operating subsidiary, subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the bank itself; that power cannot be significantly impaired or impeded by state law.  Though state law governs incorporation-related issues, state regulators cannot interfere with the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness of banking\xe2\x80\x9d by subjecting national banks or their OCC-licensed operating subsidiaries to multiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Watters\xe2\x80\x99 alternative argument, that 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4006 violates the Tenth Amendment, is unavailing.  The Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation to the States of a power delegated to Congress in the Constitution, <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U.

It is uncontested in this suit that Wachovia\xe2\x80\x99s real estate business, if conducted by the national bank itself, would be subject to OCC\xe2\x80\x99s superintendence, to the exclusion of state registration requirements and visitorial authority.  The question in dispute is whether the bank\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage lending activities remain outside the governance of state licensing and auditing agencies when those activities are conducted, not by a division or department of the bank, but by the bank\xe2\x80\x99s operating subsidiary.

Three months later, Wachovia Mortgage advised the State of Michigan that it was surrendering its mortgage lending registration.  Because it had become an operating subsidiary of a national bank, Wachovia Mortgage maintained, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s registration and inspection requirements were preempted.  Watters responded with a letter advising Wachovia Mortgage that it would no longer be authorized to conduct mortgage lending activities in Michigan.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wachovia Mortgage and Wachovia Bank filed suit against Watters, in her official capacity as commissioner, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting Watters from enforcing Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s registration prescriptions against Wachovia Mortgage, and from interfering with OCC\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive visitorial authority.  The NBA and regulations promulgated thereunder, they urged, vest supervisory authority in OCC and preempt the application of the state-law controls at issue.  Specifically, Wachovia Mortgage and Wachovia Bank challenged as preempted certain provisions of two Michigan statutes\xe2\x80\x94the Mortgage Brokers, Lenders, and Services Licensing Act and the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act.  The challenged provisions (1) require mortgage lenders\xe2\x80\x94including national bank operating subsidiaries but not national banks themselves\xe2\x80\x94to register and pay fees to the State before they may conduct banking activities in Michigan, and authorize the commissioner to deny or revoke registrations, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1652(1) (West Supp. 2006), 445.1656(1)(d) (West 2002), 445.1657(1), 445.1658, 445.1679(1)(a), 493.52(1) (West 1998), 493.53a(d), 493.54, 493.55(4), 493.56a(2), and 493.61; (2) require submission of annual financial statements to the commissioner and retention of certain documents in a particular format, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1657(2) (West 2002), 445.1671, 493.56a(2) (West 1998); (3) grant the commissioner inspection and enforcement authority over registrants, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1661 (West 2002), 493.56b (West Supp. 2005); and (4) authorize the commissioner to take regulatory or enforcement actions against covered lenders, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1665 (West 2002), 445.1666, 493.58\xe2\x80\x9359, and 493.62a (West 1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response, Watters argued that, because Wachovia Mortgage was not itself a national bank, the challenged Michigan controls were applicable and were not preempted.

She points out that \xc2\xa7481, which authorizes OCC to examine \xe2\x80\x9caffiliates\xe2\x80\x9d of national banks, does not speak to state visitorial powers.  This argument fails for two reasons.  <em>First</em>, one cannot ascribe any intention regarding operating subsidiaries to the 1864 Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7481 and 484, or the 1933 Congress that added the provisions on examining affiliates to \xc2\xa7481 and the definition of \xe2\x80\x9caffiliate\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7221a.  That is so because operating subsidiaries were not authorized until 1966.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11.  Over the past four decades, during which operating subsidiaries have emerged as important instrumentalities of national banks, Congress and OCC have indicated no doubt that such subsidiaries are \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the same terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d as national banks themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, Watters ignores the distinctions Congress recognized among \xe2\x80\x9caffiliates.\xe2\x80\x9d  The NBA broadly defines the term \xe2\x80\x9caffiliate\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany corporation\xe2\x80\x9d controlled by a national bank, including a subsidiary.  See 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7221a(b).  An operating subsidiary is therefore one type of \xe2\x80\x9caffiliate.\xe2\x80\x9d  But unlike affiliates that may engage in functions not authorized by the NBA, <em>e.g.</em>, financial subsidiaries,<em> </em>an operating subsidiary is tightly tied to its parent by the specification that it may engage only in \xe2\x80\x9cthe business of banking\xe2\x80\x9d as authorized by the Act.  \xc2\xa724a(g)(3)(A); 12 CFR \xc2\xa75.34(e)(1) (2006).

Nor has it authorized an executive agency to preempt such state laws whenever it concludes that they interfere with national bank activities.  Notwithstanding the absence of relevant statutory authority, today the Court endorses an agency\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect determination that the laws of a sovereign State must yield to federal power.  The significant impact of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the federal-state balance and the dual banking system makes it appropriate to set forth in full the reasons for my dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The National Bank Act (or NBA), 13 Stat. 99, authorized the incorporation of national banks, \xc2\xa75, <em>id.,</em> at 98, and granted them \xe2\x80\x9call such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa78, <em>id.,</em> at 98 (codified at 12 U. S. C. \xc2\xa724 Seventh), subject to regulatory oversight by the Comptroller of the Currency, \xc2\xa754, 13 Stat. 116.  To maintain a meaningful role for state legislation and for state corporations that did not engage in core banking activities, Congress circumscribed national bank authority.  Notably, national banks were expressly forbidden from making mortgage loans, \xc2\xa728, <em>id.,</em> at 108.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Moreover, the shares of national banks, as well their real estate holdings, were subject to nondiscriminatory state taxation, \xc2\xa741, <em>id.,</em> at 111; and while national banks could lend money, state law capped the interest rates they could charge, \xc2\xa720, <em>id.,</em> at 105.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Originally, it was anticipated that \xe2\x80\x9cexisting banks would surrender their state charters and re-incorporate under the terms of the new law with national charters.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That did not happen.  Instead, after an initial post-National Bank Act decline, state-chartered institutions thrived.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  What emerged was the competitive mix of state and national banks known as the dual banking system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has consistently recognized that because federal law is generally interstitial, national banks must comply with most of the same rules as their state counterparts.  As early as 1870, we articulated the principle that has remained the lodestar of our jurisprudence: that national banks</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9care only exempted from State legislation, so far as that legislation may interfere with, or impair their efficiency in performing the functions by which they are designed to serve that government\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. They are subject to the laws of the State, and are governed in their daily course of business far more by the laws of the State than of the nation.  All their contracts are governed and construed by State laws.  Their acquisition and transfer of property, their right to collect their debts, and their liability to be sued for debts, are all based on State law.  <em>It is only when the State law incapacitates the banks from discharging their duties to the government that it becomes unconstitutional</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Bank</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 9 Wall. 353, 362 (1870) (emphasis added).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nUntil today, we have remained faithful to the principle that nondiscriminatory laws of general application that do not \xe2\x80\x9cforbid\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimpair significantly\xe2\x80\x9d national bank activities should not be preempted.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/25/index.html">517 U.

Although the dual banking system\xe2\x80\x99s main virtue is its divergent treatment of national and state banks,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]<em> </em>Congress has consistently recognized that state law must usually govern the activities of both national and state banks for the dual banking system to operate effectively.  As early as 1934, Justice Brandeis observed for the Court that this congressional recognition is embodied in a long string of statutes:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe policy of equalization was adopted in the National Bank Act of 1864, and has ever since been applied, in the provision concerning taxation.  In amendments to that act and in the Federal Reserve Act and amendments thereto the policy is expressed in provisions conferring power to establish branches; in those conferring power to act as fiduciary; in those concerning interest on deposits; and in those concerning capitalization.  It appears also to have been of some influence in securing the grant in 1913 of the power to loan on mortgage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/559/index.html">292 U.

Bank in Plant City</em> v. <em>Dickinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/122/index.html">396 U. S. 122</a>, 133 (1969), that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of competitive equality is \xe2\x80\xa6 firmly embedded in the statutes governing the national banking system.\xe2\x80\x9d  So firmly embedded, in fact, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe congressional policy of competitive equality with its deference to state standards\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9copen to modification by the Comptroller of the Currency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 138.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the dual banking system has remained intact, Congress has radically transformed the national bank system from its Civil War antecedent and brought considerably more federal authority to bear on state-chartered institutions.  Yet despite all the changes Congress has made to the national bank system, and despite its exercise of federal power over state banks, it has never preempted state laws like those at issue in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most significantly, in 1913 Congress established the Federal Reserve System to oversee federal monetary policy through its influence over the availability of credit.  Federal Reserve Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72, 9, 38 Stat. 252, 259.  The Act required national banks and permitted state banks to become Federal Reserve member banks, and subjected all member banks to Federal Reserve regulations and oversight.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Also of signal importance, after the banking system collapsed during the Great Depression, Congress required all member banks to obtain deposit insurance from the newly established Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Banking Act of 1933 (or Glass-Steagall Act), \xc2\xa78, 48 Stat. 168; see also Banking Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 684.  Although both of these steps meant that many state banks were subjected to significant federal regulation,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cthe state banking system continued along with the national banking system, with no attempt to exercise preemptive federal regulatory authority over the activities of the existing state banks.\xe2\x80\x9d  M. Malloy, Banking and Financial Services Law 48 (2d ed. 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to these systemic overhauls, Congress has over time modified the powers of national banks.  The changes are too various to recount in detail, but two are of particular importance to this case.  First, Congress has gradually relaxed its prohibition on mortgage lending by national banks.  In 1913, Congress permitted national banks to make loans secured by farm land, Federal Reserve Act, \xc2\xa724, 38 Stat. 273, and in succeeding years, their mortgage-lending power was enlarged to cover loans on real estate in the vicinity of the bank, Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 754, and loans \xe2\x80\x9csecured by first liens upon forest tracts which are properly managed in all respects,\xe2\x80\x9d Act of Aug. 15, 1953, ch. 510, 67 Stat. 614.  Congress substantially expanded national banks\xe2\x80\x99 power to make real estate loans in 1974, see Housing and Community Development Act, Title VII, \xc2\xa7711, 88 Stat 716, and in 1982 it enacted the broad language, now codified at 12 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7371(a), authorizing national banks to make \xe2\x80\x9cloans \xe2\x80\xa6 secured by liens on interests in real estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, Title IV, \xc2\xa7403, 96 Stat. 1510.  While these changes have enabled national banks to engage in more evenhanded competition with state banks, they certainly reflect no purpose to give them any competitive advantage.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Congress has over the years both curtailed and expanded the ability of national banks to affiliate with other companies.  In the early part of the century, banks routinely engaged in investment activities and affiliated with companies that did the same.  The Glass-Steagall Act put an end to that.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]nacted in 1933 to protect bank depositors from any repetition of the widespread bank closings that occurred during the Great Depression,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Board of Governors, FRS </em>v. <em>Investment Company Institute,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/46/index.html">450 U. S. 46</a>, 61 (1981), Glass-Steagall prohibited Federal Reserve member banks (both state and national) from affiliating with investment banks.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In Congress\xe2\x80\x99 view, the affiliates had engaged in speculative activities that in turn contributed to commercial banks\xe2\x80\x99 Depression-era failures.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It was this focus on the welfare of depositors\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to stockholders\xe2\x80\x94that provided the basis for legislative action designed to ensure bank solvency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A scant two years later, Congress forbade national banks from owning the shares of any company because of a similar fear that such ownership could undermine the safety and soundness of national banks:[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cExcept as hereinafter provided or otherwise permitted by law, nothing herein contained shall authorize the purchase by [a national bank] for its own account of <em>any</em> shares of stock of <em>any</em> corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Banking Act of 1935, \xc2\xa7308(b), 49 Stat. 709 (emphasis added).  That provision remains on the books today.  See 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724 Seventh.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These congressional restrictions did not forbid all affiliations, however, and national banks began experimenting with new corporate forms.  One of those forms involved the national bank ownership of \xe2\x80\x9coperating subsidiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 1966, the Comptroller of the Currency took the position \xe2\x80\x9cthat a national bank may acquire and hold the controlling stock interest in a subsidiary operations corporation\xe2\x80\x9d so long as that corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunctions or activities \xe2\x80\xa6 are limited to one or several of the functions or activities that a national bank is authorized to carry on.\xe2\x80\x9d  31 Fed. Reg. 11459 (1966).  The Comptroller declined to read the categorical prohibition on national bank ownership of stock to foreclose bank ownership of operating subsidiaries, finding authority for this aggressive interpretation of national bank authority in the \xe2\x80\x9cincidental powers\xe2\x80\x9d provision of 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724 Seventh.  See 31 Fed. Reg. 11460.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Congress eventually restricted some of the new corporate structures,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] it neither disavowed nor endorsed the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s position on national bank ownership of operating subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding the congressional silence, in 1996 the OCC once again attempted to expand national banks\xe2\x80\x99 ownership powers.  The agency issued a regulation permitting national bank operating subsidiaries to undertake activities that the bank was <em>not</em> allowed to engage in directly.  12 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75.34(d), (f) (1997) (authorizing national banks to \xe2\x80\x9cacquire or establish an operating subsidiary to engage in [activities] different from that permissible for the parent national bank,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as those activities are \xe2\x80\x9cpart of or incidental to the business of banking, as determined by the Comptroller of the Currency\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 61 Fed. Reg. 60342 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress overruled this OCC regulation in 1999 in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), 113 Stat. 1338.  The GLBA was a seminal piece of banking legislation inasmuch as it repealed the Glass-Steagall Act\xe2\x80\x99s ban on affiliations between commercial and investment banks.  See \xc2\xa7101, <em>id.,</em> at 1341.  More<font b="1"> relevant to this case, however, the GLBA addressed the powers of national banks to own subsidiary corporations.  The Act provided that any national bank subsidiary engaging in activities forbidden to the parent bank would be considered a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial subsidiary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7121, <em>id.,</em> at 1380, and would be subjected to heightened regulatory obligations, see, <em>e.g.</em>,<font b="1" i="1"> 12 U.

The GLBA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x9d excluded those subsidiaries that \xe2\x80\x9cengag[e] solely in activities that national banks are permitted to engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of such activities by national banks.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa724a(g)(3).</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1" i="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By negative implication, then, only subsidiaries engaging in purely national bank activities\xe2\x80\x94which the OCC had termed \xe2\x80\x9coperating subsidiaries,\xe2\x80\x9d but which the GLBA never mentions by name\xe2\x80\x94could avoid being subjected to the restrictions that applied to financial subsidiaries.  Compare \xc2\xa7371c(b)(2) (exempting subsidiaries from certain regulatory restrictions) with \xc2\xa7371c(e) (clarifying that financial subsidiaries are not to be treated as \xe2\x80\x9csubsidiaries\xe2\x80\x9d).  Taken together, these provisions worked a rejection of the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s position that an <em>operating</em> subsidiary could engage in activities that national banks could not engage in directly.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  See \xc2\xa724a(g)(3).  Apart from this implicit rejection of the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 regulation, however, the GLBA does not even mention operating subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Congress itself has never authorized national banks to use subsidiaries incorporated under state law to perform traditional banking functions.  Nor has it authorized OCC to \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d any state-chartered entity to do so.  The fact that it may have acquiesced in the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s expansive interpretation of its authority is a plainly insufficient basis for finding preemption.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is familiar learning that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone of pre-emption analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cipollone</em> v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html">505 U. S. 504</a>, 516 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In divining that congressional purpose, I would have hoped that the Court would hew both to the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s text and to the basic rule, central to our federal system, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all pre-emption cases \xe2\x80\xa6 we \xe2\x80\x98start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1996) (quoting <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/index.html">331 U. S. 218</a>, 230 (1947)).  Had it done so, it could have avoided the untenable conclusion that Congress meant the NBA to preempt the state laws at issue here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The NBA in fact evinces quite the opposite congressional purpose.  It provides in 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a) that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although this exemption from state visitorial authority has been in place for more than 140 years, see \xc2\xa754, 13 Stat. 116 (national banks \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be subject to any other visitorial powers than such as are authorized by this act\xe2\x80\x9d), it is significant that Congress has never extended 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive blanket to cover national bank <em>subsidiaries</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, some kind of oversight.  As the complex history of the banking laws demonstrates, Congress has legislated extensively with respect to national bank \xe2\x80\x9caffiliates\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an operating subsidiary is one type of affiliate[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]\xe2\x80\x94and has moreover given the OCC extensive supervisory powers over those affiliates, see \xc2\xa7481 (providing that a federal examiner \xe2\x80\x9cshall have power to make a thorough examination of all the affairs of [a national bank] affiliate, and in doing so he shall have power \xe2\x80\xa6 to make a report of his findings to the Comptroller of the Currency\xe2\x80\x9d).  That Congress lavished such attention on national bank affiliates and conferred such far-reaching authority on the OCC without ever expanding the scope of \xc2\xa7484(a) speaks volumes about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 preemptive intent, or rather its lack thereof.  Consistent with our presumption against preemption\xe2\x80\x94a presumption I do not understand the Court to reject\xe2\x80\x94I would read \xc2\xa7484(a) to reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 considered judgment not to preempt the application of state visitorial laws to national bank \xe2\x80\x9caffiliates.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the Court likens \xc2\xa7484(a) to a congressional afterthought, musing that it merely \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[es] the burdens and undue duplication that state controls could produce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  By that logic, I take it the Court believes that the NBA would impliedly preempt all state visitorial laws as applied to national banks <em>even if \xc2\xa7484(a) did not exist</em>.  That is surprising and unlikely.  Not only would it reduce the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s express preemption provision to so much surplusage, but it would give Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence greater statutory dignity than an express command.  Perhaps that explains why none of the four Circuits to have addressed this issue relied on the preemptive force of the NBA itself.  Each instead asked whether the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations preempted state laws.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Stranger still, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning would suggest that operating subsidiaries have been exempted from state visitorial authority from the moment the OCC first authorized them in 1966.  See 31 Fed. Reg. 11459.  Yet if that were true, surely at some point over the last 40 years some national bank would have gone to court to spare its subsidiaries from the yoke of state regulation; national banks are neither heedless of their rights nor shy of litigation.  But respondents point us to no such cases that predate the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s preemption regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court licenses itself to ignore \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s limits by reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen state prescriptions significantly impair the exercise of authority, enumerated or incidental under the NBA, the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulations must give way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  But it intones this \xe2\x80\x9csignificant impairment\xe2\x80\x9d refrain without remembering that it merely provides a useful tool\xe2\x80\x94not the only tool, and not even the best tool\xe2\x80\x94to discover congressional intent.  As we explained in <em>Barnett Bank</em>, this Court \xe2\x80\x9ctake[s] the view that <em>normally</em> Congress would not want States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress has explicitly granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 U. S., at 33 (emphasis added).  But any assumption about what Congress \xe2\x80\x9cnormally\xe2\x80\x9d wants is of little moment when Congress has said exactly what it wants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also puts great weight on <em>Barnett Bank</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reference to our \xe2\x80\x9chistory \xe2\x80\xa6 of interpreting grants of both enumerated and incidental \xe2\x80\x98powers\xe2\x80\x99 to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by, but rather ordinarily pre-empting, contrary state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 32.  The Court neglects to mention that <em>Barnett Bank</em> is quite clear that this interpretive rule applies only when Congress has failed (as it often does) to manifest an explicit preemptive intent.  <em>Id.,</em> at 31.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>In that event</em>, courts must consider whether the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98structure and purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 or nonspecific statutory language, nonetheless reveal a clear, but implicit, pre-emptive intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  <em>Barnett Bank</em> nowhere holds that we can ignore strong indicia of congressional intent whenever a state law arguably trenches on national bank powers.  After all, the case emphasized that the question of preemption \xe2\x80\x9cis basically one of congressional intent.  Did Congress, in enacting the Federal Statute, intend to exercise its constitutionally delegated authority to set aside the laws of a State?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 30.  The answer here is a resounding no.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if it were appropriate to delve into the significant impairment question, the history of this very case confirms that neither the Mortgage Brokers, Lenders, and Services Licensing Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7445.1651 <em>et seq</em>. (West 2002 and Supp. 2006), nor the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act, \xc2\xa7493.51 <em>et seq</em>. (West 2005), conflicts with \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter or the general objects and purposes of Congressional legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Elmira Savings Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/161/275/index.html"></a><a href="/us/161/275/index.html">161 U.

Enacted to protect consumers from mortgage lending abuses, the Acts require mortgage brokers, mortgage servicers, and mortgage lenders to register with the State, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1652(1) (West Supp. 2006), 493.52(1) (West 2005), to submit certain financial statements, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1657(2) (West 2002), 493.56a(2) (West 2005), and to submit to state visitorial oversight, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7445.1661 (West 2002), 493.56b (West 2005).  Because the Acts expressly provide that they do not apply to \xe2\x80\x9cdepository financial institution[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7445.1675(a) (West 2002), neither national nor state banks are covered.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The statute therefore covers only nonbank companies incorporated under state law.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Wachovia Mortgage Corporation has never engaged in the core banking business of accepting deposits.  In 1997, when Wachovia Mortgage was first licensed to do business in Michigan, it was owned by a holding company that also owned the respondent Wachovia Bank, N. A.  (Neither the holding company nor the Bank did business in Michigan.)  There is no evidence, and no reason to believe, that compliance with the Michigan statutes imposed any special burdens on Wachovia Mortgage\xe2\x80\x99s activities, or that the transfer in 2003 of its ownership from the holding company to the Bank required it to make any changes whatsoever in its methods of doing business.  Neither before nor after that transfer was there any discernible federal interest in granting the company immunity from regulations that applied evenhandedly to its competitors.  The mere fact that its activities may also be performed by its banking parent provides at best a feeble justification for immunizing it from state regulation.  And it is a justification that the longstanding congressional \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy of competitive equality\xe2\x80\x9d clearly outweighs.  See <em>Plant City</em>, 396 U. S., at 133.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, however, it is beside the point whether in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment the Michigan laws will hamper national banks\xe2\x80\x99 ability to carry out their banking functions through operating subsidiaries.  It is <em>Congress\xe2\x80\x99</em> judgment that matters here, and Congress has in the NBA preempted only those laws purporting to lodge with state authorities visitorial power over national banks.  12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a).  In my view, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness to infuse congressional silence with preemptive force threatens the vitality of most state laws as applied to national banks\xe2\x80\x94a result at odds with the long and unbroken history of dual state and federal authority over national banks, not to mention our federal system of government.  It is especially troubling that the Court so blithely preempts Michigan laws designed to protect consumers.  Consumer protection is quintessentially a \xe2\x80\x9cfield which the States have traditionally occupied,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rice</em>, 331 U. S., at 230;[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] the Court should therefore have been all the more reluctant to conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d was to set aside the laws of a sovereign State, <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\nIV</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents maintain that even if the NBA lacks preemptive force, the GLBA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csame terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d reflects a congressional intent to preempt state laws as they apply to the mortgage lending activities of operating subsidiaries.  See 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724a(g)(3).  Indeed, the Court obliquely suggests as much, salting its analysis of the NBA with references to the GLBA.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13, 15.  Even a cursory review of the GLBA\xe2\x80\x99s text shows that it cannot bear the preemptive weight respondents (and perhaps the Court) would assign to it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9csame terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d appears in the <em>definition</em> of \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial subsidiary,\xe2\x80\x9d not in a provision of the statute conferring national bank powers.  Even there, it serves only to describe what a financial subsidiary is not.  See \xc2\xa724a(g)(3) (defining financial subsidiary as any subsidiary \xe2\x80\x9cother than a subsidiary that \xe2\x80\xa6 engages solely in activities that national banks are permitted to engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of such activities by national banks\xe2\x80\x9d).  Apart from this slanting reference, the GLBA <em>never mentions</em> operating subsidiaries.  Far from a demonstration that the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d was to preempt the type of law at issue here, <em>Rice</em>, 331 U. S., at 230, the \xe2\x80\x9csame terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d language at most reflects an uncontroversial acknowledgment that operating subsidiaries of national banks are subject to the same federal oversight as their national bank parents.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  It has nothing to do with\npreemption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress in fact disavowed any such preemptive intent.  Section 104 of the GLBA is titled \xe2\x80\x9cOperation of State Law,\xe2\x80\x9d 113 Stat. 1352, and it devotes more than 3,000 words to explaining which state laws Congress meant the GLBA to preempt.  Leave aside the oddity of a Congress that addresses preemption in exquisite detail in one provision of the GLBA but (according to respondents) uses only four words to express a preemptive intent elsewhere in the statute.  More importantly, \xc2\xa7104(d)(4) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[n]o State statute </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 <em>shall be preempted</em>\xe2\x80\x9d by the GLBA unless that statute has a disparate impact on federally chartered depository institutions, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>prevent[s]</em> a depository institution or affiliate thereof from engaging in activities authorized or permitted by this Act,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconflict[s] with the intent of this Act generally to permit affiliations that are authorized or permitted by Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1357 (emphasis added) (codified at 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76701(d)(4)).  No one claims that the Michigan laws at issue here are discriminatory, forbid affiliations, or \xe2\x80\x9cprevent\xe2\x80\x9d any operating subsidiary from engaging in banking activities.  It necessarily follows that the GLBA does not preempt them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that the phrase has something to do with preemption, it is simply not the case that the nonencroachment of state regulation is a \xe2\x80\x9cterm and condition\xe2\x80\x9d of engagement in the business of banking.  As a historical matter, state laws have always applied to national banks and have often encroached on the business of banking.  See <em>National Bank</em>, 9 Wall., at 362 (observing that national banks \xe2\x80\x9care subject to the laws of the State, and are governed in their daily course of business far more by the laws of the State than of the nation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court itself acknowledges that state usury, contract, and property law govern the activities of national banks and their subsidiaries, <em>ante</em>, at 6, notwithstanding that they vary across \xe2\x80\x9call States in which the banks operate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 8.  State law has always provided the legal backdrop against which national banks make real estate loans, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that the banking agencies maintain a close surveillance of the industry with a view toward preventing unsound practices that might impair liquidity or lead to insolvency does not make federal banking regulation all-pervasive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Philadelphia Nat. Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/321/index.html">374 U. S. 321</a>, 352 (1963).</p>\n<p>\n\nV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the most pressing questions in this case are whether Congress has delegated to the Comptroller of the Currency the authority to preempt the laws of a sovereign State as they apply to operating subsidiaries, and if so, whether that authority was properly exercised here.  See 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4006 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cState laws apply to national bank operating subsidiaries to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank\xe2\x80\x9d).  Without directly answering either question, the Court concludes that preemption is the \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary consequence\xe2\x80\x9d of various congressional statutes.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  Because I read those statutes differently, I must consider (as did the four Circuits to have addressed this issue) whether an administrative agency can assume the power to displace the duly enacted laws of a state legislature.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, Congress knows how to authorize executive agencies to preempt state laws.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  It has not done so here.  Nor does the statutory provision authorizing banks to engage in certain lines of business that are \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d to their primary business of accepting and managing the funds of depositors expressly or implicitly grant the OCC the power to immunize banks or their subsidiaries from state regulation.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  See 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724 Seventh.  For there is a vast and obvious difference between rules authorizing or regulating conduct and rules granting immunity from regulation.  The Comptroller may well have the authority to decide whether the activities of a mortgage broker, a real estate broker, or a travel agent should be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d to banking, and to approve a bank\xe2\x80\x99s entry into those businesses, either directly or through its subsidiaries.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>NationsBank of N. C., N. A.</em> v. <em>Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/251/index.html">513 U. S. 251</a>, 258 (1995) (upholding the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cincidental powers\xe2\x80\x9d provision to permit national banks to serve as agents in annuity sales).  But that lesser power does not imply the far greater power to immunize banks or their subsidiaries from state laws regulating the conduct of their competitors.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  As we said almost 40 years ago, \xe2\x80\x9cthe congressional policy of competitive equality with its deference to state standards\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9copen to modification by the Comptroller of the Currency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Plant City</em>, 396 U. S., at 138.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were I inclined to assume (and I am not) that congressional silence should be read as a conferral of preemptive authority, I would not find that the OCC has actually exercised any such authority here.  When the agency promulgated 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4006, it explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he section itself <em>does not effect preemption of any State law;</em> it reflects the conclusion we believe a Federal court would reach, even in the absence of the regulation \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 34790 (2001) (emphasis added).  Taking the OCC at its word, then, \xc2\xa77.4006 has no preemptive force of its own, but merely predicts how a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis will proceed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the OCC did intend its regulation to preempt the state laws at issue here, it would still not merit <em>Chevron</em> deference.  No case from this Court has ever applied such a deferential standard to an agency decision that could so easily disrupt the federal-state balance.  To be sure, expert agency opinions as to which state laws conflict with a federal statute may be entitled to \xe2\x80\x9csome weight,\xe2\x80\x9d especially when \xe2\x80\x9cthe subject matter is technical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant history and background are complex and extensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a>, 883 (2000).  But \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nlike Congress, administrative agencies are clearly not designed to represent the interests of States, yet with relative ease they can promulgate comprehensive and detailed regulations that have broad preemption ramifications for state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 908<em> </em>(Stevens, J., dissenting).[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  For that reason, when an agency purports to decide the scope of federal preemption, a healthy respect for state sovereignty calls for something less than <em>Chevron</em> deference.  See 529 U. S., at 911\xe2\x80\x93912; see also <em>Medtronic, </em>518 U. S., at 512 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not certain that an agency regulation determining the pre-emptive effect of <em>any </em>federal statute is entitled to deference\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, neither of the two justifications the OCC advanced when it promulgated 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4006 withstand <em>Chevron </em>analysis.  First, the OCC observed that the GLBA \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly acknowledged the authority of national banks to own subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x9d that conduct national bank activities \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of such activities by national banks.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 34788 (quoting 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724a(g)(3)).  The agency also noted that it had folded the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98same terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d language into an implementing regulation, 66 Fed. Reg. 34788 (citing 12 CFR \xc2\xa75.34(e)(3) (2001)).  According to the OCC, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] fundamental component of these descriptions of the characteristics of operating subsidiaries in GLBA and the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s rule is that state laws apply to operating subsidiaries to the same extent as they apply to the parent national bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 34788.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is incorrect.  As explained above, the GLBA\xe2\x80\x99s offhand use of the \xe2\x80\x9csame terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d language says nothing about preemption.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  Nor can the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s incorporation of that language into a regulation support the agency\xe2\x80\x99s position:  \xe2\x80\x9cSimply put, the existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/243/index.html">546 U. S. 243</a>, 257 (2006).  The OCC\xe2\x80\x99s argument to the contrary is particularly surprising given that when it promulgated its \xe2\x80\x9csame terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d regulation, it said not one word about preemption or the federalism implications of its rule\xe2\x80\x94an inexplicable elision if a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental component\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase is the need to operate unfettered by state oversight.  Compare 65 Fed. Reg. 12905\xe2\x80\x9312910 (2000), with Exec. Order No. 13132, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72, 4, 64 Fed. Reg. 43255, 43257 (1999) (requiring agencies to explicitly consider the \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism implications\xe2\x80\x9d of their chosen policies and to hesitate before preempting state laws).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the OCC describes operating subsidiaries \xe2\x80\x9cas the equivalent of departments or divisions of their parent banks,\xe2\x80\x9d 66 Fed. Reg. 34788, which, through the operation of 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a), would not be subject to state visitorial powers.  The OCC claims that national banks might desire to conduct their business through operating subsidiaries for the purposes of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling operations costs, improving effectiveness of supervision, more accurate determination of profits, decentralizing management decisions [and] separating particular operations of the bank from other operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19 (quoting 31 Fed. Reg. 11460).  It is obvious, however, that a national bank could realize <em>all</em> of those benefits through the straightforward expedient of dissolving the corporation and making it in fact a \xe2\x80\x9cdepartment\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cdivision\xe2\x80\x9d of the parent bank.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, the primary advantage of maintaining an operating subsidiary as a separate corporation is that it shields the national bank from the operating subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x99 liabilities.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bestfoods</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/51/index.html">524 U. S. 51</a>, 61 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a general principle of corporate law deeply ingrained in our economic and legal systems that a parent corporation \xe2\x80\xa6 is not liable for the acts of its subsidiary\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  For that reason, the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation is about far more than mere \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate structure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, or \xe2\x80\x9cinternal governance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 17 (citing <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Boutris</em>, 419 F.\xc2\xa03d 949, 960 (CA9 2005)); see also<em> Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a>, 474 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn issues of corporate law structure often matters\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is about whether a <em>state </em>corporation can avoid complying with <em>state</em> regulations, yet nevertheless take advantage of <em>state</em> laws insulating its owners from liability.  The federal interest in protecting depositors in national banks from their subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x99 liabilities surely does not justify a grant of immunity from laws that apply to competitors.  Indeed, the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation may drive companies seeking refuge from state regulation into the arms of federal parents, harm those state competitors who are not lucky enough to find a federal benefactor, and hamstring States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to regulate the affairs of state corporations.  As a result, the OCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation threatens both the dual banking system and the principle of competitive equality that is its cornerstone.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The novelty of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding merits a final comment.  Whatever the Court says, this is a case about an administrative agency\xe2\x80\x99s power to preempt state laws.  I agree with the Court that the Tenth Amendment does not preclude the exercise of that power.  But the fact that that Amendment was included in the Bill of Rights should nevertheless remind the Court that its ruling affects the allocation of powers among sovereigns.  Indeed, the reasons for adopting that Amendment are precisely those that undergird the well-established presumption against preemption.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With rare exception, we have found preemption only when a federal statute commanded it, see<em> Cipollone,</em> 505 U. S., at 517, when a conflict between federal and state law precluded obedience to both sovereigns, see <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc.</em> v. <em>Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/index.html">373 U. S. 132</a>, 142\xe2\x80\x93143 (1963), or when a federal statute so completely occupied a field that it left no room for additional state regulation, see <em>Napier</em> v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/605/index.html">272 U. S. 605</a>, 613 (1926).  Almost invariably the finding of preemption has been based on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of statutory language or of regulations plainly authorized by Congress.  Never before have we endorsed administrative action whose sole purpose was to preempt state law rather than to implement a statutory command.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no more characteristic difference between the state and the national banking laws than the fact that almost without exception, state banks may loan on real estate security, while national banks are prohibited from doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  G.
