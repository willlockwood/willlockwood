Nevertheless, after several days of delay and a fruitless search for Crosby, the court, upon a formal request from the Government, decided that trial would commence on October 17. The court ordered Crosby\'s $100,000 bond forfeited and stated for the record its findings that Crosby had been given adequate notice of the trial date, that his absence was knowing and deliberate, and that requiring the Government to try Crosby separately from his codefendants would present extreme difficulty for the Government, witnesses, counsel, and the court. It further concluded that Crosby voluntarily had waived his constitutional right to be present during the trial, and that the public interest in proceeding with the trial in his absence outweighed his interest in being present during the proceedings. Trial began on October 17, with petitioner\'s counsel actively participating, and continued in Crosby\'s absence until November 18, when the jury returned verdicts of guilty on charges against Crosby and two of his codefendants.

"</p></blockquote><p>The Government concedes that the Rule does not specifically authorize the trial <i>in absentia </i>of a defendant who was not present at the beginning of his trial. The Government argues, nonetheless, that "Rule 43 does not purport to contain a comprehensive listing of the circumstances under which the right to be present may be waived." Brief for United States 16. Accordingly, the Government contends, Crosby\'s position rests not on the express provisions of Rule 43, but solely on the maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. </i>Ibid. We disagree. It is not necessary to invoke that maxim in order to conclude that Rule 43 does not allow full trials <i>in absentia. </i>The Rule declares explicitly: "The de-</p><p><i>States </i>v. <i>Tortora, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/464/1202/">464 F.2d 1202</a>, 1208 <i>(CA2), </i>cert. denied <i>sub nom.

The list of situations in which the trial may proceed without the defendant is marked as exclusive not by the "expression of one" circumstance, but rather by the express use of a limiting phrase. In that respect the language and structure of the Rule could not be more clear.</p><p>The Government, however, urges us to look for guidance at the existing law, which the Rule was meant to restate, at the time of its adoption in 1944. See Advisory Committee\'s Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 43, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 821. That inquiry does not assist the Government. "It is well settled that ... at common law the personal presence of the defendant is essential to a valid trial and conviction on a charge of felony .... If he is absent, ... a conviction will be set aside." W. Mikell, Clark\'s Criminal Procedure 492 (2d ed. 1918) (hereinafter Mikell). Accord, Goldin, Presence of the Defendant at Rendition of the Verdict in Felony Cases, 16 Colum. L. Rev. 18, 20 (1916); F.

The right generally was considered unwaivable in felony cases. Mikell 492; 1 Bishop 175 and 178. This canon was premised on the notion that a fair trial could take place only if the jurors met the defendant face-to-face and only if those testifying against the defendant did so in his presence. See Wharton 392; 1 Bishop 178. It was thought "contrary to the dictates of humanity to let a prisoner \'waive that advantage which a view of his sad plight might give him by inclining the hearts of the jurors to listen to his defence with indulgence.\'" <i>Ibid., </i>quoting <i>Prine </i>v. <i>Commonwealth, </i>18 Pa. 103, 104 (1851).</p><p>In <i>Diaz </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/223/442/case.html">223 U.

Because it did "\'not seem to us to be consonant with the dictates of common sense that an accused person, being at large upon bail, should be at liberty, whenever he pleased, to withdraw himself from the courts of his country and to break up a trial already commenced,\'" <i>id., </i>at 457, quoting <i>Falk </i>v. <i>United States, </i>15 App. D. C. 446, 454 (1899), cert. denied, 181 U. S. 618 (1901), the Court held:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[W]here the offense is not capital and the accused is not in custody, ... if, <i>after the trial has begun in his presence, </i>he voluntarily absents himself, this does not nullify what has been done or prevent the completion of the trial, but, on the contrary, operates as a waiver of his right to be present and leaves the court free to proceed with the trial in like manner and with like effect as if he were present." 223 U. S., at 455 (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p><i>Diaz </i>was cited by the Advisory Committee that drafted Rule 43. The Committee explained: "The second sentence of the rule is a restatement of existing law that, except in capital cases, the defendant may not defeat the proceedings by voluntarily absenting himself after the trial has been commenced in his presence." Advisory Committee\'s Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 43, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 821. There is no reason to believe that the drafters intended the Rule to go further. Commenting on a preliminary version of the Rule, Judge John B. Sanborn, a member of the Committee, stated:</p><blockquote><p>\n"I think it would be inadvisable to conduct criminal trials in the absence of the defendant. That has never been the practice, and, whether the defendant wants to attend the trial or not, I think he should be compelled to be present. If, during the trial, he disappears, there is, of course, no reason why the trial should not proceed without him." 2 M. Wilken &amp; N. Triffin, Drafting His-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="261">261</a></p><blockquote><p>\ntory of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 236 (1991).</p></blockquote><p>The Court of Appeals in the present case recognized that this Court in <i>Diaz </i>had not addressed the situation of the defendant who fails to appear for the commencement of trial. Nevertheless, the court concluded: "It would be anomalous to attach more significance to a defendant\'s absence at commencement than to absence during more important substantive portions of the triaL" 917 F. 2d, at 365. While it may be true that there are no "talismanic properties which differentiate the commencement of a trial from later stages," Gov<i>ernment of the Virgin Islands </i>v. <i>Brown, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/507/186/">507 F.2d 186</a>, 189 (CA3 1975), we do not find the distinction between pretrial and midtrial flight so farfetched as to convince us that Rule 43 cannot mean what it says. As a general matter, the costs of suspending a proceeding already under way will be greater than the cost of postponing a trial not yet begun. If a clear line is to be drawn marking the point at which the costs of delay are likely to outweigh the interests of the defendant and society in having the defendant present, the commencement of trial is at least a plausible place at which to draw that line. See <i>Hopt </i>v. <i>Territory of Utah, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/110/574/case.html">110 U. S. 574</a>, 579 (1884) (discussing the public\'s interest in strict enforcement of statutory requirement that defendant be present at trial).</p><p>There are additional practical reasons for distinguishing between flight before and flight during a trial. As did <i>Diaz, </i>the Rule treats midtrial flight as a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to be present. Whether or not the right constitutionally may be waived in other circumstances-and we express no opinion here on that subject-the defendant\'s initial presence serves to assure that any waiver is indeed knowing. "Since the notion that trial may be commenced in absentia still seems to shock most lawyers, it would hardly seem appropriate to impute knowledge that this will occur to their clients." Starkey, Trial in Absentia, 54 N. Y. St.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="262">262</a></p><p>B. J. 30, 34, n. 28 (1982). It is unlikely, on the other hand, "\'that a defendant who flees from a courtroom in the midst of a trial-where judge, jury, witnesses and lawyers are present and ready to continue-would not know that as a consequence the trial could continue in his absence.\'" <i>Taylor </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/17/case.html">414 U. S. 17</a>, 20 (1973), quoting from Chief Judge Coffin\'s opinion, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Taylor, 478 </i>F. 2d 689, 691 (CA1 1973), for the Court of Appeals in that case. Moreover, a rule that allows an ongoing trial to continue when a defendant disappears deprives the defendant of the option of gambling on an acquittal knowing that he can terminate the trial if it seems that the verdict will go against him-an option that might otherwise appear preferable to the costly, perhaps unnecessary, path of becoming a fugitive from the outset.</p><p>The language, history, and logic of Rule 43 support a straightforward interpretation that prohibits the trial <i>in absentia </i>of a defendant who is not present at the beginning of trial. Because we find Rule 43 dispositive, we do not reach Crosby\'s claim that his trial <i>in absentia </i>was also prohibited by the Constitution.</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
