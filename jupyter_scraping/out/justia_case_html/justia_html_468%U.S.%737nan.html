Respondents, parents of black children who were attending public schools in seven States in school districts undergoing desegregation, brought a nationwide class action in Federal District Court against petitioner Government officials (petitioner Allen, the head of a private school identified in the complaint, intervened as a defendant), alleging that the IRS has not adopted sufficient standards and procedures to fulfill its obligation to deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools, and has thereby harmed respondents directly and interfered with their children\'s opportunity to receive an education in desegregated public schools.  Respondents also alleged that many racially segregated private schools were created or expanded in their communities at the time the public schools were undergoing desegregation, and had received tax exemptions despite the IRS policy and guidelines; and that these unlawful tax exemptions harmed respondents in that they constituted tangible financial aid for racially segregated educational institutions and encouraged the organization and expansion of institutions that provided segregated educational opportunities for white students avoiding attendance in the public schools.  Respondents did not allege that their children had ever applied or would ever apply for admission to any private school.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.

We hold that they do not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The IRS denies tax-exempt status under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 501(a) and (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 501(a) and (c)(3) -- and hence eligibility to receive charitable contributions deductible from income taxes under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 170(a)(1) and (c)(2) of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 170(a)(1) and (c)(2) -- to racially discriminatory private schools.  Rev.Rul. 71-447, 1971-2 Cum.Bull. 230. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The IRS policy requires that a school applying for tax-exempt status show that it</p>\n<p>"admits the students of any race to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at that school and that the school does not discriminate on the basis of race in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  To carry out this policy, the IRS has established guidelines and procedures for determining whether a particular school is in fact racially nondiscriminatory.  Rev.Proc. 75-50, 1975-2 Cum.Bull. 587. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Failure to comply with the guidelines "will ordinarily result in the proposed revocation of" tax-exempt status.  <em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 4.08, p. 589. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 468 U. S. 741</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The guidelines provide that</p>\n<p>"[a] school must show affirmatively both that it has adopted a racially nondiscriminatory policy as to students that is made known to the general public and that since the adoption of that policy it has operated in a bona fide manner in accordance therewith."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 2.02. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The school must state its nondiscrimination policy in its organizational charter, <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 4.01. pp. 587-588, and in all of its brochures, catalogs, and other advertisements to prospective students, <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 4.02, p. 588.  The school must make its nondiscrimination policy known to the entire community served by the school, and must publicly disavow any contrary representations made on its behalf once it becomes aware of them.  <em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 4.03. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The school must have nondiscriminatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="742">Page 468 U.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The IRS rules require a school applying for tax-exempt status to give a breakdown along racial lines of its student body and its faculty and administrative staff, <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 5.01-1, as well as of scholarships and loans awarded, <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 5.01-2.  They also require the applicant school to state the year of its organization, <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 5.01-5, and to list "incorporators, founders, board members, and donors of land or buildings," <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 5.01-3, and state whether any of the organizations among these have an objective of maintaining segregated public or private school education, <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 5.01-4.  The rules further provide that, once given an exemption, a school must keep specified records to document the extent of compliance with the IRS guidelines.  <em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 7, p. 590. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Finally, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 468 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1976, respondents challenged these guidelines and procedures in a suit filed in Federal District Court against the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The plaintiffs named in the complaint are parents of black children who, at the time the complaint was filed, were attending public schools in seven States in school districts undergoing desegregation.  They brought this nationwide class action</p>\n<p>"on behalf of themselves and their children, and . . . on behalf of all other parents of black children attending public school systems undergoing, or which may in the future undergo, desegregation pursuant to court order [or] HEW regulations and guidelines, under state law, or voluntarily."</p>\n<p>App. 22-23.  They estimated that the class they seek to represent includes several million persons.  <em>Id.</em> at 23.</p>\n<p>Respondents allege in their complaint that many racially segregated private schools were created or expanded in their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 468 U. S. 744</a></p><p> communities at the time the public schools were undergoing desegregation.  <em>Id.</em> at 23-24.  According to the complaint, many such private schools, including 17 schools or school systems identified by name in the complaint (perhaps some 30 schools in all), receive tax exemptions either directly or through the tax-exempt status of "umbrella" organizations that operate or support the schools.  <em>Id.</em> at 23-38. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Respondents allege that, despite the IRS policy of denying tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools, and despite the IRS guidelines and procedures for implementing that policy, some of the tax-exempt racially segregated private schools created or expanded in desegregating districts in fact have racially discriminatory policies.  <em>Id.</em> at 17-18 (IRS permits "schools to receive tax exemptions merely on the basis of adopting and certifying -- but not implementing -- a policy of nondiscrimination"); <em>id.</em> at 25 (same). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Respondents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="745">Page 468 U. S. 745</a></p><p> allege that the IRS grant of tax exemptions to such racially discriminatory schools is unlawful. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents allege that the challenged Government conduct harms them in two ways.  The challenged conduct</p>\n<p>"(a) constitutes tangible federal financial aid and other support for racially segregated educational institutions, and"</p>\n<p>"(b) fosters and encourages the organization, operation and expansion of institutions providing racially segregated educational opportunities for white children avoiding attendance in desegregating public school districts, and thereby interferes with the efforts of federal courts, HEW and local school authorities to desegregate public school districts which have been operating racially dual school systems."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 38-39.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 468 U. S. 746</a></p><p> Thus, respondents do not allege that their children have been the victims of discriminatory exclusion from the schools whose tax exemptions they challenge as unlawful.  Indeed, they have not alleged at any stage of this litigation that their children have ever applied or would ever apply to any private school.  <em>See Wright v. Regan,</em> 211 U.S.App.D.C. 231, 238, 656 F.2d 820, 827 (1981) ("Plaintiffs . . . maintain they have no interest whatever in enrolling their children in a private school").  Rather, respondents claim a direct injury from the mere fact of the challenged Government conduct and, as indicated by the restriction of the plaintiff class to parents of children in desegregating school districts, injury to their children\'s opportunity to receive a desegregated education. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The latter injury is traceable to the IRS grant of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools, respondents allege, chiefly because contributions to such schools are deductible from income taxes under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 170(a)(1) and (c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and the</p>\n<p>"deductions facilitate the raising of finds to organize new schools and expand existing schools in order to accommodate white students avoiding attendance in desegregating public school districts."</p>\n<p>App. 24. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents request only prospective relief.  <em>Id.</em> at 40-41.  They ask for a declaratory judgment that the challenged IRS tax-exemption practices are unlawful.  They also </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 468 U. S. 747</a></p><p> ask for an injunction requiring the IRS to deny tax exemptions to a considerably broader class of private schools than the class of racially discriminatory private schools.  Under the requested injunction, the IRS would have to deny tax-exempt status to all private schools</p>\n<p>"which have insubstantial or nonexistent minority enrollments, which are located in or serve desegregating public school districts, and which either -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) were established or expanded at or about the time the public school districts in which they are located or which they serve were desegregating;"</p>\n<p>"(2) have been determined in adversary judicial or administrative proceedings to be racially segregated; or"</p>\n<p>"(3) cannot demonstrate that they do not provide racially segregated educational opportunities for white children avoiding attendance in desegregating public school systems. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 40.  Finally, respondents ask for an order directing the IRS to replace its 1975 guidelines with standards consistent with the requested injunction.</p>\n<p>In May, 1977 the District Court permitted intervention as a defendant by petitioner Allen, the head of one of the private school systems identified in the complaint.  <em>Id.</em> at 54-55.  Thereafter, progress in the lawsuit was stalled for several years.  During this period, the IRS reviewed its challenged policies and proposed new Revenue Procedures to tighten requirements for eligibility for tax-exempt status for private schools.  <em>See</em> 43 Fed.Reg. 37296 (1978); 44 Fed.Reg. 9451 (1979). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In 1979, however, Congress blocked any strengthening </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 468 U. S. 748</a></p><p> of the IRS guidelines at least until October, 1980. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The District Court thereupon considered and granted the defendants\' motion to dismiss the complaint, concluding that respondents lack standing, that the judicial task proposed by respondents is inappropriately intrusive for a federal court, and that awarding the requested relief would be contrary to the will of Congress expressed in the 1979 ban on strengthening IRS guidelines.  <em>Wright v. Miller,</em> 480 F.Supp. 790 (DC 1979).</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, concluding that respondents have standing to maintain this lawsuit.  The court acknowledged that <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U. S. 26</a></span> (1976),</p>\n<p>"suggests that litigation concerning tax liability is a matter between taxpayer and IRS, with the door </p><p><a class="page-number" name="749">Page 468 U. S. 749</a></p><p> barely ajar for third party challenges."</p>\n<p>211 U.S.App.D.C. at 239, 656 F.2d at 828.  The court concluded, however, that the <em>Simon</em> case is inapposite, because respondents claim no injury dependent on taxpayers\' actions:  "[t]hey claim indifference as to the course private schools would take."  <em>Id.</em> at 240, 656 F.2d at 829. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Instead, the court observed,</p>\n<p>"[t]he sole injury [respondents] claim is the denigration they suffer as black parents and schoolchildren when their government graces with tax-exempt status educational institutions in their communities that treat members of their race as persons of lesser worth."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 238, 656 F.2d at 827.  The court held this denigration injury enough to give respondents standing, since it was this injury which supported standing in <em>Coit v.

As the Court explained in <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html">454 U. S. 464</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#471">454 U. S. 471</a></span>-476 (1982), the "case or controversy" requirement defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded.  The several doctrines that have grown up to elaborate that requirement are "founded in concern about the proper -- and properly limited -- role of the courts in a democratic society."  <em>Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U. S. 490</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#498">422 U. S. 498</a></span> (1975).</p>\n<p>"All of the doctrines that cluster about Article III -- not only standing but mootness, ripeness, political question, and the like -- relate in part, and in different though overlapping ways, to an idea, which is more than an intuition but less than a rigorous and explicit theory, about the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary in our kind of government."</p>\n<p><em>Vander Jagt v. O\'Neill,</em> 226 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 26-27, 699 F.2d 1166, 1178-1179 (1983) (Bork, J., concurring).  The case-or-controversy doctrines state fundamental limits on federal judicial power in our system of government.</p>\n<p>The Art. III doctrine that requires a litigant to have "standing" to invoke the power of a federal court is perhaps the most important of these doctrines.</p>\n<p>"In essence, the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 468 U. S. 751</a></p><p> court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues."</p>\n<p><em>Warth v. Seldin, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#498">422 U. S. 498</a></span>.  Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigant\'s raising another person\'s legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff\'s complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.  <em>See Valley Forge, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#474">454 U. S. 474</a></span>-475.  The requirement of standing, however, has a core component derived directly from the Constitution.  A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\'s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  454 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#472">454 U. S. 472</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Like the prudential component, the constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition.  The injury alleged must be, for example, "<em>distinct and palpable,\'" <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/91/case.html">441 U. S. 91</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/91/case.html#100">441 U. S. 100</a></span> (1979) (quoting <em>Warth v.

The injury must be "fairly" traceable to the challenged action, and relief from the injury must be "likely" to follow from a favorable decision.  <em>See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org.,</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#38">426 U.

These terms cannot be defined so as to make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.\n</em></p>\n<p>The absence of precise definitions, however, as this Court\'s extensive body of case law on standing illustrates, <em>see generally Valley Forge, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#471">454 U. S. 471</a></span>-476, hardly leaves courts at sea in applying the law of standing.  Like most legal notions, the standing concepts have gained considerable definition from developing case law.  In many cases, the standing question can be answered chiefly by comparing the allegations of the particular complaint to those made in prior standing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 468 U. S. 752</a></p><p> cases.  <em>See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Lyons, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/case.html#102">461 U. S. 102</a></span>-105.  More important, the law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic idea -- the idea of separation of powers.  It is this fact which makes possible the gradual clarification of the law through judicial application.  Of course, both federal and state courts have long experience in applying and elaborating in numerous contexts the pervasive and fundamental notion of separation of powers.</p>\n<p>Determining standing in a particular case may be facilitated by clarifying principles or even clear rules developed in prior cases.  Typically, however, the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint\'s allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.  Is the injury too abstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially cognizable?  Is the line of causation between the illegal conduct and injury too attenuated?  Is the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling too speculative?  These questions and any others relevant to the standing inquiry must be answered by reference to the Art. III notion that federal courts may exercise power only "in the last resort, and as a necessity," <em>Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/339/case.html">143 U. S. 339</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/339/case.html#345">143 U. S. 345</a></span> (1892), and only when adjudication is</p>\n<p>"consistent with a system of separated powers and [the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process,"</p>\n<p><em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#97">392 U.

S. 472</a></span>-473.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents allege two injuries in their complaint to support their standing to bring this lawsuit.  First, they say that they are harmed directly by the mere fact of Government financial aid to discriminatory private schools.  Second, they say that the federal tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools in their communities impair </p><p><a class="page-number" name="753">Page 468 U. S. 753</a></p><p> their ability to have their public schools desegregated.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#745">468 U. S. 745</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In the Court of Appeals, respondents apparently relied on the first injury.  Thus, the court below asserted that "[t]he sole injury [respondents] claim is the denigration they suffer" as a result of the tax exemptions.  211 U.S.App.D.C. at 238, 656 F.2d at 827.  In this Court, respondents have not focused on this claim of injury.  Here they stress the effect of the tax exemptions on their "equal educational opportunities," <em>see, e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondents 12, 14, renewing reliance on the second injury described in their complaint.</p>\n<p>Because respondents have not clearly disclaimed reliance on either of the injuries described in their complaint, we address both allegations of injury.  We conclude that neither suffices to support respondents\' standing.  The first fails under clear precedents of this Court because it does not constitute judicially cognizable injury.  The second fails because the alleged injury is not fairly traceable to the assertedly unlawful conduct of the IRS. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>1\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents\' first claim of injury can be interpreted in two ways.  It might be a claim simply to have the Government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 468 U. S. 754</a></p><p> avoid the violation of law alleged in respondents\' complaint.  Alternatively, it might be a claim of stigmatic injury, or denigration, suffered by all members of a racial group when the Government discriminates on the basis of race. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Under neither interpretation is this claim of injury judicially cognizable.</p>\n<p>This Court has repeatedly held that an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.  In <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html">418 U. S. 208</a></span> (1974), for example, the Court rejected a claim of citizen standing to challenge Armed Forces Reserve commissions held by Members of Congress as violating the Incompatibility Clause of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, of the Constitution.  As citizens, the Court held, plaintiffs alleged nothing but "the abstract injury in nonobservance of the Constitution. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html#223">418 U. S. 223</a></span>, n. 13.  More recently, in <em>Valley Forge, supra,</em> we rejected a claim of standing to challenge a Government conveyance of property to a religious institution.  Insofar as the plaintiffs relied simply on "<em>their shared individuated right\'" to a Government that made no law respecting an establishment of religion, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#482">454 U. S. 482</a></span> (quoting <em>Americans United v.

III without draining those requirements of meaning."</p>\n<p>454 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#483">454 U. S. 483</a></span>.  <em>See also United States v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/case.html">418 U. S. 166</a></span> (1974); <em>Laird v.

Respondents here have no standing to complain simply that their Government is violating the law.</p>\n<p>Neither do they have standing to litigate their claims based on the stigmatizing injury often caused by racial discrimination.  There can be no doubt that this sort of noneconomic injury is one of the most serious consequences of discriminatory government action, and is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing.  <em>See Heckler v. Mathews,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/case.html">465 U.

Our cases make clear, however, that such injury accords a basis for standing only to "those persons who are personally denied equal treatment" by the challenged discriminatory conduct, <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/163/case.html">407 U. S. 163</a></span> (1972), the Court held that the plaintiff had no standing to challenge a club\'s racially discriminatory membership policies, because he had never applied for membership.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/163/case.html#166">407 U. S. 166</a></span>-167.  In <em>O\'Shea v. Littleton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html">414 U. S. 488</a></span> (1974), the Court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to challenge racial discrimination in the administration of their city\'s criminal justice system, because they had not alleged that they had been, or would likely be, subject to the challenged practices.  The Court denied standing on similar facts in <em>Rizzo v. Goode,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/362/case.html">423 U. S. 362</a></span> (1976).  In each of those cases, the plaintiffs alleged official racial discrimination comparable to that alleged by respondents here.  Yet standing was denied in each case because the plaintiffs were not personally subject to the challenged discrimination.  Insofar as their first claim of injury is concerned, respondents are in exactly the same position:  unlike the appellee in <em>Heckler v. Mathews, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/case.html#740">465 U. S. 740</a></span>-741, n. 9, they do not allege a stigmatic injury suffered as a direct result of having personally been denied equal treatment.</p>\n<p>The consequences of recognizing respondents\' standing on the basis of their first claim of injury illustrate why our cases plainly hold that such injury is not judicially cognizable.  If the abstract stigmatic injury were cognizable, standing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="756">Page 468 U. S. 756</a></p><p> would extend nationwide to all members of the particular racial groups against which the Government was alleged to be discriminating by its grant of a tax exemption to a racially discriminatory school, regardless of the location of that school.  All such persons could claim the same sort of abstract stigmatic injury respondents assert in their first claim of injury.  A black person in Hawaii could challenge the grant of a tax exemption to a racially discriminatory school in Maine.  Recognition of standing in such circumstances would transform the federal courts into "no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders."  <em>United States v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html">412 U. S. 669</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html#687">412 U. S. 687</a></span> (1973).  Constitutional limits on the role of the federal courts preclude such a transformation. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p><em>2\n</em></p>\n<p>It is in their complaint\'s second claim of injury that respondents allege harm to a concrete, personal interest that can support standing in some circumstances.  The injury they identify -- their children\'s diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated school -- is, beyond any doubt, not only judicially cognizable but, as shown by cases from <em>Brown v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/case.html">347 U. S. 483</a></span> (1954), to <em>Bob Jones University v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/574/case.html">461 U. S. 574</a></span> (1983), one of the most serious injuries recognized in our legal system.  Despite the constitutional importance of curing the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="757">Page 468 U. S. 757</a></p><p> injury alleged by respondents, however, the federal judiciary may not redress it unless standing requirements are met.  In this case, respondents\' second claim of injury cannot support standing, because the injury alleged is not fairly traceable to the Government conduct respondents challenge as unlawful. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The illegal conduct challenged by respondents is the IRS\'s grant of tax exemptions to some racially discriminatory schools.  The line of causation between that conduct and desegregation of respondents\' schools is attenuated, at best.  From the perspective of the IRS, the injury to respondents is highly indirect, and "results from the independent action of some third party not before the court," <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org.,</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#42">426 U. S. 42</a></span>.  As the Court pointed out in <em>Warth v. Seldin,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#505">422 U. S. 505</a></span>, "the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="758">Page 468 U. S. 758</a></p><p> indirectness of the injury . . . may make it substantially more difficult to meet the minimum requirement of Art. III. . . ."</p>\n<p>The diminished ability of respondents\' children to receive a desegregated education would be fairly traceable to unlawful IRS grants of tax exemptions only if there were enough racially discriminatory private schools receiving tax exemptions in respondents\' communities for withdrawal of those exemptions to make an appreciable difference in public school integration.  Respondents have made no such allegation.  It is, first, uncertain how many racially discriminatory private schools are in fact receiving tax exemptions. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Moreover, it is entirely speculative, as respondents themselves conceded in the Court of Appeals, <em>see</em> <a href="#F17" name="T17">n</a> 17, <em>supra,</em> whether withdrawal of a tax exemption from any particular school would lead the school to change its policies.  <em>See</em> 480 F.Supp. at 796.  It is just as speculative whether any given parent of a child attending such a private school would decide to transfer the child to public school as a result of any changes in educational or financial policy made by the private school once it was threatened with loss of tax-exempt status.  It is also pure speculation whether, in a particular community, a large enough number of the numerous relevant school officials and parents would reach decisions that collectively would have a significant impact on the racial composition of the public schools. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 468 U. S. 759</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The links in the chain of causation between the challenged Government conduct and the asserted injury are far too weak for the chain as a whole to sustain respondents\' standing.  In <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., supra,</em> the Court held that standing to challenge a Government grant of a tax exemption to hospitals could not be founded on the asserted connection between the grant of tax-exempt status and the hospitals\' policy concerning the provision of medical services to indigents. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The causal connection depended on the decisions hospitals would make in response to withdrawal of tax-exempt status, and those decisions were sufficiently uncertain to break the chain of causation between the plaintiffs\' injury and the challenged Government action.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#40">426 U. S. 40</a></span>-46.  <em>See also Warth v. Seldin, supra.</em>  The chain of causation is even weaker in this case.  It involves numerous third parties (officials of racially discriminatory schools receiving tax exemptions and the parents of children attending such schools) who may not even exist in respondents\' communities and whose independent decisions may not collectively have a significant effect on the ability of public school students to receive a desegregated education.</p>\n<p>The idea of separation of powers that underlies standing doctrine explains why our cases preclude the conclusion that respondents\' alleged injury "fairly can be traced to the challenged action" of the IRS.  <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#41">426 U. S. 41</a></span>.  That conclusion would pave the way generally for suits challenging, not specifically identifiable Government violations of law, but the particular programs agencies establish to carry out their legal obligations.  Such suits, even when premised on allegations of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 468 U. S. 760</a></p><p> several instances of violations of law, are rarely, if ever, appropriate for federal court adjudication.</p>\n<p>"Carried to its logical end, [respondents\'] approach would have the federal courts as virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action; such a role is appropriate for the Congress, acting through its committees and the \'power of the purse;\' it is not the role of the judiciary, absent actual present or immediately threatened injury resulting from unlawful governmental action."</p>\n<p><em>Laird v.

In all three cases, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief directed at certain systemwide law enforcement practices. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The Court held in each case that, absent an allegation of a specific threat of being subject to the challenged practices, plaintiffs had no standing to ask for an injunction.

The Constitution, after all, assigns to the Executive Branch, and not to the Judicial Branch, the duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  U.S.Const., Art. II, \xc2\xa7 3.

City of Montgomery, supra,</em> the plaintiffs asserted a constitutional right, recognized in an outstanding injunction, to use the city\'s public parks on a nondiscriminatory basis.  They alleged that the city was violating that equal protection right by permitting racially discriminatory private schools and other groups to use the public parks.  The Court recognized plaintiffs\' standing to challenge this city policy insofar as the policy permitted the exclusive use of the parks by racially discriminatory private schools:  the plaintiffs had alleged direct cognizable injury to their right to nondiscriminatory access to the public parks.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/556/case.html#570">417 U.

Like the plaintiff in <em>Heckler v.

The Court did not expressly address the basis for the plaintiffs\' standing.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gilmore,</em> however, the Court identified the basis for standing in <em>Norwood:</em></p>\n<p>"The plaintiffs in <em>Norwood</em> were parties to a school desegregation order, and the relief they sought was directly related to the concrete injury they suffered."</p>\n<p>417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/556/case.html#571">417 U. S. 571</a></span>, n. 10.  Through the school desegregation decree, the plaintiffs had acquired a right to have the State "steer clear" of any perpetuation of the racially dual school system that it had once sponsored.  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/455/case.html#467">413 U. S. 467</a></span>.  The interest acquired was judicially cognizable because it was a personal interest, created by law, in having the State refrain from taking specific actions.  <em>Cf. Warth v. Seldin,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#500">422 U. S. 500</a></span> (standing may exist by virtue of legal rights created by statute).  The plaintiffs\' complaint alleged that the State directly injured that interest by aiding racially discriminatory private schools.  Respondents in this lawsuit, of course, have no injunctive rights against the IRS that are allegedly being harmed by the challenged IRS action.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Gilmore</em> and <em>Norwood, Coit v. Green, supra,</em> cannot easily be seen to have based standing on an injury different in kind from any asserted by respondents here.  The plaintiffs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 468 U. S. 764</a></p><p> in <em>Coit,</em> parents of black schoolchildren in Mississippi, sued to enjoin the IRS grant of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools in the State.  Nevertheless, <em>Coit</em> in no way mandates the conclusion that respondents have standing.</p>\n<p>First, the decision has little weight as a precedent on the law of standing.  This Court\'s decision in <em>Coit</em> was merely a summary affirmance; for that reason alone, it could hardly establish principles contrary to those set out in opinions issued after full briefing and argument.  <em>See Fusari v. Steinberg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/379/case.html">419 U. S. 379</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/379/case.html#392">419 U. S. 392</a></span> (1975) (BURGER, C.J., concurring); <em>see also Tully v.

Moreover, when the case reached this Court, the plaintiffs and the IRS were no longer adverse parties; and the ruling that was summarily affirmed, <em>Green v. Connally,</em> 330 F.Supp. 1150 (DC 1971), did not include a ruling on the issue of standing, which had been briefly considered in a prior ruling of the District Court, <em>Green v. Kennedy,</em> 309 F.Supp. 1127, 1132 (DC), <em>appeal dism\'d sub nom. Cannon v. Green,</em> 398 U.S. 956 (1970).  Thus, "the Court\'s affirmance in <em>Green</em> lacks the precedential weight of a case involving a truly adversary controversy."  <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html">416 U. S. 725</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#740">416 U. S. 740</a></span>, n. 11 (1974).</p>\n<p>In any event, the facts in the <em>Coit</em> case are sufficiently different from those presented in this lawsuit that the absence of standing here is unaffected by the possible propriety of standing there.  In particular, the suit in <em>Coit</em> was limited to the public schools of one State.  Moreover, the District Court found, based on extensive evidence before it as well as on the findings in <em>Coffey v. State Educational Finance Comm\'n,</em> 296 F.Supp. 1389 (SD Miss.1969), that large numbers of segregated private schools had been established in the State for the purpose of avoiding a unitary public school system, 309 F.Supp. at 1133-1134; that the tax exemptions were critically important to the ability of such schools to succeed, <em>id.</em> at 1134-1136; and that the connection between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="765">Page 468 U. S. 765</a></p><p> the grant of tax exemptions to discriminatory schools and desegregation of the public schools in the particular State was close enough to warrant the conclusion that irreparable injury to the interest in desegregated education was threatened if the tax exemptions continued, <em>id.</em> at 1138-1139. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  What made possible those findings was the fact that, when the Mississippi plaintiffs filed their suit, the IRS had a policy of granting tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools; thus, the suit was initially brought, not simply to reform Executive Branch enforcement procedures, but to challenge a fundamental IRS policy decision, which affected numerous identifiable schools in the State of Mississippi.  <em>See id.</em> at 1130. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>The limited setting, the history of school desegregation in Mississippi at the time of the <em>Coit</em> litigation, the nature of the IRS conduct challenged at the outset of the litigation, and the District Court\'s particular findings, which were never challenged as clearly erroneous, <em>see</em> Motion to Dismiss or Affirm in <em>Coit v. Green,</em> O.T. 1971, No. 71-425, p. 13, amply distinguish the <em>Coit</em> case from respondents\' lawsuit.  Thus, we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="766">Page 468 U. S. 766</a></p><p> need not consider whether standing was properly found to exist in <em>Coit.</em>  Whatever the answer to that question, respondents\' complaint, which aims at nationwide relief and does not challenge particular identified unlawful IRS actions, alleges no connection between the asserted desegregation injury and the challenged IRS conduct direct enough to overcome the substantial separation of powers barriers to a suit seeking an injunction to reform administrative procedures.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>"The necessity that the plaintiff who seeks to invoke judicial power stand to profit in some personal interest remains an Art.

We assume, without deciding, that a grant of tax-exempt status to an "umbrella" organization of the sort respondents have in mind is subject to the same legal constraints as a grant of tax-exempt status directly to a school.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint generally uses the phrase "racially segregated school" to mean simply that no or few minority students attend the school, irrespective of the school\'s maintenance of racially discriminatory policies or practices.  Although the complaint, on its face, alleges that granting tax-exempt status to any "racially segregated" school in a desegregating public school district is unlawful, App. 39, it is clear that respondents premise their allegation of illegality on discrimination, not on segregation alone.</p>\n<p>The nub of respondents\' complaint is that current IRS guidelines and procedures are inadequate to detect false certifications of nondiscrimination policies.  <em>See id.</em> at 17-18, 25.  This allegation would be superfluous if respondents were claiming that racial segregation even without racial discrimination made the grant of tax-exempt status unlawful.  Moreover respondents have noticeably refrained from asserting that the IRS violates the law when it grants a tax exemption to a nondiscriminatory private school that happens to have few minority students.  Indeed, respondents\' brief in this Court makes a point of noting that their complaint alleges not only segregation, but discrimination, <em>see</em> Brief for Respondents 10, n. 8, and it repeatedly states that the challenged Government conduct is the granting of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools, <em>see, e.g., id.</em> at 9-10 ("Respondents alleged that the federal petitioners are continuing to grant tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools . . ."); <em>id.</em> at 13-14.</p>\n<p>Since respondents\' entire argument is built on the assertion that their rights are violated by IRS grants of tax-exempt status to some number of unidentified racially discriminatory private schools in desegregating districts, we resolve the ambiguity in respondents\' complaint by reading it as making that assertion.</p>\n<p>Contrary to JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s statement, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#768">468 U.

To the extent there is a difference, it is that the former examines the causal connection between the assertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury, whereas the latter examines the causal connection between the alleged injury and the judicial relief requested.  Cases such as this, in which the relief requested goes well beyond the violation of law alleged, illustrate why it is important to keep the inquiries separate if the "redressability" component is to focus on the requested relief.  Even if the relief respondents request might have a substantial effect on the desegregation of public schools, whatever deficiencies exist in the opportunities for desegregated education for respondents\' children might not be traceable to IRS violations of law -- grants of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools in respondents\' communities.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>We assume, <em>arguendo,</em> that the asserted stigmatic injury may be caused by the Government\'s grant of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools even if the Government is granting those exemptions without knowing or believing that the schools in fact discriminate.

Moreover, each contains one or more private schools that discriminate against black schoolchildren and that operate with the assistance of tax exemptions unlawfully granted to them by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  <em>See</em> Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 24-48, App. 26-38.</p>\n<p>To eliminate this federal financial assistance for discriminating schools, the respondents seek a declaratory judgment that current IRS practices are inadequate both in identifying racially discriminatory schools and in denying requested tax exemptions or revoking existing exemptions for any schools so identified.  In particular, they allege that existing IRS guidelines permit schools to receive tax exemptions simply by adopting and certifying -- but not implementing -- a policy of nondiscrimination.  Pursuant to these ineffective guidelines, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] many private schools that discriminate on the basis of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 468 U.

The resulting exemptions and deductions provide tangible financial aid and other benefits which support the operation of racially segregated private schools.  In particular, the resulting deductions facilitate the raising of funds to organize new schools and expand existing schools in order to accommodate white students avoiding attendance in desegregating public school districts.  Additionally, the existence of a federal tax exemption amounts to a federal stamp of approval which facilitates fund raising on behalf of racially segregated private schools.

The Court concludes that</p>\n<p>"[t]he limited setting, the history of school desegregation in Mississippi at the time of the <em>Coit</em> litigation, the nature of the IRS conduct challenged at the outset of the litigation, and the District Court\'s particular findings . . . amply distinguish the <em>Coit</em> case from respondents\' lawsuit."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#765">468 U.

With all due respect, none of these criteria should be relevant to the determination of standing in these cases.</p>\n<p>First, although the <em>Coit</em> litigation was limited to the State of Mississippi, that relates solely to the scope of a properly certified class, and not to the standing of class members to maintain their action.  <em>Cf.</em> <l=|468 3|="" 737fn2="" u.s.="">n. 3, <em>supra.</em>  Second, although the District Court made extensive findings concerning the importance of tax exemptions to the discriminatory schools involved in the <em>Coit</em> litigation, that only helps to prove the truth of the allegations made by the respondents in these cases.  It also demonstrates why the respondents should be given either an opportunity to prove their case on the merits or an opportunity to amend their pleadings with more particularized allegations.  <em>Cf.</em> nn. <l=|468 6|="" 737fn2="" u.s.="">6, <l=|468 737fn2="" 8|="" u.s.="">8, <em>supra.</em>  Because the respondents in this litigation have never had their day in court, the Court\'s use of the specific findings made in the <em>Coit</em> litigation to deny the respondents standing in this litigation makes a mockery of the standing inquiry.  Third, although it is correct that, before the <em>Coit</em> litigation, the IRS initially followed a policy of granting tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools, that should have no bearing on the respondents\' standing in these cases; indeed, the respondents have alleged that the current IRS enforcement policy is so ineffective as to be the functional equivalent of the Government\'s policy prior to the <em>Coit</em> litigation.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#768">468 U.

Finally, if the "history of school desegregation in Mississippi at the time of the <em>Coit</em> litigation" is at all relevant to the standing inquiry, it weighs in favor of allowing the respondents to maintain their present lawsuit.  From the perspective of black children attending desegregating public schools, and according to the allegations included in their complaint, current IRS policies toward racially discriminatory private schools represent a substantial continuation of the onerous history of school desegregation in the affected school districts.  With all respect, therefore, the Court has simply failed to distinguish these cases from our summary affirmance in <em>Coit v.

The Court is quite correct when it writes:</p>\n<p>"The injury they identify -- their children\'s diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated school -- is, beyond any doubt, not only judicially cognizable but, as shown by cases from <em>Brown v.

A subsidy for the withdrawal of a white child can have the same effect as a penalty for admitting a black child.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In final analysis, the wrong respondents allege that the Government has committed is to subsidize the exodus of white children from schools that would otherwise be racially integrated.  The critical question in these cases, therefore, is whether respondents have alleged that the Government has created that kind of subsidy.</p>\n<p>In answering that question, we must, of course, assume that respondents can prove what they have alleged.  Furthermore, at this stage of the litigation, we must put to one side all questions about the appropriateness of a nationwide class action. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  The controlling issue is whether the causal connection between the injury and the wrong has been adequately alleged.</p>\n<p>An organization that qualifies for preferential treatment under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, because it is "operated exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes," 26 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 468 U.

Only last Term, we explained the effect of this preferential treatment:</p>\n<p>"Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system.  A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.  Deductible contributions are similar to cash grants of the amount of a portion of the individual\'s contributions."</p>\n<p><em>Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html">461 U.

The purpose of this scheme, like the purpose of any subsidy, is to promote the activity subsidized; the statutes "seek to achieve the same basic goal of encouraging the development of certain organizations through the grant of tax benefits."  <em>Bob Jones University v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/574/case.html">461 U.

If the granting of preferential tax treatment would "encourage" private segregated schools to conduct their "charitable" activities, it must follow that the withdrawal of the treatment would "discourage" them, and hence promote the process of desegregation.

S. 786</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We have held that, when a subsidy makes a given activity more or less expensive, injury can be fairly traced to the subsidy for purposes of standing analysis because of the resulting increase or decrease in the ability to engage in the activity. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Indeed, we have employed exactly this causation analysis in the same context at issue here -- subsidies given private schools that practice racial discrimination.  Thus, in <em>Gilmore v. City of Montgomery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/556/case.html">417 U. S. 556</a></span> (1974), we easily recognized the causal connection between official policies that enhanced the attractiveness of segregated schools and the failure to bring about or maintain a desegregated public school system. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Similarly, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/455/case.html">Norwood v.

S. 466</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court itself appears to embrace this reading of <em>Gilmore</em> and <em>Norwood.</em>  It describes <em>Gilmore</em> as holding that a city\'s policy of permitting segregated private schools to use public parks</p>\n<p>"would impede the integration of the public schools.  Exclusive availability of the public parks \'significantly enhanced the attractiveness of segregated private schools . . . by enabling them to offer complete athletic programs.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#762">468 U. S. 762</a></span>, n. 27 (quoting 417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/556/case.html#569">417 U. S. 569</a></span>).  It characterizes <em>Norwood</em> as having concluded that the provision of textbooks to such schools would impede court-ordered desegregation.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#763">468 U. S. 763</a></span>.  Although the form of the subsidy for segregated private schools involved in <em>Gilmore</em> and <em>Norwood</em> was different from the "cash grant" that flows from a tax exemption, the economic effect and causal connection between the subsidy and the impact on the complaining litigants was precisely the same in those cases as it is here. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 468 U. S. 788</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This causation analysis is nothing more than a restatement of elementary economics:  when something becomes more expensive, less of it will be purchased.  Sections 170 and 501(c)(3) are premised on that recognition.  If racially discriminatory private schools lose the "cash grants" that flow from the operation of the statutes, the education they provide will become more expensive, and hence less of their services will be purchased.  Conversely, maintenance of these tax benefits makes an education in segregated private schools relatively more attractive by decreasing its cost.  Accordingly, without tax-exempt status, private schools will either not be competitive in terms of cost or have to change their admissions policies, hence reducing their competitiveness for parents seeking "a racially segregated alternative" to public schools, which is what respondents have alleged many white parents in desegregating school districts seek. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  In either event, the process of desegregation will be advanced in the same way that it was advanced in <em>Gilmore</em> and <em>Norwood</em> -- the withdrawal of the subsidy for segregated schools means the incentive structure facing white parents who seek such schools for their children will be altered.  Thus, the laws of economics, not to mention the laws of Congress embodied in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 170 and 501(c)(3), compel the conclusion that the injury respondents have alleged -- the increased segregation of their children\'s schools because of the ready availability of private schools that admit whites only -- will be redressed if these schools\' operations are inhibited through the denial of preferential tax treatment.

The Court therefore is forced to introduce the concept of "separation of powers" into its analysis.  The Court writes that the separation of powers "explains why our cases preclude the conclusion" that respondents\' injury is fairly traceable to the conduct they challenge.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#759">468 U. S. 759</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court could mean one of three things by its invocation of the separation of powers.  First, it could simply be expressing the idea that, if the plaintiff lacks Art. III standing to bring a lawsuit, then there is no "case or controversy" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 468 U. S. 790</a></p><p> within the meaning of Art. III, and hence the matter is not within the area of responsibility assigned to the Judiciary by the Constitution.  As we have written in the past, through the standing requirement,</p>\n<p>"Art. III limit[s] the federal judicial power \'to those disputes which confine federal courts to a role consistent with a system of separated powers and which are traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Valley Forge Christian College v.

[<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  While there can be no quarrel with this proposition, in itself it provides no guidance for determining if the injury respondents have alleged is fairly traceable to the conduct they have challenged.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court could be saying that it will require a more direct causal connection when it is troubled by the separation of powers implications of the case before it.  That approach confuses the standing doctrine with the justiciability of the issues that respondents seek to raise.  The purpose of the standing inquiry is to measure the plaintiff\'s stake in the outcome, not whether a court has the authority to provide it with the outcome it seeks:</p>\n<p>"[T]he standing question is whether the plaintiff has \'alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\' as to warrant <em>his</em> invocation of federal court jurisdiction and to justify the exercise of the court\'s remedial powers on his behalf."</p>\n<p><em>Warth v.

The strength of the plaintiff\'s interest in the outcome has nothing to do with whether the relief it seeks would intrude upon the prerogatives of other branches of government; the possibility that the relief might be inappropriate does not lessen the plaintiff\'s stake in obtaining that relief.  If a plaintiff presents a nonjusticiable issue, or seeks relief that a court may not award, then its complaint should be dismissed for those reasons, and not because the plaintiff lacks a stake in obtaining that relief, and hence has no standing. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  Imposing an undefined but clearly more rigorous standard for redressability for reasons unrelated to the causal nexus between the injury and the challenged conduct </p><p><a class="page-number" name="792">Page 468 U.

[<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, the Court could be saying that it will not treat as legally cognizable injuries that stem from an administrative decision concerning how enforcement resources will be allocated.  This surely is an important point.  Respondents do seek to restructure the IRS\'s mechanisms for enforcing the legal requirement that discriminatory institutions not receive tax-exempt status.  Such restructuring would dramatically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 468 U. S. 793</a></p><p> affect the way in which the IRS exercises its prosecutorial discretion.  The Executive requires latitude to decide how best to enforce the law, and in general the Court may well be correct that the exercise of that discretion, especially in the tax context, is unchallengeable.</p>\n<p>However, as the Court also recognizes, this principle does not apply when suit is brought "to enforce specific legal obligations whose violation works a direct harm," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#761">468 U. S. 761</a></span>.  For example, despite the fact that they were challenging the methods used by the Executive to enforce the law, citizens were accorded standing to challenge a pattern of police misconduct that violated the constitutional constraints on law enforcement activities in <em>Allee v. Medrano,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/802/case.html">416 U. S. 802</a></span> (1974). [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  Here, respondents contend that the IRS is violating a specific constitutional limitation on its enforcement discretion.  There is a solid basis for that contention.  In <em>Norwood,</em> we wrote:</p>\n<p>"A State\'s constitutional obligation requires it to steer clear, not only of operating the old dual system of racially segregated schools, but also of giving significant aid to institutions that practice racial or other invidious discrimination."</p>\n<p>413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/455/case.html#467">413 U.

They establish, respondents argue, that the IRS cannot provide "cash grants" to discriminatory schools through preferential tax treatment without running afoul of a constitutional duty to refrain from "giving significant aid" to these institutions.  Similarly, respondents claim that the Internal Revenue Code itself, as construed in <em>Bob Jones,</em> constrains enforcement discretion. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  It has been clear since <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v.

Surely the question whether the Constitution or the Code limits enforcement discretion is one within the Judiciary\'s competence, and I do not believe that the question whether the law, as enunciated in <em>Gilmore, Norwood,</em> and <em>Bob Jones,</em> imposes such an obligation upon the IRS is so insubstantial that respondents\' attempt to raise it should be defeated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that it infringes the Executive\'s prerogatives. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, I would deal with the question of the legal limitations on the IRS\'s enforcement discretion on its merits, rather than by making the untenable assumption that the granting of preferential tax treatment to segregated schools does not make those schools more attractive to white students, and hence does not inhibit the process of desegregation.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The question whether respondents have adequately alleged their standing must be separated from the question whether they can prove what has been alleged.  It may be that questions concerning the racial policies of given schools, and the impact of their tax treatment on enrollment, vary widely from school to school, making inappropriate the nationwide class described in respondents\' complaint.  A case in which it was proved that a segregated private school opened just as a nearby public school system began desegregating pursuant to court order, that the IRS knew the school did not admit blacks, and that the school prospered only as a result of favorable tax treatment, might be very different from one in which the plaintiff attempted to prove a nationwide policy and its effect.  However, as JUSTICE BRENNAN observes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#770">468 U. S. 770</a></span>-771, n. 3, 780-781, n. 9, that goes to whether respondents can prove the nationwide policy they have alleged, and whether the factual issues they raise are sufficiently national in scope to justify the certification of a nationwide class.  I rather doubt that a nationwide class would be appropriate, but, at this stage, respondents\' allegations of injury must be taken as true, <em>see Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U. S. 490</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#501">422 U. S. 501</a></span> (1975), and hence we must assume that respondents can prove the existence of a nationwide policy and its alleged effects.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents\' complaint is premised on precisely this theory.  The complaint, in \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 39-48, describes a number of private schools which receive preferential tax treatment and which allegedly discriminate on the basis of race, providing white children with "a racially segregated alternative to attendance" in the public schools which respondents\' children attend.  The complaint then states:</p>\n<p>"There are thousands of other racially segregated private schools which operate or serve desegregating public school districts and which function under the umbrella of organizations which have received, applied for, or will apply for, federal tax exemptions.  Moreover, many additional public school districts will, in the future, begin desegregating pursuant to court order or [government] regulations and guidelines, under state law or voluntarily.  Additional racially segregated private schools may be organized or expanded, many of which will be operated by organizations which have received, applied for, or will apply for federal tax exemptions.  As in the case of those representative organizations and private schools described in paragraphs 39-48, <em>supra,</em> such organizations and schools provide, or will provide, white children with a racially segregated alternative to desegregating public schools.  <em>By recognizing these organizations as exempt from federal taxation, defendants facilitate their development, operation and expansion and the provision of racially segregated educational opportunities for white children avoiding attendance in desegregating public school systems.  Defendants thereby also interfere with the efforts of federal courts, [the Federal Government] and local school authorities to eliminate racially dual school systems.</em>"</p>\n<p>App. 38 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>Thus, like JUSTICE BRENNAN, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#774">468 U.

There, the plaintiffs -- indigent persons in need of free medical care -- alleged that they were harmed by the Secretary of the Treasury\'s decision to permit hospitals to retain charitable status while offering a reduced level of free care.  However, while here the source of the causal nexus is the price that white parents must pay to obtain a segregated education, which is inextricably intertwined with the school\'s tax status, in <em>Simon,</em> the plaintiffs were seeking free care, which hospitals could decide not to provide for any number of reasons unrelated to their tax status.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#42">426 U.

Therefore, they had an economic incentive to forgo preferential treatment.  As the Court observed:</p>\n<p>"It is equally speculative whether the desired exercise of the Court\'s remedial powers in this suit would result in the availability to respondents of such services.  So far as the complaint sheds light, it is just as plausible that the hospitals to which respondents may apply for service would elect to forgo favorable tax treatment to avoid the undetermined financial drain of an increase in the level of uncompensated services. . . .  [C]onflicting evidence supports the common sense proposition that the dependence upon special tax benefits may vary from hospital to hospital."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#43">426 U.

Thus, the economic effect of the challenged tax treatment in these cases is not "speculative," as the Court concluded it was in <em>Simon.</em>  Here the financial incentives run in only one direction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also Warth v.

Thus, in terms of Article III limitations on federal court jurisdiction, the question of standing is related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.

The only guidance the Court offers is that the separation of powers counsels against recognizing standing when the plaintiff "seek[s] a restructuring of the apparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal duties."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#761">468 U. S. 761</a></span>.  That cannot be an appropriate test; the separation of powers tolerates quite a bit of "restructuring" in order to eliminate the effects of racial segregation.  For example, in <em>Bolling v. Sharpe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/497/case.html">347 U. S. 497</a></span> (1954), we held that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the Executive from maintaining a dual school system.  We have subsequently made it clear that the courts have authority to restructure both school attendance patterns and curriculum when necessary to eliminate the effects of a dual school system.  <em>See, e.g., Columbus Board of Education v. Penick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/449/case.html">443 U. S. 449</a></span> (1979); <em>Milliken v.
