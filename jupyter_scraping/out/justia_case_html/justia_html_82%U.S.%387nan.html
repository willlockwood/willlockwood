Obviously there was no final decree.  The only decree rendered in the Supreme Court was that the injunction of the court below be dissolved.  That decree was in no sense final.  It left the whole case to be disposed of upon its merits.  This has been frequently decided.</p>\n<p><em>Writ dismissed.</em></p>\n<p>* <em>See</em> the two acts,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/687/case.html#689">79 U.
