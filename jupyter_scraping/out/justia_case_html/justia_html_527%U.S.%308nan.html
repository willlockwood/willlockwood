After GMD fell into financial trouble and missed an interest payment on the Notes, respondents accelerated the Notes\' principal amount and filed suit for the amount due in Federal District Court. Alleging that GMD was at risk of insolvency, or already insolvent, that it was preferring its Mexican creditors by its planned allocation to them of its most valuable assets, and that these actions would frustrate any judgment respondents could obtain, respondents requested a preliminary injunction restraining petitioners from transferring the assets. The court issued the preliminary injunction and ordered respondents to post a $50,000 bond. The Second Circuit affirmed.</p><p>Held:</p><p>1. This case has not been rendered moot by the District Court\'s granting summary judgment to respondents on their contract claim and converting the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction. Generally, the appeal of a preliminary injunction becomes moot when the trial court enters a permanent injunction because the former merges into the latter. Here, however, petitioners\' potential cause of action against the injunction bond for wrongful injunction suffices to preserve the Court\'s jurisdiction, since petitioners\' argument that the District Court lacked the power to restrain their use of assets pending a money judgment is independent of their defense against the money judgment on the merits.

A. (GMD), is a Mexican holding company. In February 1994, GMD issued $250 million of 8.25% unsecured, guaranteed notes due in 2001 (Notes), which ranked <i>pari passu </i>in priority of payment with all of GMD\'s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Interest payments were due in February and August of every year. Four subsidiaries of GMD (which are the remaining petitioners) guaranteed the Notes. Respondents are investment funds which purchased approximately $75 million of the Notes.</p><p>Between 1990 and 1994, GMD was involved in a toll road construction program sponsored by the Government of Mexico. In order to elicit private financing, the Mexican Government granted concessions to companies that would build and operate the system of toll roads. GMD was both an investor in the concessionaries and among the construction companies hired by the concessionaries to build the toll</p><p><i>* </i><i>Daniel W Krasner </i>filed a brief for the Dominican Republic urging reversal.</p><p>Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the United States by Solicitor General Waxman, Acting Assistant Attorney General Ogden, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Edward C.

Smith.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="311">311</a></p><p>roads. Problems in the Mexican economy resulted in severe losses for the concessionaries, who were therefore unable to pay contractors like GMD. In response to these problems, in 1997, the Mexican Government announced the Toll Road Rescue Program, under which it would issue guaranteed notes (Toll Road Notes) to the concessionaries, in exchange for their ceding to the Government ownership of the toll roads. The Toll Road Notes were to be used to pay the bank debt of the concessionaries, and also to pay outstanding receivables held by GMD and other contractors for services rendered to the concessionaries (Toll Road Receivables). In the fall of 1997, GMD announced that it expected to receive approximately $309 million of Toll Road Notes under the program.</p><p>Because of the downturn in the Mexican economy and the related difficulties in the toll road program, by mid-1997 GMD was in serious financial trouble. In addition to the Notes, GMD owed other debts of about $450 million. GMD\'s 1997 Form 20-F, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 1997, stated that GMD\'s current liabilities exceeded its current assets and that there was "substantial doubt" whether it could continue as a going concern. As a result of these financial problems, neither GMD nor its subsidiaries (who had guaranteed payment) made the August 1997 interest payment on the Notes.</p><p>Between August and December 1997, GMD attempted to negotiate a restructuring of its debt with its creditors. On August 26, Reuters reported that GMD was negotiating with the Mexican banks to reduce its $256 million bank debt, and that it planned to deal with this liability before negotiating with the investors owning the Notes. On October 28, GMD publicly announced that it would place in trust its right to receive $17 million of Toll Road Notes, to cover employee compensation payments, and that it had transferred its right to receive $100 million of Toll Road Notes to the Mexican</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="312">312</a></p><p>Government (apparently to pay back taxes). GMD also negotiated with the holders of the Notes (including respondents) to restructure that debt, but by December these negotiations had failed.</p><p>On December 11, respondents accelerated the principal amount of their Notes, and, on December 12, filed suit for the amount due in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (petitioners had consented to personal jurisdiction in that forum). The complaint alleged that "GMD is at risk of insolvency, if not insolvent already"; that GMD was dissipating its most significant asset, the Toll Road Notes, and was preferring its Mexican creditors by its planned allocation of Toll Road Notes to the payment of their claims, and by its transfer to them of Toll Road Receivables; and that these actions would "frustrate any judgment" respondents could obtain. App. 29-30. Respondents sought breach-of-contract damages of $80.9 million, and requested a preliminary injunction restraining petitioners from transferring the Toll Road Notes or Receivables. On that same day, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order preventing petitioners from transferring their right to receive the Toll Road Notes.</p><p>On December 23, the District Court entered an order in which it found that "GMD is at risk of insolvency if not already insolvent"; that the Toll Road Notes were GMD\'s "only substantial asset"; that GMD planned to use the Toll Road Notes "to satisfy its Mexican creditors to the exclusion of [respondents] and other holders of the Notes"; that "[i]n light of [petitioners\'] financial condition and dissipation of assets, any judgment [respondents] obtain in this action will be frustrated"; that respondents had demonstrated irreparable injury; and that it was "almost certain" that respondents would succeed on the merits of their claim. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a-26a.

We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1015 (1998).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Respondents contend that events subsequent to petitioners\' appeal of the preliminary injunction render this case moot. While that appeal was pending in the Second Circuit, the case proceeded in the District Court. Petitioners filed an answer and asserted various counterclaims. On April 17, 1998, the District Court granted summary judgment to respondents on their contract claim and dismissed petitioners\' counterclaims. The court ordered petitioners to pay respondents $82,444,259 by assignment or transfer of Toll Road Receivables or Toll Road Notes; the court also converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction pending such assignment or transfer. Although petitioners initially appealed both portions of this order to the Second Circuit, they later abandoned their appeal from the permanent injunction. The appeal from the payment order is still pending in the Second Circuit. The same date the District Court entered judgment, respondents moved to dismiss petitioners\' first appeal-the one now before us-arguing that the final judgment rendered the appeal moot. On May 4, the Second Circuit denied the motion to dismiss and two days later affirmed, as mentioned above, the District Court\'s grant of the preliminary injunction.</p><p>Respondents argue that the issue of the propriety of the preliminary injunction is moot because that injunction is now merged into the permanent injunction. Petitioners contend that the case is not moot because, if we hold that the District Court was without power to issue the preliminary injunction,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="314">314</a></p><p>then under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(c) and 65.11 they will have a claim against the injunction bond. They assert that the injunction "interfered with GMD\'s efforts to restructure its debt and substantially impaired GMD\'s ability to continue its operations in the ordinary course of business." Brief for Petitioners 7. Respondents concede that a party who has been wrongfully enjoined has a claim on the bond, but they argue that although such a claim might mean that the <i>case </i>is not moot, it does not prevent this <i>interlocutory appeal </i>from becoming moot. In any event, say respondents, because a claim for wrongful injunction requires that the enjoined party win on the ultimate merits, petitioners have forfeited any claim by failing to appeal the portion of the District Court\'s judgment converting the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.</p><p>Generally, an appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction becomes moot when the trial court enters a permanent injunction, because the former merges into the latter. We have dismissed appeals in such circumstances. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Smith </i>v. <i>Illinois Bell Telephone Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/587/case.html">270 U. S. 587</a>, 588-589 (1926). We agree with petitioners, however, that their potential cause of action against the injunction bond preserves our jurisdiction over this appeal. Cf. <i>Liner </i>v. <i>Jafco, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/301/case.html">375 U. S. 301</a>, 305-306 (1964).</p><p>In the case of the usual preliminary injunction, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin, pending the outcome of the litigation, action that he claims is unlawful. If his lawsuit turns out to be meritorious-if he is found to be entitled to the permanent injunction that he seeks-even if the preliminary injunction was wrongly issued (because at that stage of the</p><p>1 Rule 65(c) provides that an applicant for a preliminary injunction must obtain security "for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained." Rule 65.1 states in part that "[t]he surety\'s liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="315">315</a></p><p>litigation the plaintiff\'s prospects of winning were not sufficiently clear, or the plaintiff was not suffering irreparable injury) its issuance would in any event be harmless error. The final injunction establishes that the defendant <i>should not have been engaging in the conduct that was enjoined. </i>Hence, it is reasonable to regard the preliminary injunction as merging into the final one: If the latter is valid, the former is, if not procedurally correct, at least harmless. A quite different situation obtains in the present case, where (according to petitioners\' claim) the substantive validity of the final injunction does <i>not </i>establish the substantive validity of the preliminary one. For the latter was issued not to enjoin <i>un</i><i>lawful </i>conduct, but rather to <i>render </i>unlawful conduct that would otherwise be permissible, in order to protect the anticipated judgment of the court; and it is the essence of petitioners\' claim that such an injunction can be issued only after the judgment is rendered. If petitioners are correct, they <i>have </i>been harmed by issuance of the unauthorized preliminary injunction-and hence <i>should </i>be able to recover on the <i>bond-even if </i>the final injunction is proper. It would make no sense, when this is the claim, to say that the preliminary injunction merges into the final one.2</p><p>2We recognize that respondents alleged in their complaint that the assignments of the rights to receive Toll Road Notes violated the negative pledge clause of the note instrument and the provision that the Notes ranked <i>pari passu </i>with other debt, and therefore that petitioners were not entitled to engage in the restrained conduct. We do not, however, understand the District Court to have made a finding-either in the preliminary injunction order or in the final order-that petitioners\' enjoined conduct was unlawful. The mootness of petitioners\' claim at the present stage of the proceedings must be assessed on the basis of what that claim <i>is. </i>As shown by the question on which we granted certiorari, it is that the District Court wrongfully entered an order to protect its judgment before the judgment was rendered. If, in fact, petitioners had no right under the note instrument to take the actions that were enjoined, that would presumably be a defense to the action on the injunction bond. See, <i>e. g., Blumenthal </i>v. <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner </i>&amp; <i>Smith, Inc., </i>910 F. 2d <i>1049,1054 (CA2 </i>1990); Note, Recovery for Wrongful Interlocutory Injunc-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="316">316</a></p><p>We reject respondents\' argument that the controversy over the bond saves the "case" from mootness, but does not save the "issue" of the validity of the preliminary injunction from mootness. <i>University of Texas </i>v. <i>Camenisch, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/390/case.html">451 U. S. 390</a> (1981), upon which respondents principally rely, is inapposite. In that case a deaf graduate student sued the University of Texas to obtain an injunction requiring the school to pay for a sign-language interpreter for his school work. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction and required the student to post an injunction bond. Pending appeal of that injunction, the university paid for the interpreter, but the student graduated before the Court of Appeals issued its decision. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals held that the appeal of the preliminary injunction was not moot because the issue of who had to pay for the interpreter remained. We reversed:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The Court of Appeals correctly held that the case as a whole is not moot, since, as that court noted, it remains to be decided who should ultimately bear the cost of the interpreter. However, the issue before the Court of Appeals was not who should pay for the interpreter, but rather whether the District Court had abused its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction requiring the University to pay for him. The two issues are significantly different, since whether the preliminary injunction should have issued depended on the balance of factors listed in [Fifth Circuit precedent], while whether the University should ultimately bear the cost of the interpreter depends on a final resolution of the merits of Camenisch\'s case.</p></blockquote><p>tions Under Rule 65(c), 99 Harv. L. Rev. 828, 836 (1986). But it does not bear upon the mootness of petitioners\' present claim.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="317">317</a></p><blockquote><p>\n"This, then, is simply another instance in which one issue in a case has become moot, but the case as a whole remains alive because other issues have not become moot .... Because the only issue presently before usthe correctness of the decision to grant a preliminary injunction-is moot, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be vacated and the case must be remanded to the District Court for trial on the merits." <i>Id., </i>at 393-394 (citations omitted).</p></blockquote><p><i>Camenisch </i>is simply an application of the same principle which underlies the rule that a preliminary injunction ordinarily merges into the final injunction. Since the preliminary injunction no longer had any effect (the student had graduated), and since the substantive issue governing the propriety of what had been paid under the preliminary injunction (as opposed to the procedural issue of whether the injunction should have issued when it did) was the same issue underlying the merits claim, there was no sense in trying the preliminary injunction question separately. In the present case, however, petitioners\' basis for arguing that the preliminary injunction was wrongfully issued-which is that the District Court lacked the power to restrain their use of assets pending a money judgment-is independent of respondents\' claim on the merits-which is that petitioners breached the note instrument by failing to make the August 1997 interest payment. The resolution of the merits is immaterial to the validity of petitioners\' potential claim on the bond. Cf. <i>American Can Co. </i>v. <i>Mansukhani, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/742/314/">742 F.2d 314</a>, <i>320-321 (CA7 </i>1984); <i>Stacey </i>G. v. <i>Pasadena Independent Sch.

And again for the same reason, we reject respondents\' argument that petitioners have no wrongful injunction claim because they lost the case on the merits.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>We turn, then, to the merits question whether the District Court had authority to issue the preliminary injunction in this case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.3 The Judiciary Act of 1789 conferred on the federal courts jurisdiction over "all suits ... in equity." \xc2\xa7 11, 1 Stat. 78.

The United States as <i>amicus curiae, </i>however, contends that the preliminary injunction issued in this case is analogous to the relief obtained in the equitable action known as a "creditor\'s bill." This remedy was used (among other purposes) to permit a judgment creditor to discover the debtor\'s assets, to reach equitable interests not subject to execution at law, and to set aside fraudulent conveyances. See 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \xc2\xa7 2.8(1), pp. 191-192 (2d ed. 1993); 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy\'s Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7 1415, pp. 1065-1066 (5th ed. 1941); 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences \xc2\xa7 26, p. 51 (rev. ed. 1940). It was well established, however, that, as a general rule, a creditor\'s bill could be brought only by a creditor who had already obtained a judgment establishing the debt.

Particularly in the absence of any discussion of this point by the lower courts, we are not inclined to speculate upon the existence or applicability to this case of any exceptions, and follow the wellestablished general rule that a judgment establishing the debt was necessary before a court of equity would interfere with the debtor\'s use of his property.</p><p>JUSTICE GINSBURG concedes that federal equity courts have traditionally rejected the type of provisional relief granted in this case. See <i>post, </i>at 338 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). She invokes, however, "the grand aims of equity," and asserts a general power to grant relief whenever legal remedies are not "practical and efficient," unless there is a statute to the contrary. <i>Post, </i>at 342 (internal quotation marks omitted). This expansive view of equity must be rejected. Joseph Story\'s famous treatise reflects what we consider the proper rule, both with regard to the general role of equity in our "government of laws, not of men," and with regard to its application in the very case before us:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Mr. Justice Blackstone has taken considerable pains to refute this doctrine. \'It is said,\' he remarks, \'that it is the business of a Court of Equity, in England, to abate the rigor of the common law.

We do not question the proposition that equity is flexible; but in the federal system, at least, that flexibility is confined within the broad boundaries of traditional equitable relief. To accord a type of relief that has never been available before-and especially (as here) a type of relief that has been specifically disclaimed by longstanding judicial precedent-is to invoke a "default rule," <i>post, </i>at 342, not of flexibility but of omnipotence. When there are indeed new conditions that might call for a wrenching departure from past practice, Congress is in a much better position than we both to perceive them and to design the appropriate remedy. Despite JUSTICE GINSBURG\'S allusion to the "increasing complexities of modern business relations," <i>post, </i>at 337 (internal quotation marks omitted), and to the bygone "age of slow-moving capital and comparatively immobile wealth," <i>post, </i>at 338, we suspect there is absolutely nothing new about debtors\' trying to avoid paying their debts, or seeking to favor some creditors over others-or even about their seeking to achieve these ends through "sophisticated ... strategies," <i>ibid. </i>The law of fraudulent conveyances and bankruptcy was developed to prevent such conduct; an equitable power to restrict a debtor\'s use of his unencumbered property before judgment was not.</p><p>Respondents argue (supported by the United States) that the merger of law and equity changed the rule that a general creditor could not interfere with the debtor\'s use of his property. But the merger did not alter substantive rights. "Notwithstanding the fusion of law and equity by the Rules of Civil Procedure, the substantive principles of Courts of Chancery remain unaffected." <i>Stainback, </i>336 U. S., at 382, n. 26. Even in the absence of historical support, we would not be inclined to believe that it is merely a question of procedure whether a person\'s unencumbered assets can be</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="323">323</a></p><p>frozen by general-creditor claimants before their claims have been vindicated by judgment. It seems to us that question goes to the substantive rights of all property owners. In any event it appears, as we have observed, that the rule requiring a judgment was historically regarded as serving, not merely the procedural end of assuring exhaustion of legal remedies (which the merger of law and equity could render irrelevant), but also the substantive end of giving the creditor an interest in the property which equity could then act upon. See <i>supra, </i>at 319-320.6</p><p>We note that none of the parties or <i>amici </i>specifically raised the applicability to this case of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 18(b), which states:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first having obtained a judgment establishing the claim for money."</p></blockquote><p>6 As we stated in <i>Adler </i>v. <i>Fenton, </i>24 How. 407, 411-412 (1861): \'\'\'Our laws determine with accuracy the time and manner in which the property of a debtor ceases to be subject to his disposition, and becomes subject to the rights of his creditor. A creditor acquires a lien upon the lands of his debtor by a judgment; and upon the personal goods of the debtor, by the delivery of an execution to the sheriff. It is only by these liens that a creditor has any vested or specific right in the property of his debtor. Before these liens are acquired, the debtor has full dominion over his property; he may convert one species of property into another, and he may alienate to a purchaser. The rights of the debtor, and those of a creditor, are thus defined by positive rules; and the points at which the power of the debtor ceases, and the right of the creditor commences, are clearly established. These regulations cannot be contravened or varied by any interposition of equity\'" (quoting <i>Moran </i>v. <i>Dawes, </i>1 Hopk. Ch. 365, 367 (N.

They further alleged that the company that sold the certificates was insolvent, that it was likely to make preferential payments to certain creditors, and that its assets were in danger of dissipation. They sought the appointment of a receiver and an injunction restraining the company administering the trust from transferring any assets of the corporations or of the trust. The District Court preliminarily enjoined the company from transferring a fixed sum. <i>Id., </i>at 285-286.</p><p>7 Several States have adopted the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (or its successor the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act), which has been interpreted as conferring on a nonjudgment creditor the right to bring a fraudulent conveyance claim.

Insofar as Rule 18(b) applies to such an action, the state statute eliminating the need for a judgment may have altered the common-law rule that a general contract creditor has no interest in his debtor\'s property.

And, if so, it is difficult to see why a plaintiff in any action for a personal judgment in tort or contract may not, also, apply to the chancellor for a so-called injunction sequestrating his opponent\'s assets pending recovery and satisfaction of a judgment in such a law action.

As one treatise writer explained:</p><blockquote><p>\n"A rule of procedure which allowed any prowling creditor, before his claim was definitely established by judgment, and without reference to the character of his demand, to file a bill to discover assets, or to impeach transfers, or interfere with the business affairs of the alleged debtor, would manifestly be susceptible of the grossest abuse. A more powerful weapon of oppression could not be placed at the disposal of unscrupulous litigants." Wait, Fraudulent Conveyances \xc2\xa7 73, at 110-111.</p></blockquote><p>The requirement that the creditor obtain a prior judgment is a fundamental protection in debtor-creditor law-rendered all the more important in our federal system by the debtor\'s right to a jury trial on the legal claim. There are other factors which likewise give us pause: The remedy sought here could render Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 64, which authorizes use of state prejudgment remedies, a virtual irrelevance. Why go through the trouble of complying with local</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="331">331</a></p><p>attachment and garnishment statutes when this all-purpose prejudgment injunction is available? More importantly, by adding, through judicial fiat, a new and powerful weapon to the creditor\'s arsenal, the new rule could radically alter the balance between debtor\'s and creditor\'s rights which has been developed over centuries through many lawsincluding those relating to bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyances, and preferences. Because any rational creditor would want to protect his investment, such a remedy might induce creditors to engage in a "race to the courthouse" in cases involving insolvent or near-insolvent debtors, which might prove financially fatal to the struggling debtor. (In this case, we might observe, the respondents did not represent all of the holders of the Notes; they were an active few who sought to benefit at the expense of the other noteholders as well as GMD\'s other creditorsY) It is significant that, in England, use of the <i>Mareva </i>injunction has expanded rapidly. "Since 1975, the English courts have awarded <i>Mareva </i>injunctions to freeze assets in an ever-increasing set of circumstances both within and beyond the commercial setting to an ever-expanding number of plaintiffs." Wasserman, <i>supra, </i>at 339. As early as 1984, one observer stated that "[t]here are now a steady flow of such applications to our Courts which have been estimated to exceed one thou-</p><p>llJUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that respondents acted to benefit all of GMD\'s creditors. See <i>post, </i>at 341, n. 6. But respondents\' complaint sought the full amount they were allegedly owed, despite their contention that petitioners could not pay all their creditors. It is not clear that the "trust in compliance with Mexican law" that respondents proposed as a possible preliminary remedy, <i>ibid., </i>was to be for the benefit of all creditors, rather than respondents alone-but that remedy was in any event denied, which did not deter respondents from seeking a simple freeze on assets to satisfy their anticipated judgment. There is nothing whatever wrong with respondents\' pursuing their own interests. Indeed, the fact that it is entirely proper and entirely predictable is the very premise of the point we are making: that this new remedy will promote unregulated competition among the creditors of a struggling debtor.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="332">332</a></p><p>sand per month."

We set them forth only to demonstrate that resolving them in this forum is incompatible with the democratic and self-deprecating judgment we have long since made: that the equitable powers conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not include the power to create remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence. Even when sitting as a court in equity, we have no authority to craft a "nuclear weapon" of the law like the one advocated here. Joseph Story made the point many years ago:</p><blockquote><p>\n"If, indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess the unbounded jurisdiction, which has been thus generally ascribed to it, of correcting, controlling, moderating, and even superceding the law, and of enforcing all the rights, as well as charities, arising from natural law and justice, and of freeing itself from all regard to former rules and precedents, it would be the most gigantic in its sway, and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary power, that could well be devised. It would literally place the whole rights and property of the community under the arbitrary will of the Judge, acting, if you please, <i>arbitrio boni judicis, </i>and it may be, <i>ex aequo et bono, </i>according to his own notions and conscience; but still acting with a despotic and sovereign authority. A Court of Chancery might then well deserve the spirited rebuke of Seldon; \'For law we have a measure, and know what to trust to-Equity is according to the conscience of him, that is Chancellor; and as that is larger, or narrower, so is Equity. \'T is all one, as if they should make the standard for the measure the Chancellor\'s foot.

In my view, the Court relies on an unjustifiably static conception of equity jurisdiction. From the beginning, we have defined the scope of federal equity in relation to the <i>principles </i>of equity existing at the separation of this country from England, see, <i>e. g., Payne </i>v. <i>Hook, </i>7 Wall. 425, 430 (1869); <i>Gordon </i>v. <i>Washington, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/30/case.html">295 U. S. 30</a>, 36 (1935); we have never limited federal equity jurisdiction to the specific practices and remedies of the pre-Revolutionary Chancellor.</p><p>Since our earliest cases, we have valued the adaptable character of federal equitable power. See <i>Seymour </i>v. <i>Freer, </i>8 Wall. 202, 218 (1869) ("[A] court of equity ha[s] unquestionable authority to apply its flexible and comprehensive jurisdiction in such manner as might be necessary to the right administration of justice between the parties."); <i>Hecht Co. </i>v. <i>Bowles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/321/case.html">321 U. S. 321</a>, 329 (1944) ("Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished [federal equity jurisdiction]."). We have also recognized that equity must evolve over time, "in order to meet the requirements of every case, and to satisfy the needs of a progressive social condition in which new primary rights and duties are constantly arising and new kinds of wrongs are constantly committed." <i>Union Pacific R.

[I]t possesses an inherent capacity of expansion, so as to keep abreast of each succeeding generation and age."). A dynamic equity jurisprudence is of special importance in the commercial law context. As we observed more than a century ago: "It must not be forgotten that in the increasing complexities of modern business relations equitable remedies have necessarily and steadily been expanded, and no inflexible rule has been permitted to circumscribe them." <i>Union </i>Pacific R.

See Wasserman, <i>supra, </i>at 319.

As the Court observes, see <i>ante, </i>at 327-329, preliminary asset-freeze injunctions have been available in English courts since the 1975 Court of Appeal decision in <i>Mareva Compania Naviera </i>S. <i>A. </i>v. <i>International Bulkcarriers </i>S. <i>A., </i>2 Lloyd\'s Rep. 509. Although the cases reveal some uncertainty regarding <i>Mareva\'s </i>jurisdictional basis, the better-reasoned and more recent decisions ground <i>Mareva </i>in equity\'s traditional power to remedy the "abuse" of legal process by defendants and the "injustice" that would result from defendants "making themselves judgment-proof" by disposing of their assets during the pendency of litigation. <i>Iraqi Ministry of Defence </i>v. <i>Arcepey Shipping Co., </i>1 All E. R. 480, 484-487 (1979) (citations omitted); see Hetherington, Introduction to the Mareva Injunction, in Mareva Injunctions 1, 10-13, and n. 95, 20 (M.

S. 212, 222 (1945)). Given the strong showings a creditor would be required to make to gain the provisional remedy, and the safeguards on which the debtor could insist, I agree with the Second Circuit "that this \'parade of horribles\' [would] not come to pass." <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/143/688/">143 F.3d 688</a>, 696 (1998).</p><p>Under standards governing preliminary injunctive relief generally, a plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction. See <i>Doran </i>v. <i>Salem Inn, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/922/case.html">422 U. S. 922</a>, 931 (1975). Plaintiffs with questionable claims would not meet the likelihood of success criterion. See llA Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 2948.3, at 184-188 (as a general rule, plaintiff seeking preliminary injunction must demonstrate a reasonable probability of success). The irreparable injury requirement would not be met by unsubstantiated allegations that a defendant may dissipate assets. See <i>id., </i>\xc2\xa7 2948.1, at 153 ("Speculative injury is not sufficient."); see also Wasserman, 67 Wash. L. Rev., at 286-305 (discussing application of traditional preliminary injunction requirements to provisional asset-freeze requests). As the Court of Appeals recognized, provisional freeze orders would be appropriate in damages actions only upon a finding that, without the freeze, "the movant would be unable to collect [a money] judgment." 143 F. 3d, at 697. The preliminary asset-freeze order, in short, would rank and operate as an extraordinary remedy.</p><p>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), moreover, requires a preliminary injunction applicant to post a bond "in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined." As an essential condition for a preliminary freeze order, a district court could demand sufficient security to ensure a remedy for wrongly enjoined defendants. Furthermore, it would be</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="341">341</a></p><p>incumbent on a district court to "match the scope of its injunction to the most probable size of the likely judgment," thereby sparing the defendant from undue hardship.

Cf. <i>ante, </i>at 327, 332-333. The case we face should be paradigmatic. There was no question that GMD\'s debt to Alliance was due and owing. And the short span-less than four months-between preliminary injunction and summary judgment shows that the temporary restraint on GMD did not linger beyond the time necessary for a fair and final adjudication in a busy but efficiently operated court. Absent immediate judicial action, Alliance would have been left with a multimillion dollar judgment on which it could collect not a penny.6 In my view, the District Court properly invoked its equitable power to avoid that manifestly unjust result and to protect its ability to render an enforceable final judgment.</p><p>At the hearing on the preliminary injunction, the District Judge asked: "We have got a case where there is no defense</p><p>6 Before the District Court, Alliance frankly acknowledged the existence of other, unrepresented creditors. While acting to protect its own interest, Alliance asked the District Court to fashion relief that "does not just directly benefit us, but benefits ... the whole class of creditors" by creating "an even playing field" among creditors. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a; see also <i>id., </i>at 45a (Alliance suggests that District Court direct GMD to set up a trust in compliance with Mexican law in order to oversee distributions to creditors). The Court supplies no reason to think that Alliance should have abandoned its rock-solid claim just because other creditors, for whatever reason, failed to bring suit.

Why is that equitable?" <i>Id., </i>at 36a. The Court gives no satisfactory answer.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>Contrary to the Court\'s suggestion, see <i>ante, </i>at 332, this case involves no judicial usurpation of Congress\' authority. Congress, of course, can instruct the federal courts to issue preliminary injunctions freezing assets pending final judgment, or instruct them not to, and the courts must heed Congress\' command. See <i>Guaranty Trust Co. </i>v. <i>York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/99/case.html">326 U. S. 99</a>, 105 (1945) ("Congressional curtailment of equity powers must be respected."). Indeed, Congress has restricted the equity jurisdiction of federal courts in a variety of contexts. See <i>Yakus </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/case.html">321 U. S. 414</a>, 442, n. 8 (1944) (cataloging statutes regulating federal equity power).</p><p>The Legislature, however, has said nothing about preliminary freeze orders. The relevant question, therefore, is whether, absent congressional direction, the general equitable powers of the federal courts permit relief of the kind fashioned by the District Court. I would find the default rule in the grand aims of equity. Where, as here, legal remedies are not "practical and efficient," <i>Payne, </i>7 Wall., at 431, the federal courts must rely on their "flexible jurisdiction in equity ... to protect all rights and do justice to all concerned," <i>Rubber Co. </i>v. <i>Goodyear, </i>9 Wall. 788, 807 (1870). No countervailing precedent or principle holds the federal courts powerless to prevent a defendant from dissipating assets, to the destruction of a plaintiff\'s claim, during the course of judicial proceedings. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and uphold the District Court\'s preliminary injunction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
