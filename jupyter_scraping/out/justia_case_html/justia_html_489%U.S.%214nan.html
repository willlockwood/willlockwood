It also dictates the organization and composition of those bodies, limits the term of office of a party chair, and requires that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern California.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that these provisions violate the free speech and associational rights of political parties and their members guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  826 F.2d 814 (1987).  We noted probable jurisdiction, 485 U.S. 1004 (1988), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The State of California heavily regulates its political parties.  Although the laws vary in extent and detail from party to party, certain requirements apply to all "ballot-qualified" parties. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The California Elections Code (Code) provides that the "official governing bodies" for such a party are its "state convention," "state central committee," and "county central committees," Cal.Elec.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 11702 (West </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 489 U. S. 217</a></p><p> 1977), and that these bodies are responsible for conducting the party\'s campaigns. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  At the same time, the Code provides that the official governing bodies "shall not endorse, support, or oppose, any candidate for nomination by that party for partisan office in the direct primary election."  <em>Ibid.</em>  It is a misdemeanor for any primary candidate, or a person on her behalf, to claim that she is the officially endorsed candidate of the party.  \xc2\xa7 29430.</p>\n<p>Although the official governing bodies of political parties are barred from issuing endorsements, other groups are not.  Political clubs affiliated with a party, labor organizations, political action committees, other politically active associations, and newspapers frequently endorse primary candidates. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  With the official party organizations silenced by the ban, it has been possible for a candidate with views antithetical to those of her party nevertheless to win its primary. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 489 U. S. 218</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In addition to restricting the primary activities of the official governing bodies of political parties, California also regulates their internal affairs.  Separate statutory provisions dictate the size and composition of the state central committees; [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] set forth rules governing the selection and removal of committee members; [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] fix the maximum term of office for the chair of the state central committee; [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] require that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern California; [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] specify the time and place of committee meetings; [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="219">Page 489 U. S. 219</a></p><p> limit the dues parties may impose on members. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Violations of these provisions are criminal offenses punishable by fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Various county central committees of the Democratic and Republican Parties, the state central committee of the Libertarian Party, members of various state and county central committees, and other groups and individuals active in partisan politics in California brought this action in federal court against state officials responsible for enforcing the Code (State or California). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  They contended that the ban on primary endorsements and the restrictions on internal party governance deprive political parties and their members of the rights of free speech and free association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The first count of the complaint challenged the ban on endorsements in partisan primary elections; the second count challenged the ban on endorsements in nonpartisan school, county, and municipal elections; and the third count challenged the provisions that prescribe the composition of state central committees, the term of office and eligibility criteria for state central committee chairs, the time and place of state and county central committee meetings, and the dues county committee members must pay. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="220">Page 489 U. S. 220</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, in support of which they filed 28 declarations from the chairs of each plaintiff central committee, prominent political scientists, and elected officials from California and other States.  The State moved to dismiss, and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment supported by one declaration from a former state senator.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the first count, ruling that the ban on primary endorsements in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 11702 and 29430 violated the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court stayed all proceedings on the second count under the abstention doctrine of <em>Railroad Comm\'n of Texas v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U. S. 496</a></span> (1941). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  On the third count, the court ruled that the laws prescribing the composition of state central committees, limiting the committee chairs\' terms of office, and designating that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern California violate the First Amendment. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The court denied summary judgment with respect to the statutory provisions establishing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="221">Page 489 U. S. 221</a></p><p> the time and place of committee meetings and the amount of dues.  Civ. No. C-83-5599 MHP (ND Cal., May 3, 1984).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  792 F.2d 802 (1986).  This Court vacated that decision, 479 U.S. 1024 (1987), and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Tashijian v. Republican Party of Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html">479 U. S. 208</a></span> (1986).</p>\n<p>After supplemental briefing, the Court of Appeals again affirmed.  826 F.2d 814 (1987).  The court first rejected the State\'s arguments based on nonjusticiability, lack of standing, Eleventh Amendment immunity, and <em>Pullman</em> abstention.  826 F.2d at 821-825.  Turning to the merits, the court characterized the prohibition on primary endorsements as an "outright ban" on political speech.  <em>Id.</em> at 833.</p>\n<p><em>Prohibiting the governing body of a political party from supporting some candidates and opposing others patently infringes both the right of the party to express itself freely and the right of party members to an unrestricted flow of political information.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 835.  The court rejected the State\'s argument that the ban served a compelling state interest in preventing internal party dissension and factionalism:  "The government simply has no legitimate interest in protecting political parties from disruptions of their own making."  <em>Id.</em> at 834.  The court noted, moreover, that the State had not shown that banning primary endorsements protects parties from factionalism.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court concluded that the ban was not necessary to protect voters from confusion, stating, "California\'s ban on preprimary endorsements is a form of paternalism that is inconsistent with the First Amendment."  <em>Id.</em> at 836.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also found that California\'s regulation of internal party affairs "burdens the parties\' right to govern themselves as they think best."  <em>Id.</em> at 827.  This interference with the parties\' and their members\' First Amendment rights was not justified by a compelling state interest, for a State has a legitimate interest "in orderly elections, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="222">Page 489 U. S. 222</a></p><p> not orderly parties."  <em>Id.</em> at 831.  In any event, the court noted, the State had failed to submit "<em>a shred of evidence,\'" <em>id.</em> at 833 (quoting Civ. No. C-83-5599 (ND Cal. May 3, 1984)), that the regulations of party internal affairs helped minimize party factionalism.  Accordingly, the court held that the challenged provisions were unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>A State\'s broad power to regulate the time, place, and manner of elections</p>\n<p>"does not extinguish the State\'s responsibility to observe the limits established by the First Amendment rights of the State\'s citizens."</p>\n<p><em>Tashijian v.

[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Maintaining a stable political system is, unquestionably, a compelling state interest.  <em>See Storer v.

California, however, never adequately explains how banning parties from endorsing or opposing primary candidates advances that interest.  There is no showing, for example, that California\'s political system is any more stable now than it was in 1963, when the legislature enacted the ban.  Nor does the State explain what makes the California system so peculiar that it is virtually the only State that has determined that such a ban is necessary. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 489 U. S. 227</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The only explanation the State offers is that its compelling interest in stable government embraces a similar interest in party stability.  Brief for Appellants 47.  The State relies heavily on <em>Storer v. Brown, supra,</em> where we stated that, because "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism may do significant damage to the fabric of government," 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html#736">415 U. S. 736</a></span>, States may regulate elections to ensure that "some sort of order, rather than chaos . . . accompan[ies] the democratic processes," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html#730">415 U. S. 730</a></span>.  Our decision in <em>Storer,</em> however, does not stand for the proposition that a State may enact election laws to mitigate intraparty factionalism during a primary campaign.  To the contrary, <em>Storer</em> recognized that "contending forces within the party employ the primary campaign and the primary election to finally settle their differences."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html#735">415 U. S. 735</a></span>.  A primary is not hostile to intraparty feuds; rather, it is an ideal forum in which to resolve them.  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>American Party of Texas v. White,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/767/case.html#781">415 U. S. 781</a></span>.  <em>Tashijian</em> recognizes precisely this distinction.  In that case, we noted that a State may enact laws to "prevent the disruption of the political parties from without" but not, as in this case, laws "to prevent the parties from taking internal steps affecting their own process for the selection of candidates."  479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html#224">479 U. S. 224</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is no answer to argue, as does the State, that a party that issues primary endorsements risks intraparty friction which may endanger the party\'s general election prospects.  Presumably a party will be motivated by self-interest, and not engage in acts or speech that run counter to its political success.  However, even if a ban on endorsements saves a political party from pursuing self-destructive acts, that would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="228">Page 489 U. S. 228</a></p><p> not justify a State substituting its judgment for that of the party.  <em>See ibid.; Democratic Party of United States,</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#124">450 U.

Because preserving party unity during a primary is not a compelling state interest, we must look elsewhere to justify the challenged law.</p>\n<p>The State\'s second justification for the ban on party endorsements and statements of opposition is that it is necessary to protect primary voters from confusion and undue influence.  Certainly the State has a legitimate interest in fostering an informed electorate.  <em>Tashijian, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html#220">479 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the ban on primary endorsements by political parties burdens political speech while serving no compelling governmental interest, we hold that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 11702 and 29430 violate the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>We turn next to California\'s restrictions on the organization and composition of official governing bodies, the limits on the term of office for state central committee chair, and the requirement that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern California.  These laws directly implicate the associational rights of political parties and their members.  As we noted in <em>Tashijian,</em> a political party\'s "determination . . . of the structure which best allows it to pursue its political goals is protected by the Constitution."  479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html#224">479 U. S. 224</a></span>.  Freedom of association also encompasses a political party\'s decisions about the identity of, and the process for electing, its leaders.  <em>See Democratic Party of United States, supra,</em> (State cannot dictate process of selecting state delegates to Democratic National Convention); </p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 489 U. S. 230</a></p><p> <em>Cousins v. Wigoda,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html">419 U.

Tashijian, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html#235">479 U. S. 235</a></span>-236 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) ("The ability of the members of [a political p]arty to select their own candidate . . . unquestionably implicates an associational freedom").</p>\n<p>The laws at issue burden these rights.  By requiring parties to establish official governing bodies at the county level, California prevents the political parties from governing themselves with the structure they think best. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  And by specifying who shall be the members of the parties\' official governing bodies, California interferes with the parties\' choice of leaders.  A party might decide, for example, that it will be more effective if a greater number of its official leaders are local activists, rather than Washington-based elected officials.  The Code prevents such a change.  A party might also decide that the state central committee chair needs more than two years to successfully formulate and implement policy.  The Code prevents such an extension of the chair\'s term of office.  A party might find that a resident of northern California would be particularly effective in promoting the party\'s message and in unifying the party.  The Code prevents her from chairing the state central committee unless the preceding chair was from the southern part of the State.</p>\n<p>Each restriction thus limits a political party\'s discretion in how to organize itself, conduct its affairs, and select its leaders.  Indeed, the associational rights at stake are much stronger than those we credited in <em>Tashijian.</em>  There, we found that a party\'s right to free association embraces a right to allow registered voters who are not party members to vote in the party\'s primary.  Here, party members do not seek to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 489 U. S. 231</a></p><p> associate with nonparty members, but only with one another in freely choosing their party leaders. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the challenged laws burden the associational rights of political parties and their members, the question is whether they serve a compelling state interest.  A State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.  <em>Rosario v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/752/case.html">410 U.

Toward that end, a State may enact laws that interfere with a party\'s internal affairs when necessary to ensure that elections are fair and honest.  <em>Storer v.

For example, a State may impose certain eligibility requirements for voters in the general election even though they limit parties\' ability to garner support and members.  <em>See, e.g., Dunn v.

The California Supreme Court ultimately decided that the Code did not prohibit such endorsements, and so did not reach the First Amendment question.  <em>Unger v. Superior Court,</em> 37 Cal.3d 612, 692 P.2d 238 (1984).  A ban on party endorsements in nonpartisan elections subsequently was enacted by ballot initiative.  A Federal District Court has ruled that this ban violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  <em>Geary v. Renne,</em> Civ. No. C-87-4724 AJZ (ND Cal., April 27), <em>stayed,</em> 856 F.2d 1456 (CA9 1988).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court invalidated the following Code sections:  Cal.Elec.Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8660, 8661, 8663-8667, 8669 (West 1977 and Supp.1989) (Democratic state central committee); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9160, 9160.5, 9161, 9161.5, 9162-9164 (Republican state central committee); \xc2\xa7 9274 (West 1977) (Republican state central committee chair); and \xc2\xa7 9816 (West 1977 and Supp.1989) (Peace and Freedom state central committee chair).  In addition, it held that \xc2\xa7 29102 (West 1977) was unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>California contends that it need not show that its endorsement ban serves a compelling state interest, because the political parties have "consented" to it.  In support of this claim, California observes that the legislators who could repeal the ban belong to political parties, that the bylaws of some parties prohibit primary endorsements, and that parties continue to participate in state-run primaries.</p>\n<p>This argument is fatally flawed in several respects.  We have never held that a political party\'s consent will cure a statute that otherwise violates the First Amendment.  Even aside from this fundamental defect, California\'s consent argument is contradicted by the simple fact that the official governing bodies of various political parties have joined this lawsuit.  In addition, the Democratic and Libertarian Parties moved to issue endorsements following the Court of Appeals\' invalidation of the endorsement ban.</p>\n<p>There are other flaws in the State\'s argument.  Simply because a legislator belongs to a political party does not make her at all times a representative of party interests.  In supporting the endorsement ban, an individual legislator may be acting on her understanding of the public good or her interest in reelection.  The independence of legislators from their parties is illustrated by the California Legislature\'s frequent refusal to amend the election laws in accordance with the wishes of political parties.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Addendum 12a-13a \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 7-9 (declaration of Bert Coffey, chair of the Democratic state central committee).  Moreover, the State\'s argument ignores those parties with negligible, if any, representation in the legislature.</p>\n<p>That the bylaws of some parties prohibit party primary endorsements also does not prove consent.  These parties may have chosen to reflect state election law in their bylaws, rather than permit or require conduct prohibited by law.  Nor does the fact that parties continue to participate in the state-run primary process indicate that they favor each regulation imposed upon that process.  A decision to participate in state-run primaries more likely reflects a party\'s determination that ballot participation is more advantageous than the alternatives, that is, supporting independent candidates or conducting write-in campaigns.  <em>See Storer v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html">415 U. S. 724</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html#745">415 U.

S. 799</a></span>, n. 26 (1983).</p>\n<p>Finally, the State\'s focus on the parties\' alleged consent ignores the independent First Amendment rights of the parties\' members.  It is wholly undemonstrated that the members authorized the parties to consent to infringements of members\' rights.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The State also claims that the ban on primary endorsements serves a compelling state interest in "<em>confining each voter to a single nominating act.\'"  <em>Tashijian v. Republican Party of Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html">479 U. S. 208</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/case.html#225">479 U.

This argument is meritless.  It fails to distinguish between a nominating act -- the vote cast at the primary election -- and speech that may influence that act.  The logic of the State\'s argument not only would support a ban on endorsements by every organization and individual, but also would justify a total ban on all discussion of a candidate\'s qualifications and political positions.  Such a blanket prohibition cannot coexist with the constitutional protection of political speech.\n</em></p>\n<p>The State\'s claim that the endorsement ban is necessary to serve any compelling state interest is called into question by its argument before the District Court and the Court of Appeals that this action is not justiciable, because the State has never enforced the challenged election laws.  826 F.2d 814, 821 (1987).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>New Jersey also bans primary endorsements by political parties.  N.J.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 19:34-52 (West 1964); <em>see</em> Weisburd, Candidate-Making and the Constitution:  Constitutional Restraints on and Protections of Party Nominating Methods, 57 S.Cal.L.Rev. 213, 271-272, n. 343 (1984).  Florida\'s statutory ban on primary endorsements by political parties was held to violate the First Amendment.  <em>See Abrams v. Reno,</em> 452 F.Supp. 1166, 1171-1172 (SD Fla.1978), <em>aff\'d,</em> 649 F.2d 342 (CA5 1981), <em>cert. denied,</em> 455 U.S. 1016 (1982).  Several States provide formal procedures for party primary endorsements. <em>See, e.g.,</em> Conn.Gen.Stat. \xc2\xa7 9-390 (1967 and Supp.1988); R.I.Gen.Laws \xc2\xa7 17-12-4 (1988); <em>see also</em> Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, The Transformation in American Politics:  Implications for Federalism 148 (1986).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>It is doubtful that the silencing of official party committees, alone among the various groups interested in the outcome of a primary election, is the key to protecting voters from confusion.  Indeed, the growing number of endorsements by political organizations using the labels "Democratic" or "Republican" has likely misled voters into believing that the official governing bodies were supporting the candidates.</p>\n<p>The State makes no showing, moreover, that voters are unduly influenced by party endorsements.  There is no evidence that an endorsement issued by an official party organization carries more weight than one issued by a newspaper or a labor union.  In States where parties are permitted to issue primary endorsements, voters may consider the parties\' views on the candidates, but still exercise independent judgment when casting their vote.  For example, in the 1982 New York Democratic gubernatorial contest, Mario Cuomo won the primary over Edward Koch, who had been endorsed by the party.  That year, gubernatorial candidates endorsed by their parties also lost the primary election to nonendorsed candidates in Massachusetts and Minnesota.  Even where the party-endorsed candidate wins the primary, one study has concluded that the party endorsement has little, if any effect, on the way voters cast their vote.  App. 97-98 \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 10, 14-17 (declaration of Malcolm E. Jewell, Professor of Political Science, University of Kentucky).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>The State suggested at oral argument that the endorsement ban prevents fraud by barring party officials from misrepresenting that they speak for the party.  To the extent that the State suggests that only the primary election results can constitute a party endorsement, Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9, it confuses an endorsement from the official governing bodies that may influence election results with the results themselves.  To the extent that the State is claiming that the appellees are not authorized to represent the official party governing bodies and their members, the State simply is reasserting its standing claim which the District Court rejected.  Civ. No. C-83-5599 (ND Cal., June 1, 1984) ("[T]he plaintiff central committees . . . have authorization and capacity to bring and maintain this litigation").

Chaney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/191/case.html">442 U. S. 191</a></span> (1979), is not to the contrary.  There we upheld a Washington statute mandating that political parties create a state central committee, to which the Democratic Party, not the State, had assigned significant responsibilities in administering the party, raising and distributing funds to candidates, conducting campaigns, and setting party policy.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/191/case.html#198">442 U.

The statute only required that the state central committee perform certain limited functions such as filling vacancies on the party ticket, nominating Presidential electors and delegates to national conventions, and calling state-wide conventions.  The party members did not claim that these <em>statutory</em> requirements imposed impermissible burdens on the party or themselves, so we had no occasion to consider whether the challenged law burdened the party\'s First Amendment rights, and, if so, whether the law served a compelling state interest.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/191/case.html#197">442 U. S. 197</a></span>, n. 12.  Here, in contrast, it is state law, not a political party\'s charter, that places the state central committees at a party\'s helm, and in particular assigns the statutorily mandated committee responsibility for conducting the party\'s campaigns.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Because we find that curbing intraparty friction is not a compelling state interest as long as the electoral process remains fair and orderly, we need not address the appellees\' contention that the challenged laws weaken, rather than strengthen, parties.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Today the Court relies on its opinion in <em>Illinois Bd. of Elections v.

In that case, JUSTICE BLACKMUN explained his acceptance of the Court\'s approach in words that precisely express my views about this case.  He wrote:</p>\n<p>"Although I join the Court\'s opinion, . . . I add these comments to record purposefully, and perhaps somewhat belatedly, my unrelieved discomfort with what </p><p><a class="page-number" name="234">Page 489 U. S. 234</a></p><p> seems to be a continuing tendency in this Court to use as tests such easy phrases as \'compelling [state] interest\' and \'least drastic [or restrictive] means.\'  <em>See, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/440/173/case.html#184">440 U.

S. 186</a></span>.  I have never been able fully to appreciate just what a \'compelling state interest\' is.  If it means \'convincingly controlling,\' or \'incapable of being overcome\' upon any balancing process, then, of course, the test merely announces an inevitable result, and the test is no test at all.  And, for me, \'least drastic means\' is a slippery slope, and also the signal of the result the Court has chosen to reach.  A judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little less \'drastic\' or a little less \'restrictive\' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legislation down.  This is reminiscent of the Court\'s indulgence, a few decades ago, in substantive due process in the economic area as a means of nullification."</p>\n<p>"I feel, therefore, and have always felt, that these phrases are really not very helpful for constitutional analysis.  They are too convenient and result-oriented, and I must endeavor to disassociate myself from them.  Apart from their use, however, the result the Court reaches here is the correct one.
