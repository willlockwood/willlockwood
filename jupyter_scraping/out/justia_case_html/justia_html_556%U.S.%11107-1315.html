MIRZAYANCE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">KNOWLES, WARDEN <em>v</em>. MIRZAYANCE</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x931315.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 13, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 24, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Mirzayance entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI) at his state-court murder trial.  During the guilt phase, he sought to avoid a conviction for first-degree murder and instead obtain a second-degree murder verdict by presenting medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and was, therefore, incapable of the necessary premeditation or deliberation.  The jury nevertheless convicted him of first-degree murder.  After the trial\xe2\x80\x99s NGI phase was scheduled, Mirzayance accepted his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to abandon the insanity plea.  Counsel believed that a defense verdict was unlikely because the jury had just rejected medical testimony similar to that which would be presented to establish the NGI defense.  Moreover, although counsel had planned to supplement the medical evidence with testimony by Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s parents as to their son\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness, the parents refused to testify at the last moment.  Following his conviction, Mirzayance alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>.  The trial court denied relief, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mirzayance then applied for federal habeas relief, which the District Court denied.   The Ninth Circuit reversed, ordering an evidentiary hearing on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to withdraw the NGI plea.  During the hearing, the Magistrate Judge made extensive factfindings, including, <em>inter alia,</em> that the NGI phase medical evidence essentially would have duplicated the evidence the jury rejected in the guilt phase; that counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on the NGI claim because the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of first-degree murder as a practical matter would cripple Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s chances of convincing the jury that he nevertheless was incapable of understanding the nature and quality of his act and of distinguishing right from wrong; that Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s parents were not simply reluctant, but had effectively refused, to testify; that counsel had made a carefully reasoned decision not to proceed with the NGI plea after weighing his options and discussing the matter with experienced co-counsel; but that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was nevertheless deficient because Mirzayance had \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to lose\xe2\x80\x9d by going forward with the NGI phase of the trial.  The Magistrate Judge also found prejudice and recommended habeas relief.  The District Court accepted the recommendation and granted the writ.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling, among other things, that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance had been deficient because Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s parents had not refused, but had merely expressed reluctance to testify, and because competent counsel would have attempted to persuade them to testify, which Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s counsel admittedly did not.  The court essentially concluded that competent counsel would have pursued the insanity defense because counsel had nothing to lose by putting on the only defense available.  In addition, the court found prejudice because, in the  court\xe2\x80\x99s view, there was a reasonable probability the jury would have found Mirzayance insane had counsel pursued the NGI phase.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that federal habeas relief was authorized under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) because the California Court of Appeal had \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Whether the state-court decision is reviewed under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s standard or <em>de novo</em>, Mirzayance has failed to establish that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was ineffective.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The State Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim did not violate clearly established federal law.  The Ninth Circuit reached a contrary result based largely on its application of an improper review standard\xe2\x80\x94it blamed counsel for abandoning the NGI claim because there was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to lose\xe2\x80\x9d by pursuing it.  But it is not \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely established by this Court.  See, <em>e.g., Wright</em> v. <em>Van Patten</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Absent anything akin to the \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to lose\xe2\x80\x9d standard in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, habeas relief could have been granted under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) only if the state-court decision in this case had unreasonably applied <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s more general standard for ineffective-assistance claims, whereby a defendant must show both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice, 466 U. S., at 687.  The question \xe2\x80\x9cis not whether a federal court believes the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Strickland </em>\xe2\x80\x9cwas incorrect but whether [it] was unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94a substantially higher threshold.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Landrigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/465/index.html">550 U. S. 465</a>, 473.  And, because <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s is a general standard, a state court has even more latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard.  Under the doubly deferential judicial review that applies to a <em>Strickland</em> claim evaluated under the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) standard, Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim fails.  It was not unreasonable for the state court to conclude that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not deficient when he counseled Mirzayance to abandon a claim that stood almost no chance of success.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Even if Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim were eligible for <em>de novo </em>review, it would still fail because he has not shown ineffective assistance at all.  Mirzayance can establish neither the deficient performance nor the prejudice required by <em>Strickland.</em>  As to performance, he has not shown \xe2\x80\x9cthat counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 687\xe2\x80\x93688.  Rather, counsel merely recommended the withdrawal of what he reasonably believed was a claim doomed because similar medical testimony had already been rejected and the parents\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, which he believed to be his strongest evidence, would not be available.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s position that competent counsel might have persuaded the reluctant parents to testify is in tension with the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s contrary findings and applies a more demanding standard than <em>Strickland </em>prescribes.  The failure to show ineffective assistance is also confirmed by the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was essentially an informed one \xe2\x80\x9cmade after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options,\xe2\x80\x9d and was therefore \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually unchallengeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at<em> </em>690.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that counsel was required to assert the only defense available, even one almost certain to lose, is not supported by any \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing professional norms\xe2\x80\x9d of which the Court is aware.  See <em>id., </em>at 688.  Nor has Mirzayance demonstrated that he suffered prejudice, which requires a showing of \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 694.  In fact, it was highly improbable that the jury, having just rejected testimony about Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition in the guilt phase, would have reached a different result based on similar evidence at the NGI phase.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  In this case, respondent Alexandre Mirzayance claimed ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney recommended withdrawing his insanity defense.  The California courts rejected this claim on state postconviction review.  We must decide whether this decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.  We hold that it was not.  Whether reviewed under the standard of review set forth in \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) or <em>de novo</em>, Mirzayance failed to establish that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was ineffective, see <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mirzayance confessed that he stabbed his 19-year-old cousin nine times with a hunting knife and then shot her four times.  At trial, he entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI).  Under California law, when both of these pleas are entered, the court must hold a bifurcated trial, with guilt determined during the first phase and the viability of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s NGI plea during the second.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71026(a) (West 1985).  During the guilt phase of Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s trial, he sought to avoid a conviction for first-degree murder by obtaining a verdict on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder.  To that end, he presented medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and was, therefore, incapable of the premeditation or deliberation necessary for a first-degree murder conviction.  The jury nevertheless convicted Mirzayance of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge set the NGI phase to begin the day after the conviction was entered but, on the advice of counsel, Mirzayance abandoned his NGI plea before it commenced.  He would have borne the burden of proving his insanity during the NGI phase to the same jury that had just convicted him of first-degree murder.  Counsel had planned to meet that burden by presenting medical testimony similar to that presented in the guilt phase, including evidence that Mirzayance was insane and incapable of premeditating or deliberating.  Because the jury rejected similar evidence at the guilt phase (where the State bore the burden of proof), counsel believed a defense verdict at the NGI phase (where the burden was on the defendant) was unlikely.  He planned, though, to have Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s parents testify and thus provide an emotional account of Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s struggles with mental illness to supplement the medical evidence of insanity.  But on the morning that the NGI phase was set to begin, Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s parents refused to testify.  After consulting with co-counsel, counsel advised Mirzayance that he should withdraw the NGI plea.  Mirzayance accepted the advice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After he was sentenced, Mirzayance challenged his conviction in state postconviction proceedings.  Among other allegations, he claimed that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland</em>.  The California trial court denied the petition and the California Court of Appeal affirmed without offering any reason for its rejection of this particular ineffective assistance claim.  <em>People </em>v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, Nos. B116856, B124764 (Mar. 31, 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 165\xe2\x80\x93167, 200\xe2\x80\x93201 (hereinafter App.).  Mirzayance then filed an application for federal habeas relief under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, which the District Court denied without an evidentiary hearing.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and ordered an evidentiary hearing on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to withdraw the NGI plea.  <em>Mirzayance </em>v. <em>Hickman</em>, 66 Fed. Appx. 676, 679\xe2\x80\x93681 (CA9 2003).  During that evidentiary hearing, a Magistrate Judge made factual findings that the District Court later adopted.  Post-Remand Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge in No. CV 00\xe2\x80\x9301388 DT (RZ) (CD Cal.), App. 38, 68; <em>Mirzayance</em> v. <em>Knowles</em>, No. CV 00\xe2\x80\x931388 DT (RZ) (CD Cal., Nov. 15, 2004), <em>id.</em>, at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Magistrate Judge, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for the two-part trial was to seek a second-degree murder verdict in the first stage and to seek an NGI verdict in the second stage.  This strategy faltered when the jury instead convicted Mirzayance of first-degree murder.  In the circumstances of this case, the medical evidence that Mirzayance planned to adduce at the NGI phase essentially would have duplicated evidence that the jury had necessarily rejected in the guilt phase.  First-degree murder in California includes any killing that is \xe2\x80\x9cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7189 (West 1999).  To prove NGI, a defendant must show that he was incapable of knowing or understanding the nature of his act or of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the offense.  See <em>People</em> v. <em>Lawley</em>, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 170, 38 P.\xc2\xa03d 461, 508 (2002).  Highlighting this potential contradiction, the trial judge instructed the jury during the guilt phase that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98deliberate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as required for a first-degree murder conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cmeans formed or arrived at or determined upon as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations for and against the proposed course of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 48\xe2\x80\x9349.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the jury found Mirzayance guilty of first-degree murder, counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on the NGI claim.  According to the Magistrate Judge: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe defense suspected that a jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Mirzayance] had \xe2\x80\x98deliberated\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98premeditated\xe2\x80\x99 his killing of [the victim] as a practical matter would cripple [Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s] chances of convincing the jury later, during the sanity phase, that [Mirzayance] nevertheless \xe2\x80\x98was incapable of knowing or understanding the nature and quality of his \xe2\x80\xa6 act and of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the commission of the offense,\xe2\x80\x99 Cal.

If weeks after the guilty verdict and the withdrawal of their son\xe2\x80\x99s NGI plea, [Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s] parents\xe2\x80\x99 emotions still prevented them from testifying at the sentencing hearing, then surely those emotional obstacles to their testifying <em>in the NGI phase</em> would have been at least as potent, and probably more so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 73 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Magistrate Judge found that counsel made a carefully reasoned decision not to go forward with the NGI plea:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Counsel] carefully weighed his options before making his decision final; he did not make it rashly\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s] strategy at the NGI phase \xe2\x80\xa6 depended entirely on the heartfelt participation of [Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s] parents as witnesses\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Moreover, [counsel] knew that, although he had experts lined up to testify, their testimony had significant weaknesses\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s] NGI-phase strategy became impossible to attempt once [Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s] parents \xe2\x80\xa6 expressed \xe2\x80\xa6 their reluctance to [testify]\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  All [counsel] was left with were four experts, all of whom reached a conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that [Mirzayance] did not premeditate and deliberate his crime\xe2\x80\x94that the same jury about to hear the NGI evidence already had rejected under a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof.

[Counsel] discussed the situation with his experienced co-counsel \xe2\x80\xa6 who concurred in [counsel\xe2\x80\x99s] proposal that he recommend to [Mirzayance] the withdrawal of the NGI plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 69\xe2\x80\x9371.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBased on these factual findings, the Magistrate Judge stated that, in his view, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not deficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite this determination, the Magistrate Judge concluded that the court was bound by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 remand order to determine only whether \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there were tactical reasons for abandoning the insanity defense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 98 (quoting <em>Hickman</em>, 66 Fed.

Even though the Magistrate Judge thought that counsel was reasonable in recommending that a very weak claim be dropped, the Magistrate Judge understood the remand order to mean that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient if withdrawing the NGI plea would achieve no tactical advantage.  The Magistrate Judge found that \xe2\x80\x9c[Mirzayance] had nothing to lose\xe2\x80\x9d by going forward with the NGI phase of the trial, App. 100, and thus held, under the remand order, that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient,  <em>ibid</em>.  As to prejudice, the Magistrate Judge concluded the court was similarly bound by the remand order because the Court of Appeals described the NGI defense as remaining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98viable and strong.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 98 (quoting <em>Hickman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 681).  Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge found prejudice and recommended granting the writ of habeas corpus.

It first stated that the lower court had misunderstood its remand order, which it described as requiring an examination of \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s reason for abandoning the insanity defense,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than as mandating that the District Court must find deficient performance if it found counsel had \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to lose\xe2\x80\x9d by pursuing the insanity defense.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> App. 98\xe2\x80\x9399.

Rather, his counsel merely recommended the withdrawal of what he reasonably believed was a claim doomed to fail.  The jury had already rejected medical testimony about Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s mental state in the guilt phase, during which the State carried its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Magistrate Judge explained this point:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll [counsel] was left with were four experts, all of whom reached a conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that [Mirzayance] did not premeditate and deliberate his crime\xe2\x80\x94that the same jury about to hear the NGI evidence already had rejected under a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof.

Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s counsel reasonably believed that there was almost no chance that the same jury would have reached a different result when considering similar evidence, especially with Mirzayance bearing the burden of proof.  Furthermore, counsel knew he would have had to present this defense without the benefit of the parents\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, which he believed to be his strongest evidence.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s] strategy at the NGI phase had been to appeal to the jury in one or both of two ways that depended entirely on the heartfelt participation of [Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s] parents as witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d).  Counsel reasonably concluded that this defense was almost certain to lose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals took the position that the situation was not quite so dire because the parents \xe2\x80\x9cmerely expressed reluctance to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 7; <em>Knowles,</em> 175 Fed. Appx., at 144.  It explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompetent counsel would have attempted to persuade them to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 7; <em>Knowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 144.  But that holding is in tension with the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings and applies a more demanding standard than <em>Strickland </em>prescribes.  The Magistrate Judge noted that the parents \xe2\x80\x9cconveyed the same sense as a refusal.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 72.  Indeed, the Magistrate Judge found that the parents \xe2\x80\x9cdid not testify later at [Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s] sentencing hearing\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been \xe2\x80\x98too emotional\xe2\x80\x99 for them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 73 (quoting testimony from evidentiary hearing).

The Court of Appeals insisted, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[r]easonably effective assistance\xe2\x80\x99 required here that counsel assert the only defense available \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 8; see also <em>Knowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 145.  But we are aware of no \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing professional norms\xe2\x80\x9d that prevent counsel from recommending that a plea be withdrawn when it is almost certain to lose.  See <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 688.  And in this case, counsel did not give up \xe2\x80\x9cthe only defense available.\xe2\x80\x9d  Counsel put on a defense to first-degree murder during the guilt phase.  Counsel also defended his client at the sentencing phase.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The law does not require counsel to raise every available nonfrivolous defense.  See <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Barnes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/745/index.html">463 U.

Mirzayance has thus failed to demonstrate that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, Mirzayance has not demonstrated that he suffered prejudice from his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance.  See <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U.

To establish prejudice, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 694.  To prevail on his ineffective-assistance claim, Mirzayance must show, therefore, that there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that he would have prevailed on his insanity defense had he pursued it.  This Mirzayance cannot do.  It was highly improbable that a jury, which had just rejected testimony about Mirzayance\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition when the State bore the burden of proof, would have reached a different result when Mirzayance presented similar evidence at the NGI phase.
