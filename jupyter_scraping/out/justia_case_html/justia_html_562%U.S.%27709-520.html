The State imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel, but exempts their main competitors\xe2\x80\x94interstate motor and water carriers.  CSX sued respondents, the Alabama Department of Revenue and its Commissioner (Alabama), claiming that this tax scheme discriminates against railroads in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4\xe2\x80\x93R Act or Act), which bars four forms of discriminatory taxation, 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711501(b).  Three of the delineated prohibitions deal with property taxes, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), and the fourth is a catch-all provision that forbids a State to \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mpose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa711501(b)(4).  The District Court dismissed CSX\xe2\x80\x99s suit as not cognizable under the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act on the basis of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Department of Revenue of Ore.</em> v. <em>ACF Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/510/332/index.html">510 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0CSX is challenging \xe2\x80\x9canother tax\xe2\x80\x9d within subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.  The Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9ctax.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, this Court looks to the word\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary definition, which is expansive.  A State seeking to raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxation on property, income, transactions, or activities.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]nother tax\xe2\x80\x9d is thus best understood to encompass any tax a State might impose, on any asset or transaction, except the property taxes already addressed in subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  There is no reason to interpret subsection (b)(4) as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes that some States imposed in lieu of property taxes at the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  Moreover, CSX\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s apparent view, does protest Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of taxes on its fuel.  The exemptions the State has given may play a central role in CSX\xe2\x80\x99s argument, but the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s essential subject remains the taxes imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be said to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d against a railroad under subsection (b)(4) where the State has granted exemptions from the tax to other entities (here, the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s competitors).  Because the statute does not define \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court again looks to the term\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning, which is to fail to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.  To charge one group of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4% rate, if the groups are the same in all relevant respects, is to discriminate against the latter.  That discrimination continues if the favored group\xe2\x80\x99s rate goes down to 0%, which is all an exemption is.  To say that such a tax does not \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d is to adopt a definition at odds with the word\xe2\x80\x99s natural meaning.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that tax schemes with exemptions may be discriminatory.  See, <em>e.g., Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Department of Treasury</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/index.html">489 U. S. 803</a>.  And even <em>Department of Revenue of Ore.</em> v. <em>ACF Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/510/332/index.html">510 U. S. 332</a>, on which the Eleventh Circuit heavily relied in dismissing CSX\xe2\x80\x99s suit, made clear that tax exemptions \xe2\x80\x9ccould be a variant of tax discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 343.  In addition, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of discrimination applies regardless whether the favored entities are interstate or local.  The distinctions drawn in the statute are not between interstate and local actors, as Alabama suggests, but between railroads and all other actors, whether interstate or local.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>ACF Industries </em>does not require a different result.  There, the Court held that railroads could not contest property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4), reasoning that it would be illogical to permit such a challenge when subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3)\xe2\x80\x94the \xc2\xa711501 provisions specifically addressing property taxes\xe2\x80\x94permitted States to grant property tax exemptions.  Such a reading would \xe2\x80\x9csubvert the statutory plan\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontravene the \xe2\x80\x98elementary canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U. S., at 340.  Contrary to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s argument, this structural analysis does not apply here.  Subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) specifically allow property tax exemptions, but neither they nor any other provision of the Act speaks to non-property exemptions like those at issue here.  Because Congress has expressed no intent to \xe2\x80\x9callo[w] the States to grant\xe2\x80\x9d non-property exemptions, <em>id., </em>at 343, reading subsection (b)(4) to encompass them poses no danger of \xe2\x80\x9cnullify[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a congressional policy choice or otherwise \xe2\x80\x9csubverting the statutory plan,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 340, 343<font b="1">.  Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s other efforts to borrow from <em>ACF Industries</em>\xe2\x80\x99 analysis similarly fail.  Also unavailing is Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, even if <em>ACF Industries\xe2\x80\x99 </em>reasoning is limited to property tax exemptions, its holding must extend to non-property tax exemptions in order to prevent inconsistent or anomalous results in the treatment of property and non-property taxes.

Section 11501(b)(4) provides that a State may not \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mpose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  CSX wishes to bring an action under this provision because rail carriers, but not motor or water carriers, must pay Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales and use taxes on diesel fuel.  To determine whether this suit may go forward, we must therefore answer two questions.  Is CSX challenging \xe2\x80\x9canother tax\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute?  And, if so, might that tax \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d against rail carriers by exempting their competitors?[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An excise tax, like Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales and use tax, is \xe2\x80\x9canother tax\xe2\x80\x9d under subsection (b)(4).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d; nor does the statute otherwise place any matters within, or exclude any matters from, the term\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.

S. 803</a> (1989), for example, we reviewed a state income tax provision that exempted retirement benefits given by the State, but not those paid by the Federal Government.  We held that the tax \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d against federal employees under 4 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7111, which serves to protect those employees from discriminatory state taxation.  Similarly, our dormant Commerce Clause cases have often held that tax exemptions given to local businesses discriminate against interstate actors.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Dias</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/263/index.html">468 U. S. 263</a>, 268\xe2\x80\x93269 (1984) (holding that a state excise tax on alcohol \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d against interstate businesses because of exemptions granted to local producers); <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.</em> v. <em>Town of Harrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/564/index.html">520 U.

And even our decision in <em>ACF Industries</em>, on which the Eleventh Circuit relied in dismissing CSX\xe2\x80\x99s suit, made clear that tax exemptions \xe2\x80\x9ccould be a variant of tax discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U.

Alabama argues for this result, claiming that \xc2\xa711501(b) is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto protect interstate carriers against discrimination <em>vis-\xc3\x80-vis </em>local businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 29.<font b="1">  But the text of \xc2\xa711501(b) tells a different story.  Consistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of restoring the financial stability of railroads (not of interstate carriers generally), <em>supra,</em> at 1, each of subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x99s provisions proscribes taxes that specially burden a <em>rail carrier\xe2\x80\x99s</em> property or otherwise discriminate against a <em>rail carrier.</em>  And not a single provision of the Act (including the references in subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) to \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property\xe2\x80\x9d) distinguishes between local and non-local taxpayers who receive favorable tax treatment.  The distinctions drawn in \xc2\xa711501(b) are not between interstate and local actors, as the State contends, but rather between railroads and other actors, whether interstate or local.  Accordingly, a state excise tax that applies to railroads but exempts their interstate competitors is subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4) as a \xe2\x80\x9ctax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As against the plain language of subsection (b)(4), Alabama offers two arguments based on our decision in <em>ACF Industries</em>.  The first claim, which the Eleventh Circuit accepted, rests on the reasoning we adopted in <em>ACF Industries:</em> We<em> </em>concluded there that railroads could not challenge property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4),\nand Alabama asserts that the same analysis applies to ex-\ncise (and other non-property) tax exemptions.  The second contention focuses on alleged problems that would emerge in the application of \xc2\xa711501(b) if the rule of <em>ACF Industries </em>did not govern all tax exemptions.  On this view, even if <em>ACF Industries</em>\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning<em> </em>is irrelevant to cases involving excise taxes, its holding must extend to those cases to prevent inconsistent or anomalous results.

But we reasoned that the structure of \xc2\xa711501 required the opposite result.  510 U. S., at 343.

We think they misread that<em> </em>decision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We began our analysis in <em>ACF Industries </em>by explaining that railroads could not challenge property tax exemptions under subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3)\xe2\x80\x94the provisions of \xc2\xa711501 specifically addressing property taxes.  As noted earlier, subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) prohibit a State from imposing higher property tax rates or assessment ratios on \xe2\x80\x9crail transportation property\xe2\x80\x9d than on \xe2\x80\x9cother commercial and industrial property.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute defines \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property\xe2\x80\x9d as including only \xe2\x80\x9cproperty \xe2\x80\xa6 subject to a property tax levy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa711501(a)(4).

We viewed this holding as a matter of simple deduction: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be illogical to conclude that Congress, having allowed the States to grant property tax exemptions in subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), would turn around and nullify its own choice in subsection (b)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Or stated otherwise: \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eading subsection (b)(4) to prohibit what\xe2\x80\x9d other parts of the statute were \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to allow,\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9csubvert the statutory plan\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontravene the \xe2\x80\x98elementary canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 340.<font b="1">  The structure of \xc2\xa711501 thus compelled our conclusion that property tax exemptions\xe2\x80\x94even if \xe2\x80\x9ca variant of tax discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 343\xe2\x80\x94fell outside subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this structural analysis\xe2\x80\x94the core of <em>ACF Industries</em>\xe2\x80\x94has no bearing on the question here.

Brief for Respondents 41.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That claim rings hollow.  To be sure, <em>ACF Industries </em>noted that Congress had declined to speak \xe2\x80\x9cwith any degree of particularity to\xe2\x80\x9d the permissibility of property tax exemptions, even though States often granted them.  510 U. S., at 343.<font b="1">  But we thought that fact relevant only because Congress <em>had </em>spoken with particularity in proscribing other forms of discriminatory property taxes.  The very sentence Alabama highlights makes our reasoning clear: Congress\xe2\x80\x99s silence as to the practice of granting property tax exemptions reflected its acquiescence in that practice \xe2\x80\x9c<em>in light of</em> the explicit prohibition [in subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3)] of [property] tax rate and assessment ratio discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 344 (emphasis added).<font b="1">  If that explicit prohibition had not existed\xe2\x80\x94if \xc2\xa711501(b) had consisted only of subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s broad ban on tax\ndiscrimination\xe2\x80\x94we could not have gleaned what we did from congressional silence.  After all, the very purpose of a catch-all provision like subsection (b)(4) is to avoid the necessity of listing each matter (here, each kind of tax discrimination) falling within it.  And with respect to <em>non-</em>property taxes (like Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales and use taxes), subsection (b)(4) is all there is.  So here again, our analysis in <em>ACF Industries </em>does not apply because it rested on subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3)\xe2\x80\x94that is, on the highly reticulated scheme in the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act relating solely to property taxes.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alabama also emphasizes our statement in <em>ACF Industries </em>that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]rinciples of federalism\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d supported our holding, Brief for Respondents 41\xe2\x80\x9343 (quoting 510 U. S., at 345), but this final effort to borrow from that decision\xe2\x80\x99s analysis similarly fails.  We indeed recognized in <em>ACF Industries</em> that the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act limits the traditional taxing power of the States.  Because that is so, we expressed \xe2\x80\x9chesitan[ce] to extend the statute beyond its evident scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U. S., at 345.  But here, for all the reasons already noted, we are not \xe2\x80\x9cextend[ing] the statute\xe2\x80\x9d; we are merely giving effect to its clear meaning.  To reiterate: The 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act distinguishes between property taxes and other taxes.  Congress expressed its intent to insulate property tax exemptions from challenge; against that background, <em>ACF Industries </em>stated that permitting such suits would intrude on the States\xe2\x80\x99 rightful authority.  By contrast, Congress drafted \xc2\xa711501 to enable railroads to contest all other tax exemptions; and when Congress speaks in such preemptive terms, its decision must govern.  Principles of federalism cannot narrow \xc2\xa711501\xe2\x80\x99s clear scope.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>CSX Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Georgia State Bd. of Equalization</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/9/index.html">552 U. S. 9</a>, 20 (2007) (rejecting the idea that federalism principles preclude challenges to state valuation methodologies when \xc2\xa711501 \xe2\x80\x9cclearly authorized\xe2\x80\x9d such actions).  Nothing in <em>ACF Industries</em> suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alabama additionally makes a subtler argument involving <em>ACF Industries</em>.  Given that decision, Alabama contends, a ruling in CSX\xe2\x80\x99s favor here would create troubling inconsistencies.  Alabama claims that subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s singular prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d would then mean one thing for property taxes (according to <em>ACF Industries</em>) and another for non-property taxes, even though nothing in the statute supports \xe2\x80\x9cmorphing definitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 32.  And still worse than the difference in meaning would be the difference in result:\nA ruling for CSX, Alabama argues, would give railroads more protection against non-property taxes than against property taxes, even though no good reason exists for this distinction.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s one-word-two-meanings argument collapses because it again rests on a misunderstanding of <em>ACF Industries</em>.  That decision did not define \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d or say that a tax exemption could not fall within that term.  Quite to the contrary: As noted earlier, <em>ACF Industries </em>frankly acknowledged that tax exemptions, including property tax exemptions, \xe2\x80\x9ccould be a variant of tax discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U. S., at 343; <em>supra,</em> at 9.  We held that property tax exemptions were immune from challenge under subsection (b)(4) for structural, rather than linguistic, reasons.  Even assuming these exemptions \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[d],\xe2\x80\x9d they did so in a way that the specific provisions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) allow, and accordingly \xc2\xa711501(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition could not include them.  That reasoning, once more, does not apply here, because subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) do not permit\xe2\x80\x94indeed, in no way address\xe2\x80\x94non-property tax exemptions.  We therefore do not adopt a new definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d in this case; in the context of the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act, that word has, and has always had, just one meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What remains is Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s complaint that a ruling in CSX\xe2\x80\x99s favor, when combined with our decision in <em>ACF Industries, </em>will result in divergent treatment of property and non-property taxes.  At times, Alabama dresses up this objection in Latin: It contends that the canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, which \xe2\x80\x9climits general terms [that] follow specific ones to matters similar to those specified,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gooch</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/124/index.html">297 U. S. 124</a>, 128 (1936), has a role to play in interpreting \xc2\xa711501(b).  More particularly, Alabama contends that this canon<em> </em>supports reading into \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) every limitation contained in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), including the exclusion of tax exemptions from the class of state actions subject to challenge.  See Brief for Respondents 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  That interpretive move, Alabama rightly notes, would ensure equal treatment of property tax and non-property tax exemptions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we think <em>ejusdem generis </em>is not relevant here.  As an initial matter, subsection (b)(4), \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough something of a catchall, . . . is <em>not </em>a general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable (<em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x98fishing rods, nets, hooks, bobbers, sinkers, and other equipment\xe2\x80\x99).\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/593/index.html">515 U. S. 593</a>, 615 (1995) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Rather, that subsection is \xe2\x80\x9cone of . . . several distinct and independent prohibitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Related to this structural point is a functional one.  We typically use <em>ejusdem generis </em>to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/105/index.html">532 U. S. 105</a>, 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (2001); see 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa747:17 (7th ed. 2007).  But that concern is absent here.  Reading subsection (b)(4) to cover non-property tax exemptions will not deprive subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) of effect, because those subsections are addressed only to property taxes.  A canon meaning literally \xe2\x80\x9cof the same kind\xe2\x80\x9d has no application to provisions directed toward dissimilar subject matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The better version of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s claim reads entirely in English; it is simply that distinguishing between property tax exemptions and other tax exemptions makes not a whit of sense.  We are not much inclined to disagree.  Neither CSX nor the United States as <em>amicus curiae </em>has offered a satisfying reason for why Congress drew this line\xe2\x80\x94why in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) it barred challenges based on property tax exemptions, but then turned around in \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) to allow challenges based on, say, excise tax exemptions.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x935, 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  CSX, for example, has not presented any evidence that different tax exemptions posed different levels of threat to railroads\xe2\x80\x99 financial stability.  So even if Congress had a good reason for distinguishing between property and non-property tax exemptions, we acknowledge that it eludes us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this admission does not take us far in Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s direction.  Even if the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act were ambiguous, we doubt we would interpret subsection (b)(4) to replicate each facet of subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  Treating property tax exemptions and other tax exemptions equivalently might make sense, as Alabama argues.  But so too might allowing railroads to challenge all taxes (property or non-property) that contain exemptions.  After all, as we noted earlier, tax exemptions are an obvious form of tax discrimination.  See<em> supra,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  It is hardly self-evident why Congress would prohibit a State from charging a railroad a 4% tax and a competitor a 2% tax, but allow the State to charge the railroad a 4% tax and the competitor nothing. The latter situation would frustrate the purposes of the Act even more than the former.  In <em>ACF Industries</em>, we accepted that anomaly because the terms and structure of the Act demanded that we do so.  But we could say no more in favor of the result than that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot so bizarre that Congress could not have intended it.\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U. S., at 347 (internal quotation marks omitted).<font b="1">  That was not a glowing recommendation, and we see no reason today to view the matter differently.  Accordingly, even assuming that statutory ambiguity permitted us to do so, we would hesitate to extend the distinction between tax exemptions and differential tax rates in order to avoid a distinction between property and non-property taxes.  That would seem a poor trade of statutory anomalies.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, and more importantly, the choice is not ours to make.  Congress wrote the statute it wrote, and that statute draws a sharp line between property taxes and other taxes.  Congress drafted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) to exclude tax exemptions from the sphere of prohibited property tax discrimination.  But it drafted \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) more broadly, without any of the prior subsections\xe2\x80\x99 limitations, to proscribe other \xe2\x80\x9ctax[es] that discriminat[e],\xe2\x80\x9d including through the use of exemptions.  That congressional election settles this case.  Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s preference for symmetry cannot trump an asymmetrical statute.  And its preference for the greatest possible latitude to levy taxes cannot trump Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to restrict discriminatory taxation of rail carriers.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in this case is limited.  We hold that CSX may challenge Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales and use taxes as \xe2\x80\x9ctax[es] that discriminat[e] against \xe2\x80\xa6 rail carrier[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa711501(b)(4).  We do not address whether CSX should prevail in that challenge\xe2\x80\x94whether, that is, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s taxes in fact discriminate against railroads by exempting interstate motor and water carriers.  Alabama argues, in support of barring CSX\xe2\x80\x99s challenge at the outset, that this inquiry into discrimination may pose difficulties.  Brief for Respondents 35\xe2\x80\x9337.  We cannot deny that assertion, but neither can we respond to it by precluding CSX\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Discrimination cases sometimes do raise knotty questions about whether and when dissimilar treatment is adequately justified.  In the context of the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act, those hard calls can arise when States charge different tax rates to different entities in a practice the statute specifically subjects to challenge.  See \xc2\xa711501(b)(3).  So too, difficult issues can emerge when, as here, States provide certain entities with tax exemptions.  In either case, Congress has directed the federal courts to review a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s challenge; and in either case, we would flout the congressional command were we to declare the matter beyond us.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This provision was originally codified at 49 U.

We do not consider any issues concerning whether these exemptions actually discriminate against CSX.  See <em>infra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, and n.\xc2\xa08.  Alabama has raised two such issues in this Court.  First, Alabama contends that in deciding CSX\xe2\x80\x99s claim, a federal court must consider not only the specific taxes challenged, but also the broader tax scheme.  Brief for Respondents 58\xe2\x80\x9360.  Second, the State argues that the court must compare the taxation of CSX not merely to direct competitors\nbut to other commercial entities as well.  <em>Id.</em>, at 48, n.\xc2\xa07.  Most of the dissenting opinion is devoted to supporting the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument on this second question.  But we leave these and all other issues relating to whether Alabama actually has discriminated against CSX to the trial court on remand to address as and when it wishes.  No court in this case has previously considered these questions, and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs in this Court have only sketchily addressed them.  In addition, the parties dispute whether Alabama waived its claim on the second issue by initially agreeing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe comparison class consists of motor carriers and water carriers,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a (internal quotation marks omitted),<font b="1"> and proceeding with the litigation on that basis.  We think this question of waiver is also best considered by the trial court.</font></p><font b="1">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As originally enacted, the provision that is now 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) prohibited the imposition of \xe2\x80\x9cany other tax\xe2\x80\x9d that discriminates against a railroad.  \xc2\xa726c (1976 ed.).  The substitution of \xe2\x80\x9canother tax\xe2\x80\x9d occurred when Congress first recodified the Act.  In line with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s statement that revisions made at that time should not be construed as having substantive effect, see n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>, we treat the two terms as synonymous.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Alabama also invokes the remedial provision of subsection (c), n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>, to urge that we read \xc2\xa711501 as effectively limited to property or \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu\xe2\x80\x9d taxes.  According to Alabama, that provision entitles federal courts to grant relief only when States overvalue railroad property under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2): Federal courts, the State avers, \xe2\x80\x9chave no power to enjoin the granting of tax exemptions as a violation of subsection (b)(4), or, apparently [to remedy] <em>any </em>violation of sub-\nsection (b)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 37.  But that interpretation of subsection (c)\xe2\x80\x99s remedial provision cannot be right, because it would nullify subsection (b)(4) (and, for that matter, subsection (b)(3) as well).  We understand subsection (c)\xe2\x80\x99s remedial provision neither as limiting the broad grant of jurisdiction to federal courts to prevent violations of subsection (b) nor as otherwise restricting the scope of that subsection.  The remedial provision simply limits the availability of relief when a State discriminates in assessing the value of railroad property, as proscribed by subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2).  That kind of discrimination is not at issue here.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This conclusion does not, as Alabama and the dissent contend, turn railroads into \xe2\x80\x9cmost-favored-taxpayers,\xe2\x80\x9d entitled to any exemption (or other tax break) that a State gives to another entity.  See Brief for Respondents 23; <em>post</em>, at 9 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  We hold only that \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) enables a railroad to challenge an excise or other non-property tax as discriminatory on the basis of the tax scheme\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions\xe2\x80\x94as the dissent apparently agrees, <em>post</em>, at 1.  Whether the railroad will prevail\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether it can prove the alleged discrimination\xe2\x80\x94depends on whether the State offers a sufficient justification for declining to provide the exemption at issue to rail carriers.  See <em>supra,</em> at 8; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25\xe2\x80\x9326; <em>Richmond, F. &amp; P. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Department of Taxation, Commonwealth of Va.</em>, 762 F.\xc2\xa02d 375, 380\xe2\x80\x93381, and n. 4 (CA4 1985).  So if, to use the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s example, a railroad challenged a scheme in which \xe2\x80\x9cevery person and business in the State of Alabama paid a $1 annual tax, and <em>one person</em> was exempt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 9, for some reason having nothing to do with railroads, we presume the suit would be promptly dismissed.  Nothing in this application of \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) offers a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d to railroads.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent argues in addition that a State should prevail against any claim of discrimination brought under subsection (b)(4) if it can demonstrate that a tax does not \xe2\x80\x9ctarget\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csingle out\xe2\x80\x9d a railroad, <em>post</em>, at 1; that showing, without more, would justify the tax (although the dissent declines to say just what it means to \xe2\x80\x9ctarget,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa03).  This argument primarily concerns the question whether Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s tax scheme in fact discriminates under subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x94a question we have explained is inappropriate to address, see n.\xc2\xa05, <em>supra</em>.  We note, however, that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument about subsection (b)(4) rests  entirely on the premise that subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) prohibit only property taxes that \xe2\x80\x9ctarget\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csingle out\xe2\x80\x9d railroads, see <em>post</em>, at 4; so, the dissent would say, a State may impose a 4% property tax on railroads (assuming some unspecified number of other taxpayers also pay that rate) while levying only a 2% property tax on railroad competitors.  But we have never decided, in <em>ACF Industries</em> or any other case, whether subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) should be interpreted in this manner.  And even accepting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s unexplained premise, a serious question would remain about whether to transplant this construction of subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) to subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s very different terrain, see <em>infra,</em> at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.               </p>\n</font></casctfnt><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963436">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.

Although parts of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s discussion appear to question this standard, see <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311, the limited holding does not foreclose it.

We did precisely that in <em>Department of Revenue of Ore.</em> v. <em>ACF Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/332/index.html">510 U. S. 332</a> (1994), where we similarly faced a question about the meaning of subsection (b)(4).  In that case, our structural analysis of \xc2\xa711501(b) was \xe2\x80\x9ccentral to the interpretation of subsection (b)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 340. </p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The structure of \xc2\xa711501(b) is straightforward.  Subsections (b)(1) through (3) instruct that States may not assess railroad property at \xe2\x80\x9ca higher ratio to the true market value \xe2\x80\xa6 than \xe2\x80\xa6 other commercial and industrial property,\xe2\x80\x9d 49 U.

Subsection (b)(4) then forbids \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would look to subsections (b)(1) through (3) to determine the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d in (b)(4).  As many lower courts have correctly recognized, subsection (b)(4) \nis a residual clause, naturally appurtenant to subsections (b)(1) through (3).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Moreover, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9canother tax that discriminates\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(4) suggests that the previous subsections all describe taxes that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner similar to that forbidden by subsection (b)(4).  See <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em> v. <em>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 384 (2003) (reading the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother legal process\xe2\x80\x9d restrictively because \xe2\x80\x9cwhere general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsections (b)(1) through (3) each prohibit particular types of state taxes that target or single out railroad property for less favorable tax treatment than other commercial and industrial property.  First, the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d addressed in subsections (b)(1) through (3) can only be described as taxes that target or single out railroad property.  Those subsections specifically concern taxes that affect railroad property differently from the way they affect a larger class of comparative taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 property.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3); cf. <em>ante</em>, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ach of subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x99s provisions proscribes taxes that specially burden a rail carrier\xe2\x80\x99s property or otherwise discriminate against a rail carrier\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).  Second, each subsection refers to the same comparison class\xe2\x80\x94other \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think it follows that, under subsection (b)(4), a tax \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates against a rail carrier\xe2\x80\x9d if it similarly targets railroads for tax treatment less favorable than other commercial and industrial taxpayers.  As we found in <em>ACF Industries</em>, the structure of the statute provides a light by which to navigate the meaning of subsection (b)(4).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The background of \xc2\xa711501(b) also supports this understanding of subsection (b)(4).  In previous cases, we have identified the problem that made subsection (b) necessary.  At the time the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (4\xe2\x80\x93R Act) was enacted, it was clear that \xe2\x80\x9crailroads \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9care easy prey for State and local tax assessors\xe2\x80\x9d in that they are \xe2\x80\x9cnonvoting, often nonresident, targets for local taxation,\xe2\x80\x9d who cannot easily remove themselves from the locality.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ACF Industries</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 336 (quoting <em>Western Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Equalization of S.\xc2\xa0D.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/123/index.html">480 U.

The obvious rationale supporting subsections (b)(1) through (3) is that the \xe2\x80\x9cway to prevent tax discrimination against the railroads is to tie their tax fate to the fate of a large and local group of taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kansas City Southern R.

In this way, subsections (b)(1) through (3) establish a political check on the taxation of rail-\nroads.

Relying on the second definition in Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, the majority defines \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  This definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate,\xe2\x80\x9d combined with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctions drawn in \xc2\xa711501(b) are \xe2\x80\xa6 between railroads and other actors, whether interstate or local,\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that the comparison class could be <em>anyone</em>.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Ante,</em> at 10.  The majority ultimately implies that \xe2\x80\x9canother tax that discriminates against a rail carrier\xe2\x80\x9d is any tax that draws a distinction between a rail carrier and anyone else without sufficient justification.  See <em>ante, </em>at 10, n.\xc2\xa08 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether the railroad will prevail \xe2\x80\xa6 depends on whether the State offers a sufficient justification for declining to provide the exemption at issue to rail carriers\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not read subsection (b)(4) so independently of (b)(1) through (3).  Perhaps, as the majority asserts, subsection (b)(4) is not an ideal candidate for <em>ejusdem generis</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But given the ambiguity of subsection (b)(4), (b)(1) through (3) are the best guides for understanding its proper scope\xe2\x80\x94something we recognized in <em>ACF Industries</em>.  510 U. S., at 343.  It is more reasonable to discern the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(4) using the preceding subsections than to pluck from the dictionary a definition for such a context-dependent term.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Detaching subsection (b)(4) from the rest of the section would expand its meaning well beyond the scope of the problem that necessitated \xc2\xa711501(b).  Instead of simply eliminating the particular vulnerability of railroads by tying their tax fate to that of general commercial and industrial taxpayers, railroads would receive a surprising windfall: most-favored taxpayer status.  This would convert subsection (b)(4) from a shield into a sword. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The implication of the majority opinion is that if every person and business in the State of Alabama paid a $1 annual tax, and <em>one person</em> was exempt, CSX could sue under subsection (b)(4) and require the State to either exempt CSX also or \xe2\x80\x9coffe[r] a sufficient justification\xe2\x80\x9d for the distinction.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa08.  Although the majority denies that this would provide railroads most-favored-taxpayer status, see <em>ibid.</em>, it acknowledges that States would have to justify any tax distinction that railroads argue may disfavor them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only bulwark against requiring States to give railroads every<em> </em>tax exemption that anyone else gets would be open-ended judicial determinations of what is \xe2\x80\x9csufficient justification\xe2\x80\x9d for such distinctions.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Unsurprisingly, the statute provides no guidance for what \xe2\x80\x9csufficient justification\xe2\x80\x9d might mean, but neither does the majority.   There are all sorts of reasons that might lead a State to distinguish between railroads and others for tax purposes.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58.  For instance, in this case, Alabama points out that motor carriers and interstate water carriers pay a separate\xe2\x80\x94and frequently higher\xe2\x80\x94tax on fuel from which railroads<em> </em>are effectively exempt.  Brief for Respondents 12\xe2\x80\x9316, 59\xe2\x80\x9360.  That might be a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient justification\xe2\x80\x9d for their exemptions from the taxes here, but the majority expressly disclaims reaching that question.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa05.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Of course, logically extending the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d from subsections (b)(1) through (3) would avoid this problem, as there is no need for \xe2\x80\x9cjustification\xe2\x80\x9d at all: A tax either targets railroads by comparison to commercial and industrial taxpayers or it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree with the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(4) that the majority seems to imply.  The rest of \xc2\xa711501(b) provides a logical and coherent way to determine what subsection (b)(4) means, and we have used that methodology before.  See <em>ACF Industries</em>, 510 U. S., at 340.  The best way to read subsection (b)(4) is as prohibiting taxes that target or single out railroads as compared to general commercial and industrial taxpayers.  That is the test I would establish, and I do not understand the majority to foreclose the lower courts from utilizing it.
