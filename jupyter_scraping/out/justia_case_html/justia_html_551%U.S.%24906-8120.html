Upon verifying that Brendlin was a parole violator, the officers formally arrested him and searched him, the driver, and the car, finding, among other things, methamphetamine paraphernalia.  Charged with possession and manufacture of that substance, Brendlin moved to suppress the evidence obtained in searching his person and the car, arguing that the officers lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop, which was an unconstitutional seizure of his person.  The trial court denied the motion, but the California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that Brendlin was seized by the traffic stop, which was unlawful.  Reversing, the State Supreme Court held that suppression was unwarranted because a passenger is not seized as a constitutional matter absent additional circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable person that he was the subject of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s investigation or show of authority.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>When police make a traffic stop, a passenger in the car, like the driver, is seized for Fourth Amendment purposes and so may challenge the stop\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A person is seized and thus entitled to challenge the government\xe2\x80\x99s action when officers, by physical force or a show of authority, terminate or restrain the person\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.  <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Bostick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/429/index.html">501 U. S. 429</a>, 434; <em>Brower</em> v. <em>County of Inyo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/593/index.html">489 U. S. 593</a>, 597.  There is no seizure without that person\xe2\x80\x99s actual submission.  See, <em>e.g., California</em> v. <em>Hodari D.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/621/index.html">499 U. S. 621</a>, 626, n. 2.  When police actions do not show an unambiguous intent to restrain or when an individual\xe2\x80\x99s submission takes the form of passive acquiescence, the test for telling when a seizure occurs is whether, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave.  <em>E.g., United States</em> v. <em>Mendenhall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/544/index.html">446 U. S. 544</a>, 554 (principal opinion).  But when a person \xe2\x80\x9chas no desire to leave\xe2\x80\x9d for reasons unrelated to the police presence, the \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive effect of the encounter\xe2\x80\x9d can be measured better by asking whether \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers\xe2\x80\x99 requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bostick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 435\xe2\x80\x93436.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Brendlin was seized because no reasonable person in his position when the car was stopped would have believed himself free to \xe2\x80\x9cterminate the encounter\xe2\x80\x9d between the police and himself.  <em>Bostick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 436.  Any reasonable passenger would have understood the officers to be exercising control to the point that no one in the car was free to depart without police permission.  A traffic stop necessarily curtails a passenger\xe2\x80\x99s travel just as much as it halts the driver, diverting both from the stream of traffic to the side of the road, and the police activity that normally amounts to intrusion on \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy and personal security\xe2\x80\x9d does not normally (and did not here) distinguish between passenger and driver.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/index.html">428 U. S. 543</a>, 554.  An officer who orders a particular car to pull over acts with an implicit claim of right based on fault of some sort, and a sensible person would not expect the officer to allow people to come and go freely from the physical focal point of an investigation into faulty behavior or wrongdoing.  If the likely wrongdoing is not the driving, the passenger will reasonably feel subject to suspicion owing to close association; but even when the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be subject to some scrutiny, and his attempt to leave would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place.  It is also reasonable for passengers to expect that an officer at the scene of a crime, arrest, or investigation will not let people move around in ways that could jeopardize his safety.  See, <em>e.g., Maryland</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/408/index.html">519 U. S. 408</a>, 414\xe2\x80\x93415.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion comports with the views of all nine Federal Courts of Appeals, and nearly every state court, to have ruled on the question.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion reflects three premises with which this Court respectfully disagrees.  First, the view that the police only intended to investigate the car\xe2\x80\x99s driver and did not direct a show of authority toward Brendlin impermissibly shifts the issue from the intent of the police as objectively manifested to the motive of the police for taking the intentional action to stop the car.  Applying the objective <em>Mendenhall </em>test resolves any ambiguity by showing that a reasonable passenger would understand that he was subject to the police display of authority.  Second, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that Brendlin, as the passenger, had no ability to submit to the police show of authority because only the driver was in control of the moving car is unavailing.  Brendlin had no effective way to signal submission while the car was moving, but once it came to a stop he could, and apparently did, submit by staying inside.  Third, there is no basis for the state court\xe2\x80\x99s fear that adopting the rule this Court applies would encompass even those motorists whose movement has been impeded due to the traffic stop of another car.  An occupant of a car who knows he is stuck in traffic because another car has been pulled over by police would not perceive the show of authority as directed at him or his car.

The question in this case is whether the same is true of a passenger.  We hold that a passenger is seized as well and so may challenge the constitutionality of the stop.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Early in the morning of November 27, 2001, Deputy Sheriff Robert Brokenbrough and his partner saw a parked Buick with expired registration tags.  In his ensuing conversation with the police dispatcher, Brokenbrough learned that an application for renewal of registration was being processed.  The officers saw the car again on the road, and this time Brokenbrough noticed its display of a temporary operating permit with the number \xe2\x80\x9c11,\xe2\x80\x9d indicating it was legal to drive the car through November.  App. 115.  The officers decided to pull the Buick over to verify that the permit matched the vehicle, even though, as Brokenbrough admitted later, there was nothing unusual about the permit or the way it was affixed.  Brokenbrough asked the driver, Karen Simeroth, for her license and saw a passenger in the front seat, petitioner Bruce Brendlin, whom he recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the Brendlin brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 65.  He recalled that either Scott or Bruce Brendlin had dropped out of parole supervision and asked Brendlin to identify himself.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Brokenbrough returned to his cruiser, called for backup, and verified that Brendlin was a parole violator with an outstanding no-bail warrant for his arrest.  While he was in the patrol car, Brokenbrough saw Brendlin briefly open and then close the passenger door of the Buick.  Once reinforcements arrived, Brokenbrough went to the passenger side of the Buick, ordered him out of the car at gunpoint, and declared him under arrest.  When the police searched Brendlin incident to arrest, they found an orange syringe cap on his person.  A patdown search of Simeroth revealed syringes and a plastic bag of a green leafy substance, and she was also formally arrested.  Officers then searched the car and found tubing, a scale, and other things used to produce methamphetamine.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brendlin was charged with possession and manufacture of methamphetamine, and he moved to suppress the evidence obtained in the searches of his person and the car as fruits of an unconstitutional seizure, arguing that the officers lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop.  He did not assert that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the search of Simeroth\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle, cf. <em>Rakas</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/index.html">439 U. S. 128</a> (1978), but claimed only that the traffic stop was an unlawful seizure of his person.  The trial court denied the suppression motion after finding that the stop was lawful and Brendlin was not seized until Brokenbrough ordered him out of the car and formally arrested him.  Brendlin pleaded guilty, subject to appeal on the suppression issue, and was sentenced to four years in prison.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Court of Appeal reversed the denial of the suppression motion, holding that Brendlin was seized by the traffic stop, which they held unlawful.  8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 882 (2004) (officially depublished).  By a narrow majority, the Supreme Court of California reversed.  The State Supreme Court noted California\xe2\x80\x99s concession that the officers had no reasonable basis to suspect unlawful operation of the car, 38 Cal. 4th 1107, 1114, 136 P.\xc2\xa03d 845, 848 (2006),[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] but still held suppression unwarranted because a passenger \xe2\x80\x9cis not seized as a constitutional matter in the absence of additional circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable person that he or she was the subject of the peace officer\xe2\x80\x99s investigation or show of authority,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 1111, 136 P. 3d, at 846.  The court reasoned that Brendlin was not seized by the traffic stop because Simeroth was its exclusive target, <em>id</em>., at 1118, 136 P. 3d, at 851, that a passenger cannot submit to an officer\xe2\x80\x99s show of authority while the driver controls the car, <em>id</em>., at 1118\xe2\x80\x931119, 135 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 851\xe2\x80\x93852, and that once a car has been pulled off the road, a passenger \xe2\x80\x9cwould feel free to depart or otherwise to conduct his or her affairs as though the police were not present,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 1119, 136 P. 3d, at 852.  In dissent, Justice Corrigan said that a traffic stop entails the seizure of a passenger even when the driver is the sole target of police investigation because a passenger is detained for the purpose of ensuring an officer\xe2\x80\x99s safety and would not feel free to leave the car without the officer\xe2\x80\x99s permission.  <em>Id</em>., at 1125, 136 P. 3d, at 856.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to decide whether a traffic stop subjects a passenger, as well as the driver, to Fourth Amendment seizure, 549 U.

A police officer may make a seizure by a show of authority and without the use of physical force, but there is no seizure without actual submission; otherwise, there is at most an attempted seizure, so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned.  See <em>California</em> v. <em>Hodari D.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/621/index.html">499 U. S. 621</a>, 626, n.\xe2\x80\x822 (1991); <em>Lewis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 844, 845, n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the actions of the police do not show an unambiguous intent to restrain or when an individual\xe2\x80\x99s submission to a show of governmental authority takes the form of passive acquiescence, there needs to be some test for telling when a seizure occurs in response to authority, and when it does not.  The test was devised by Justice Stewart in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mendenhall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/544/index.html">446 U. S. 544</a> (1980), who wrote that a seizure occurs if \xe2\x80\x9cin view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 554 (principal opinion).  Later on, the Court adopted Justice Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s touchstone, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Hodari D</em>., <em>supra</em>, at 627; <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Chesternut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/567/index.html">486 U.

S. 194</a>, 202 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law is settled that in Fourth Amendment terms a traffic stop entails a seizure of the driver \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Prouse</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/index.html"></a><a href="/us/440/648/index.html">440 U.

And although we have not, until today, squarely answered the question whether a passenger is also seized, we have said over and over in dicta that during a traffic stop an officer seizes everyone in the vehicle, not just the driver.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Prouse</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 653 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]topping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a \xe2\x80\x98seizure\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of [the Fourth and Fourteenth] Amendments\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Colorado</em> v. <em>Bannister</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/1/index.html">449 U.

We spoke of the arresting officer\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Prouse was in the back seat when the car was pulled over, see 440 U. S., at 650, n.\xc2\xa01, described Prouse as an occupant, not as the driver, and referred to the car\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coccupants\xe2\x80\x9d as being seized, <em>id</em>., at 653.  Justification for stopping a car was the issue again in <em>Whren</em> v. <em>United States</em>, where we passed upon a Fourth Amendment challenge by two petitioners who moved to suppress drug evidence found during the course of a traffic stop.  See 517 U. S., at 809.  Both driver and passenger claimed to have been seized illegally when the police stopped the car; we agreed and held suppression unwarranted only because the stop rested on probable cause.  <em>Id</em>., at 809\xe2\x80\x93810, 819.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State concedes that the police had no adequate justification to pull the car over, see n.\xe2\x80\x822, <em>supra</em>, but argues that the passenger was not seized and thus cannot claim that the evidence was tainted by an unconstitutional stop.  We resolve this question by asking whether a reasonable person in Brendlin\xe2\x80\x99s position when the car stopped would have believed himself free to \xe2\x80\x9cterminate the encounter\xe2\x80\x9d between the police and himself.  <em>Bostick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 436.

An officer who orders one particular car to pull over acts with an implicit claim of right based on fault of some sort, and a sensible person would not expect a police officer to allow people to come and go freely from the physical focal point of an investigation into faulty behavior or wrongdoing.  If the likely wrongdoing is not the driving, the passenger will reasonably feel subject to suspicion owing to close association; but even when the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be subject to some scrutiny, and his attempt to leave the scene would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place.  Cf. <em>Drayton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 197\xe2\x80\x93199, 203\xe2\x80\x93204 (finding no seizure when police officers boarded a stationary bus and asked passengers for permission to search for drugs).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also reasonable for passengers to expect that a police officer at the scene of a crime, arrest, or investigation will not let people move around in ways that could jeopardize his safety.  In <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/408/index.html">519 U.

In fashioning this rule, we invoked our earlier statement that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 414 (quoting <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Summers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/692/index.html">452 U.

And the treatise writers share this prevailing judicial view that a passenger may bring a Fourth Amendment challenge to the legality of a traffic stop.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 6 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa711.3(e), pp. 194, 195, and n. 277 (4th ed. 2004 and Supp. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf either the stopping of the car, the length of the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s detention thereafter, or the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s removal from it are unreasonable in a Fourth Amendment sense, then surely the passenger has standing to object to those constitutional violations and to have suppressed any evidence found in the car which is their fruit\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)); 1 W. Ringel, Searches &amp; Seizures, Arrests and Confessions \xc2\xa711:20, p.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9398 (2d ed. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x99s stop of an automobile results in a seizure of both the driver and the passenger\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The contrary conclusion drawn by the Supreme Court of California, that seizure came only with formal arrest, reflects three premises as to which we respectfully disagree.  First, the State Supreme Court reasoned that Brendlin was not seized by the stop because Deputy Sheriff Brokenbrough only intended to investigate Simeroth and did not direct a show of authority toward Brendlin.  The court saw Brokenbrough\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cflashing lights [as] directed at the driver,\xe2\x80\x9d and pointed to the lack of record evidence that Brokenbrough \xe2\x80\x9cwas even aware [Brendlin] was in the car prior to the vehicle stop.\xe2\x80\x9d  38 Cal. 4th, at 1118, 136 P. 3d, at 851.  But that view of the facts ignores the objective <em>Mendenhall</em> test of what a reasonable passenger would understand.  To the extent that there is anything ambiguous in the show of force (was it fairly seen as directed only at the driver or at the car and its occupants?), the test resolves the ambiguity, and here it leads to the intuitive conclusion that all the occupants were subject to like control by the successful display of authority.  The State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, on the contrary, shifts the issue from the intent of the police as objectively manifested to the motive of the police for taking the intentional action to stop the car, and we have repeatedly rejected attempts to introduce this kind of subjectivity into Fourth Amendment analysis.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Whren</em>, 517 U. S., at 813 (\xe2\x80\x9cSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Chesternut</em>, 486 U. S., at 575, n.\xc2\xa07 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he subjective intent of the officers is relevant to an assessment of the Fourth Amendment implications of police conduct only to the extent that that intent has been conveyed to the person confronted\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Mendenhall</em>, 446 U. S., at 554, n.\xc2\xa06 (principal opinion) (disregarding a Government agent\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent to detain Mendenhall); cf. <em>Rakas</em>, 439 U. S., at 132\xe2\x80\x93135 (rejecting the \xe2\x80\x9ctarget theory\xe2\x80\x9d of Fourth Amendment standing, which would have allowed \xe2\x80\x9cany criminal defendant at whom a search was directed\xe2\x80\x9d to challenge the legality of the search (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California defends the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on this point by citing our cases holding that seizure requires a purposeful, deliberate act of detention.  See Brief for Respondent 9\xe2\x80\x9314.  But <em>Chesternut</em>, <em>supra</em>, answers that argument.  The intent that counts under the Fourth Amendment is the \xe2\x80\x9cintent [that] has been conveyed to the person confronted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 575, n.\xc2\xa07, and the criterion of willful restriction on freedom of movement is no invitation to look to subjective intent when determining who is seized.  Our most recent cases are in accord on this point.  In <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/833/index.html">523 U. S. 833</a>, we considered whether a seizure occurred when an officer accidentally ran over a passenger who had fallen off a motorcycle during a high-speed chase, and in holding that no seizure took place, we stressed that the officer stopped Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s movement by accidentally crashing into him, not \xe2\x80\x9cthrough means intentionally applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 844 (emphasis deleted).  We did not even consider, let alone emphasize, the possibility that the officer had meant to detain the driver only and not the passenger.  Nor is <em>Brower</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/593/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/593/index.html">489 U. S. 593</a>, to the contrary, where it was dispositive that \xe2\x80\x9cBrower was meant to be stopped by the physical obstacle of the roadblock\xe2\x80\x94and that he was so stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id</em>., at 599.  California reads this language to suggest that for a specific occupant of the car to be seized he must be the motivating target of an officer\xe2\x80\x99s show of authority, see Brief for Respondent 12, as if the thrust of our observation were that Brower, and not someone else, was \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to be stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d  But our point was not that Brower alone was the target but that officers detained him \xe2\x80\x9cthrough means intentionally applied\xe2\x80\x9d; if the car had had another occupant, it would have made sense to hold that he too had been seized when the car collided with the roadblock.  Neither case, then, is at odds with our holding that the issue is whether a reasonable passenger would have perceived that the show of authority was at least partly directed at him, and that he was thus not free to ignore the police presence and go about his business.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Supreme Court of California assumed that Brendlin, \xe2\x80\x9cas the passenger, had no ability to submit to the deputy\xe2\x80\x99s show of authority\xe2\x80\x9d because only the driver was in control of the moving vehicle.  38 Cal. 4th, at 1118, 1119, 136 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 852.  But what may amount to submission depends on what a person was doing before the show of authority: a fleeing man is not seized until he is physically overpowered, but one sitting in a chair may submit to authority by not getting up to run away.  Here, Brendlin had no effective way to signal submission while the car was still moving on the roadway, but once it came to a stop he could, and apparently did, submit by staying inside.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the State Supreme Court shied away from the rule we apply today for fear that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould encompass even those motorists following the vehicle subject to the traffic stop who, by virtue of the original detention, are forced to slow down and perhaps even come to a halt in order to accommodate that vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s submission to police authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1120, 136 P. 3d, at 853.  But an occupant of a car who knows that he is stuck in traffic because another car has been pulled over (like the motorist who can\xe2\x80\x99t even make out why the road is suddenly clogged) would not perceive a show of authority as directed at him or his car.  Such incidental restrictions on freedom of movement would not tend to affect an individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csense of security and privacy in traveling in an automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Prouse</em>, 440 U. S., at 662.  Nor would the consequential blockage call for a precautionary rule to avoid the kind of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and oppressive interference by [law] enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals\xe2\x80\x9d that the Fourth Amendment was intended to limit.  <em>Martinez-Fuerte</em>, 428 U. S., at 554.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the consequence to worry about would not flow from our conclusion, but from the rule that almost all courts have rejected.  Holding that the passenger in a private car is not (without more) seized in a traffic stop would invite police officers to stop cars with passengers regardless of probable cause or reasonable suspicion of anything illegal.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The fact that evidence uncovered as a result of an arbitrary traffic stop would still be admissible against any passengers would be a powerful incentive to run the kind of \xe2\x80\x9croving patrols\xe2\x80\x9d that would still violate the driver\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment right.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/index.html">413 U. S. 266</a>, 273 (1973) (stop and search by Border Patrol agents without a warrant or probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment); <em>Prouse</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 663 (police spot check of driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and registration without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brendlin was seized from the moment Simeroth\xe2\x80\x99s car came to a halt on the side of the road, and it was error to deny his suppression motion on the ground that seizure occurred only at the formal arrest.
