Commissioner, \n\n302 U.\xc2\xa0S. 573\n\xe2\x80\x93579 (1938), provides the relevant legal standard.  First, a tax\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant character,\xe2\x80\x9d or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is controlling.  See id., at 579.  Thus, a foreign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess profits tax for most taxpayers is generally creditable.  Second, foreign tax creditability depends not on the way a foreign government characterizes its tax but on whether the tax, if enacted in the U.\xc2\xa0S., would be an income, war profits, or excess profits tax.  See \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)(ii).  Giving further form to these principles, \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax\xe2\x80\x99s predominant character is that of a U.\xc2\xa0S. income tax \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Three tests set forth in the regulations provide guidance in making this assessment, see \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(b)(1).  The tests indicate that net gain consists of realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attributable to such gross receipts, in combination known as net income.  A foreign tax that reaches net income, or profits, is creditable.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The U.\xc2\xa0K. windfall tax\xe2\x80\x99s predominant character is that of an excess profits tax, a category of income tax in the U.\xc2\xa0S. sense.  The Labour government\xe2\x80\x99s conception of \xe2\x80\x9cprofit-making value\xe2\x80\x9d as a backward-looking analysis of historic profits is not a typical valuation method.  Rather, it is a tax on realized net income disguised as a tax on the difference between two values, one of which is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed price-to-earnings ratio.  The substance of the windfall tax confirms this conclusion.  When rearranged, the U.\xc2\xa0K\xe2\x80\x99s formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference between the profits each company actually earned and the amount the Labour government believed it should have earned given its flotation value.  For most of the relevant companies, the U.\xc2\xa0K. formula\xe2\x80\x99s substantive effect was to impose a 51.71 percent tax on all profits above a threshold, a classic excess profits tax.  The Commissioner claims that any algebraic rearrangement is improper because U.\xc2\xa0S. courts must take the foreign tax rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports to adopt.  But such a rigid construction cannot be squared with the black-letter principle that \xe2\x80\x9ctax law deals in economic realities, not legal abstractions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n\n350 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n.  Given the artificiality of the U.\xc2\xa0K.\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method, this Court follows substance over form and recognizes that the windfall tax is nothing more than a tax on actual profits above a threshold.

This case addresses whether that tax is creditable for U.\xc2\xa0S. tax purposes.  Internal Revenue Code \xc2\xa7901(b)(1) states that any \xe2\x80\x9cincome, war profits, and excess profits taxes\xe2\x80\x9d paid overseas are creditable against U.\xc2\xa0S. income taxes.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7901(b)(1).

These companies were sold to private parties through an initial sale of shares, known as a \xe2\x80\x9cflotation.\xe2\x80\x9d  As part of privatization, many com-panies were required to continue providing services at the same rates they had offered under government control for a fixed period, typically their first four years of private operation.  As a result, the companies could only increase profits during this period by operating more efficiently.  Responding to market incentives, many of the companies became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial profits in the process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe U.\xc2\xa0K.\xe2\x80\x99s Labour Party, which had unsuccessfully opposed privatization, used the companies\xe2\x80\x99 profitability as a campaign issue against the Conservative Party.  In part because of campaign promises to tax what it characterized as undue profits, the Labour Party defeated the Conservative Party at the polls in 1997.  Prior to coming to power, Labour Party leaders hired accounting firm Arthur Andersen to structure a tax that would capture excess, or \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall,\xe2\x80\x9d profits earned during the initial years in which the companies were prohibited from increasing rates.  Par-liament eventually adopted the tax, which applied only to the regulated companies that were prohibited from raising their rates.  See Finance (No. 2) Act, 1997, ch. 58, pt. I, cls.\xc2\xa01 and 2(5) (Eng.) (U.\xc2\xa0K. Windfall Tax Act).  It imposed a 23 percent tax on any \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d earned by such companies.  Id., cl.\xc2\xa01(2).

For 27 of the 32 companies subject to the tax, the number of days in the initial period was 1,461 days (or four years).  Of the remaining five companies, one had no tax liability because it did not earn any windfall profits.  Three had initial periods close to four years (1,463, 1,456, and 1,380 days).  The last was privatized shortly before the Labour Party took power and had an initial period of only 316 days.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe number 9 in the formula was characterized as a price-to-earnings ratio and was selected because it represented the lowest average price-to-earnings ratio of the 32 companies subject to the tax during the relevant period.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See id., sched. 1, \xc2\xa71, cl. 2(3); Brief for Respondent 7.  The statute expressly set its value, and that value was the same for all companies.  U.\xc2\xa0K. Windfall Tax Act, sched. 1, \xc2\xa71, cl. 2(3).  The only variables that changed in the windfall tax formula for all the companies were profits (P) and flotation value (FV); the initial period (D) varied for only a few of the companies subject to the tax.  The Labour government asserted that the term [365 \xc3\x97 (P \xe2\x88\x95 D) \xc3\x97 9] represented what the flotation value should have been given the assumed price-to-earnings ratio of 9.  Thus, it claimed (and the Commissioner here reiterates) that the tax was simply a 23 percent tax on the difference between what the companies\xe2\x80\x99 flotation values should have been and what they actually were.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner PPL Corporation (PPL) was an owner, through a number of subsidiaries, of 25 percent of South Western Electricity plc, 1 of 12 government-owned elec-tric companies that were privatized in 1990 and that were subject to the tax.

In its 1997 federal income-tax return, PPL claimed a credit under \xc2\xa7901 for its share of the bill.

First, the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant character\xe2\x80\x9d of a tax, or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is controlling.  See id., at 579 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are here concerned only with the \xe2\x80\x98standard\xe2\x80\x99 or normal tax\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under this principle, a for-eign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess profits tax in most instances is creditable, even if it may affect a handful of taxpayers differently.  Creditability is an all or nothing proposition.  As the Treasury Regulations confirm, \xe2\x80\x9ca tax either is or is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the way a foreign government characterizes its tax is not dispositive with respect to the U.\xc2\xa0S. creditability analysis.  See \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)(ii) (foreign tax creditable if predominantly \xe2\x80\x9can income tax in the U.\xc2\xa0S. sense\xe2\x80\x9d).  In Biddle, the Court considered the creditability of certain U.\xc2\xa0K. taxes on stock dividends under the substantively identical predecessor to \xc2\xa7901.  The Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing in [the statute\xe2\x80\x99s] language to suggest that in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments, a shifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign characterizations and classifications of tax legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  302 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 578\xe2\x80\x93579.  See also United States v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., \n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132, \n145 (1989)\n (noting in interpreting \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902 that Biddle is particularly applicable \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a contrary interpretation would leave\xe2\x80\x9d tax interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cto the varying tax policies of foreign tax authorities\xe2\x80\x9d); Heiner v.

Instead of the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the tax, the crucial inquiry is the tax\xe2\x80\x99s economic effect.  See Biddle, supra, at 579 (inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [a tax] is the substantial equivalent of payment of the tax as those terms are used in our own statute\xe2\x80\x9d).

Indeed, annual profit is a variable in the tax formula.  U.\xc2\xa0K. Windfall Tax Act, sched. 1, \xc2\xa71, cls. 2(2) and 5.  It is also undisputed that there is no meaningful difference for our purposes in the accounting principles by which the U. K. and the U.\xc2\xa0S. calculate profits.  See Brief for Petitioners 47.  The dis-agreement instead centers on how to characterize the tax formula the Labour Party adopted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Third Circuit, following the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s lead, believed it could look no further than the tax formula that the Parliament enacted and the way in which the Labour government characterized it.  Under that view, the windfall tax must be considered a tax on the difference between a company\xe2\x80\x99s flotation value (the total amount investors paid for the company when the government sold it) and an imputed \xe2\x80\x9cprofit-making value,\xe2\x80\x9d defined as a company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caverage annual profit during its \xe2\x80\x98initial period\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. times 9, the assumed price-to-earnings ratio.\xe2\x80\x9d  665 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 65.  So characterized, the tax captures a portion of the difference between the price at which each company was sold and the price at which the Labour government believed each company should have been sold given the actual profits earned during the initial period.  Relying on this characterization, the Third Circuit believed the windfall tax failed at least the Treasury Regulation\xe2\x80\x99s realization and gross receipts tests because it reached some artificial form of valuation instead of profits.  See id., at 67, and n.\xc2\xa03.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn contrast, PPL\xe2\x80\x99s position is that the substance of the windfall tax is that of an income tax in the U.\xc2\xa0S. sense.  While recognizing that the tax ostensibly is based on the difference between two values, it argues that every \xe2\x80\x9cvari-able\xe2\x80\x9d in the windfall tax formula except for profits and flotation value is fixed (at least with regard to 27 of the 32 companies).  PPL emphasizes that the only way the Labour government was able to calculate the imputed \xe2\x80\x9cprofit-making value\xe2\x80\x9d at which it claimed companies should have been privatized was by looking after the fact at the actual profits earned by each company.  In PPL\xe2\x80\x99s view, it matters not how the U.\xc2\xa0K. chose to arrange the formula or what it claimed to be taxing, because a tax based on profits above some threshold is an excess profits tax, regardless of how it is mathematically arranged or what labels foreign law places on it.  PPL, thus, contends that the windfall taxes it paid meet the Treasury Regulation\xe2\x80\x99s tests and are credit-able under \xc2\xa7901.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe agree with PPL and conclude that the predominant character of the windfall tax is that of an excess profits tax, a category of income tax in the U.\xc2\xa0S. sense.  It is important to note that the Labour government\xe2\x80\x99s conception of \xe2\x80\x9cprofit-making value\xe2\x80\x9d as a backward-looking analysis of historic profits is not a recognized valuation method; instead, it is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed price-to-earnings ratio.  At trial, one of PPL\xe2\x80\x99s expert witnesses explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x989 is not an accurate P/E multiple, and it is not applied to current or expected future earnings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  135 T.\xc2\xa0C., at 326, n.\xc2\xa017 (quoting testimony).  Instead, the windfall tax is a tax on realized net income disguised as a tax on the difference between two values, one of which is completely fictitious.  See App. 251, Report \xc2\xb61.7 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he value in profit making terms described in the wording of the act . . . is not a real value: it is rather a construct based on realised profits that would not have been known at the date of privatisation\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe substance of the windfall tax confirms the accuracy of this observation.  As already noted, the parties stipulated that the windfall tax could be calculated as follows:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThis formula can be rearranged algebraically to the following formula, which is mathematically and substantively identical:\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe next step is to substitute the actual number of days for D.  For 27 of the 32 companies subject to the windfall tax, the number of days was identical, 1,461 (or four years).  Inserting that amount for D in the formula yields the following:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tSimplifying the formula by multiplying and dividing numbers reduces the formula to:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tAs noted, FV represents the value at which each company was privatized.  FV is then divided by 9, the arbitrary \xe2\x80\x9cprice-to-earnings ratio\xe2\x80\x9d applied to every company.  The economic effect is to convert flotation value into the profits a company should have earned given the assumed price-to-earnings ratio.  See 135 T.\xc2\xa0C., at 327 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98In effect, the way the tax works is to say that the amount of profits you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed in any year before you\xe2\x80\x99re subject to tax is equal to one-ninth of the flotation price.  After that, profits are deemed excess, and there is a tax\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting testimony from the treasurer of South Western Electricity plc)).  The annual profits are then multiplied by 4.0027, giving the total \xe2\x80\x9cacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d profits (as opposed to windfall profit) that each company\xe2\x80\x99s flotation value entitled it to earn during the initial period given the artificial price-to-earnings ratio of 9.  This fictitious amount is finally subtracted from actual profits, yielding the excess profits, which were taxed at an effective rate of 51.71 percent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe rearranged tax formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference between the profits each company actually earned and the amount the Labour government believed it should have earned given its flotation value.  For the 27 companies that had 1,461-day initial periods, the U.\xc2\xa0K. tax formula\xe2\x80\x99s substantive effect was to impose a 51.71 percent tax on all profits earned above a threshold.  That is a classic excess profits tax.  See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1917, ch. 159, Tit. II, \xc2\xa7201, \n\n39Stat.\n1000 (8 percent tax imposed on excess profits exceeding the sum of $5,000 plus 8 percent of invested capital).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, other algebraic reformulations of the windfall tax equation are possible.  See 665 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 66; Brief for Anne Alstott et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 21\xe2\x80\x9323 (Alstott Brief).  The point of the reformulation is not that it yields a particular percentage (51.75 percent for most of the companies).  Rather, the algebraic reformulations illustrate the economic substance of the tax and its interrelationship with net income.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commissioner argues that any algebraic rearrangement is improper, asserting that U.\xc2\xa0S. courts must take the foreign tax rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports to adopt.  Brief for Respondent 28.  As a result, the Commissioner claims that the analysis begins and ends with the Labour government\xe2\x80\x99s choice to characterize its tax base as the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cprofit-making value\xe2\x80\x9d and flotation value.  Such a rigid construction is unwarranted.  It cannot be squared with the black-letter principle that \xe2\x80\x9ctax law deals in economic realities, not legal abstractions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Commissioner v.

First, the Commissioner attempts to buttress the argument that the windfall tax is a tax on value by noting that some U.\xc2\xa0S. gift and estate taxes use actual, past profits to estimate value.  Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing 26 CFR \xc2\xa720.2031\xe2\x80\x933 (2012) and \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72032A).  This argument misses the point.  In the case of valuation for gift and estate taxes, past income may be used to estimate future income streams.  But, it is future revenue-earning potential, reduced to market value, that is subject to taxation.  The windfall profits tax, by contrast, undisputedly taxed past, realized net income alone.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commissioner contends that the U.\xc2\xa0K. was not trying to establish valuation as of the 1997 date on which the windfall tax was enacted but instead was attempting to derive a proper flotation valuation as of each company\xe2\x80\x99s flotation date.  Brief for Respondent 21.  The Commissioner asserts that there was no need to estimate future in- come (as in the case of the gift or estate recipient) because actual revenue numbers for the privatized companies were available.  Ibid.  That argument also misses the mark.  It is true, of course, that the companies might have been privatized at higher flotation values had the government recognized how efficient\xe2\x80\x94and thus how profitable\xe2\x80\x94the companies would become.  But, the windfall tax requires an underlying concept of value (based on actual ex post earnings) that would be alien to any valuer.  Taxing ac-tual, realized net income in hindsight is not the same as considering past income for purposes of estimating future earning potential.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Example 3 to the Treasury Regulation\xe2\x80\x99s gross receipts test is also misplaced.  Id., at 37\xe2\x80\x9338; 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(b)(3)(ii), Ex. 3.  That example posits a petroleum tax in which \xe2\x80\x9cgross receipts from extraction income are deemed to equal 105 percent of the fair market value of petroleum extracted.  This computation is designed to produce an amount that is greater than the fair market value of actual gross receipts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Under the example, a tax based on inflated gross receipts is not creditable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Third Circuit believed that the same type of algebraic rearrangement used above could also be used to rearrange a tax imposed on Example 3.  It hypothesized:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cSay that the tax rate on the hypothetical extraction tax is 20%.  It is true that a 20% tax on 105% of receipts is mathematically equivalent to a 21% tax on 100% of receipts, the latter of which would satisfy the gross receipts requirement.  PPL proposes that we make the same move here, increasing the tax rate from 23% to 51.75% so that there is no multiple of receipts in the tax base.  But if the regulation allowed us to do that, the example would be a nullity.  Any tax on a multiple of receipts or profits could satisfy the gross receipts requirement, because we could reduce the starting point of its tax base to 100% of gross receipts by imagining a higher tax rate.\xe2\x80\x9d  665 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 67.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe Commissioner reiterates the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s argument.

As the Fifth Circuit correctly recognized, there is a difference between imputed and actual receipts.  \xe2\x80\x9cExample 3 hypothesizes a tax on the extraction of petroleum where the income value of the petroleum is deemed to be .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. deliberately greater than actual gross receipts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Entergy Corp., 683 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 238.  In contrast, the windfall tax depends on actual figures.  Ibid.  (\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no need to calculate imputed gross receipts; gross receipts were actually known\xe2\x80\x9d).  Example 3 simply addresses a different foreign taxation issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe argument also incorrectly equates imputed gross receipts under Example 3 with net income.  See 665 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 67 (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny tax on a multiple of receipts or profits\xe2\x80\x9d).  As noted, a tax is creditable only if it applies to realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attributable to such gross receipts.  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(b)(4)(i).  A tax based solely on gross receipts (like the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis) would be noncreditable because it would fail the Treasury Regulation\xe2\x80\x99s net income requirement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, even if expenses were subtracted from imputed gross receipts before a tax was imposed, the effect of inflating only gross receipts would be to inflate revenue while holding expenses (the other component of net income) constant.

See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But there is a different way of looking at this case.  If the predominant character inquiry is expanded to include the five companies that had dif- ferent initial periods, especially those with much shorter initial periods, it becomes impossible to rewrite the windfall tax as an excess profits tax.  Instead, it becomes clear that the windfall tax is functionally a tax on value.  But because the Government took the position at oral argument that the predominant character inquiry should disregard such \xe2\x80\x9coutlie[r]\xe2\x80\x9d companies, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\xe2\x80\x9339, and this argument is therefore only pressed by amici, Brief for Anne Alstott et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 28\xe2\x80\x9330 (hereinafter Alstott Brief), I reserve consideration of this argument for another day and another context and join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Internal Revenue Code provides that \xe2\x80\x9cincome, war profits, and excess profits taxes\xe2\x80\x9d paid to a foreign country are creditable.  \n\n26 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7901(b)(1).  Whether a foreign tax falls within one of these categories depends on whether its \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant character .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is that of an income tax in the U.\xc2\xa0S. sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)(ii) (2010).  As the Court explains, there are three components to this in- quiry, ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x937, but at its core the inquiry simply asks whether a foreign tax resembles a typical income, war profits, or excess profits tax, ante, at 6.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tImportantly, though, the relevant Treasury Regulations also provide that a foreign tax \xe2\x80\x9cis or is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  One way to understand this language is that for a tax to be classed as a creditable income tax, its predominant character must be that of an income tax with respect to \xe2\x80\x9call persons subject to the tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  Of course, among the many persons subject to a tax, some may face tax burdens different from the majority of affected taxpayers.  The challenge in applying predominant character analysis will sometimes lie in determining whether and how such outlier taxpayers affect the characterization of a given tax.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe windfall tax at issue here exemplifies this problem.  As the Court notes, ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, the parties stipulated to the following form of the windfall tax:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tIf the predominant character analysis is restricted to those 27 companies that share an identical initial period length, then it makes sense to fix D at 1,461, as the Court does.  Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  And from there, it is just a matter of basic algebra, ante, at 9, and n.\xc2\xa04, to show that these companies\xe2\x80\x99 tax liability is equal to total profits minus a threshold amount (in this case, 44.47% of each company\xe2\x80\x99s flotation value) multiplied by a percentage-form tax rate: Tax=51.71%\xc3\x97P-44.47%\xc3\x97FV.  See ante, at 9; Brief for Petitioners 10.  Because an excess profits tax is generally a tax levied on the profits of a business beyond a particular threshold, see Wells, Legislative History of Excess Profits Taxation in the United States in World Wars I and II, 4 Nat. Tax J. 237, 243 (1951), it appears to follow that the windfall tax can properly be characterized as an excess profits tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut not all of the 32 affected companies had an initial period length of 1,461 days; 5 of the companies had dif- ferent initial periods.  See App. 34, 39\xe2\x80\x9341.  When these different initial period values are inserted into the formulation proposed by PPL, two results follow.  First, these companies have tax rates different from the 51.71% rate the Court calculates for the 27 other companies.  Second, their excess profits threshold also varies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, consider Railtrack Group, a clear outlier with an initial period of 316 days.  Inserting this value into the stipulated formula yields the following:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tApplying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s algebra, this formula can be reduced to the following:  Railtrack Group\xe2\x80\x99s Tax=239.10%\xc3\x97[P-(9.62%\xc3\x97FV)].  Railtrack Group\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d tax rate and its excess profits threshold (239.10% and 9.62% respec- tively) are very different from those companies with the common initial period length of 1,461 days (51.71% and 44.47%).  See ante, at 10.  Railtrack Group is not alone in this respect: four other companies also had tax rates and excess profits thresholds that differed from the majority of affected companies.  See App. 34, 38\xe2\x80\x9340.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce these outlier companies are included in the creditability analysis, it becomes clear that the windfall tax \xe2\x80\x9cis not an income tax .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for all persons\xe2\x80\x9d subject to it.  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) (emphasis added).  A typical income tax applies a fixed percentage rate to a base income that varies across taxpayers.  An excess profits tax does the same, but incorporates a threshold, which may or may not vary across taxpayers, to exempt a portion of the base from taxation.  In contrast, here both of the rate and threshold components vary from company to company according to the D variable.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeen through this lens, the windfall tax is really a tax on average profits.  See Alstott Brief 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  Under the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulated form of the windfall tax, each company pays a fixed tax rate of 23% on a base that is calculated by first multiplying a company\xe2\x80\x99s daily average profits during its initial period (i.e., P/D , or total profits over the initial period divided by the length of the initial period) by a fixed price-to-earnings ratio; and then subtracting that com- pany\xe2\x80\x99s flotation value FV.  See ante, at 2.  In practice, this means that, for example, a company that earns $100 million over 1,461 days would pay approximately the same amount of taxes as a company that has earned $25 million over 365 days.  These two companies would have almost the same average profits.  See Alstott Brief 28.  This is not how an income tax works.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe difference between a tax on profits and tax on average profits is especially significant for properly characterizing a tax such as the windfall tax.  Average daily profits multiplied by a price-to-earnings ratio, rather than being a way of approximating income, is a way of approximating value.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See Thompson, A Lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Modern Valuation Techniques in Mergers and Acquisitions, 21 J. Corp. L. 457, 532\xe2\x80\x93533 (1996) (describing similar valuation techniques using price-to-earnings ratios).  Accordingly, incorporating an outlier like Railtrack Group into the predominant character analysis suggests that the windfall tax is a tax on a company\xe2\x80\x99s value.  Railtrack Group and the companies like it are not random outliers, Brief for Petitioners 38, n.\xc2\xa03, but instead are critical pieces of data for understanding how the tax actually functioned as a matter of \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic realit[y].\xe2\x80\x9d  Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n\n350 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308, \n315 (1956)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument, however, rests on the premise that because the relevant regulations state that \xe2\x80\x9ca tax either is or is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax,\xe2\x80\x9d 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)(ii), a tax\xe2\x80\x99s predominant character must be as an income tax for all taxpayers.  But if a tax only needs to be an income tax for \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial number of taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d and does not have to \xe2\x80\x9csatisfy the predominant character test in its application to all taxpayers,\xe2\x80\x9d Exxon Corp. v. Commissioner, 113 T.\xc2\xa0C. 338, 352 (1999), then this average profits argument cannot get off the ground.  Under this reading, the regulations tell courts to treat outliers like Railtrack Group as flukes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt oral argument, the Government apparently rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x9coutliers\xe2\x80\x9d like Railtrack Group are relevant to creditability analysis.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\xe2\x80\x9339.  The Government also did not argue these outliers\xe2\x80\x99 relevance before the Court of Appeals, ante, at 14, n.\xc2\xa06, and so this argument, and the regulatory interpretation it depends upon, has only been presented to this Court by amici, see Alstott Brief 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  We are not barred from considering statutory and regulatory interpretations raised in an amicus brief, but we should be \xe2\x80\x9creluctant to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis v. United States, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n, n. (1994), when the issue is one of first impression and the Federal Government has staked out what appears to be a contrary position.  Thus, while I find this argument persuasive, I do not base my analysis of this case on it and therefore concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0For example, some taxes may produce outliers that might suggest that the tax is not an income tax, when in fact the tax is attemptingto reach net gain and therefore has the predominant character of an income tax.  This situation often arises when a tax relies on imperfect estimates and assumptions in attempting to calculate net gain.  Such a tax strives to treat similarly situated taxpayers the same but fails to do so only because the estimated component inadvertently affects some taxpayers differently.  A situation of this kind occurred in Texasgulf, Inc. v. Commissioner, 172 F.\xc2\xa03d 209 (CA2 1999).  In that case, a Canadian mining tax did not permit taxpayers to deduct their specific expenses, but did permit them to deduct a fixed \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing allowance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 211\xe2\x80\x93213.  The taxpayer argued that the tax was creditable because the processing allowance was an attempt to reach net income, gross income minus expenses, by using \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a method that is likely to produce an amount that approximates, or is greater than, recovery of such significant costs and expenditures.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 215 (quoting 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.901\xe2\x80\x932(b)(4)(i)(B) (1999)).  To support its argument, the taxpayer introduced empirical evidence that roughly 85% of companies facing mining tax liability had nonrecoverable expenses less than the processing allowance.  Texasgulf, Inc., 172 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 215\xe2\x80\x93216.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the taxpayer that the tax was a creditable income tax because it was clear that the mining tax was attempting to reach net income, albeit by using an estimate to calculate deductions.  Id.,at 216\xe2\x80\x93217.  This result is sensible: A company that happens to have deductible expenses greater than the fixed amount set by the processing allowance is not an instructive outlier regarding the mining taxes predominant character.  The mining tax is attempting to reach that company\xe2\x80\x99s net income, but fails to do only because it relies on an approximate value for deductions.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The figures for the other four companies are as follows: Powergen plc, which had an initial period of 1,463 days had a tax rate of 51.64% and an excess profits threshold of 44.54%, App. 38\xe2\x80\x9339; National Power plc, which had an initial period of 1,456 days, had a rate of 51.89% and a threshold of 44.32%, id., at 39\xe2\x80\x9340; Northern Ireland Electricity plc, which had an initial period of 1,380 days, had a rate of 54.75% and a threshold of 42.01%, id., at 40; and British Energy plc, which had an initial period of 260 days, had a rate of 290.60% and a threshold of 7.91%, id., at 34.
