The contract was to continue for one year, when, if the money with interest thereon was not paid, it was to continue in force until payment should be made.  After B. had advanced the money and entered upon the performance of the contract, A. conveyed all its property, including its franchisee, to C. in trust to secure the payment of certain bonds issued by it.  Default having been made in their payment, C. brought a foreclosure suit and obtained a decree placing the road in the hands of a receiver and ordering its sale.

Caldwell and Henry Clews, as joint tenants, and to the survivor of each -- the former of whom has since deceased -- all its real and personal property, including its franchises, in trust, to secure a large number of its bonds then about to be issued; that $1,400,000 of said bonds were sold or hypothecated, and came into the hands of persons unknown to the complainant, but for much less than their value and not by a <em>bona fide</em> sale; that notwithstanding, the alleged creditors of the company instituted foreclosure proceedings in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of North Carolina, and in 1873 obtained a decree ordering the sale of all the property of said company; that the defendant, Smith, having in that suit been appointed receiver of the company, forbade the complainant, in July, 1873, from further using the cars of the company unless upon conditions whereby said contract was virtually surrendered or ignored; that thereupon the complainant was compelled to abandon said railroad, although the money so loaned, with a portion of the interest thereon, is still due and unpaid.

JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The bill avers that it was filed against the receiver appointed by the court below, that he was in possession of the railroad, and that the institution of the suit was by the consent of the court.  Without this latter fact, the bill could not have been filed or maintained.  The suit would have been a contempt of the court which had appointed the receiver, and punishable as such.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/203/case.html">Davis v.

The contract of a corporation is presumed to be <em>infra vires,</em> until the contrary is made to appear.  2 Waite, Actions and Defenses 334.</p>\n<p>The charter is set out in the record, and forms a part of it.  That leaves no room for doubt upon the subject.</p>\n<p>Adequate capacity on the part of the railroad company to make the contract is to be presumed in like manner.</p>\n<p>No party defendant was necessary but the receiver.  He was in the possession of the property and effects of the railroad company, subject to the order of the court, and could have specifically performed the contract, or paid back the money loaned if the court had so directed.  The presence of the other parties was immaterial, and the bill might well have been dismissed as to them.  <em>Davis v. Gray, supra; Doggett v. Railroad Company, supra,</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/72/case.html">99 U. S. </a></span> 72.</p>\n<p>The contract between the express company and the railroad company was that the latter should give to the former the necessary facilities for the transaction of all its business upon the road, forward without delay by the passenger trains both ways all the express matter that should be offered, do all in its power to promote the convenience of the express company, both at the way and terminal stations, and carry free of charge the messengers in charge of the express matter, and the officers and agents of the express company passing over the road on express business.  The consideration for these stipulations was a loan by the express company to the railroad company of $20,000, to be expended in repairs and equipments for the road, the loan to bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum, and the payment of fifty cents per hundred pounds for all express matter carried over the road, to be applied in discharge of the loan and interest.  The contract was to continue for one year from the first day of January, 1866, and until the principal and interest of the debt should be fully paid.  The bill avers that the receiver had refused to carry out the contract, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 99 U. S. 200</a></p><p> and that the principal of x20,000 and a part of the interest were unpaid.</p>\n<p>The enforcement of contracts not relating to realty by a decree for specific performance is not an unusual exercise of equity jurisdiction.  Such cases are numerous in both English and American jurisprudence.  They proceed upon the ground that under the circumstances a judgment at law would not meet the demands of justice, that it would be less beneficial than relief in equity, that the damages would not be an accurate satisfaction, that their extent could not be exactly shown, or that the pursuit of the legal remedy would be attended otherwise with doubt and difficulty.</p>\n<p>Judge Story, after an elaborate examination of the subject, thus lays down the general rule:</p>\n<p>"The just conclusion in all such cases would seem to be that courts of equity ought not to decline the jurisdiction for a specific performance of contracts whenever the remedy at law is doubtful in its nature, extent, operation, or adequacy."</p>\n<p>2 Story, Eq.Jur., sec. 728.  <em>See also Stuyvesant v. The Mayor,</em> 11 Paige (N.Y.), 414; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/151/case.html">Barr v. Lapsley,</a></span></em> 1 Wheat. 151; <em>Storer v. Great Western Railway Co.,</em> 2 You. &amp; Coll. 48; <em>Wilson v. Furness Railroad Co.,</em> Law Rep. 9 Eq. 28.</p>\n<p>But we need not pursue the subject further, because there is one provision of the contract in this case which is fatal to the relief sought.  A court of equity never interferes where the power of revocation exists.  Frye, Specif.Perform. 64.</p>\n<p>The contract stipulates that after the first year it shall cease upon the payment of the $20,000 and interest.  This might be made immediately upon the rendition of the decree.  The action of the court would thus become a nullity.</p>\n<p>There is another objection to the appellant\'s case which is no less conclusive.</p>\n<p>The road is in the hands of the receiver appointed in a suit brought by the bondholders to foreclose their mortgage.  The appellant has no lien.  The contract neither expressly nor by implication touches that subject.  It is not a license as insisted by counsel.  It is simply a contract for the transportation of persons and property over the road.  A specific performance by the receiver would be a form of satisfaction or payment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 99 U. S. 201</a></p><p> which he cannot be required to make.  As well might he be decreed to satisfy the appellant\'s demand by money, as by the service sought to be enforced.  Both belong to the lienholders, and neither can thus be diverted.</p>\n<p>The appellant can therefore have no <em>locus standi</em> in a court of equity.</p>\n<p>Both these objections appear by its own showing.  It was therefore competent and proper for the court below, <em>sua sponte,</em> to dismiss the bill for the want of equity upon its face.  <em>Brown v.
