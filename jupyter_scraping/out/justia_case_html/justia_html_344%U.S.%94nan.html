JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The right to the use and occupancy of a church in the City of New York is in dispute.</p>\n<p>The right to such use is claimed by appellee, a corporation created in 1925 by an act of the Legislature of New York, Laws of New York 1925, c. 463, for the purpose of acquiring a cathedral for the Russian Orthodox Church in North America as a central place of worship and residence of the ruling archbishop</p>\n<p>"in accordance with the doctrine, discipline and worship of the Holy Apostolic Catholic Church of Eastern Confession as taught by the holy scriptures, holy tradition, seven ecumenical councils and holy fathers of that church."</p>\n<p>The corporate right is sought to be enforced so that the head of the American churches, religiously affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, may occupy the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 344 U. S. 96</a></p><p> Cathedral.  At the present time, that head is the Metropolitan of All America and Canada, the Archbishop of New York, Leonty, who, like his predecessors, was elected to his ecclesiastical office by a sobor of the American churches. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>That claimed right of the corporation to use and occupancy for the archbishop chosen by the American churches is opposed by appellants, who are in possession.  Benjamin Fedchenkoff bases his right on an appointment in 1934 by the Supreme Church Authority of the Russian Orthodox Church, to-wit, the Patriarch <em>locum tenens</em> of Moscow and all Russia and its Holy Synod, as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of North America and the Aleutian Islands.  The other defendant-appellant is a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church, also acknowledging the spiritual and administrative control of the Moscow hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Determination of the right to use and occupy Saint Nicholas depends upon whether the appointment of Benjamin </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 344 U.

The Court of Appeals of New York, reversing the lower court, determined that the prelate appointed by the Moscow ecclesiastical authorities was not entitled to the Cathedral and directed the entry of a judgment that appellee corporation be reinvested with the possession and administration of the temporalities of St. Nicholas Cathedral.  <em>St. Nicholas Cathedral v.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>See</em> Stokes, Church and State in the United States (1950), vol. 1, c. VIII.</p>\n<p>The Russian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous member of the Eastern Orthodox Greek Catholic Church.  It sprang from the Church of Constantinople in the Tenth Century.  The schism of 1054 A.D. split the Universal Church into those of the East and the West.  Gradually self-government was assumed by the Russian Church until, in the Sixteenth Century, its autonomy was recognized, and a Patriarch of Moscow appeared.  Fortescue, Orthodox Eastern Church, c. V.  For the next one hundred </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 344 U. S. 101</a></p><p> years, the development of the church kept pace with the growth of power of the Czars, but it increasingly became a part of the civil government -- a state church.  Throughout that period, it also remained an hierarchical church with a Patriarch at its head, governed by the conventions or sobors called by him.  However, from the time of Peter the Great until 1917, no sobor was held.  No patriarch ruled or was chosen.  During that time, the church was governed by a Holy Synod, a group of ecclesiastics with a Chief Procurator representative of the government as a member.</p>\n<p>Late in the Eighteenth Century, the Russian Church entered the missionary field in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska.  From there, churches spread slowly down the Pacific Coast, and later, with the Slavic immigration to our eastern cities, particularly to Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and New York.  The character of the administrative unit changed with the years, as is indicated by the changes in its name.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">note 2</a>  In 1904, when a diocese of North America was created, its first archbishop, Tikhon, shortly thereafter established himself in his seat at Saint Nicholas Cathedral.  His appointment came from the Holy Synod of Russia, as did those of his successors in order Platon and Evdokim.  Under those appointments, the successive archbishops occupied the Cathedral and residence of Saint Nicholas under the administrative authority of the Holy Synod.</p>\n<p>In 1917, Archbishop Evdokim returned to Russia permanently.  Early that year, an All Russian Sobor was held, the first since Peter the Great.  It occurred during the interlude of political freedom following the fall of the Czar.  A patriarch was elected and installed -- Tikhon, who had been the first American Archbishop.  Uncertainties as to the succession to and administration of the American archbishopric made their appearance following this sobor, and were largely induced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 344 U. S. 102</a></p><p> by the almost contemporaneous political disturbances which culminated swiftly in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.  The Russian Orthodox Church was drawn into this maelstrom.  After a few years, the Patriarch was imprisoned.  There were suggestions of his counter-revolutionary activity.  Church power was transferred, partly through a sobor considered by many as noncanonical to a Supreme Church Council.  The declared reforms were said to have resulted in a "Living Church," or sometimes in a "Renovated Church."  Circumstances and pressures changed.  Patriarch Tikhon was released from prison, and died in 1925.   He named three bishops as <em>locum tenens</em> for the patriarchal throne.  It was one of these, Sergius, who, in 1933, appointed the appellant Benjamin as Archbishop.  The Church was registered as a religious organization under Soviet law in 1927.  Thereafter, the Russian Church and the Russian State approached, if not a reconciliation, at least an adjustment, which eventuated by 1943 in the election of Sergius, one of the bishops named as <em>locum tenens</em> by Tikhon, to the Patriarchate.  The Living or Renovated Church, whether deemed a reformed, a schismatic or a new church, apparently withered away.  After Sergius\' death, a new patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexi, was chosen Patriarch in 1945 at Moscow at a sobor recognized by all parties to this litigation as a true sobor held in accordance with the church canons. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Russian upheaval caused repercussions in the North American diocese.  That Diocese, at the time of the Soviet Revolution ,recognized the spiritual and administrative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 344 U. S. 103</a></p><p> control of Moscow.  White Russians, both lay and clerical, found asylum in America from the revolutionary conflicts, strengthening the feeling of abhorrence of the secular attitude of the new Russian Government.  The church members already here, immigrants and native-born, while habituated to look to Moscow for religious direction, were accustomed to our theory of separation between church and state.  The Russian turmoil, the restraints on religious activities, and the evolution of a new ecclesiastical hierarchy in the form of the "Living Church," deemed noncanonical or schismatic by most churchmen, made very difficult Russian administration of the American diocese.  Furthermore, Patriarch Tikhon, on November 20, 1920, issued Decision No. 362 relating to church administration for troublesome times.  This granted a large measure of autonomy, when the Russian ruling authority was unable to function, subject to "confirmation later to the Central Church Authority when it is reestablished."  Naturally the growing number of American-born members of the Russian Church did not cling to a hierarchy identified with their country of remote origin with the same national feeling that moved their immigrant ancestors.  These facts and forces generated in America a separatist movement.</p>\n<p>That movement brought about the arrangements at the Detroit Sobor of 1924 for a temporary American administration of the church on account of the disturbances in Russia. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  This was followed by the declarations of autonomy of the successive sobors since that date, a spate of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 344 U. S. 104</a></p><p> litigation concerning control of the various churches and occupancy of ecclesiastical positions, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the New York legislation (known as Article 5-C, notes 2 and 3, <em>supra</em>), and this controversy.</p>\n<p>Delegates from the North American Diocese intended to be represented at an admittedly canonical Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Church held in 1945 at Moscow.  They did not arrive in time, on account of delays responsibility for which has not been fixed.  The following stipulation appears as to their later actions while at Moscow:</p>\n<p>"It is stipulated that Bishop Alexi and Father Dzvonchik, representing the local group of American Churches under Bishop Theophilus, appeared before the Patriarch and the members of his Synod in Moscow, presented a written report on the condition of the American Church, with a request for autonomy, and a few days later received from the Patriarch the Ukase. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 344 U. S. 105</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There came to the Russian Church in America this Ukase of the Moscow Patriarchy of February 14 or 16, 1945, covering Moscow\'s requirements for reunion of the American Orthodox Church with the Russian.  It required for reunion that the Russian Church in America hold promptly an "all American Orthodox Church Sobor;" that it express the decision of the dioceses to reunite with the Russian Mother Church, declare the agreement of the American Orthodox Church to abstain "from political activities against the U.S.S.R." and so direct its parishes, and elect a Metropolitan subject to confirmation by the Moscow Patriarchy.  The decree said,</p>\n<p>"In view of the distance of the American Metropolitan District from the Russian Mother Church . . . , the Metropolitan-Exarch . . . may be given some extended powers by the Moscow Patriarchy. . . ."</p>\n<p>The American congregations, speaking through their Cleveland Sobor of 1946, refused the proffered arrangement and resolved in part:</p>\n<p>"That any administrative recognition of the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad is hereby terminated, retaining, however, out spiritual and brotherly relations with all parts of the Russian Orthodox Church abroad. . . ."</p>\n<p>This ended the efforts to compose the differences between the Mother Church and its American offspring, and this litigation and the enactment of Article 5-C of the Religious Corporations Law of New York followed.  We understand the above factual summary corresponds substantially with the factual basis for determination formulated by the Court of Appeals of New York.  From those circumstances, it seems clear that the Russian Orthodox Church was, until the Russian Revolution, an hierarchical church with unquestioned paramount jurisdiction in the governing body in Russia over the American Metropolitanate.  Nothing indicates that either the Sacred Synod or the succeeding Patriarchs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 344 U. S. 106</a></p><p> relinquished that authority or recognized the autonomy of the American church.  The Court of Appeals decision proceeds, we understand, upon the same assumption.  302 N.Y. at 5, 23, 24, 96 N.E.2d at 57, 68, 69.  That court did consider</p>\n<p>"whether there exists in Moscow at the present time a true central organization of the Russian Orthodox Church capable of functioning as the head of a free international religious body."</p>\n<p>It concluded that this aspect of the controversy had not been sufficiently developed to justify a judgment upon that ground.  302 N.Y. at 22-24, 96 N.E.2d at 67-69.</p>\n<p><em>The Religious Corporations Law.</em> -- The New York Court of Appeals depended for its judgment, refusing recognition to Archbishop Benjamin, the appointee of the Moscow Hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, upon Article 5-C of the Religious Corporations Law, quoted and analyzed at notes  <a href="#F2" name="T2">2 and <l=|344 a="" u<="">| </l=|344></a><a href="#F2" name="T2">2 and <l=|344 a="" u<="">S. 94fn3|&gt;3, <em>supra.</em> [</l=|344></a><a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Certainly a legislature \xef\xbf\xbd <a href="#F2" name="T2">2 and <l=|344 a="" u<="">S. 107\xef\xbf\xbd is free to act upon such information as it may have as to the necessity for legislation.  But an enactment by a legislature cannot validate action which the Constitution prohibits, and we think that the statute here in question passes the constitutional limits.  We conclude that Article 5-C undertook, by its terms, to transfer the control of the New York churches of the Russian Orthodox religion from the central governing hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Patriarch of Moscow, and the Holy Synod, to the governing authorities of the Russian Church in America, a church organization limited to the diocese of North America and the Aleutian Islands.  This transfer takes place by virtue of the statute.  Such a law violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  It prohibits in this country the free exercise of religion.  Legislation that regulates church administration, the operation of the churches, the appointment of clergy, by requiring conformity to church statutes</l=|344></a></p><a href="#F2" name="T2">\n<p>"adopted at a general convention </p></a><p><a href="#F2" name="T2"></a><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 344 U.

Although this statute requires the New York churches to</p>\n<p>"in all other respects conform to, maintain, and follow the faith, doctrine, ritual, communion, discipline, canon law, traditions, and usages of the Eastern Confession (Eastern Orthodox or Greek Catholic Church),"</p>\n<p>their conformity is by legislative, fiat and subject to legislative will.  Should the state assert power to change the statute requiring conformity to ancient faith and doctrine to one establishing a different doctrine, the invalidity would be unmistakable.</p>\n<p>Although \xc2\xa7 5 of the Religious Corporation Law [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] had long controlled religious corporations, the Court of Appeals held that its rule was not based on any constitutional requirement or prohibition. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Since certain events of which the Court took judicial notice indicated to it that the Russian Government exercised control over the central </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 344 U.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>This legislation, Art. 5-C, in the view of the Court of Appeals, gave the use of the churches to the Russian Church in America on the theory that this church would most faithfully carry out the purposes of the religious trust. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, dangers of political use of church pulpits would be minimized.  Legislative power to punish subversive action cannot be doubted.  If such action should be actually attempted by a cleric, neither his robe nor his pulpit would be a defense.  But, in this case, no problem </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 344 U. S. 110</a></p><p> of punishment for the violation of law arises.  There is no charge of subversive or hostile action by any ecclesiastic.  Here, there is a transfer by statute of control over churches.  This violates our rule of separation between church and state.  That conclusion results from the purpose, meaning, and effect of the New York legislation stated above, considered in the light of the history and decisions considered below.</p>\n<p>Hierarchical churches may be defined as those organized as a body with other churches having similar faith and doctrine with a common ruling convocation or ecclesiastical head.

It was decided here at the 1871 Term.</p>\n<p>"The government of the [Presbyterian] church is exercised by and through an ascending series of \'judicatories,\' known as Church Sessions, Presbyteries, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 344 U.

The Louisville Presbytery, the immediate superior of the Walnut Street Church, promptly issued a Declaration and Testimony, refusing obedience and calling for resistance to the alleged usurpation of authority.  The Louisville Presbytery divided, as did the Walnut Street Church, and the pro-slavery group obtained admission into the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States.  In June, 1867, the Presbyterian General Assembly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 344 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Its ruling is summed up in these words:</p>\n<p>"In this country, the full and free right to entertain any religious belief, to practice any religious principle, and to teach any religious doctrine which does not violate the laws of morality and property, and which does not infringe personal rights, is conceded to all.  The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect.  The right to organize voluntary religious associations to assist in the expression and dissemination of any religious doctrine, and to create tribunals for the decision of controverted questions of faith within the association, and for the ecclesiastical government of all the individual members, congregations, and officers within the general association, is unquestioned.  All who unite themselves to such a body do so with an implied consent to this government, and are bound to submit to it.  But it would be a vain consent, and would lead to the total subversion of such religious bodies, if anyone aggrieved by one of their decisions could appeal to the secular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 344 U. S. 115</a></p><p> courts and have them reversed.  It is of the essence of these religious unions, and of their right to establish tribunals for the decision of questions arising among themselves, that those decisions should be binding in all cases of ecclesiastical cognizance, subject only to such appeals as the organism itself provides for."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/679/case.html#728">80 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  This controversy concerning the right to use St. Nicholas Cathedral is strictly a matter of ecclesiastical government, the power of the Supreme Church Authority of the Russian Orthodox Church to appoint the ruling hierarch of the archdiocese of North America.   No one disputes that such power did lie in that Authority prior to the Russian Revolution.</p>\n<p><em>Watson v. Jones,</em> although it contains a reference to the relations of church and state under our system of laws, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] was decided without depending upon prohibition of state interference with the free exercise of religion.  It was decided in 1872, before judicial recognition of the coercive power of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect the limitations of the First Amendment against state action.  It long antedated the 1938 decisions of <em>Erie R.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 344 U. S. 116</a></p><p> <em>Co. v. Tompkins</em> and <em>Ruhlin v. New York Life Ins.

S. 304</a></span> U.S. 202, and, therefore, even though federal jurisdiction in the case depended solely on diversity, the holding was based on general law, rather than Kentucky law. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The opinion radiates, however, a spirit of freedom for religious organizations, an independence from secular control or manipulation, in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.  Freedom to select the clergy, where no improper methods of choice are proven, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] we think, must now be said to have federal constitutional protection as a part of the free exercise of religion against state interference. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 344 U. S. 117</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Legislative Power.</em> -- The Court of Appeals of New York recognized, generally, the soundness of the philosophy of ecclesiastical control of church administration and polity, but concluded that the exercise of that control was not free from legislative interference. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  That Court presented forcefully the argument supporting legislative power to act on its own knowledge of "the Soviet attitude toward things religious."  302 N.Y. at pages 32-33, 96 N.E.2d at 74.  It was said:</p>\n<p>"The Legislature realized that the North American church, in order to be free of Soviet interference in its affairs, had declared its temporary administrative autonomy in 1924, pursuant to the ukase of 1920, while retaining full spiritual communion with the patriarchate, and that there was a real danger that those properties and temporalities long enjoyed and used by the Russian Orthodox Church worshippers in this State would be taken from them by the representatives of the patriarchate."</p>\n<p>302 N.Y. at 33, 96 N.E.2d at 74.  It was thought that <em>American Communications Assn. v. Douds,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/case.html">339 U. S. 382</a></span>, supported the thesis that, where there is some specific evil, found as a fact, "some infringement upon traditional liberties was justifiable" to effect a cure.  302 N.Y. at 31, 96 N.E.2d at 73.  On that reasoning, it was thought permissible, in view "of the changed situation of the patriarchate in Russia," to replace it with the Russian Church in America as the ruling authority over the administration of the church.  The legal basis for this legislative substitution was found in the theory that the Russian Church in America "was the trustee which <em>may be relied upon to carry out more </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 344 U. S. 118</a></em></p><p><em> effectively and faithfully the purposes of this religious trust (<em>Carrier v. Carrier,</em> 226 N.Y. 114, 123 N.E. 135).\'"  <em>Id.</em> 302 N.Y. at 30, 96 N.E.2d at 72.  Mindful of the authority of the Court of Appeals in its interpretation of the powers of its own legislature and with respect for its standing and ability, we do not agree with its statement as to legislative power over religious organizations.\n</em></p>\n<p>In our view, the <em>Douds</em> case may not be interpreted to validate New York\'s Article 5-C.  That case involved the validity of \xc2\xa7 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended, 61 Stat. 136, 146, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 159(h).  That section forbade the NLRB from acting at the suggestion of a labor organization unless affidavits of its officers were filed denying affiliation with subversive organizations or belief in the overthrow of this Government by force or other unconstitutional means.  We upheld the enactment as a proper exercise of the power to protect commerce from the evil of disruption from strikes so politically inspired.  In so doing, we said,</p>\n<p>"legitimate attempts to protect the public not from the remote possible effects of noxious ideologies, but from present excesses of direct, active conduct are not presumptively bad because they interfere with and, in some of its manifestations, restrain the exercise of First Amendment rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/case.html#399">339 U. S. 399</a></span>.  And added,</p>\n<p>"But, insofar as the problem is one of drawing inferences concerning the need for regulation of particular forms of conduct from conflicting evidence, this Court is in no position to substitute its judgment as to the necessity or desirability of the statute for that of Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/case.html#400">339 U. S. 400</a></span>.  It is an exaggeration to say that those sound statements point to a legislative power to take away from a church\'s governing body and its duly ordained representative the possession and use of a building held in trust for the purposes for which it is being employed because of an apprehension, even though reasonable, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 344 U. S. 119</a></p><p> that it may be employed for improper purposes.  In <em>Douds,</em> we saw nothing that was aimed at the free expression of views.  Unions could have officers with such affiliations and political purposes as they might choose, but the Government was not compelled to allow those officers an opportunity to disrupt commerce for their own political ends.  We looked upon the affidavit requirement as an assurance that disruptive forces would not utilize a government agency to accomplish their purposes.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/case.html#403">339 U. S. 403</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In upholding the validity of Article 5-C, the New York Court of Appeals apparently assumes Article 5-C does nothing more than permit the trustees of the Cathedral to use it for services consistent with the desires of the members of the Russian Church in America.  Its reach goes far beyond that point.  By fiat, it displaces one church administrator with another.  It passes the control of matters strictly ecclesiastical from one church authority to another.  It thus intrudes for the benefit of one segment of a church the power of the state into the forbidden area of religious freedom contrary to the principles of the First Amendment.  Such prohibition differs from the restriction of a right to deal with Government allowed in <em>Douds,</em> in that the Union in the <em>Douds</em> case had no such constitutionally protected right.  New York\'s Article 5-C directly prohibits the free exercise of an ecclesiastical right, the Church\'s choice of its hierarchy.</p>\n<p>We do not think that New York\'s legislative application of a <em>cy pres</em> doctrine to this trust avoids the constitutional rule against prohibition of the free exercise of religion.  <em>Late Corporation of Latter-Day Saints v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/136/1/case.html">136 U. S. 1</a></span>, relied upon by the appellee, does not support its argument.

That charter was revoked by Congress, and some of the property of the church was escheated to the United States for the use of the common schools of Utah.

The majority in the Appellate Division further intimated that to read the statute literally would result in an interference in ecclesiastical concerns not within the competency of the Legislature.

The Legislature, like Congress, knew the character and method of operation of international communism and the Soviet attitude toward things religious.  The Legislature was aware of the contemporary views of qualified observers who have visited Russia and who have had an opportunity to observe the present status of the patriarchate in the Soviet system.  The Legislature realized that the North American church, in order to be free of Soviet interference in its affairs, had declared its temporary administrative autonomy in 1924, pursuant to the ukase of 1920, while retaining full spiritual communion with the patriarchate, and that there was a real danger that those properties and temporalities long enjoyed and used by the Russian Orthodox Church worshippers in this State would be taken from them by the representatives of the patriarchate.  On the basis of these facts, and the facts stated (<em>supra</em>), and no doubt other facts we know not of, our Legislature concluded that the Moscow Patriarchate was no longer capable of functioning as a true religious body, but had become a tool of the Soviet Government primarily designed to implement its foreign policy.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.</p>\n<p>Let me put to one side the question whether, in our day, a legislature could, consistently with due process, displace the judicial process and decide a particular controversy affecting property so as to decree that A, not B, owns it or is entitled to its possession.  Obviously, a legislature would not have that power merely because the property belongs to a church.</p>\n<p>In any event, this proceeding rests on a claim which cannot be determined without intervention by the State in a religious conflict.  St. Nicholas Cathedral is not just a piece of real estate.  It is no more that than is St. Patrick\'s Cathedral or the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.  A cathedral is the seat and center of ecclesiastical authority.  St. Nicholas Cathedral is an archiepiscopal see of one of the great religious organizations.  What is at stake here is the power to exercise religious authority.  That is the essence of this controversy.  It is that even though the religious authority becomes manifest and is exerted through authority over the Cathedral as the outward symbol of a religious faith. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 344 U. S. 122</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The judiciary has heeded, naturally enough, the menace to a society like ours of attempting to settle such religious struggles by state action.  And so, when courts are called upon to adjudicate disputes which, though generated by conflicts of faith, may fairly be isolated as controversies over property and therefore within judicial competence, the authority of courts is in strict subordination to the ecclesiastical law of a particular church prior to a schism.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/679/case.html">Watson v. Jones,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 679.  This very limited right of resort to courts for determination of claims, civil in their nature, between rival parties among the communicants of a religious faith is merely one aspect of the duty of courts to enforce the rights of members in an association, temporal or religious, according to the laws of that association.  <em>See Gonzalez v. Archbishop,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/280/1/case.html">280 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/280/1/case.html#16">280 U. S. 16</a></span>-17.</p>\n<p>Legislatures have no such obligation to adjudicate, and no such power.  Assuredly they have none to settle conflicts of religious authority and none to define religious obedience.  These aspects of spiritual differences constitute the heart of this controversy.  The New York legislature decreed that one party to the dispute, and not the other, should control the common center of devotion.  In doing so, the legislature effectively authorized one party to give religious direction not only to its adherents, but also to its opponents.  <em>See St. Nicholas Cathedral v. Kedroff,</em> 302 N.Y. 1, 24-29, 96 N.E.2d 56, 68-72.</p>\n<p>The arguments by which New York seeks to justify this inroad into the realm of faith are echoes of past attempts at secular intervention in religious conflicts.  It is said that an impressive majority both of the laity and of the priesthood of the old local church now adhere to the party whose candidate New York enthroned, as it were, as Archbishop.  Be that as it may, it is not a function of civil government under our constitutional system to assure rule to any religious body by a counting of heads.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 344 U. S. 123</a></p><p> Our Constitution does assure that anyone is free to worship according to his conscience.  A legislature is not free to vest in a schismatic head the means of acting under the authority of his old church by affording him the religious power which the use and occupancy of St. Nicholas Cathedral make possible.</p>\n<p>Again, it is argued that New York may protect itself from dangers attributed to submission by the mother church in Moscow to political authority.  To reject this claim, one does not have to indulge in the tendency of lawyers to carry arguments to the extreme of empty formal logic.  Scattered throughout the country, there are religious bodies with ties to various countries of a world in tension -- tension due in part to shifting political affiliation and orientation.  The consideration which permeates the court\'s opinion below would give each State the right to assess the circumstances in the foreign political entanglements of its religious bodies that make for danger to the State, and the power, resting on plausible legislative findings, to divest such bodies of spiritual authority and of the temporal property which symbolizes it.</p>\n<p>Memory is short, but it cannot be forgotten that, in the State of New York, there was strong feeling against the Tsarist regime at a time when the Russian Church was governed by a Procurator of the Tsar.  And when Mussolini exacted the Lateran Agreement, argument was not wanting by those friendly to her claims that the Church of Rome was subjecting herself to political authority. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The fear, perhaps not wholly groundless, that the loyalty of its citizens might be diluted by their adherence to a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 344 U. S. 124</a></p><p> church entangled in antagonistic political interests, reappears in history as the ground for interference by civil government with religious attachments. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Such fear readily leads to persecution of religious beliefs deemed dangerous to ruling political authority.  It was on this basis, after all, that Bismarck sought to detach German Catholics from Rome by a series of laws not too different in purport from that, before us today. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The long, unedifying history of the contest between the secular state and the church is replete with instances of attempts by civil government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 344 U. S. 125</a></p><p> to exert pressure upon religious authority.  Religious leaders have often made gestures of accommodation to such pressures.  History also indicates that the vitality of great world religions survived such efforts.  In any event, under our Constitution, it is not open to the governments of this Union to reinforce the loyalty of their citizens by deciding who is the true exponent of their religion.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are told that the present Moscow Patriarchate is not the true superior church of the American communicants.  The vicissitudes of war and revolution which have beset the Moscow Patriarchate since 1917 are said to have resulted in a discontinuity which divests the present Patriarch of his authority over the American church.  Both parties to the present controversy agree that the present Patriarch is the legitimately chosen holder of his office, and the account of the proceedings and pronouncements of the American schismatic group so indicate.  Even were there doubt about this, it is hard to see by what warrant the New York Legislature is free to substitute its own judgment as to the validity of Patriarch Alexy\'s claim and to disregard acknowledgment of the present Patriarch by his co-equals in the Eastern Confession, the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, and by religious leaders throughout the world, including the present Archbishop of York.

JUSTICE JACKSON, dissenting.</p>\n<p>New York courts have decided an ordinary ejectment action involving possession of New York real estate in favor of the plaintiff, a corporation organized under the Religious Corporations Law of New York under the name "Saint Nicholas Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church in North America."  Admittedly, it holds, and since 1925 has held, legal title to the Cathedral property.  The New York Court of Appeals decided that it also has the legal right to its possession and control.</p>\n<p>The appellant Benjamin\'s defense against this owner\'s demand for possession and the basis of his claimed right to enjoy possession of property he admittedly does not own is set forth in his answer to the ejectment suit in these words:</p>\n<p>"Said premises pursuant to the above rules of the Russian Orthodox Church are held in trust for the benefit of the accredited Archbishop of said Archdiocese, to be possessed, occupied, and used by said Archbishop as his residence, as a place for holding religious services, and other purposes related to his office and as the seat and headquarters for the administration, by him, of the affairs of the Archdiocese both temporal and spiritual."</p>\n<p>And, says the appellant Benjamin, he is that Archbishop.  These allegations are denied, and they define the issues as tendered to the state courts. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 344 U. S. 127</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I greatly oversimplify the history of this controversy to indicate its nature, rather than to prove its merits.  This Cathedral was incorporated and built in the era of the Czar, under the regime of a state-ridden church in a church-ridden state.  The Bolshevik did not free the church from the grip of state from the grip of the church, but it did not free the church from the grip of the state.  It only brought to the top a new master for a captive and submissive ecclesiastical establishment.  By 1945, the Moscow patriarchy had been reformed and manned under the Soviet regime, and it sought to reestablish in other countries its pre-revolutionary control of church property and its sway over the minds of the religious.  As the Court\'s opinion points out, it demanded of the Russian Church in America, among other things, that it abstain "from political activities against the U.S.S.R."  The American Cathedral group, along with others, refused submission to the representative of the Moscow Patriarch, whom it regarded as an arm of the Soviet Government.  Thus, we have an ostensible religious schism with decided political overtones.</p>\n<p>If the Fourteenth Amendment is to be interpreted to leave anything to the courts of a state to decide without our interference, I should suppose it would be claims to ownership or possession of real estate within its borders and the vexing technical questions pertaining to the creation, interpretation, termination, and enforcement of uses and trusts, even though they are for religious and charitable purposes.  This controversy, I believe, is a matter for settlement by state law, and not within the proper province of this Court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>As I read the prevailing opinions, the Court assumes that some transfer of control has been accomplished by legislation which results in a denial of due process.  This, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 344 U. S. 128</a></p><p> of course, would raise a question of deprivation of property, not of liberty, while only the latter issue is raised by the parties.  And it could be sustained only by a finding by us that the legislation worked a transfer, rather than a confirmation, of property rights.  The Court of Appeals seems to have regarded the statute merely as a legislative reaffirmation of principle the Court would find to be controlling in its absence.</p>\n<p>But this Court apparently thinks that, by mere enactment of the statute, the legislature invaded a field of action reserved to the judiciary.  However desirable we may think a rigid separation of powers to be (and I, for one, think it is basic in the Federal Government), I do not think the Fourteenth Amendment undertakes to control distribution of powers within the states.  At all events, I do not think we are warranted in holding that New York may not enact this legislation in question, which is in form and in substance an amendment of its Religious Corporations Law.</p>\n<p>Nothing in New York law required this denomination to incorporate its Cathedral.  The Religious Corporations Law of the State expressly recognizes unincorporated churches (\xc2\xa7 2) and undertakes no regulation of them or their affairs.  But this denomination wanted the advantages of a corporate charter for its Cathedral, to obtain immunity from personal liability and other benefits.  This statute does not interfere with religious freedom, but furthers it.  If they elect to come under it, the statute makes separate provision for each of many denominations with corporate controls appropriate to its own ecclesiastical order.  When it sought the privilege of incorporation under the New York law applicable to its denomination, it seems to me that this Cathedral and all connected with its temporal affairs were submitted to New York law.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of this Court\'s decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/518/case.html">Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 518, the Constitution of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 344 U. S. 129</a></p><p> New York since 1846 has authorized the legislature to create corporations by general laws and special acts, subject, however, to a reservation that all such acts "may be altered from time to time or repealed."  New York Const., Art. X, \xc2\xa7 1.  That condition becomes a part of every corporate charter subsequently granted by New York.  <em>Lord v. Equitable Life Assurance Society,</em> 194 N.Y. 212, 87 N.E. 443; <em>People v. Gass,</em> 190 N.Y. 323, 83 N.E. 64; <em>Pratt Institute v. New York,</em> 183 N.Y. 151, 75 N.E. 1119.</p>\n<p>What has been done here, as I see it, is to exercise this reserved power which permits the State to alter corporate controls in response to the lessons of experience.  Of course, the power is not unlimited, and could be so exercised as to deprive one of property without due process of law.  But I do not think we can say that a legislative application of a principle so well established in our common law as the <em>cy pres</em> doctrine is beyond the powers reserved by the New York Constitution.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court holds, however, that the State cannot exercise its reserved power to control this property without invading religious freedom, because it is a Cathedral, and devoted to religious uses.  I forbear discussion of the extent to which restraints imposed upon Congress by the First Amendment are transferred against the State by the Fourteenth Amendment beyond saying that I consider that the same differences which apply to freedom of speech and press, <em>see</em> dissenting opinion in <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/250/case.html">343 U. S. 250</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/250/case.html#287">343 U. S. 287</a></span>, are applicable to questions of freedom of religion and of separation of church and state.</p>\n<p>It is important to observe what New York has not done in this case.  It has not held that Benjamin may not act as Archbishop or be revered as such by all who will follow him.  It has not held that he may not have a Cathedral.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 344 U. S. 130</a></p><p> Indeed, I think New York would agree that no one is more in need of spiritual guidance than the Soviet faction.  It has only held that this cleric may not have a particular Cathedral which, under New York law, belongs to others.  It has not interfered with his or anyone\'s exercise of his religion.  New York has not outlawed the Soviet-controlled sect nor forbidden it to exercise its authority or teach its dogma in any place whatsoever except on this piece of property owned and rightfully possessed by the Cathedral Corporation.</p>\n<p>The fact that property is dedicated to a religious use cannot, in my opinion, justify the Court in sublimating an issue over property rights into one of deprivation of religious liberty which alone would bring in the religious guaranties of the First Amendment.  I assume no one would pretend that the State cannot decide a claim of trespass, larceny, conversion, bailment, or contract, where the property involved is that of a religious corporation or is put to religious use, without invading the principle of religious liberty.</p>\n<p>Of course, possession of the property will help either side that obtains it to maintain its prestige and to continue or extend its sway over the minds and souls of the devout.  So would possession of a bank account, an income-producing office building, or any other valuable property.  But, if both claimants are religious corporations or personalities, cannot the State decide the issues that arise over ownership and possession without invading the religious freedom of one or the other of the parties?</p>\n<p>Thus, if the American group, which owns the title to the Cathedral, had by force barred Benjamin from entering it physically, would the Court say it was an interference with religious freedom to entertain and decide his ejectment action?  If state courts are to decide such controversies at all, instead of leaving them to be settled by a show of force, is it constitutional to decide for only </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 344 U. S. 131</a></p><p> one side of the controversy, and unconstitutional to decide for the other?  In either case, the religious freedom of one side or the other is impaired if the temporal goods they need are withheld or taken from them.</p>\n<p>As I have earlier pointed out, the Soviet Ecclesiast\'s claim, denial of which is said to be constitutional error, is not that this New York property is impressed with a trust by virtue of New York law.  The claim is that it is impressed with a trust by virtue of the rules of the Russian Orthodox Church.  This Court so holds.</p>\n<p>I shall not undertake to wallow through the complex, obscure and fragmentary details of secular and ecclesiastical history, theology, and canon law in which this case is smothered.  To me, whatever the canon law is found to be and whoever is the rightful head of the Moscow patriarchate, I do not think New York law must yield to the authority of a foreign and unfriendly state masquerading as a spiritual institution.  <em>See</em> "The Soviet Propaganda Program," Staff Study No. 3, Subcommittee on Overseas Information Programs of the United States, 82d Cong., 2d Sess.</p>\n<p>I have supposed that a this Union was entirely free to make its own law, independently of any foreign-made law, except as the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution might require deference to the law of a sister state or the Supremacy Clause require submission to federal law.  I do not see how one can spell out of the principles of separation of church and state a doctrine that a state submit property rights to settlement by canon law.  If there is any relevant inference to be drawn, I should think it would be to the contrary, though I see no obstacle to the state\'s allowing ecclesiastical law to govern in such a situation if it sees fit.  I should infer that from the trend of such decisions as <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/case.html">304 U. S. 64</a></span>; <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/487/case.html">313 U. S. 487</a></span>; <em>Griffin v. McCoach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/498/case.html">313 U. S. 498</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 344 U. S. 132</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The only ground pressed upon this appeal is that the judgment below violates the religious freedom guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  I find this contention so insubstantial that I would dismiss the appeal.  Whether New York has arrived at the correct solution of this question is a matter on which its own judges have disagreed.  But they have disagreed within the area which is committed to them for agreement or disagreement, and I find nothing which warrants our invading their jurisdiction.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
