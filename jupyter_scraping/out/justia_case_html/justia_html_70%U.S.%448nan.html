This was, it is true, the judgment of the Court of Appeals as well as the judgment of the supreme court, but it became a final judgment, on which execution could issue only when entered, on the 16th February, 1866, in the supreme court, to which the record was returned, and where it remained. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 70 U.
