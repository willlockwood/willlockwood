The Port leases marine terminal facilities to operators that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships.  Federally licensed short-haul trucks, called \xe2\x80\x9cdrayage trucks,\xe2\x80\x9d assist in those operations by moving cargo into and out of the Port.  In 2007, in response to community concerns over the impact of a proposed port expansion on traffic, the environment, and safety, the Board implemented a Clean Truck Program.  As part of that program, the Board devised a standard-form \xe2\x80\x9cconcession agreement\xe2\x80\x9d to govern the relationship between the Port and drayage companies.  The agreement requires a company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting concerns, and to submit a plan listing off-street parking locations for each truck.  Other requirements relate to a company\xe2\x80\x99s financial capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of drivers.  The concession agreement sets out penalties for violations, including possible suspension or revocation of the right to provide drayage services.  The Board also amended the Port\xe2\x80\x99s tariff to ensure that every drayage company would enter into the agreement.  The amended tariff makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or imprisonment, for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregistered drayage truck.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), whose members include many of the drayage companies at the Port, sued the Port and City, seeking an injunction against the concession agreement\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  ATA principally contended that the requirements are expressly preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA), see \n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714501(c)(1).  ATA also argued that even if the requirements are valid, Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., \n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61\n, prevents the Port from enforcing the requirements by withdrawing a defaulting company\xe2\x80\x99s right to operate at the Port.  The District Court held that neither \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) nor Castle prevented the Port from proceeding with its program.  The Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed, finding only the driver-employment provision preempted and rejecting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Castle claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0The FAAAA expressly preempts the concession agreement\xe2\x80\x99s placard and parking requirements.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts a state \xe2\x80\x9claw, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to the transportation of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714501(c)(1).  Because the parties agree that the Port\xe2\x80\x99s placard and parking requirements relate to a motor carrier\xe2\x80\x99s price, route, or service with respect to transporting property, the only disputed question is whether those requirements \xe2\x80\x9chav[e] the force and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 14501(c)(1) draws a line between a government\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of regulatory authority and its own contract-based participation in a market.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s  \xe2\x80\x9cforce and effect of law\xe2\x80\x9d language excludes from the clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope contractual arrangements made by a State when it acts as a market participant, not as a regulator.  See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, \n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219\n.  But here, the Port exercised classic regulatory authority in imposing the placard and parking requirements.  It forced terminal operators\xe2\x80\x94and through them, trucking companies\xe2\x80\x94to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment.  That counts as action \xe2\x80\x9chaving the force and effect of law\xe2\x80\x9d if anything does.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Port\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument to the contrary focuses on motives rather than means.  But the Port\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary intentions do not control.  When the government employs a coercive mechanism, available to no private party, it acts with the force and effect of law, whether or not it does so to turn a profit.  Only if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental) exercise of legal authority may it escape \xc2\xa714501(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive scope.  That the criminal sanctions fall on terminal operators, not directly on the trucking companies, also makes no difference.  See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364\n\xe2\x80\x93373.

Castle rebuffed a State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways for past infringements of state safety regulations.  But Castle does not prevent a State from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously out of compliance with such regulations.  And at this juncture, there is no basis for finding that the Port will actually use the concession agreement\xe2\x80\x99s penalty provision as Castle proscribes.

We hold that the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) expressly preempts two of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s provisions, which require such a company to develop an off-street parking plan and display designated placards on its vehicles.  We decline to decide in the case\xe2\x80\x99s present, pre-enforcement posture whether, under Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., \n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61 (1954)\n, federal law governing licenses for interstate motor carriers prevents the Port from using the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s penalty clause to punish violations of other, non-preempted provisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los Angeles, is the largest port in the country.  The Port owns marine terminal facilities, which it leases to \xe2\x80\x9cterminal operators\xe2\x80\x9d (such as shipping lines and stevedoring companies) that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships.  Short-haul trucks, called \xe2\x80\x9cdrayage trucks,\xe2\x80\x9d move the cargo into and out of the Port.  The trucking companies providing those drayage services are all federally licensed motor carriers.  Before the events giving rise to this case, they contracted with terminal operators to transport cargo, but did not enter into agreements with the Port itself.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe City\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Harbor Commissioners runs the Port pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff, which sets out various regulations and charges.  In the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the Board decided to enlarge the Port\xe2\x80\x99s facilities to accommodate more ships.  Neighborhood and environmental groups objected to the proposed expansion, arguing that it would increase congestion and air pollution and decrease safety in the surrounding area.  A lawsuit they brought, and another they threatened, stymied the Board\xe2\x80\x99s development project for almost 10 years.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo address the community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, the Board implemented a Clean Truck Program beginning in 2007.  Among other actions, the Board devised a standard-form \xe2\x80\x9cconcession agreement\xe2\x80\x9d to govern the relationship between the Port and any trucking company seeking to operate on the premises.  Under that contract, a company may transport cargo at the Port in exchange for complying with various requirements.  The two directly at issue here compel the company to (1) affix a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting environmental or safety concerns (You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the type: \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I driving?  213\xe2\x80\x93867\xe2\x80\x935309\xe2\x80\x9d) and (2) submit a plan listing off-street parking locations for each truck when not in service.  Three other provisions in the agreement, formerly dis- puted in this litigation, relate to the company\xe2\x80\x99s financial capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of drivers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Board then amended the Port\xe2\x80\x99s tariff to ensure that every company providing drayage services at the facility would enter into the concession agreement.  The mechanism the Board employed is a criminal prohibition on terminal operators.  The amended tariff provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno Terminal Operator shall permit access into any Terminal in the Port of Los Angeles to any Drayage Truck unless such Drayage Truck is registered under a Concession [Agreement].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 105.  A violation of that provision\xe2\x80\x94which occurs \xe2\x80\x9ceach and every day\xe2\x80\x9d a terminal operator provides access to an unregistered truck\xe2\x80\x94is a misdemeanor.

When a company commits a \xe2\x80\x9cMinor Default,\xe2\x80\x9d the Port may issue a warning letter or order the company to undertake \xe2\x80\x9ccorrective action,\xe2\x80\x9d complete a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. training,\xe2\x80\x9d or pay the costs of the Port\xe2\x80\x99s investigation.

Id., at 82.  The agreement, however, does not specify which breaches of the contract qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cMajor,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cMinor.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the parties agree that the Port has never suspended or revoked a trucking company\xe2\x80\x99s license to operate at the Port for a prior violation of one of the contract provisions involved in this case.

(ATA), is a national trade association representing the trucking industry, including drayage companies that operate at the Port.  ATA filed suit against the Port and City, seeking an injunction against the five provisions of the concession agreement discussed above.  The complaint principally contended that \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA expressly preempts those requirements.  That statutory section states:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[A] State [or local government] may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to the transportation of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714501(c)(1).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tATA also offered a back-up argument: Even if the requirements are valid, ATA claimed, the Port may not enforce them by withdrawing a defaulting company\xe2\x80\x99s right to operate at the Port.  That argument rested on Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., \n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61 (1954)\n, which held that Illinois could not bar a federally licensed motor car- rier from its highways for prior violations of state safety regulations.  We reasoned in Castle that the State\xe2\x80\x99s action conflicted with federal law providing for certification of motor carriers; and ATA argued here that a similar conflict would inhere in applying the concession agreement to suspend or revoke a trucking company\xe2\x80\x99s privileges.  Following a bench trial, the District Court held that neither \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) nor Castle prevents the Port from proceeding with any part of its Clean Truck Program.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed.  Most important for our purposes, the court held that \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) does not preempt the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s placard and parking requirements because they do not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0ha[ve] the force and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  660 F.\xc2\xa03d 384, 395 (2011) (quoting \xc2\xa714501(c)(1)).  The court reasoned that those requirements, rather than regulating the drayage market, advance the Port\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness interest\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging its facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 401.

The Ninth Circuit also held the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s financial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions not preempted, for reasons not relevant here.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Section 14501(c)(1), the court decided, preempts only the contract\xe2\x80\x99s employment provision.  Finally, the Ninth Circuit rejected ATA\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Castle bars the Port from applying the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s penalty clause to withdraw a trucking company\xe2\x80\x99s right to operate at the facility.  The court thought Castle inapplicable because of the narrower exclusion in this case: \xe2\x80\x9cUnlike a ban on using all of a State\xe2\x80\x99s freeways,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9ca limitation on access to a single Port does not prohibit motor carriers\xe2\x80\x9d from generally participating in interstate commerce.  660 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 403.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari to resolve two questions: first, whether \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the concession agreement\xe2\x80\x99s placard and parking provisions; and second, whether Castle precludes reliance on the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s penalty clause to suspend or revoke a trucking company\xe2\x80\x99s privileges.  See 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).  Contrary to the Ninth Circuit, we hold that the placard and parking requirements are preempted as \xe2\x80\x9cprovision[s] having the force and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  That determination does not obviate the enforcement issue arising from Castle because the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rulings upholding the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s financial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions have now become final;\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t accordingly, the Port could try to apply its penalty provision to trucking companies that have violated those surviving requirements.

That phrase, we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cconnotes official, government-imposed policies\xe2\x80\x9d prescribing \xe2\x80\x9cbinding standards of conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 229, n.\xc2\xa05 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And we contrasted that quintessential regulatory action to \xe2\x80\x9ccontractual commitment[s] voluntarily undertaken.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 229 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In Wolens, we addressed a State\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of an agreement between two private parties.  But the same reasoning holds if the government enters into a contract just as a private party would\xe2\x80\x94for example, if a State (or City or Port) signs an agreement with a trucking company to transport goods at a specified price.  See, e.g., Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n233 (1993)\n (When a State acts as a purchaser of services, \xe2\x80\x9cit does not \xe2\x80\x98regulate\xe2\x80\x99 the workings of the market .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ; it exemplifies them\xe2\x80\x9d (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  The \xe2\x80\x9cforce and effect of law\xe2\x80\x9d language in \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) excludes such everyday contractual arrangements from the clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  That phrasing targets the State acting as a State, not as any market actor\xe2\x80\x94or other- wise said, the State acting in a regulatory rather than proprietary mode.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut that statutory reading gets the Port nothing, because it exercised classic regulatory authority\xe2\x80\x94complete with the use of criminal penalties\xe2\x80\x94in imposing the placard and parking requirements at issue here.  Consider again how those requirements work.  They are, to be sure, contained in contracts between the Port and trucking companies.  But those contracts do not stand alone, as the result merely of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary commitments.  The Board of Harbor Commissioners aimed to \xe2\x80\x9crequire parties who access Port land and terminals for purposes of pro- viding drayage services\xe2\x80\x9d to enter into concession agreements with the Port.  App. 108 (Board\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFindings\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it accomplished that objective by amending the Port\xe2\x80\x99s tariff\xe2\x80\x94a form of municipal ordinance\xe2\x80\x94to provide that \xe2\x80\x9cno Terminal Operator shall permit\xe2\x80\x9d a drayage truck to gain \xe2\x80\x9caccess into any Terminal in the Port\xe2\x80\x9d unless the truck is \xe2\x80\x9cregistered under\xe2\x80\x9d such a concession agreement.  Id., at 105.  A violation of that tariff provision is a violation of criminal law.  And it is punishable by a fine or a prison sentence of up to six months.  Id., at 85\xe2\x80\x9386.  So the contract here functions as part and parcel of a governmental program wielding coercive power over private parties, backed by the threat of criminal punishment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat counts as action \xe2\x80\x9chaving the force and effect of law\xe2\x80\x9d if anything does.  The Port here has not acted as a private party, contracting in a way that the owner of an ordinary commercial enterprise could mimic.  Rather, it has forced terminal operators\xe2\x80\x94and through them, trucking companies\xe2\x80\x94to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by time in prison.  In some cases, the question whether governmental action has the force of law may pose difficulties; the line between regulatory and proprietary conduct has soft edges.  But this case takes us nowhere near those uncertain boundaries.  Contractual commitments resulting not from ordinary bargaining (as in Wolens), but instead from the threat of criminal sanctions manifest the government qua government, performing its prototypical regulatory role.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Port\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument to the contrary, like the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s, focuses on motive rather than means.  The Court of Appeals related how community opposition had frustrated the Port\xe2\x80\x99s expansion, and concluded that the Clean Truck Program \xe2\x80\x9crespon[ded] to perceived business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  660 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 407.  The Port tells the identical story, emphasizing that private companies have similar business incentives to \xe2\x80\x9cadopt[\xc2\xa0] \xe2\x80\x98green growth\xe2\x80\x99 plans like the Port\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for City of Los Angeles 30.  We have no reason to doubt that account of events; we can assume the Port acted to enhance goodwill and improve the odds of achieving its business plan\xe2\x80\x94just as a private company might.  But the Port\xe2\x80\x99s intentions are not what matters.  That is because, as we just described, the Port chose a tool to fulfill those goals which only a government can wield: the hammer of the criminal law.  See United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 438 F.\xc2\xa03d 150, 157 (CA2 2006), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, \n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330 (2007)\n.  And when the government employs such a coercive mechanism, available to no private party, it acts with the force and effect of law, whether or not it does so to turn a profit.  Only if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental) exercise of legal authority may it escape \xc2\xa714501(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Port also tries another tack, reminding us that the criminal sanctions here fall on terminal operators alone, not on the trucking companies subject to the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s requirements; hence, the Port maintains, the matter of \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal penalties is a red herring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; see Brief for City of Los Angeles 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  But we fail to see why the target of the sanctions makes any difference.  The Port selected an indirect but wholly effective means of \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] parties .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. providing drayage services\xe2\x80\x9d to display placards and submit parking plans: To wit, the Port required terminal operators, on pain of criminal penalties, to insist that the truckers make those commitments.  App. 108; see supra, at 3, 8.  We have often rejected efforts by States to avoid preemption by shifting their regulatory focus from one company to another in the same supply chain.  See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364\n\xe2\x80\x93373 (2008) (finding preemption under the FAAAA although the State\xe2\x80\x99s requirements directly targeted retailers rather than motor carriers); Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246, \n255 (2004)\n (finding preemption under the Clean Air Act although the requirements directly targeted car buyers rather than sellers).  The same goes here.  The Port made its regulation of drayage trucks mandatory by imposing criminal penalties on the entities hiring all such trucks at the facility.  Slice it or dice it any which way, the Port thus acted with the \xe2\x80\x9cforce of law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur rejection of the concession agreement\xe2\x80\x99s placard and parking requirements does not conclude this case.  Two other provisions of the agreement are now in effect: As noted earlier, the Ninth Circuit upheld the financial-capacity and truck-maintenance requirements, and that part of its decision has become final.  See supra, at 5, and n.\xc2\xa02.  ATA argues that our holding in Castle limits the way the Port can enforce those remaining requirements.  According to ATA, the Port may not rely on the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s penalty provision to suspend or revoke the right of non-complying trucking companies to operate on the premises. \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we have described, Castle rebuffed a State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways for past infringements of state safety regulations.  A federal statute, we explained, gave a federal agency the authority to license interstate motor carriers, as well as a carefully circumscribed power to suspend or terminate those licenses for violations of law.  That statute, we held, implicitly prohibited a State from \xe2\x80\x9ctak[ing] action\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94like a ban on the use of its highways\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9camounting to a suspension or revocation of an interstate carrier\xe2\x80\x99s [federally] granted right to operate.\xe2\x80\x9d  348 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties here dispute whether Castle restricts the Port\xe2\x80\x99s remedial authority.  The Port echoes the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view that banning a truck from \xe2\x80\x9call of a State\xe2\x80\x99s freeways\xe2\x80\x9d is meaningfully different from denying it \xe2\x80\x9caccess to a single Port.\xe2\x80\x9d  660 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 403; see Brief for City of Los Angeles 49.  ATA responds that because the Port is a \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial channel of interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d Castle applies to it just as much as to roads.  Brief for Petitioner 18.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut we see another question here: Does the Port\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement scheme involve curtailing drayage trucks\xe2\x80\x99 operations in the way Castle prohibits, even assuming that decision applies to facilities like this one?  As just indicated, Castle puts limits on how a State or locality can punish an interstate motor carrier for prior violations of truck- ing regulations (like the concession agreement\xe2\x80\x99s requirements).  Nothing we said there, however, prevents a State from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously out of compliance with such regulations.  Indeed, ATA filed an amicus brief in Castle explaining that a vehicle \xe2\x80\x9cthat fails to comply with the state\xe2\x80\x99s regulations may be barred from the state\xe2\x80\x99s highways.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for ATA, O.\xc2\xa0T 1954, No. 44, p.\xc2\xa012; see Brief for Respondent, id., p.\xc2\xa023 (A State may \xe2\x80\x9cstop and prevent from continuing on the highway any motor vehicle which it finds not to be in compliance\xe2\x80\x9d).  And ATA reiterates that view here, as does the United States as amicus curiae.  See Reply Brief 22; Brief for United States 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  So the Port would not violate Castle if it barred a truck from operating at its facilities to prevent an ongoing violation of the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd at this juncture, we have no basis for finding that the Port will ever use the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s penalty provision for anything more than that.  That provision, to be sure, might be read to give the Port broader authority: As noted earlier, the relevant text enables the Port to suspend or revoke a trucking company\xe2\x80\x99s right to provide dray- age services at the facility as a \xe2\x80\x9c[r]emedy\xe2\x80\x9d for a \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Default.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 82; see supra, at 3.  But the agreement nowhere states what counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Default\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and specifically, whether a company\xe2\x80\x99s breach of the financial-capacity or truck-maintenance requirements would qual-ify.  And the Port has in fact never used its suspension or revocation power to penalize a past violation of those requirements.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  Indeed, the Port\xe2\x80\x99s brief states that \xe2\x80\x9cit does not claim[\xc2\xa0] the authority to punish past, cured violations of the requirements challenged here through suspension or revocation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for City of Los Angeles 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).  So the kind of enforcement ATA fears, and believes inconsistent with Castle, might never come to pass at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn these circumstances, we decide not to decide ATA\xe2\x80\x99s Castle-based challenge.  That claim, by its nature, attacks the Port\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement scheme.  But given the pre-enforcement posture of this case, we cannot tell what that scheme entails.  It might look like the one forbidden in Castle (as ATA anticipates), or else it might not (as the Port assures us).  We see no reason to take a guess now about what the Port will do later.  There will be time enough to address the Castle question when, if ever, the Port enforces its agreement in a way arguably violating that decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the placard and parking provisions of the Port\xe2\x80\x99s concession agreement.

The tension between \xc2\xa714501 and the Constitution is apparent, because the Constitution does not give Congress power to regulate intrastate commerce.  United States v. Lopez, \n\n514 U.

Because the Constitution and federal laws are supreme, conflicting state laws are without legal effect.  See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, \n\n530 U. S. 363, \n372 (2000)\n.  However, the constitutional text leaves no doubt that only federal laws made \xe2\x80\x9cin Pursuance\xe2\x80\x9d of the Constitution are supreme.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n\n501 U.

Although respondents waived any argument that Congress lacks authority to regulate the placards and parking arrangements of drayage trucks using the port, I doubt that Congress has such authority.  The Court has iden- tified three categories of activity that Congress may regulate under the Commerce Clause: (1) the use of the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cactivities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lopez, supra, at 558\xe2\x80\x93559.  Drayage trucks that carry cargo into and out of the Port of Los Angeles undoubtedly operate within the \xe2\x80\x9cchannels of interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for that is what a port is.  Congress can therefore regulate conduct taking place within the port.  But it is doubtful whether Congress has the power to decide where a drayage truck should park once it has left the port or what kind of placard the truck should display while offsite.  Even under the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial effects\xe2\x80\x9d test, which I have rejected as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rootless and malleable standard\xe2\x80\x99 at odds with the constitutional design,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonzales v. Raich, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n (dissenting opinion) (quoting United States v. Morrison, \n\n529 U. S. 598, \n627 (2000)\n (Thomas, J., concurring)), it is difficult to say that placards and parking arrangements substantially af- fect interstate commerce.  Congress made no findings indicating that offsite parking\xe2\x80\x94conduct that falls within the scope of the States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional police powers\xe2\x80\x94substantially affects interstate commerce.  And I doubt that it could.  Nevertheless, because respondents did not preserve a constitutional challenge to the FAAAA and because I agree that the provisions in question have the \xe2\x80\x9cforce and effect of law,\xe2\x80\x9d I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
