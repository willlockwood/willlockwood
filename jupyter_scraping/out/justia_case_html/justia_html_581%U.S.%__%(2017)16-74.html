Respondents, current and former hospital employees, filed class actions alleging that the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 pension plans do not fall within ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s church-plan exemption because they were not established by a church.

In other words, because Congress deemed the category of plans \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and maintained by a church\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\xe2\x80\x9d plans \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained by\xe2\x80\x9d principal-purpose organizations, those plans\xe2\x80\x94and <i>all</i> those plans\xe2\x80\x94are exempt from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Had Congress wanted, as the employees contend, to alter only the maintenance requirement, it could have provided in subparagraph (C)(i) that \xe2\x80\x9ca plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by\xe2\x80\x9d a principal-purpose organization\xe2\x80\x94removing \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and\xe2\x80\x9d from the first part of the sentence.  But Congress did not adopt that ready alternative.  Instead, it added language whose most natural reading is to enable a plan \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained\xe2\x80\x9d by a principal-purpose organization to substitute for a plan both \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained\xe2\x80\x9d by a church.  And as a corollary to that point, the employees\xe2\x80\x99 construction runs aground on the so-called surplusage canon\xe2\x80\x94the presumption that each word Congress uses is there for a reason.  The employees read subparagraph (C)(i) as if it were missing the two words \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court, however, \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s] effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362\n.

According to the hospitals, Congress wanted to ensure that churches and church-affiliated organizations received comparable treatment under ERISA.  If that is so, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the text fits Congress\xe2\x80\x99s objective to a T, as a church-establishment requirement would necessarily disfavor plans created by church affiliates.  The employees, by contrast, claim that subparagraph (C)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s main goal was to bring within the church-plan exemption plans managed by local pension boards\xe2\x80\x94organizations often used by congregational denominations\xe2\x80\x94so as to ensure parity between congregational and hierarchical churches.  But that account cuts against, not in favor of, their position.  Keeping the church-establishment requirement would have prevented some plans run by pension boards\xe2\x80\x94the very entities the employees say Congress most wanted to benefit\xe2\x80\x94from qualifying as \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plans\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA.

See \xc2\xa71002(33)(C)(i).  The question presented here is whether a church must have originally <i>established</i> such a plan for it to so qualify.

But in enacting the statute, Congress made an important exception.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]hurch plan[s]\xe2\x80\x9d have never had to comply with ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  \xc2\xa71003(b)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d came in two distinct phases.  From the beginning, ERISA provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98church plan\xe2\x80\x99 means a plan established and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for its employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church or by a convention or association of churches.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71002(33)(A).  Then, in 1980, Congress amended the statute to expand that definition by deeming additional plans to fall within it.  The amendment specified that for purposes of the church-plan definition, an \xe2\x80\x9cemployee of a church\xe2\x80\x9d would include an employee of a church-affiliated organization (like the hospitals here).  \xc2\xa71002(33)(C)(ii)(II).  And it added the provision whose effect is at issue in these cases:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cA plan established and maintained for its employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church or by a convention or association of churches includes a plan maintained by an organization .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the principal purpose or function of which is the administration or funding of a plan or program for the provision of retirement benefits or welfare benefits, or both, for the employees of a church or a convention or association of churches, if such organi-zation is controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71002(33)(C)(i).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is a mouthful, for lawyers and non-lawyers alike; to digest it more easily, note that everything after the word \xe2\x80\x9corganization\xe2\x80\x9d in the third line is just a (long-winded) description of a particular kind of church-associated en-tity\xe2\x80\x94which this opinion will call a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal-purpose organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  The main job of such an entity, as the statute explains, is to fund or manage a benefit plan for the employees of churches or (per the 1980 amendment\xe2\x80\x99s other part) of church affiliates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The three federal agencies responsible for administering ERISA have long read those provisions, when taken together, to exempt plans like the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s mandates.  (The relevant agencies are the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.)  The original definitional provision\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa71002(33)(A), or paragraph (A) for short\xe2\x80\x94defines a \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d as one \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not by a church-affiliated nonprofit.  But according to the agencies, the later (block-quoted) provision\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa71002(33)(C)(i), or just subparagraph (C)(i)\xe2\x80\x94expands that definition to include any plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization, regardless of whether a church initially established the plan.  And, the agencies believe, the internal benefits committee of a church-affiliated nonprofit counts as such an organization.  See, <i>e.g., </i>IRS General Counsel Memorandum No. 39007 (Nov. 2, 1982), App. 636\xe2\x80\x93637.  That interpretation has appeared in hundreds of private letter rulings and opinion letters issued since 1982, including several provided to the hospitals here.  See App. 57\xe2\x80\x9369, 379\xe2\x80\x93386, 668\xe2\x80\x93715.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The three cases before us are part of a recent wave of litigation challenging the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 view.  Respondents, current and former employees of the hospitals, filed class actions alleging that their employers\xe2\x80\x99 pension plans do not fall within ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s church-plan exemption (and thus must satisfy the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirements).  That is so, the employees claim, because those plans were not established by a church\xe2\x80\x94and ERISA, even as amended, demands that all \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plans\xe2\x80\x9d have such an origin.  According to the employees, the addition of subparagraph (C)(i) allowed principal-purpose organizations to <i>maintain </i>such plans in lieu of churches; but that provision kept as-is paragraph (A)\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that churches themselves <i>establish</i> \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at 265\xe2\x80\x93268, 435\xe2\x80\x93437, 783\xe2\x80\x93785.  The District Courts handling the cases agreed with the employees\xe2\x80\x99 position, and therefore held that the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 plans must comply with ERISA.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Courts of Appeals for the Third, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits affirmed those decisions.  The Third Circuit ruled first, concluding that ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain text\xe2\x80\x9d requires that a pension plan be established by a church to qualify for the church-plan exemption.  <i>Kaplan </i>v.<i> Saint Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Healthcare System</i>, 810 F.\xc2\xa03d 175, 177 (2015).  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, paragraph (A) set out \xe2\x80\x9ctwo requirements\xe2\x80\x9d for the exemption\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cestablishment and maintenance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9conly the latter is expanded by the use of \xe2\x80\x98includes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in subparagraph (C)(i).  <i>Id.</i>, at 181.  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits relied on similar reasoning to decide in the employees\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  See <i>Stapleton </i>v.<i> Advocate Health Care Network</i>, 817 F.\xc2\xa03d 517, 523 (CA7 2016); <i>Rollins</i> v. <i>Dignity Health</i>, 830 F.\xc2\xa03d 900, 906 (CA9 2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of the importance of the issue, this Court granted certiorari.  579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The dispute in these cases about what counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d hinges on the combined meaning of paragraph (A) and subparagraph (C)(i).  Interpretive purists may refer back as needed to the provisions as quoted above.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  But for those who prefer their statutes in (comparatively) user-friendly form, those provisions go as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">Under paragraph (A), a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98church plan\xe2\x80\x99 means a plan established and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">Under subparagraph (C)(i), \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plan established and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. includes a plan maintained by [a principal-purpose] organization.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The parties agree that under those provisions, a \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d need not be maintained by a church; it may instead be maintained by a principal-purpose organization.  But the parties differ as to whether a plan maintained by that kind of organization must still have been established by a church to qualify for the church-plan exemption.  The hospitals say no: The effect of subparagraph (C)(i) was to bring within the church-plan definition all pension plans maintained by a principal-purpose organization, regardless of who first established them.  The employees say yes: Subparagraph (C)(i) altered only the requirement that a pension plan be maintained by a church, while leaving intact the church-establishment condition.  We conclude that the hospitals have the better of the argument.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start, as we always do, with the statutory language\xe2\x80\x94here, a new definitional phrase piggy-backing on the one already existing.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan,\xe2\x80\x9d as just stated, initially \xe2\x80\x9cmean[t]\xe2\x80\x9d only \xe2\x80\x9ca plan established and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church.\xe2\x80\x9d  But subparagraph (C)(i) provides that the original definitional phrase will now \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\xe2\x80\x9d another\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca plan maintained by [a principal-purpose] organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  That use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\xe2\x80\x9d is not literal\xe2\x80\x94any more than when Congress says something like \xe2\x80\x9ca State \xe2\x80\x98includes\xe2\x80\x99 Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002(10).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Rather, it tells readers that a <i>different</i> type of plan should<i> </i>receive<i> </i>the same treatment (<i>i.e., </i>an exemption) as the type described in the old definition.  And those newly favored plans, once again, are simply those \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained by a principal-purpose organization\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of their origins.  In effect, Congress provided that the new phrase can stand in for the old one as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98church plan\xe2\x80\x99 means <b>\n                    a plan established and maintained by a church\n                </b> [a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization].\xe2\x80\x9d  The church-establishment condition thus drops out of the picture.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider the same point in the form of a simple logic problem, with paragraph (A) and subparagraph (C)(i) as its first two steps: </p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">Premise 1: A plan established and maintained by a church is an exempt church plan.</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">Premise 2: A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization.</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">Deduction: A plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization is an exempt church plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Or, as one court put the point without any of the ERISA terminology: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f A is exempt, and A includes C, then C is exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Overall </i>v.<i> Ascension</i>, 23 F.

Because Congress deemed the category of plans \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and maintained by a church\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\xe2\x80\x9d plans \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained by\xe2\x80\x9d principal-purpose organizations, those plans\xe2\x80\x94and <i>all</i> those plans\xe2\x80\x94are exempt from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Had Congress wanted, as the employees contend, to alter only the maintenance requirement, it had an easy way to do so\xe2\x80\x94differing by only two words from the language it chose, but with an altogether different meaning.  Suppose Congress had provided that \xe2\x80\x9ca plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by\xe2\x80\x9d a principal-purpose organization, leaving out the words \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and\xe2\x80\x9d from the first part of the sentence.  That amendment would have accomplished exactly what the employees argue Congress intended: The language, that is, would have enabled a principal-purpose organization to take on the maintenance of a \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan,\xe2\x80\x9d but left untouched the requirement that a church establish the plan in the first place.  But Congress did not adopt that ready alternative.  Instead, it added language whose most natural reading is to enable a plan \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained\xe2\x80\x9d by a principal-purpose organization to substitute for a plan both \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained\xe2\x80\x9d by a church.  That drafting decision indicates that Congress did not in fact want what the employees claim.  See, <i>e.g., Lozano</i> v. <i>Montoya Alvarez</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314) (When legislators did not adopt \xe2\x80\x9cobvious alternative\xe2\x80\x9d language, \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural implication is that they did not intend\xe2\x80\x9d the alternative).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A corollary to this point is that the employees\xe2\x80\x99 construction runs aground on the so-called surplusage canon\xe2\x80\x94the presumption that each word Congress uses is there for a reason.  See generally A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 174\xe2\x80\x93179 (2012).  As just explained, the employees urge us to read subparagraph (C)(i) as if it were missing the two words \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and.\xe2\x80\x9d  The employees themselves do not contest that point: They offer no account of what function that language would serve on their proposed interpretation.  See Brief for Respondents 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  In essence, the employees ask us to treat those words as stray marks on a page\xe2\x80\x94notations that Congress regrettably made but did not really intend.  Our practice, however, is to \xe2\x80\x9cgive effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362,\n404 (2000)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  And here, that means construing the words \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and\xe2\x80\x9d in subparagraph (C)(i) as removing, for plans run by principal-purpose organizations, paragraph (A)\xe2\x80\x99s church-establishment condition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The employees\xe2\x80\x99 primary argument to the contrary takes the form of a supposed interpretive principle: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a definition or rule has two criteria, and a further provision expressly modifies only one of them, that provision is understood to affect only the criterion it expands or modifies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 22.  Applied here, the employees explain, that principle requires us to read subparagraph (C)(i) as \xe2\x80\x9cmodify[ing] only the criterion\xe2\x80\x9d in paragraph (A) that \xe2\x80\x9cit expressly expands (\xe2\x80\x98maintained\xe2\x80\x99), while leaving the other criterion (\xe2\x80\x98established\xe2\x80\x99) unchanged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 14.  The employees cite no precedent or other authority to back up their proposed rule of construction, but they offer a thought-provoking hypothetical to demonstrate its good sense.  <i>Id.,</i> at 22.  Imagine, they say, that a statute provides free insurance to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who is disabled and a veteran,\xe2\x80\x9d and an amendment then states that \xe2\x80\x9ca person who is disabled and a veteran includes a person who served in the National Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting 810 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 181).<i> </i>Would a non-disabled member of the National Guard be entitled to the insurance benefit?  Surely not, the employees answer: All of us would understand the \xe2\x80\x9cincludes\xe2\x80\x9d provision to expand (or clarify) only the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cveteran\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94leaving unchanged the requirement of a disability.  And the same goes here, the employees claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But one good example does not a general rule make.  Consider a variant of the employees\xe2\x80\x99 hypothetical: A statute offers free insurance to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who enlisted and served in the active Armed Forces,\xe2\x80\x9d with a later amendment providing that \xe2\x80\x9ca person who enlisted and served in the active Armed Forces includes a person who served in the National Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Would a person who served in the National Guard be ineligible for benefits unless she had also enlisted in the active Armed Forces\xe2\x80\x94say, the regular Army or Navy?  Of course not.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Two hypotheticals with similar grammatical constructions, two different results.  In the employees\xe2\x80\x99 example, the mind rebels against reading the statute literally, in line with the logical and canonical principles described above.  In the variant, by contrast, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s literal meaning and its most natural meaning cohere: Satisfaction of the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s single eligibility criterion\xe2\x80\x94service in the National Guard\xe2\x80\x94is indeed enough.  What might account for that divergence?  And what does such an explanation suggest for ERISA?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two features of the employees\xe2\x80\x99 hypothetical, when taken in combination, make it effective.  First, the criteria there\xe2\x80\x94veteran-status and disability\xe2\x80\x94are relatively distinct from one another.  (Compare enlistment and service, which address similar matters and tend to travel in tandem, the one preceding the other.)  The more independent the specified variables, the more likely that they were designed to have standalone relevance.  Second and yet more crucial, the employees\xe2\x80\x99 example trades on our background understanding that a given interpretation is simply implausible\xe2\x80\x94that it could not possibly have been what Congress wanted.  Congress, we feel sure, would not have intended <i>all </i>National Guardsmen to get a benefit that is otherwise reserved for disabled veterans.  (Compare that to our sense of whether Congress would have meant to hinge benefits to Guardsmen on their enlistment in a different service.)  That sense of inconceivability does most of the work in the employees\xe2\x80\x99 example, urging readers to discard usual rules of interpreting text because they will lead to a \xe2\x80\x9cmust be wrong\xe2\x80\x9d outcome.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But subparagraph (C)(i) possesses neither of those characteristics.  For starters, the criteria at issue\xe2\x80\x94establishment and maintenance\xe2\x80\x94are not unrelated.  The former serves as a necessary precondition of the latter, and both describe an aspect of an entity\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with a benefit plan.  Indeed, for various purposes, ERISA treats the terms \xe2\x80\x9cestablish\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain\xe2\x80\x9d interchange-ably.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa71002(16)(B) (defining the \xe2\x80\x9csponsor\xe2\x80\x9d of a plan as the organization that \xe2\x80\x9cestablishe[s] or maintain[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the plan).  So an amendment altering the one requirement could naturally alter the other too.  What\xe2\x80\x99s more, nothing we know about the way ERISA is designed to operate makes that an utterly untenable result.  Whereas the disability condition is central to the statutory scheme in the employees\xe2\x80\x99 hypothetical, the church-establishment condition, taken on its own, has limited functional significance.  Establishment of a plan, after all, is a one-time, historical event; it is the entity <i>maintaining </i>the plan that has the primary ongoing responsibility (and potential liability) to plan participants.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 31; <i>Rose</i> v. <i>Long Island R.\xc2\xa0R. Pension Plan</i>, 828 F.\xc2\xa02d 910, 920 (CA2 1987), cert. denied,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 936 (1988)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he status of the entity which currently maintains a particular pension plan bears more relation to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goals in enacting ERISA and its various exemptions[\xc2\xa0] than does the status of the entity which established the plan\xe2\x80\x9d).  So removing the establishment condition for plans run by principal-purpose organizations has none of the contextual implausibility\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could not possibly have meant that\xe2\x80\x9d quality\xe2\x80\x94on which the employees\xe2\x80\x99 example principally rides.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the contrary, everything we can tell from extra-statutory sources about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in enacting subparagraph (C)(i) supports our reading of its text.  We say \xe2\x80\x9ceverything we can tell\xe2\x80\x9d because in fact we cannot tell all that much.  The legislative materials in these cases consist almost wholly of excerpts from committee hearings and scattered floor statements by individual lawmakers\xe2\x80\x94the sort of stuff we have called \xe2\x80\x9camong the least illuminating forms of legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>SW General, Inc.</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 16).  And even those lowly sources speak at best indirectly to the precise question here: None, that is, comments in so many words on whether subparagraph (C)(i) altered paragraph (A)\xe2\x80\x99s church-establishment condition.  Still, both the hospitals and the employees have constructed narratives from those bits and pieces about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s goals in amending paragraph (A).  And our review of their accounts\xe2\x80\x94the employees\xe2\x80\x99 nearly as much as the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94tends to confirm our conviction that plans maintained by principal-purpose organizations are eligible for ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d exemption, whatever their origins.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to the hospitals, Congress wanted to eliminate any distinction between churches and church-affiliated organizations under ERISA.  See Brief for Petition-ers 18, 33\xe2\x80\x9335.  The impetus behind the 1980 amend-ment, they claim, was an IRS decision holding that pension plans established by orders of Catholic Sisters (to benefit their hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 employees) did not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plans\xe2\x80\x9d because the orders were not \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying out [the Church\xe2\x80\x99s] religious<i> </i>functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  IRS General Counsel Memorandum No. 37266, 1977 WL 46200, *5 (Sept. 22, 1977).  Many religious groups protested that ruling, criticizing the IRS for \xe2\x80\x9cattempting to define what is and what is not [a] \xe2\x80\x98church\xe2\x80\x99 and how the mission of the church is to be carried out.\xe2\x80\x9d  125 Cong. Rec. 10054 (1979) (letter to Sen. Talmadge from the Lutheran Church\xe2\x80\x93Missouri Synod); see <i>id.,</i> at 10054\xe2\x80\x9310058 (similar letters).  And that anger, the hospitals maintain, was what prompted ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s amendment: Congress, they say, designed the new provision to ensure that, however categorized, all groups associated with church activities would receive comparable treatment.  See Brief for Petitioners 35.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If that is so, our construction of the text fits Congress\xe2\x80\x99s objective to a T.  A church-establishment requirement necessarily puts the IRS in the business of deciding just what a church is and is not\xe2\x80\x94for example (as in the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s ruling about the Sisters), whether a particular Catholic religious order should count as one.  And that requirement, by definition, disfavors plans created by church affiliates, as compared to those established by (whatever the IRS has decided are) churches.  It thus makes key to the \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d exemption the very line that, on the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 account, Congress intended to erase.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The employees tell a different story about the origins of subparagraph (C)(i)\xe2\x80\x94focusing on the pension boards that congregational denominations often used.  See Brief for Respondents 14, 38\xe2\x80\x9342; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>19\xe2\x80\x9322.  In line with their non-hierarchical nature, those denominations typically relied on separately incorporated local boards\xe2\x80\x94rather than entities integrated into a national church structure\xe2\x80\x94to administer benefits for their ministers and lay workers.  According to the employees, subparagraph (C)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s main goal was to bring those local pension boards within the church-plan exemption, so as to ensure that congregational and hierarchical churches would receive the same treatment.  In support of their view, the employees cite several floor statements in which the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors addressed that objective.  See Brief for Respondents 38.  Senator Talmadge, for example, stated that under the amendment, a \xe2\x80\x9cplan or program funded or administered through a pension board .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will be considered a church plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  124 Cong. Rec. 16523; see also 124 Cong. Rec. 12107 (remarks of Rep. Conable).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that account of subparagraph (C)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose cuts against, not in favor of, the employees\xe2\x80\x99 position.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 21 (accepting the employees\xe2\x80\x99 narrative, but arguing that it buttresses the opposite conclusion).  That is because, as hearing testimony disclosed, plans run by church-affiliated pension boards came in different varieties: Some were created by church congregations, but others were established by the boards themselves.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hearings on S. 1090 et\xc2\xa0al. before the Subcommittee on Private Pension Plans and Employee Fringe Benefits of the Senate Committee on Finance, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., 400\xe2\x80\x93401, 415\xe2\x80\x93417  (1979).  And still others were sufficiently old that their provenance could have become the subject of dispute.  See <i>id.,</i> at 411; 125 Cong. Rec. 10052 (remarks of Sen. Talmadge) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe average age of a church plan is at least 40 years\xe2\x80\x9d).  So keeping the church-establishment requirement would have prevented some plans run by pension boards\xe2\x80\x94the very entities the employees say Congress most wanted to benefit\xe2\x80\x94from qualifying as \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plans\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA.  No argument the employees have offered here supports that goal-defying (much less that text-defying) statutory construction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ERISA provides (1) that a \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d means a \xe2\x80\x9cplan established and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) that a \xe2\x80\x9cplan established and maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by a church\xe2\x80\x9d is to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[\xc2\xa0] a plan maintained by\xe2\x80\x9d a principal-purpose organization.  Under the best reading of the statute, a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization therefore qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of who established it.  We accordingly reverse the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The parties disputed the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 church ties in the courts below, see n.\xc2\xa02, <i>infra</i>, but we assume for purposes of this decision that the facts are as the hospitals describe them.

See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Respondents 7\xe2\x80\x938 (collecting cases and press reports of church plan failures).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion because I am persuaded that it correctly interprets the relevant statutory text.  But I am nonetheless troubled by the outcome of these cases.  As the majority acknowledges, <i>ante</i>, at 12, the available legislative history does not clearly endorse this result.  That silence gives me pause: The decision to exempt plans neither established nor maintained by a church could have the kind of broad effect that is usually thoroughly debated during the legislative process and thus recorded in the legislative record.  And to the extent that Congress acted to exempt plans established by orders of Catholic Sisters, see <i>ibid.</i>, it is not at all clear that Congress would take the same action today with respect to some of the largest health-care providers in the country.  Despite their relationship to churches, organizations such as petitioners operate for-profit subsidiaries, see Dignity Health and Subordinate Corporations, Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for Years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and Independent Auditors\xe2\x80\x99 Report, p. 50, https://emma.msrb.org/ES823341-ES646022-ES1041174.pdf (as last visited  June 1, 2017); employ thousands of employees, App. 774; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 16\xe2\x80\x9374, pp. 5a, 31a; earn billions of dollars in revenue, <i>ibid.</i>; and compete in the secular market with companies that must bear the cost of complying with ERISA.  These organizations thus bear little resemblance to those Congress considered when enacting the 1980 amendment to the church plan definition.  This current reality might prompt Congress to take a different path.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the end, I agree with the majority that the statutory text compels today\xe2\x80\x99s result.  Other provisions also impact the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d exemption.  Those provisions\xe2\x80\x94including the provisions governing which organizations qualify as principal  purpose organizations permitted to establish and maintain \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plans,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 6, n. 3\xe2\x80\x94need also be construed in line with their text and with a view toward effecting ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s broad remedial purposes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
