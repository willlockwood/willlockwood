One key provision is the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain \xe2\x80\x9cminimum essential\xe2\x80\x9d health insurance coverage.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A.  For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company.  Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a \xe2\x80\x9c[s]hared responsibility payment\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Government.  \xc2\xa75000A(b)(1).  The Act provides that this \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s taxes, and \xe2\x80\x9cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\xe2\x80\x9d as tax penalties.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75000A(c), (g)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion.  The current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396d(a).  The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover.  For example, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all.  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act increases federal funding to cover the States\xe2\x80\x99 costs in expanding Medicaid coverage.  \xc2\xa71396d(y)(1).  But if a State does not comply with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.  \xc2\xa71396c.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federation of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the individual mandate.  Finding the mandate severable from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act intact.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">\n\t\t\t\t648 F.\xc2\xa03d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar this suit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Anti-Injunction Act provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a), so that those subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund.  The present challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsibility payment from those who do not comply with the individual mandate.  But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as a \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Affordable Care Act describes the payment as a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d not a \xe2\x80\x9ctax.\xe2\x80\x9d  That label cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Constitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit.

The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent reflects this understanding: As expansive as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching \xe2\x80\x9cactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d  E.g., United States v. Lopez, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 549\n.  The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity.  It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConstruing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority.  Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.  Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do.  The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing.  They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it.  Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers.  The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9327.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s other reforms.  Each of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service to, a granted power.  E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope those who would otherwise be outside of it.  Even if the individual mandate is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s other reforms, such an expansion of federal power is not a \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d means for making those reforms effective.

But, for the reasons explained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.  It is therefore necessary to turn to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9clay and collect Taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01.  In pressing its taxing power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the mandate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cevery reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,\xe2\x80\x9d Hooper v. California, \n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648\n, the question is whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly possible\xe2\x80\x9d to interpret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22\n.

It does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax.  In answering that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Constantine, \n\n296 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9335.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax.  The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation.  Cf. Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., \n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20\n\xe2\x80\x9337.  None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance.  But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful.  Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS.  And Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice of language\xe2\x80\x94stating that individuals \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d obtain insurance or pay a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94does not require reading \xc2\xa75000A as punishing unlawful conduct.  It may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance.  See New York v. United States, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144\n\xe2\x80\x93174.  Pp.\xc2\xa035\xe2\x80\x9340.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl.\xc2\xa04.  A tax on going without health insurance is not like a capitation or other direct tax under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.

Congress may use this power to establish cooperative state-federal Spending Clause programs.  The legitimacy of Spending Clause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of such programs.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.\xe2\x80\x9d  New York v.

When Congress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressuring the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation runs counter to this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s system of federalism.

The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\xe2\x80\x99s overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.  The Government claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a modification of the existing program, and that this modification is permissible because Congress reserved the \xe2\x80\x9cright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\xe2\x80\x9d of Medicaid.  \xc2\xa71304.  But the expansion accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.  The original program was designed to cover medical services for particular categories of vulnerable individuals.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level.  A State could hardly anticipate that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reservation of the right to \xe2\x80\x9calter\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9camend\xe2\x80\x9d the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.

See \xc2\xa71303.  The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act are not affected.  Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether to participate in the Medicaid expansion.

But given the majority view, she agrees with The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in Part IV\xe2\x80\x93B that the Medicaid Act\xe2\x80\x99s severability clause, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71303, determines the appropriate remedy.  Because The Chief Justice finds the withholding\xe2\x80\x94not the granting\xe2\x80\x94of federal funds incompatible with the Spending Clause, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 extension of Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its willingness to participate.  Even absent \xc2\xa71303\xe2\x80\x99s command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down the ACA in its entirety.

We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies.  That judgment is entrusted to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s elected leaders.  We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain the remainder.  Nearly two centuries ago, Chief Justice Marshall observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question respecting the extent of the powers actually granted\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9cis perpetually arising, and will probably continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  In this case we must again determine whether the Constitution grants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many States and individuals believe it does not possess.  Resolving this controversy requires us to examine both the limits of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power, and our own limited role in policing those boundaries.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9cis acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That is, rather than granting general authority to perform all the conceiv-able functions of government, the Constitution lists, or enumerates, the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s powers.  Congress may, for example, \xe2\x80\x9ccoin Money,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cestablish Post Offices,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9craise and support Armies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cls.\xc2\xa05, 7, 12.  The enumeration of powers is also a limitation of pow- ers, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he enumeration presupposes something not enumerated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824).  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s express conferral of some powers makes clear that it does not grant others.  And the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9ccan exercise only the powers granted to it.\xe2\x80\x9d  McCulloch, supra, at 405.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday, the restrictions on government power foremost in many Americans\xe2\x80\x99 minds are likely to be affirmative pro-hibitions, such as contained in the Bill of Rights.  These affirmative prohibitions come into play, however, only where the Government possesses authority to act in the first place.  If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it would not violate any of the express prohibitions in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the Constitution did not initially include a Bill of Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enu-meration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government.  As Alexander Hamilton put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No.\xc2\xa084, p.\xc2\xa0515 (C. Ros-siter ed. 1961).  And when the Bill of Rights was ratified, it made express what the enumeration of powers necessarily implied: \xe2\x80\x9cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt.\xc2\xa010.  The Federal Government has expanded dramatically over the past two centuries, but it still must show that a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions.  See, e.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same does not apply to the States, because the Con-stitution is not the source of their power.  The Consti-tution may restrict state governments\xe2\x80\x94as it does, for example, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal protection of the laws.  But where such prohibitions do not apply, state governments do not need constitutional au-thorization to act.  The States thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government\xe2\x80\x94punishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning property for development, to name but a few\xe2\x80\x94even though the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text does not authorize any government to do so.  Our cases refer to this general power of governing, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Government, as the \xe2\x80\x9cpolice power.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598\n\xe2\x80\x93619 (2000).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cState sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.\xe2\x80\x9d  New York v. United States, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144, \n181 (1992)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the police power is controlled by 50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the facets of governing that touch on citizens\xe2\x80\x99 daily lives are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed.  The Framers thus ensured that powers which \xe2\x80\x9cin the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people\xe2\x80\x9d were held by governments more local and more accountable than a dis- tant federal bureaucracy.  The Federalist No.\xc2\xa045, at 293 (J. Madison).  The independent power of the States also serves as a check on the power of the Federal Government: \xe2\x80\x9cBy denying any one government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bond v. United States, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case concerns two powers that the Constitution does grant the Federal Government, but which must be read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority akin to the police power.  The Constitution authorizes Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.  Our precedents read that to mean that Congress may regulate \xe2\x80\x9cthe channels of interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpersons or things in interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthose activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The power over activities that substantially affect interstate commerce can be expansive.  That power has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem-ingly local matters as a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grow wheat for himself and his livestock, and a loan shark\xe2\x80\x99s extor-tionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop. See Wickard v. Filburn, \n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111 (1942)\n; Perez v. United States, \n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146 (1971)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress may also \xe2\x80\x9clay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01.  Put simply, Congress may tax and spend.  This grant gives the Federal Government considerable influence even in areas where it cannot directly regulate.  The Federal Government may enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid, or otherwise control.  See, e.g., License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 471 (1867).  And in exercising its spending power, Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition those offers on compliance with specified conditions.  See, e.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 666, \n686 (1999)\n.  These offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government itself could not impose.  See, e.g., South Dakota v. Dole, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203\n\xe2\x80\x93206 (1987) (conditioning federal highway funds on States raising their drinking age to 21).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reach of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.  We have long read this provision to give Congress great latitude in exercising its powers: \xe2\x80\x9cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur permissive reading of these powers is explained in part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s elected leaders.  \xe2\x80\x9cProper respect for a co-ordinate branch of the government\xe2\x80\x9d requires that we strike down an Act of Congress only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe lack of constitutional authority to pass [the] act in question is clearly demonstrated.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Harris, \n\n106 U.\xc2\xa0S. 629, \n635 (1883)\n.  Members of this Court are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments.  Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.  It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur deference in matters of policy cannot, however, become abdication in matters of law.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those lim- its may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.\xe2\x80\x9d  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).  Our respect for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s policy judgments thus can never extend so far as to disavow restraints on federal power that the Constitution carefully constructed.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe peculiar circumstances of the moment may render a measure more or less wise, but cannot render it more or less constitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chief Justice John Marshall, A Friend of the Constitution No.\xc2\xa0V, Alexandria Gazette, July 5, 1819, in John Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s Defense of McCulloch v. Maryland 190\xe2\x80\x93191 (G. Gunther ed. 1969).  And there can be no question that it is the responsibility of this Court to enforce the limits on federal power by striking down acts of Congress that transgress those limits.  Marbury v. Madison, supra, at 175\xe2\x80\x93176.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe questions before us must be considered against the background of these basic principles.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n\n124Stat.\n119.  The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health in-surance and decrease the cost of health care.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s 10 titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of provisions.  This case concerns constitutional challenges to two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe individual mandate requires most Americans to maintain \xe2\x80\x9cminimum essential\xe2\x80\x9d health insurance coverage.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A.  The mandate does not apply to some individuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.  \xc2\xa75000A(d).  Many individuals will receive the required cov-erage through their employer, or from a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare.  See \xc2\xa75000A(f).  But for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive health insurance through a third party, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBeginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a \xe2\x80\x9c[s]hared responsibility payment\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Government.  \xc2\xa75000A(b)(1).  That payment, which the Act describes as a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d is calculated as a percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for qualifying private health insurance.  \xc2\xa75000A(c).  In 2016, for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ-ual\xe2\x80\x99s household income, but no less than $695 and no more than the average yearly premium for insurance that covers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g., prescription drugs and hospitalization).  Ibid.; \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718022.  The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s taxes, and \xe2\x80\x9cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\xe2\x80\x9d as tax penalties, such as the penalty for claiming too large an income tax refund.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(g)(1).  The Act, however, bars the IRS from using several of its normal enforcement tools, such as criminal prosecutions and levies.  \xc2\xa75000A(g)(2).  And some individuals who are subject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the penalty\xe2\x80\x94for example, those with income below a certain threshold and members of Indian tribes.  \xc2\xa75000A(e).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the day the President signed the Act into law, Florida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida.  Those plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94who are both respondents and petitioners here, depending on the issue\xe2\x80\x94were subsequently joined by 13 more States, several individuals, and the National Fed-eration of Independent Business.  The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the individual mandate provisions of the Act exceeded Congress\xe2\x80\x99s powers under Article I of the Constitution.  The District Court agreed, holding that Congress lacked constitutional power to enact the individual mandate.  780 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1256 (ND Fla. 2011).  The District Court determined that the individual mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the Act, and therefore struck down the Act in its entirety.  Id., at 1305\xe2\x80\x931306.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The court affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the individual mandate exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power.  648 F.\xc2\xa03d 1235 (2011).  The panel unanimously agreed that the individual mandate did not impose a tax, and thus could not be authorized by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9clay and collect Taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01.  A majority also held that the individual mandate was not supported by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., cl.\xc2\xa03.  According to the majority, the Commerce Clause does not empower the Federal Government to order individuals to engage in commerce, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to cast the individual mandate in a different light were unpersuasive.  Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear effect on interstate commerce.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving held the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, the majority examined whether that provision could be severed from the remainder of the Act.  The ma-jority determined that, contrary to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, it could.  The court thus struck down only the individual mandate, leaving the Act\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions intact.  648 F. 3d, at 1328.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to the individual mandate.  The Sixth Circuit and the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s commerce power.  See Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F.\xc2\xa03d 529 (CA6 2011); Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (CADC 2011).  The Fourth Circuit determined that the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from considering the merits of that question.  See Liberty Univ., Inc. v. Geithner, 671 F.\xc2\xa03d 391 (2011).  That statute bars suits \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a).  A majority of the Fourth Circuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate\xe2\x80\x99s penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction Act, because it is a financial assessment collected by the IRS through the normal means of taxation.  The majority therefore determined that the plaintiffs could not challenge the individual mandate until after they paid the penalty.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly challenged here is the Medicaid expansion.  Enacted in 1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396a(a)(10).  In order to receive that funding, States must comply with federal criteria governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost.  By 1982 every State had chosen to participate in Medicaid.  Federal funds received through the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of state budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most States\xe2\x80\x99 total revenue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover.  For example, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all.  See \xc2\xa71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act increases federal funding to cover the States\xe2\x80\x99 costs in expanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a portion of the costs on their own.  \xc2\xa71396d(y)(1).  If a State does not comply with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.  See \xc2\xa71396c.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlong with their challenge to the individual mandate, the state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional powers.  The Court of Appeals unanimously held that the Medicaid expansion is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Spending Clause.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01.  And the court rejected the States\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the threatened loss of all federal Medicaid funding violates the \n \nTenth Amendment by coercing them into complying with the Medicaid expansion.  648 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1264, 1268.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with respect to both the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.  565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  Because no party supports the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the individual mandate can be completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that aspect of the judgment below.  And because there is a reasonable argument that the Anti-Injunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ-ual mandate, but no party supports that proposition, we appointed an amicus curiae to advance it.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have the authority to do so.  The Anti-Injunction Act provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the per- son against whom such tax was assessed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a).  This statute protects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to collect a consistent stream of revenue, by barring litigation to enjoin or otherwise obstruct the collection of taxes.  Because of the Anti-Injunction Act, taxes can ordinarily be challenged only after they are paid, by suing for a refund.  See Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Nav. Co., \n\n370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x938 (1962).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s individual mandate first becomes enforceable in 2014.  The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to restrain the penalty\xe2\x80\x99s future collection.  Amicus contends that the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a tax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this suit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.  The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77421(a) (emphasis added).  Congress, however, chose to describe the \xe2\x80\x9c[s]hared responsibility payment\xe2\x80\x9d imposed on those who forgo health insurance not as a \xe2\x80\x9ctax,\xe2\x80\x9d but as a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75000A(b), (g)(2).  There is no immediate reason to think that a statute applying to \xe2\x80\x9cany tax\xe2\x80\x9d would apply to a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to label this exaction a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d is significant because the Affordable Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Thomas More, 651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 551.  Where Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute and different language in another, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally.  See Russello v. United States, \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16, \n23 (1983)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmicus argues that even though Congress did not label the shared responsibility payment a tax, we should treat it as such under the Anti-Injunction Act because it functions like a tax.  It is true that Congress cannot change whether an exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur-poses simply by describing it as one or the other.  Congress may not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing Clause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s constraint on criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial pun-ishment a \xe2\x80\x9ctax.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., \n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20\n\xe2\x80\x9337 (1922); Department of Revenue of Mont. v.

How they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent is the statutory text.  We have thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily described \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes\xe2\x80\x9d even where that label was inaccurate.  See Bailey v. George, \n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16 (1922)\n (Anti-Injunction Act applies to \xe2\x80\x9cChild Labor Tax\xe2\x80\x9d struck down as exceeding Congress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress can, of course, describe something as a penalty but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  For example, \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76671(a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany reference in this title to \xe2\x80\x98tax\xe2\x80\x99 imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the penalties and liabilities provided by\xe2\x80\x9d subchapter 68B of the Internal Revenue Code.  Penalties in subchapter 68B are thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes the Anti-Injunction Act.  The individual mandate, however, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code.  Nor does any other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26 shall also be \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed\xe2\x80\x9d to apply to the individual mandate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmicus attempts to show that Congress did render the Anti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate, albeit by a more circuitous route.  Section 5000A(g)(1) spec-ifies that the penalty for not complying with the man- date \xe2\x80\x9cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter 68.\xe2\x80\x9d  Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76671(a).  According to amicus, by directing that the penalty be \xe2\x80\x9cassessed and collected in the same man-ner as taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa75000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act applicable to this penalty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government disagrees.  It argues that \xc2\xa75000A(g)(1) does not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act, because \xc2\xa75000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of the Treasury to use the same \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98methodology and procedures\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.

As it observes, \xe2\x80\x9cAssessment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCollection\xe2\x80\x9d are chapters of the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author-ity to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying the means by which he shall do so.  See \xc2\xa76201 (assess-ment authority); \xc2\xa76301 (collection authority).  Section 5000A(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s command that the penalty be \xe2\x80\x9cassessed and collected in the same manner\xe2\x80\x9d as taxes is best read as referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.  That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of \xc2\xa75000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he may use to collect the penalty.  See \xc2\xa75000A(g)(2)(A) (barring criminal prosecutions); \xc2\xa75000A(g)(2)(B) (prohibiting the Secretary from using notices of lien and levies).  The Anti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the procedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmicus argues in the alternative that a different section of the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the penalty as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act.  Section 6201(a) authorizes the Secretary to make \xe2\x80\x9cassessments of all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties).\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Amicus contends that the penalty must be a tax, because it is an assessable penalty and \xc2\xa76201(a) says that taxes include assessable penalties.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat argument has force only if \xc2\xa76201(a) is read in isolation.  The Code contains many provisions treating taxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7860(h)(1), 6324A(a), 6601(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), 6602, 7122(b).  There would, for example, be no need for \xc2\xa76671(a) to deem \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code al- ready included all such penalties in the term \xe2\x80\x9ctax.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, amicus\xe2\x80\x99s earlier observation that the Code requires assessable penalties to be assessed and collected \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner as taxes\xe2\x80\x9d makes little sense if assessable penalties are themselves taxes.  In light of the Code\xe2\x80\x99s consistent distinction between the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassessable penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d we must accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s in-terpretation: \xc2\xa76201(a) instructs the Secretary that his authority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess penalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to taxes for other purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Affordable Care Act does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this suit, and we may proceed to the merits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact the individual mandate.  First, the Government argues that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under the Commerce Clause.  Under that theory, Congress may order individuals to buy health insurance because the failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could un-dercut the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s other reforms.  Second, the Government argues that if the commerce power does not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it as an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax.  According to the Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so, and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s first argument is that the individual mandate is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  According to the Government, the health care market is characterized by a significant cost-shifting problem.  Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insurance, they often will not be able to pay for it.  Because state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to provide a certain degree of care to individuals without regard to their ability to pay, see, e.g., \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71395dd; Fla. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7395.1041, hospitals end up receiving compensation for only a portion of the services they provide.  To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to insurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher premiums.  Congress estimated that the cost of uncompensated care raises family health insurance premiums, on average, by over $1,000 per year.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(F).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the problem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions or other health issues.  It did so through the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed-issue\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity- rating\xe2\x80\x9d provisions.  These provisions together prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to those with such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher premiums than healthy individuals.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300gg, 300gg\xe2\x80\x931, 300gg\xe2\x80\x933, 300gg\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do not, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health care needs.  In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that problem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay purchasing health insurance until they become sick, relying on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.  The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay for their coverage.  This will lead insurers to significantly increase premiums on everyone.  See Brief for America\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Plans et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93393 etc. 8\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe individual mandate was Congress\xe2\x80\x99s solution to these problems.  By requiring that individuals purchase health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by those who would otherwise go without it.  In addition, the mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher than their health care expenses.  This allows insurers to subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals the reforms require them to accept.  The Government claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government contends that the individual mandate is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power because the failure to pur-chase insurance \xe2\x80\x9chas a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d by creating the cost-shifting prob-lem.

Lopez, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 549\n\xe2\x80\x93559 (1995), but it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause.  We have recognized, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states,\xe2\x80\x9d but extends to activities that \xe2\x80\x9chave a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Darby, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 100\n\xe2\x80\x93119 (1941).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power, more-over, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends to activities that do so only when aggregated with similar activities of others.

The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.  If the power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate\xe2\x80\x9d something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous.  For example, the Constitution gives Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9ccoin Money,\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to the power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate the Value thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., cl.\xc2\xa05.  And it gives Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9craise and support Armies\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide and maintain a Navy,\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to the power to \xe2\x80\x9cmake Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., cls.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.  If the power to regulate the armed forces or the value of money included the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence, the specific grant of such powers would have been unnecessary.  The language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated.  See Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 188 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he enlightened patriots who framed our constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur precedent also reflects this understanding.  As expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: They uniformly describe the power as reaching \xe2\x80\x9cactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them.  See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at 560 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained\xe2\x80\x9d); Perez, 402 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 154 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted)); Wickard, supra, at 125 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if appellee\xe2\x80\x99s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d); NLRB v.

It instead compels individ-uals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.  Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Con-gress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast do-main to congressional authority.  Every day individuals do not do an infinite number of things.  In some cases they decide not to do something; in others they simply fail to do it.  Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring countless decisions an individual could potentially make within the scope of federal regulation, and\xe2\x80\x94under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory\xe2\x80\x94empower Congress to make those decisions for him.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying the Government\xe2\x80\x99s logic to the familiar case of Wickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry us from the notion of a government of limited powers.  In Wickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im-posed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption on his own farm.  317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114\xe2\x80\x93115, 128\xe2\x80\x93129.  That amount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota under a program designed to support the price of wheat by limiting supply.  The Court rejected the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s argument that growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the reach of the commerce power.  It did so on the ground that the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grow wheat for his own use allowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market.  That decision, when considered in the aggregate along with sim-ilar decisions of others, would have had a substantial ef-fect on the interstate market for wheat.  Id., at 127\xe2\x80\x93129.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWickard has long been regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 560, but the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory in this case would go much further.  Under Wickard it is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to regulate the market for wheat by supporting its price.  But price can be supported by increasing demand as well as by decreasing supply.  The aggregated decisions of some consumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect on the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase health insurance have on the price of insurance.  Congress can therefore command that those not buying wheat do so, just as it argues here that it may command that those not buying health insurance do so.  The farmer in Wickard was at least actively engaged in the production of wheat, and the Government could regulate that activity because of its effect on commerce.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory here would effectively override that limitation, by establishing that individuals may be regulated under the Commerce Clause whenever enough of them are not doing something the Government would have them do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s logic would justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem.  See Seven-Sky, 661 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (noting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify any mandate to purchase a product or ser- vice in interstate commerce that would be unconstitu-tional\xe2\x80\x9d under its theory of the commerce power).  To consider a different example in the health care market, many Americans do not eat a balanced diet.  That group makes up a larger percentage of the total population than those without health insurance.  See, e.g., Dept. of Agriculture and Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dietary Guidelines for Americans 1 (2010).  The failure of that group to have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a greater extent than the failure of the uninsured to purchase insurance.  See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, &amp; Dietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity: Payer- and Service-Specific Estimates, 28 Health Affairs w822 (2009) (detailing the \xe2\x80\x9cundeniable link between ris-ing rates of obesity and rising medical spending,\xe2\x80\x9d and esti-mating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe annual medical burden of obesity has risen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and could amount to $147 billion per year in 2008\xe2\x80\x9d).  Those in-creased costs are borne in part by other Americans who must pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the insured.  See Center for Applied Ethics, Voluntary Health Risks: Who Should Pay?, 6 Issues in Ethics 6 (1993) (noting \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence that individuals with unhealthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated with their behaviors; most of the expense is borne by the rest of society in the form of higher insurance premiums, government expenditures for health care, and disability benefits\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress addressed the insurance problem by ordering everyone to buy insurance.  Under the Gov-ernment\xe2\x80\x99s theory, Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables.  See Dietary Guidelines, supra, at 19 (\xe2\x80\x9cImproved nutrition, appropriate eating behaviors, and increased physical activity have tre-mendous potential to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reduce health care costs\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPeople, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things that would be good for them or good for society.  Those failures\xe2\x80\x94joined with the similar failures of others\xe2\x80\x94can readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s logic, that authorizes Congress to use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the Government would have them act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is not the country the Framers of our Constitution envisioned.  James Madison explained that the Commerce Clause was \xe2\x80\x9can addition which few oppose and from which no apprehensions are entertained.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No.\xc2\xa045, at 293.  While Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the Commerce Clause has of course expanded with the growth of the national economy, our cases have \xe2\x80\x9calways recognized that the power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Maryland v. Wirtz, \n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 183, \n196 (1968)\n.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory would erode those limits, permitting Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its authority, \xe2\x80\x9ceverywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No.\xc2\xa048, at 309 (J. Madison).  Congress already enjoys vast power to regulate much of what we do.  Accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory would give Congress the same license to regulate what we do not do, fundamentally changing the relation between the citizen and the Federal Government.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic effects on commerce.  But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the Framers, who were \xe2\x80\x9cpractical statesmen,\xe2\x80\x9d not metaphysical philosophers.  Industrial Union Dept., AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, \n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 607, \n673 (1980)\n (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  As we have ex-plained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe framers of the Constitution were not mere visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but practical men, dealing with the facts of political life as they understood them, putting into form the government they were creating, and prescribing in language clear and intelligible the powers that government was to take.\xe2\x80\x9d  South Carolina v. United States, \n\n199 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, \n449 (1905)\n.  The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it, and for over 200 years both our decisions and Congress\xe2\x80\x99s actions have reflected this understanding.  There is no reason to depart from that understanding now.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government sees things differently.  It argues that because sickness and injury are unpredictable but unavoidable, \xe2\x80\x9cthe uninsured as a class are active in the market for health care, which they regularly seek and obtain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 50.  The individual mandate \xe2\x80\x9cmerely regulates how individuals finance and pay for that active participation\xe2\x80\x94requiring that they do so through insurance, rather than through attempted self-insurance with the back-stop of shifting costs to others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government repeats the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cactive in the market for health care\xe2\x80\x9d throughout its brief, see id., at 7, 18, 34, 50, but that concept has no constitutional significance.  An individual who bought a car two years ago and may buy another in the future is not \xe2\x80\x9cactive in the car market\xe2\x80\x9d in any pertinent sense.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cactive in the market\xe2\x80\x9d cannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by the individual mandate are not currently engaged in any commercial activity involving health care, and that fact is fatal to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s effort to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate the uninsured as a class.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 42.

Raich, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n17 (2005)\n (emphasis added), not classes of individuals, apart from any activity in which they are engaged, see, e.g., Perez, 402 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 153 (\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in \xe2\x80\x98extortionate credit transactions\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe individual mandate\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of the uninsured as a class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to existing commercial activity.  The mandate primarily affects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to need significant health care and have other priorities for spending their money.  It is precisely because these individuals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health care costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of forcing insurance companies to cover others who impose greater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(I) (recognizing that the mandate would \xe2\x80\x9cbroaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums\xe2\x80\x9d).

Asserting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government argues that because \xe2\x80\x9c[e]veryone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market,\xe2\x80\x9d they can be \xe2\x80\x9cregulated in advance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 109 (Mar. 27, 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future ac-tivity finds no support in our precedent.  We have said that Congress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco-nomic activity.  See, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, \n\n305 U.\xc2\xa0S. 197 (1938)\n (regulating the labor practices of  utility companies); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

McClung, \n\n379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 294 (1964)\n (prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners).  But we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that activity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently engaged in commerce.  Each one of our cases, including those cited by Justice Ginsburg, post, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, involved preexisting economic activity.  See, e.g., Wickard, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 127\xe2\x80\x93129 (producing wheat); Raich, supra, at 25 (growing marijuana).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEveryone will likely participate in the markets for food, clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today.  The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions.  Any police power to regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities, remains vested in the States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government argues that the individual mandate can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because health insurance is a unique product.  According to the Government, upholding the individual mandate would not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or broccoli because, as the Government puts it, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ealth in-surance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for United States 19.

But that does not mean the compelled purchase of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the second.  No matter how \xe2\x80\x9cinherently integrated\xe2\x80\x9d health insurance and health care consumption may be, they are not the same thing: They involve different transactions, entered into at different times, with different providers.  And for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant health care needs will be years, or even decades, away.  The proximity and degree of connection between the mandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lack-ing to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Gov- ernment.  The individual mandate forces individuals into commerce precisely because they elected to refrain from commercial activity.  Such a law cannot be sus- tained under a clause authorizing Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government next contends that Congress has the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the individual mandate because the mandate is an \xe2\x80\x9cintegral part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the guaranteed-issue and community-rating insurance reforms.

No longer would Congress be limited to regulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some preexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of federal regulation.  Instead, Congress could reach beyond the natural limit of its authority and draw within its regulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of it.  Even if the individual mandate is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal power is not a \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d means for making those reforms effective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government relies primarily on our decision in Gonzales v. Raich.  In Raich, we considered \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market\xe2\x80\x9d in marijuana.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 22.  Certain individuals sought an exemption from that regulation on the ground that they engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.  We denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana is a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could be readily diverted into the interstate market.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana would therefore have been substantially undercut if it could not also regulate intrastate possession and consumption.  Id., at 19.  Accordingly, we recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress was acting well within its authority\xe2\x80\x9d under the Necessary and Proper Clause even though its \xe2\x80\x9cregulation ensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 22; see also Perez, 402 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 154.  Raich thus did not involve the exercise of any \xe2\x80\x9cgreat substantive and independent power,\xe2\x80\x9d McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.  Instead, it concerned only the constitutionality of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJust as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d component of the insurance re-forms.  The commerce power thus does not authorize the mandate.  Accord, post, at 4\xe2\x80\x9316 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is not the end of the matter.  Because the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it is necessary to turn to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s second argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated power to \xe2\x80\x9clay and collect Taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s tax power argument asks us to view the statute differently than we did in considering its commerce power theory.  In making its Commerce Clause argument, the Government defended the mandate as a regulation requiring individuals to purchase health in-surance.  The Government does not claim that the taxing power allows Congress to issue such a command.  Instead, the Government asks us to read the mandate not as ordering individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text of a statute can sometimes have more than one possible meaning.  To take a familiar example, a law that reads \xe2\x80\x9cno vehicles in the park\xe2\x80\x9d might, or might not, ban bicycles in the park.  And it is well established that if a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that does not do so.  Justice Story said that 180 years ago: \xe2\x80\x9cNo court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448\xe2\x80\x93449 (1830).  Justice Holmes made the same point a century later: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blodgett v. Holden, \n\n275 U.\xc2\xa0S. 142, \n148 (1927)\n (concurring opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe most straightforward reading of the mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.  After all, it states that individuals \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d maintain health insurance.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(a).  Congress thought it could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause, and the Government primarily defended the law on that basis.  But, for the reasons explained above, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.  Under our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternative reading of the statute\xe2\x80\x94that it only imposes a tax on those without insurance\xe2\x80\x94is a reasonable one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the mandate, if an individual does not maintain health insurance, the only consequence is that he must make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his taxes.  See \xc2\xa75000A(b).  That, according to the Government, means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition\xe2\x80\x94not owning health insurance\xe2\x80\x94that triggers a tax\xe2\x80\x94the required payment to the IRS.  Under that theory, the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.  Rather, it makes going without insurance just another thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earning income.  And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it may be within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional power to tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t The question is not whether that is the most natural interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a \xe2\x80\x9cfairly possible\xe2\x80\x9d one.  Crowell v. Benson, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22, \n62 (1932)\n.  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cevery reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hooper v. California, \n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648, \n657 (1895)\n.  The Government asks us to interpret the mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate the Constitution.  Granting the Act the full measure of deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for the reasons set forth below.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects.  The \xe2\x80\x9c[s]hared responsibility payment,\xe2\x80\x9d as the statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d when they file their tax returns.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(b).  It does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their household income is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue Code.  \xc2\xa75000A(e)(2).  For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4).  The requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which\xe2\x80\x94as we previously explained\xe2\x80\x94must assess and collect it \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner as taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supra, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  This process yields the essential feature of any tax: it produces at least some revenue for the Government.  United States v. Kahriger, \n\n345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22\n, n.\xc2\xa04 (1953).  Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion per year by 2017.  Congressional Budget Office, Payments of Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Apr. 30, 2010), in Selected CBO Publications Related to Health Care Legislation, 2009\xe2\x80\x932010, p.\xc2\xa071 (rev. 2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is of course true that the Act describes the payment as a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d not a \xe2\x80\x9ctax.\xe2\x80\x9d  But while that label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act, supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, it does not determine whether the payment may be viewed as an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing power.  It is up to Con-gress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice of label on that question.  That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional power to tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two challenges to the \xe2\x80\x9cChild Labor Tax\xe2\x80\x9d on the same day.  In the first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so-called tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act.  George, 259 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20.  Congress knew that suits to obstruct taxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction Act; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress therefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply.  In the second case, however, we held that the same exaction, although labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Con-gress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing power.  Drexel Furniture, 259 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  That constitutional question was not controlled by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice of label.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes nonetheless were authorized by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax.  In the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets\xe2\x80\x94for which the licensee had to pay a fee\xe2\x80\x94could be sustained as exercises of the taxing power.  5 Wall., at 471.  And in New York v. United States we upheld as a tax a \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d on out-of-state nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was paid to the Federal Treasury.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 171.  We thus ask whether the shared responsibility payment falls within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing power, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isregarding the designa-tion of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

For example, in Drexel Furniture, we focused on three practical characteristics of the so-called tax on employing child laborers that convinced us the \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d was actually a penalty.  First, the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy burden\xe2\x80\x9410 percent of a company\xe2\x80\x99s net income\xe2\x80\x94on those who employed children, no matter how small their infraction.  Second, it imposed that exaction only on those who knowingly employed underage laborers.  Such scienter require-ments are typical of punitive statutes, because Congress often wishes to punish only those who intentionally break the law.  Third, this \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d was enforced in part by the Department of Labor, an agency responsible for pun-ishing violations of labor laws, not collecting revenue.  259 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36\xe2\x80\x9337; see also, e.g., Kurth Ranch, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 780\xe2\x80\x93782 (considering, inter alia, the amount of the exaction, and the fact that it was imposed for violation of a separate criminal law); Constantine, supra, at 295 (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same analysis here suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax, not a penalty: First, for most Americans the amount due will be far less than the price of insurance, and, by statute, it can never be more.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It may often be a reasonable financial decision to make the payment rather than purchase insurance, unlike the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitory\xe2\x80\x9d financial punishment in Drexel Furniture.  259 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 37.  Second, the individual mandate contains no scienter requirement.  Third, the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation\xe2\x80\x94except that the Service is not allowed to use those means most suggestive of a punitive sanction, such as criminal prosecution.  See \xc2\xa75000A(g)(2).  The reasons the Court in Drexel Furniture held that what was called a \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d there was a penalty support the conclusion that what is called a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d here may be viewed as a tax.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNone of this is to say that the payment is not intended to affect individual conduct.  Although the payment will raise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to expand health insurance coverage.  But taxes that seek to influence conduct are nothing new.  Some of our earliest federal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of domestic industry.  See W. Brownlee, Federal Taxation in America 22 (2d ed. 2004); cf. 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa7962, p.\xc2\xa0434 (1833) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe taxing power is often, very often, applied for other purposes, than revenue\xe2\x80\x9d).  Today, federal and state taxes can compose more than half the retail price of cigarettes, not just to raise more money, but to encourage people to quit smoking.  And we have upheld such obviously regulatory measures as taxes on selling marijuana and sawed-off shotguns.  See United States v. Sanchez, \n\n340 U.\xc2\xa0S. 42\n\xe2\x80\x9345 (1950); Sonzinsky v. United States, \n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506, \n513 (1937)\n.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very tax is in some measure regula-tory.  To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sonzinsky, supra, at 513.  That \xc2\xa75000A seeks to shape decisions about whether to buy health insurance does not mean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn distinguishing penalties from taxes, this Court has explained that \xe2\x80\x9cif the concept of penalty means anything, it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Reorganized CF&amp;I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213, \n224 (1996)\n; see also United States v. La Franca, \n\n282 U.\xc2\xa0S. 568, \n572 (1931)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] penalty, as the word is here used, is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act\xe2\x80\x9d).  While the individual mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health insurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful.  Neither the Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS.  The Government agrees with that reading, confirming that if someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insurance, they have fully complied with the law.  Brief for United States 60\xe2\x80\x9361; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (Mar. 26, 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance.  See Congressional Budget Office, supra, at 71.  We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful.  That Congress apparently regards such extensive failure to comply with the mandate as tolerable suggests that Congress did not think it was creating four million outlaws.  It suggests instead that the shared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citizens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health insurance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plaintiffs contend that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice of language\xe2\x80\x94stating that individuals \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d obtain insurance or pay a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94requires reading \xc2\xa75000A as punishing unlawful conduct, even if that interpretation would ren-der the law unconstitutional.  We have rejected a similar argument before.  In New York v. United States we examined a statute providing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the disposal of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. low-level radioactive waste.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 169 (quoting \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72021c(a)(1)(A)).  A State that shipped its waste to another State was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State, a portion of which would be paid over to the Federal Government.   And a State that did not adhere to the statutory scheme faced \xe2\x80\x9c[p]enalties for failure to comply,\xe2\x80\x9d including increases in the surcharge.  \xc2\xa72021e(e)(2); New York, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 152\xe2\x80\x93153.  New York urged us to read the statute as a federal command that the state legislature enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would have violated the Constitution.  To avoid that outcome, we interpreted the statute to impose only \xe2\x80\x9ca series of incentives\xe2\x80\x9d for the State to take responsibility for its waste.  We then sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government as an exercise of the taxing power.  Id., at 169\xe2\x80\x93174.  We see no insurmountable obstacle to a similar approach here.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe joint dissenters argue that we cannot uphold \xc2\xa75000A as a tax because Congress did not \xe2\x80\x9cframe\xe2\x80\x9d it as such.  Post, at 17.  In effect, they contend that even if the Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we interpret this statute to do, the law must be struck down because Congress used the wrong labels.  An example may help illustrate why labels should not control here.  Suppose Congress enacted a statute providing that every taxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient windows must pay $50 to the IRS.  The amount due is adjusted based on factors such as taxable income and joint filing status, and is paid along with the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s income tax return.  Those whose income is below the filing threshold need not pay.  The required payment is not called a \xe2\x80\x9ctax,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d or anything else.  No one would doubt that this law imposed a tax, and was within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax.  That conclusion should not change simply because Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the pay-ment.  Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mpos[e] a tax through judicial legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 25.  Rather, it would give practical effect to the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in \xc2\xa75000A under the taxing power, and that \xc2\xa75000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax.  That is sufficient to sustain it.  The \xe2\x80\x9cquestion of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress does not depend on recitals of the power which it undertakes to exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Woods v. Cloyd W.

That clause provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  This requirement means that any \xe2\x80\x9cdirect Tax\xe2\x80\x9d must be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to its population.  According to the plaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a direct tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress made no effort to apportion it among the States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was unclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as a \xe2\x80\x9chead tax\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpoll tax\xe2\x80\x9d), might be a direct tax.  See Springer v. United States, \n\n102 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586\n\xe2\x80\x93598 (1881).  Soon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on ownership of carriages, over James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s objection that it was an unapportioned direct tax.  Id., at 597.  This Court upheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such a tax would make little sense, because it would have required taxing carriage owners at dramatically different rates depending on how many carriages were in their home State.  See Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 174 (1796) (opinion of Chase, J.).  The Court was unanimous, and those Justices who wrote opinions either directly asserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of taxation were direct: capitations and land taxes.  See id., at 175; id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 183 (opinion of Iredell, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat narrow view of what a direct tax might be per-sisted for a century.  In 1880, for example, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cdirect taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are only capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument, and taxes on real estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Springer, supra, at 602.  In 1895, we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on personal property and income from personal property, in the course of striking down aspects of the federal income tax.  Pollock v. Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Loan &amp; Trust Co., \n\n158 U.\xc2\xa0S. 601, \n618 (1895)\n.  That result was overturned by the \n \nSixteenth Amendment, although we continued to consider taxes on personal property to be direct taxes.  See Eisner v. Macom-ber, \n\n252 U.\xc2\xa0S. 189\n\xe2\x80\x93219 (1920).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA tax on going without health insurance does not fall within any recognized category of direct tax.  It is not a capitation.  Capitations are taxes paid by every person, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to property, profession, or any other circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hylton, supra, at 175 (opinion of Chase, J.) (emphasis altered).  The whole point of the shared responsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir-cumstances\xe2\x80\x94earning a certain amount of income but not obtaining health insurance.  The payment is also plainly not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.  The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax that must be apportioned among the several States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere may, however, be a more fundamental objection to a tax on those who lack health insurance.  Even if only a tax, the payment under \xc2\xa75000A(b) remains a burden that the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not an act.  If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause as authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain from commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThree considerations allay this concern.  First, and most importantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does not guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through inactivity.  A capitation, after all, is a tax that every- one must pay simply for existing, and capitations are expressly contemplated by the Constitution.  The Court today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we ab-stain from the regulated activity.  But from its creation, the Constitution has made no such promise with respect to taxes.  See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy (Nov. 13, 1789) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur new Constitution is now established .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhether the mandate can be upheld under the Commerce Clause is a question about the scope of federal authority.  Its answer depends on whether Congress can exercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of directing individuals to purchase insurance.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something is, by contrast, not new.  Tax incentives already promote, for example, purchasing homes and professional educations.  See 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7163(h), 25A.  Sustaining the mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchasing health insurance, not whether it can.  Upholding the individual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does not recognize any new federal power.  It determines that Congress has used an existing one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use its taxing power to influence conduct is not without limits.  A few of our cases policed these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive exactions obviously designed to regulate behavior otherwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority.  See, e.g., United States v. Butler, \n\n297 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1936)\n; Drexel Furniture, \n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20\n.  More often and more recently we have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive or effect of revenue-raising measures.  See Kahriger, 345 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 27\xe2\x80\x9331 (collecting cases).  We have nonetheless maintained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of regulation and punishment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Kurth Ranch, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 779 (quoting Drexel Furniture, supra, at 38).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have already explained that the shared responsibility payment\xe2\x80\x99s practical characteristics pass muster as a tax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing power.  Supra, at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  Because the tax at hand is within even those strict limits, we need not here decide the precise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive that the taxing power does not authorize it.  It remains true, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Texas Co., \n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 342, \n364 (1949)\n (quoting Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex\xc2\xa0rel. Knox, \n\n277 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n223 (1928)\n (Holmes, J., dissenting)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, although the breadth of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax is greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing power does not give Congress the same degree of control over individual behavior.  Once we recognize that Congress may regulate a particular decision under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full weight to bear.  Congress may simply command individ-uals to do as it directs.  An individual who disobeys may be subjected to criminal sanctions.  Those sanctions can include not only fines and imprisonment, but all the attendant consequences of being branded a criminal: deprivation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right to bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment opportunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other controversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the taxing power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money into the Federal Treasury, no more.  If a tax is properly paid, the Government has no power to compel or punish individuals subject to it.  We do not make light of the se-vere burden that taxation\xe2\x80\x94especially taxation motivated by a regulatory purpose\xe2\x80\x94can impose.  But imposition  of a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful choice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing to pay a tax levied on that choice.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that certain in-dividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax.  Be-cause the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Ginsburg questions the necessity of rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s commerce power argument, given that \xc2\xa75000A can be upheld under the taxing power.  Post, at 37.  But the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it.  It is only because the Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command that it is necessary to reach the taxing power question.  And it is only because we have a duty to construe a stat-ute to save it, if fairly possible, that \xc2\xa75000A can be interpreted as a tax.  Without deciding the Commerce Clause question, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving construction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance.  Section 5000A would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command.  The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.  Section 5000A is therefore constitutional, because it can reasonably be read as a tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe States also contend that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the Spending Clause.  They claim that Congress is coercing the States to adopt the changes it wants by threatening to withhold all of a State\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid grants, unless the State accepts the new expanded funding and complies with the conditions that come with it.  This, they argue, violates the basic principle that the \xe2\x80\x9cFederal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.\xe2\x80\x9d  New York, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 188.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid.

There is no mandatory coverage for most childless adults, and the States typically do not offer any such coverage.  The States also enjoy considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels for parents of needy families.  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(10)(A)(ii).  On average States cover only those unemployed parents who make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and only those employed parents who make less than 63 percent of the poverty line.  Kaiser Comm\xe2\x80\x99n on Medicaid and the Uninsured, Performing Under Pressure 11, and fig.\xc2\xa011 (2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in contrast, require States to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65 with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line.  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  The Act also establishes a new \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ssential health benefits\xe2\x80\x9d package, which States must provide to all new Medicaid recipients\xe2\x80\x94a level sufficient to satisfy a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under the individual man-date.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(k)(1), 1396u\xe2\x80\x937(b)(5), 18022(b).

Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01.  We have long recognized that Congress may use this power to grant federal funds to the States, and may condition such a grant upon the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctaking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take.\xe2\x80\x9d  College Savings Bank, 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 686.

Spending Clause legislation as \xe2\x80\x98much in the nature of a contract.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Barnes v. Gorman, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 181, \n186 (2002)\n (quoting Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n17 (1981)\n).  The legitimacy of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of the spending power \xe2\x80\x9cthus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the \xe2\x80\x98contract.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pennhurst, supra, at 17.  Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the status of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed-eral system.  That system \xe2\x80\x9crests on what might at first seem a counterintuitive insight, that \xe2\x80\x98freedom is enhanced by the creation of two governments, not one.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bond, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Alden v. Maine, \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 706, \n758 (1999)\n).  For this reason, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  New York, supra, at 162.  Otherwise the two-government system established by the Framers would give way to a system that vests power in one central government, and individual liberty would suffer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat insight has led this Court to strike down fed- eral legislation that commandeers a State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative or administrative apparatus for federal purposes.  See, e.g., Printz, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 933 (striking down federal legisla- tion compelling state law enforcement officers to perform federally mandated background checks on handgun purchasers); New York, supra, at 174\xe2\x80\x93175 (invalidating provisions of an Act that would compel a State to either take title to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste regulations).  It has also led us to scrutinize Spending Clause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using financial inducements to exert a \xe2\x80\x9cpower akin to undue influence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 548, \n590 (1937)\n.  Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies.  But when \xe2\x80\x9cpressure turns into compulsion,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.\xe2\x80\x9d  New York, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178.  That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPermitting the Federal Government to force the States to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regu-latory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 169.  Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds.  In such a situation, state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer.  But when the State has no choice, the Federal Government can achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in New York and Printz.  Indeed, this danger is heightened when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe addressed such concerns in Steward Machine.  That case involved a federal tax on employers that was abated if the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that met certain federally specified conditions.  An employer sued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly \xe2\x80\x9cdriv[ing] the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws at the bidding of the central government.\xe2\x80\x9d  301 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 587.  We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Government might employ its taxing power to exert a \xe2\x80\x9cpower akin to undue influence\xe2\x80\x9d upon the States.  Id., at 590.  But we observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and abatement program to channel money to the States that would otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for use in providing national unemployment services.  Congress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the money into state programs only on the condition that the money be used for the same purposes.  Predicating tax abatement on a State\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of a particular type of un-employment legislation was therefore a means to \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard [the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s] own treasury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 591.  We held that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn rejecting the argument that the federal law was a \xe2\x80\x9cweapon[\xc2\xa0] of coercion, destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court noted that there was no reason to suppose that the State in that case acted other than through \xe2\x80\x9cher unfettered will.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 586, 590.  Indeed, the State itself did \xe2\x80\x9cnot offer a suggestion that in passing the unemployment law she was affected by duress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 589.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress may attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and spending programs to preserve its control over the use of federal funds.  In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives by adopting \xe2\x80\x9cthe simple expedient of not yielding\xe2\x80\x9d to federal blandishments when they do not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.  Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447, \n482 (1923)\n.  The States are separate and independent sovereigns.

They object that Congress has \xe2\x80\x9ccrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,\xe2\x80\x9d New York, supra, at 175, in the way it has structured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the new funds to States that will not accept the new conditions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those States\xe2\x80\x99 existing Medicaid funds.  The States claim that this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care coverage effected by the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven the nature of the threat and the programs at issue here, we must agree.  We have upheld Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States\xe2\x80\x99 complying with restrictions on the use of those funds, because that is the means by which Congress ensures that the funds are spent according to its view of the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral Welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  Conditions that do not here govern the use of the funds, however, cannot be justified on that ba- sis.  When, for example, such conditions take the form of threats to terminate other significant independent grants, the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressuring the States to accept policy changes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn South Dakota v.

By \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial inducement\xe2\x80\x9d the Court meant the threat of losing five percent of highway funds; no new money was offered to the States to raise their drinking ages.  We found that the inducement was not impermissibly coercive, because Congress was offering only \xe2\x80\x9crelatively mild encouragement to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dole, 483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211.  We observed that \xe2\x80\x9call South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%\xe2\x80\x9d of her highway funds.  Ibid.

A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s expansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not merely \xe2\x80\x9ca relatively small percentage\xe2\x80\x9d of its existing Medicaid funding, but all of it.  Dole, supra, at 211.  Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average State\xe2\x80\x99s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83 percent of those costs.  See Nat.

The Federal Government estimates that it will pay out approximately $3.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs of pre-expansion Medicaid.  Brief for United States 10, n.\xc2\xa06.  In addition, the States have developed intricate statutory and administrative regimes over the course of many decades to implement their objectives under existing Medicaid.  It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one percent of South Dakota\xe2\x80\x99s budget left that State with a \xe2\x80\x9cprerogative\xe2\x80\x9d to reject Congress\xe2\x80\x99s desired policy, \xe2\x80\x9cnot merely in theory but in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211\xe2\x80\x93212.  The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\xe2\x80\x99s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Ginsburg claims that Dole is distinguishable because here \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked for any other program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 47.  But that begs the question: The States contend that the expansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is forcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the existing Medicaid program.  We cannot agree that existing Medicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable Care Act are all one program simply because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress styled\xe2\x80\x9d them as such.  Post, at 49.  If the expansion is not properly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid program, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to so title it is irrelevant.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the Government claims that the Medicaid expansion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the ex-isting program because the States agreed that Congress could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on in the first place.  The Government observes that the Social Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid provisions, contains a clause expressly reserving \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\xe2\x80\x9d of that statute.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71304.  So it does.  But \xe2\x80\x9cif Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pennhurst, 451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17.  A State confronted with statutory language reserving the right to \xe2\x80\x9calter\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9camend\xe2\x80\x9d the pertinent provisions of the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that Congress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medicaid program as it developed.  Congress has in fact done so, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other times both old and new.  See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, \n\n86Stat.\n1381\xe2\x80\x931382, 1465 (extending Med-icaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new funding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, \xc2\xa74601, \n\n104Stat.\n1388\xe2\x80\x93166 (extending eligibility, and conditioning old and new funds).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.  The original program was de-signed to cover medical services for four particular cat-egories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly, and needy families with dependent children.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396a(a)(10).  Previous amendments to Medicaid eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of these categories.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level.  It is no longer a program to care for the neediest among us, but rather an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance coverage.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F14" name="T14">\n\t\t\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the manner in which the expansion is structured indicates that while Congress may have styled the expansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recognized it was enlisting the States in a new health care program.   Congress created a separate funding provision to cover the costs of providing services to any person made newly eligible by the expansion.  While Congress pays 50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid, \xc2\xa71396d(b), once the expansion is fully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible persons, \xc2\xa71396d(y)(1).  The conditions on use of the different funds are also distinct.  Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid benefit package.  \xc2\xa71396a(k)(1); see Brief for United States 9.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hough Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to legislate under the spending power is broad, it does not include surprising participating States with postacceptance or \xe2\x80\x98retroactive\xe2\x80\x99 conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pennhurst, supra, at 25.  A State could hardly anticipate that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reservation of the right to \xe2\x80\x9calter\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9camend\xe2\x80\x9d the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Ginsburg claims that in fact this expansion is no different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such that \xe2\x80\x9ca State would be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 56.  But the prior change she dis-cusses\xe2\x80\x94presumably the most dramatic alteration she could find\xe2\x80\x94does not come close to working the transformation the expansion accomplishes.  She highlights an amendment requiring States to cover pregnant women and increasing the number of eligible children.  Ibid.  But this modification can hardly be described as a major change in a program that\xe2\x80\x94from its inception\xe2\x80\x94provided health care for \xe2\x80\x9cfamilies with dependent children.\xe2\x80\x9d  Previous Medicaid amendments simply do not fall into the same category as the one at stake here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cfix the outermost line\xe2\x80\x9d where persuasion gives way to coercion.  301 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 591.

Mississippi, \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742, \n775 (1982)\n (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and that is what it is attempting to do with the Medicaid expansion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use.  What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.  Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to do just that.  It allows her to withhold all \xe2\x80\x9cfurther [Medicaid] payments .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the State\xe2\x80\x9d if she determines that the State is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement, including those contained in the expansion.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396c.  In light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the Secretary cannot apply \xc2\xa71396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the expansion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat fully remedies the constitutional violation we have identified.  The chapter of the United States Code that contains \xc2\xa71396c includes a severability clause confirming that we need go no further.  That clause specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71303.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not affect the continued ap-plication of \xc2\xa71396c to the existing Medicaid program.  Nor does it affect the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s ability to withdraw funds pro-vided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has chosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with the requirements of that Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not to say, as the joint dissent suggests, that we are \xe2\x80\x9crewriting the Medicaid Expansion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 48.  Instead, we determine, first, that \xc2\xa71396c is unconstitutional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds from States that decline to comply with the expansion.  We then follow Congress\xe2\x80\x99s explicit textual instruction to leave unaffected \xe2\x80\x9cthe remainder of the chapter, and the application of [the challenged] provision to other persons or circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71303.  When we invalidate an application of a statute because that application is unconstitutional, we are not \xe2\x80\x9crewriting\xe2\x80\x9d the statute; we are merely enforcing the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question remains whether today\xe2\x80\x99s holding affects other provisions of the Affordable Care Act.  In considering that question, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e seek to determine what Congress would have intended in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320, \n330 (2006)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  The question here is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid expansion.  Unless it is \xe2\x80\x9cevident\xe2\x80\x9d that the answer is no, we must leave the rest of the Act intact.  Champlin Refining Co. v.

It is fair to say that Congress assumed that every State would participate in the Medicaid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to do so.  The States contend that Congress enacted the rest of the Act with such full participation in mind; they point out that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying the mandate, \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(f)(1)(A)(ii), and enacted no other plan for providing coverage to many low-income individuals.  According to the States, this means that the entire Act must fall.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe disagree.  The Court today limits the financial pressure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept the terms of the Medicaid expansion.  As a practical matter, that means States may now choose to reject the expansion; that is the whole point.  But that does not mean all or even any will.  Some States may indeed decline to participate, either because they are unsure they will be able to afford their share of the new funding obligations, or because they are unwilling to commit the administrative resources necessary to support the expansion.  Other States, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the outset.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply because some may choose not to participate.  The other reforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain \xe2\x80\x9cfully operative as a law,\xe2\x80\x9d Champlin, supra, at 234, and will still function in a way \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic objectives in enacting the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d Booker, supra, at 259.  Confident that Congress would not have intended anything different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need not fall in light of our constitutional holding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part.  The individual mandate cannot be upheld as an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Commerce Clause.  That Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to engage in it.  In this case, however, it is reasonable to con-strue what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance.  Such legislation is within Con-gress\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding.  Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions.  Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer.  The States are given no such choice in this case: They must either accept a basic change in the nature of Medicaid, or risk losing all Medicaid funding.  The remedy for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal Government from imposing such a sanction.  That remedy does not require striking down other portions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Framers created a Federal Government of limited powers, and assigned to this Court the duty of enforcing those limits.

Beyond question, Congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care.  Congress chose, instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments.

In 2010, on average, an individual in the United States incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses.  Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Historic National Health Expenditure Data, National Health Expenditures: Se- lected Calendar Years 1960\xe2\x80\x932010 (Table 1).  Over a lifetime, costs mount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  See Alemayahu &amp; Warner, The Lifetime Distribution of Health Care Costs, in 39 Health Service Research 627, 635 (June 2004).  When a person requires nonroutine care, the cost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.  A single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs upwards of $10,000.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Health Policy, ASPE Research Brief: The Value of Health Insurance 5 (May 2011).  Treatments for many serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly cost a substantial sum.

Many (approximately 170 million in 2009) are insured by private insurance companies.  Others, including those over 65 and certain poor and disabled persons, rely on government-funded insurance programs, notably Medicare and Medicaid.  Combined, private health insurers and State and Federal Governments finance almost 85% of the medical care administered to U.\xc2\xa0S. residents.

See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2).  As just noted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a serious illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford to pay on her own.  Unlike markets for most products, however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that an uninsured individual will receive no care.  Federal and state law, as well as professional obligations and embedded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the patient\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay.  See, e.g., \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71395dd; Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7395.1041(3)(f) (2010); Tex.

In 2008, for example, hospi- tals, physicians, and other health-care professionals received no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116 billion in care they administered to those without insurance.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHealth-care providers do not absorb these bad debts. Instead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost of uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the government and private insurance companies.  In response, private insurers increase their premiums, shifting the cost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who carry insurance.  The net result: Those with health insurance subsidize the medical care of those without it.  As economists would describe what happens, the uninsured \xe2\x80\x9cfree ride\xe2\x80\x9d on those who pay for health insurance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe size of this subsidy is considerable.

Insurance companies and health-care providers know that some percentage of healthy, uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury each year and will receive medical care despite their inability to pay.  In anticipation of this uncompensated care, health-care companies raise their prices, and insurers their premiums.  In other words, because any uninsured person may need medical care at any moment and because health-care companies must account for that risk, every uninsured person impacts the market price of medical care and medical insurance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other deleterious effects on the health-care market.  Because those without insurance generally lack access to preventative care, they do not receive treatment for conditions\xe2\x80\x94like hypertension and diabetes\xe2\x80\x94that can be successfully and affordably treated if diagnosed early on.  See Institute of Medicine, National Academies, Insuring America\xe2\x80\x99s Health: Principles and Recommendations 43 (2004).

An influx of unhealthy individuals into a State with universal health care would result in increased spending on medical services.

Facing that risk, individual States are unlikely to take the initiative in addressing the problem of the uninsured, even though solving that problem is in all States\xe2\x80\x99 best interests.

Such a program, commonly referred to as a single-payer system (where the sole payer is the Federal Government), would have left little, if any, room for private enterprise or the States.  Instead of going this route, Congress enacted the ACA, a solution that retains a robust role for private insurers and state governments.  To make its chosen approach work, however, Congress had to use some new tools, including a requirement that most individuals obtain private health insurance coverage.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (the minimum coverage provision).  As explained below, by employing these tools, Congress was able to achieve a practical, alto- gether reasonable, solution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of uninsured U.\xc2\xa0S. residents.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(C) and (I) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The minimum coverage provision advances this objective by giving potential recipients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insurance.  Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual must either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a tax penalty.

Congress knew that encouraging individuals to purchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem, because most of the uninsured are not uninsured by choice.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Of particular concern to Congress were people who, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot acquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical conditions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, private insurance companies took an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s medical history into account when setting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an individual.  Because individuals with preexisting med- ical conditions cost insurance companies significantly more than those without such conditions, insurers routinely re- fused to insure these individuals, charged them substantially higher premiums, or offered only limited coverage that did not include the preexisting illness.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Coverage Denied: How the Current Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind 1 (2009) (Over the past three years, 12.6 million non- elderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums due to a preexisting condition.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo ensure that individuals with medical histories have access to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three-part solution.  First, Congress imposed a \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed is- sue\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, which bars insurers from denying coverage to any person on account of that person\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition or history.  See 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x931, 300gg\xe2\x80\x933, 300gg\xe2\x80\x934(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  Second, Congress required insurers to use \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity rating\xe2\x80\x9d to price their insurance policies.  See \xc2\xa7300gg.  Community rating, in effect, bars insurance companies from charging higher premiums to those with preexisting conditions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could not work effectively unless individuals were given a powerful incentive to obtain insurance.

When insurance companies are required to insure the sick at affordable prices, individuals can wait until they become ill to buy insurance.  Pretty soon, those in need of immediate medical care\xe2\x80\x94i.e., those who cost insurers the most\xe2\x80\x94become the insurance companies\xe2\x80\x99 main customers.  This \xe2\x80\x9cadverse selection\xe2\x80\x9d problem leaves insurers with two choices: They can either raise premiums dramatically to cover their ever-increasing costs or they can exit the market.  In the seven States that tried guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements without a minimum coverage provision, that is precisely what insurance companies did.

Beyond dispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate commerce.  Those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health-care products and services each year.  See supra, at 5.  Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered largely by national and regional companies who routinely transact business across state lines.  The uninsured also cross state lines to receive care.  Some have medical emergencies while away from home.  Others, when sick, go to a neighboring State that provides better care for those who have not prepaid for care.  See supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNot only do those without insurance consume a large amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and stability.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  Given these far-reaching effects on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is hardly inconsequential or equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cdoing nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress has the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.  See supra, at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  See also Wickard, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 128 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable connection\xe2\x80\x9d to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goal of protecting the health-care market from the disruption caused by individuals who fail to obtain insurance.  By requiring those who do not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum coverage provision gives individuals a strong incentive to insure.  This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe, would reduce the number of uninsured and, correspondingly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on the national health-care market.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured individuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain insurance or to pay the specified penalty.  As earlier observed, because every person is at risk of needing care at any moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of their current health status, adversely affect the price of health care and health insurance.  See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Moreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to those in need of immediate care simply could not work.  Insurance companies would either charge these individuals prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community-rating regulations were in place, close up shop.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.

The commerce power does not, The Chief Justice announces, permit Congress to \xe2\x80\x9ccompe[l] individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\ta\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s novel constraint on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for that reason alone warrants disapprobation.  See infra, at 23\xe2\x80\x9327.  But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 18, such a limitation would be inapplicable here.  Everyone will, at some point, consume health-care products and services.  See supra, at 3.  Thus, if The Chief Justice is correct that an insurance-purchase requirement can be applied only to those who \xe2\x80\x9cactively\xe2\x80\x9d consume health care, the minimum coverage provision fits the bill.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Chief Justice does not dispute that all U.\xc2\xa0S. residents participate in the market for health services over the course of their lives.  See ante, at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they cannot predict.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But, The Chief Justice insists, the uninsured cannot be considered active in the market for health care, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proximity and degree of connection between the [uninsured today] and [their] subsequent commercial activity is too lacking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 27.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument has multiple flaws.  First, more than 60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office each year.  See supra, at 5.  Nearly 90% will within five years.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  An uninsured\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of health care is thus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the next five years and more likely than not to occur this year.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEqually evident, Congress has no way of separating those uninsured individuals who will need emergency medi- cal care today (surely their consumption of medical care is sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need medical services for years to come.  No one knows when an emergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the uninsured arise daily.  To capture individuals who unexpect- edly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then, Congress needed to include individuals who will not go to a doctor anytime soon.  Congress, our decisions instruct, has authority to cast its net that wide.  See Perez v. United States, \n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146, \n154 (1971)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, it is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 role, not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, to delineate the boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to regulate.  The Chief Justice defines the health-care mar- ket as including only those transactions that will occur either in the next instant or within some (unspecified) proximity to the next instant.  But Congress could reasonably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective, encompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur over the next decade, see supra, at 19, not just those occurring here and now.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, contrary to The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s contention, our precedent does indeed support \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 26.  In Wickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Government imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he was permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (AAA).  317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114\xe2\x80\x93115.  He could not be penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the wheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open market.  Id., at 119.  The Court rejected this argument.  Id., at 127\xe2\x80\x93129.  Wheat intended for home consumption, the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9coverhangs the market, and if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases [intended by the AAA].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 128.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilar reasoning supported the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in Raich, which upheld Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate marijuana grown for personal use.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 19.  Homegrown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar- ket for marijuana, we observed, for \xe2\x80\x9cthe high demand in the interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana into that market.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decisions thus acknowledge Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority, under the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an individual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from growing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to cease cultivating marijuana) because of a prophesied future transaction (the eventual sale of that wheat or marijuana in the interstate market).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 actions are even more rational in this case, where the future activity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to occur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will take place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMaintaining that the uninsured are not active in the health-care market, The Chief Justice draws an analogy to the car market.  An individual \xe2\x80\x9cis not \xe2\x80\x98active in the car market,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d The Chief Justice observes, simply because he or she may someday buy a car.  Ante, at 25.  The analogy is inapt.  The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care and the guarantee that emergency care will be provided when required are conditions nonexistent in other markets.  That is so of the market for cars, and of the market for broccoli as well.  Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so.  And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment.  She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.  See Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F.\xc2\xa03d 529, 565 (CA6 2011) (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cRegulating how citizens pay for what they already receive (health care), never quite know when they will need, and in the case of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not be able to afford, has few (if any) parallels in modern life.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the ground that all are participants or will be participants in the health-care market would therefore carry no implication that Congress may justify under the Commerce Clause a mandate to buy other products and services.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage provision \xe2\x80\x9ccompel[s] individuals .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to purchase an unwanted product,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 18, or \xe2\x80\x9csuite of products,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 11, n.\xc2\xa02 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.).  If unwanted today, medical service secured by insurance may be desperately needed tomorrow.  Virtually everyone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point in his or her life.  See supra, at 3.  Health insurance is a means of paying for this care, nothing more.  In requiring individuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.  Rather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which individuals pay for an interstate good they consume: Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical care in advance (instead of at the point of service) and through insurance (instead of out of pocket).  Establishing payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate commerce is quintessential economic regulation well within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 domain.  See, e.g., United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., \n\n315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 110, \n118 (1942)\n.  Cf. post, at 13 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.)

See ante, at 17, 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  This complaint, too, is spurious.  Under the current health-care system, healthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for which they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need it, emergency medical care will be available, although they cannot afford it.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Those who have insurance bear the cost of this guarantee.  See ibid.  By requiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or pay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage provision ends the free ride these individuals currently enjoy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the fullness of time, moreover, today\xe2\x80\x99s young and healthy will become society\xe2\x80\x99s old and infirm.  Viewed over a lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who pay more than their fair share currently will pay less than their fair share when they become senior citizens.  And even if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals, over their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance than they receive in health services, they have little to complain about, for that is how insurance works.  Every insured person receives protection against a catastrophic loss, even though only a subset of the covered class will ultimately need that protection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tb\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s limitation of the commerce power to the regulation of those actively engaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Constitution or our decisions.

In separating the power to regulate from the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence, The Chief Justice asserts, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument is difficult to fathom.  Requiring individuals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter- state health-insurance and health-care markets, both of them in existence well before the enactment of the ACA.  See Wickard, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 128 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9csomething to be regulated\xe2\x80\x9d was surely there when Congress created the minimum coverage provision.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv- ity line.  In Wickard, for example, we upheld the penalty imposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat, even though the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers to purchase wheat in the open market.

In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court attempted to cabin Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause authority by distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d from activity once conceived to be noncommercial, notably, \xe2\x80\x9cproduction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmining,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n\n156 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n12 (1895)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cCommerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\xe2\x80\x9d); Carter v.

The Court also sought to distinguish activities having a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d effect on interstate commerce, and for that reason, subject to federal regulation, from those having only an \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d effect, and therefore not amenable to federal control.  See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n\n295 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495, \n548 (1935)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he dis- tinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized as a fundamental one.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese line-drawing exercises were untenable, and the Court long ago abandoned them.  \xe2\x80\x9c[Q]uestions of the power of Congress [under the Commerce Clause],\xe2\x80\x9d we held in Wickard, \xe2\x80\x9care not to be decided by reference to any for- mula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as \xe2\x80\x98production\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98indirect\xe2\x80\x99 and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 120.

Racine, 847 F.\xc2\xa02d 1211, 1213 (CA7 1988) (en banc).  Take this case as an example.  An individual who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance.  See Thomas More Law Center, 651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 561 (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo one is in- active when deciding how to pay for health care, as self-insurance and private insurance are two forms of action for addressing the same risk.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The minimum coverage provision could therefore be described as regulating activists in the self-insurance market.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Wickard is another example.  Did the statute there at issue target activity (the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)?  If anything, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis suggested the latter.

See, e.g., ante, at 23 (Allowing Congress to compel an individ- ual not engaged in commerce to purchase a product would \xe2\x80\x9cpermi[t] Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its authority, everywhere extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The joint dissenters express a similar apprehension.  See post, at 8 (If the minimum coverage provision is upheld under the commerce power then \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the hideous monster whose devouring jaws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

As several times noted, the unique attributes of the health-care market render everyone active in that market and give rise to a significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other markets.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x937, 16\xe2\x80\x9318, 21.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor would the commerce power be unbridled, absent The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cactivity\xe2\x80\x9d limitation.  Congress would remain unable to regulate noneconomic conduct that has only an attenuated effect on interstate commerce and is traditionally left to state law.  See Lopez, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 567; Morrison, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 617\xe2\x80\x93619.  In Lopez, for example, the Court held that the Federal Government lacked power, under the Commerce Clause, to criminalize the possession of a gun in a local school zone.  Possessing a gun near a school, the Court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cis in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 567; ibid. (noting that the Court would have \xe2\x80\x9cto pile inference upon inference\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that gun possession has a substantial effect on commerce).  Relying on similar logic, the Court concluded in Morrison that Congress could not regulate gender-motivated violence, which the Court deemed to have too \xe2\x80\x9cattenuated [an] effect upon interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 615.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn individual\xe2\x80\x99s decision to self-insure, I have explained, is an economic act with the requisite connection to interstate commerce.  See supra, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Other choices individuals make are unlikely to fit the same or similar description.  As an example of the type of regulation he fears, The Chief Justice cites a Government mandate to purchase green vegetables.  Ante, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  One could call this concern \xe2\x80\x9cthe broccoli horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress, The Chief Justice posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the failure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on others.  See ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider the chain of inferences the Court would have to accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate was likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care costs borne by lithe Americans.  The Court would have to believe that individuals forced to buy vegetables would then eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away), would prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed or raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods, and would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise or little sleep) to trump the improved diet.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Such \xe2\x80\x9cpil[ing of] inference upon inference\xe2\x80\x9d is just what the Court refused to do in Lopez and Morrison.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther provisions of the Constitution also check congressional overreaching.  A mandate to purchase a particu- lar product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, interfered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSupplementing these legal restraints is a formidable check on congressional power: the democratic process.  See Raich, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33; Wickard, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 120 (repeating Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwarning that effective restraints on [the commerce power\xe2\x80\x99s] exercise must proceed from political rather than judicial processes\xe2\x80\x9d (citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197 (1824)).  As the controversy surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act attests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political resistance.  This prospect is borne out by the behavior of state legislators.  Despite their possession of unquestioned authority to impose mandates, state governments have rarely done so.  See Hall, Commerce Clause Challenges to Health Care Reform, 159 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1825, 1838 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen contemplated in its extreme, almost any power looks dangerous.  The commerce power, hypothetically, would enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home production of all meat, fish, and dairy goods, effectively compelling Americans to eat only vegetables.  Cf. Raich, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 9; Wickard, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 127\xe2\x80\x93129.  Yet no one would offer the \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical and unreal possibilit[y],\xe2\x80\x9d Pullman Co. v. Knott, \n\n235 U.\xc2\xa0S. 23, \n26 (1914)\n, of a vegetarian state as a credible reason to deny Congress the authority ever to ban the possession and sale of goods.  The Chief Justice accepts just such specious logic when he cites the broccoli horrible as a reason to deny Congress the power to pass the individual mandate.  Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of America 169 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of analogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But see, e.g., post, at 3 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.) (asserting, outlandishly, that if the minimum coverage provision is sustained, then Congress could make \xe2\x80\x9cbreathing in and out the basis for federal prescription\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo bolster his argument that the minimum coverage provision is not valid Commerce Clause legislation, The Chief Justice emphasizes the provision\xe2\x80\x99s novelty.  See ante, at 18 (asserting that \xe2\x80\x9csometimes the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is the lack of historical precedent for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s action\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  While an insurance-purchase mandate may be novel, The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s argument certainly is not.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n almost every instance of the exer- cise of the [commerce] power differences are asserted from previous exercises of it and made a ground of attack.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hoke v.

For decades, the Court has declined to override legislation because of its novelty, and for good reason.

Hindering Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to do so is shortsighted; if history is any guide, today\xe2\x80\x99s constriction of the Commerce Clause will not endure.

Without the individual mandate, Congress learned, guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements would trigger an adverse-selection death-spiral in the health-insurance market: Insurance premiums would skyrocket, the number of uninsured would increase, and insurance companies would exit the market.  See supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  When complemented by an insurance mandate, on the other hand, guaranteed issue and community rating would work as intended, increasing access to insurance and reducing uncompensated care.  See supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The minimum coverage provision is thus an \xe2\x80\x9cessential par[t] of a larger regulation of economic activity\xe2\x80\x9d; without the provision, \xe2\x80\x9cthe regulatory scheme [w]ould be undercut.\xe2\x80\x9d  Raich, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted).

As evidenced by Medicare, Medicaid, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Federal Government plays a lead role in the health-care sector, both as a direct payer and as a regulator.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, and perhaps most important, the minimum coverage provision, along with other provisions of the ACA, addresses the very sort of interstate problem that made the commerce power essential in our federal system.  See supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  The crisis created by the large number of U.\xc2\xa0S. residents who lack health insurance is one of national dimension that States are \xe2\x80\x9cseparately incompetent\xe2\x80\x9d to handle.

Far from trampling on States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty, the ACA attempts a federal solution for the very reason that the States, acting separately, cannot meet the need.  Notably, the ACA serves the general welfare of the people of the United States while retaining a prominent role for the States.

The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause opinion, and even more so the joint dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, see post, at 4\xe2\x80\x9316, bear a disquieting resemblance to those long-overruled decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUltimately, the Court upholds the individual mandate as a proper exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to tax and spend \xe2\x80\x9cfor the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. general Welfare of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01; ante, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  I concur in that determination, which makes The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause essay all the more puzzling.  Why should The Chief Justice strive so mightily to hem in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 capacity to meet the new problems arising constantly in our ever-developing modern economy?  I find no satisfying response to that question in his opinion.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThrough Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an opportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid of federal financing.  To receive federal Medicaid funds, States must provide health benefits to specified categories of needy persons, including pregnant women, children, parents, and adults with disabilities.  Guaranteed eligibility varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal poverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it depends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state or federal assistance programs.  The ACA enlarges the population of needy people States must cover to include adults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the fed- eral poverty level.  The spending power conferred by the Constitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Congress to define the contours of programs financed with federal funds.  See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n17 (1981)\n.  And to expand coverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legislation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as embracive of the poor as Congress chose.  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion, then, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger population, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may it achieve the same result by amending existing law?  The answer should be that Congress may expand by amendment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid benefits.  A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the population served by a federally funded program would advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely serve the interests of federalism.  To the contrary, such a requirement would rigidify Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to empower States by partnering with them in the implementation of federal programs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMedicaid is a prototypical example of federal-state cooperation in serving the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s general welfare.  Rather than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uni- form national health-care system for the poor, Con- gress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid grants to their particular needs, so long as they remain within bounds set by federal law.  In shaping Medicaid, Congress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms participating states must meet; instead, Congress reserved the \xe2\x80\x9cright to alter, amend, or repeal\xe2\x80\x9d any provision of the Medicaid Act.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71304.  States, for their part, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent with changes from time to time made in the federal law.  See 42 CFR \xc2\xa7430.12(c)(i) (2011).  And from 1965 to the present, States have regularly conformed to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 alterations of the Medicaid Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Chief Justice acknowledges that Congress may \xe2\x80\x9ccondition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States\xe2\x80\x99 complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 50, but nevertheless concludes that the 2010 expansion is unduly coercive.  His conclusion rests on three premises, each of them essential to his theory.  First, the Medicaid expansion is, in The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s view, a new grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid program existing before the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Congress, The Chief Justice maintains, has threatened States with the loss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them to adopt a new one.  Second, the expansion was unforeseeable by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.  Third, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the States have no real choice but to participate in the Medicaid expansion.  The Chief Justice therefore\xe2\x80\x94for the first time ever\xe2\x80\x94finds an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 spending power unconstitutionally coercive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMedicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two spending programs; it is a single program with a constant aim\xe2\x80\x94to enable poor persons to receive basic health care when they need it.  Given past expansions, plus express statutory warning that Congress may change the requirements participating States must meet, there can be no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.  Moreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medicaid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 terms.  Future Congresses are not bound by their predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 dispositions; they have authority to spend federal revenue as they see fit.  The Federal Government, therefore, is not, as The Chief Justice charges, threatening States with the loss of \xe2\x80\x9cexisting\xe2\x80\x9d funds from one spending program in order to induce them to opt into another program.  Congress is simply requiring States to do what States have long been required to do to receive Medicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress prescribes for participation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA majority of the Court, however, buys the argument that prospective withholding of funds formerly available exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 spending power.  Given that holding, I entirely agree with The Chief Justice as to the appropriate remedy.  It is to bar the withholding found impermissible\xe2\x80\x94not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap the expansion altogether, see post, at 46\xe2\x80\x9348.  The dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical departure from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s normal course.  When a constitutional infirmity mars a statute, the Court ordinarily removes the infirmity.  It undertakes a salvage operation; it does not demolish the legislation.  See, e.g., Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., \n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491, \n504 (1985)\n (Court\xe2\x80\x99s normal course is to declare a statute invalid \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise [to leave the statute] intact\xe2\x80\x9d).  That course is plainly in order where, as in this case, Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave untouched every provision not found invalid.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71303.  Because The Chief Justice finds the withholding\xe2\x80\x94not the granting\xe2\x80\x94of federal funds incom- patible with the Spending Clause, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 extension of Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its willingness to participate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tExpansion has been characteristic of the Medicaid program.  Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as passed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs jointly administered with the States.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  States were not required to participate in Medicaid.  But if they did, the Federal Government paid at least half the costs.  To qual- ify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded, state-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with Dependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind; and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled.  See Social Security Amendments of 1965, \xc2\xa7121(a), \n\n79Stat.\n343; Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, \n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 34, \n37 (1981)\n.  At their option, States could enroll additional \xe2\x80\x9cmedically needy\xe2\x80\x9d individuals; these costs, too, were partially borne by the Federal Government at the same, at least 50%, rate.

Most relevant here, between 1988 and 1990, Congress required participating States to include among their beneficiaries pregnant women with family incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, children up to age 6 at the same income levels, and children ages 6 to 18 with family incomes up to 100% of the poverty level.

Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 expansion is financed largely by federal outlays.  In 2014, federal funds will cover 100% of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries; that rate will gradually decrease before settling at 90% in 2020.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396d(y) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  By comparison, federal contributions toward the care of beneficiaries eligible pre-ACA range from 50% to 83%, and averaged 57% between 2005 and 2008.  \xc2\xa71396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, C.

Subject to its basic requirements, the Medicaid Act empowers States to \xe2\x80\x9cselect dramatically different levels of funding and coverage, alter and experiment with different financing and delivery modes, and opt to cover (or not to cover) a range of parti- cular procedures and therapies.

Absent from the nationalized model, of course, is the state-level policy discretion and experimentation that is Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s hallmark; undoubtedly the interests of federalism are better served when States retain a meaning- ful role in the implementation of a program of such importance.

That Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal highway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State permitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons less than 21 years old.  Drinking age was not within the authority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued, because the \n \nTwenty-First Amendment gave the States exclusive power to control the manufacture, transportation, and consumption of alcoholic beverages.  The small percentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota stood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to purchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as coercion, the Court concluded.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case does not present the concerns that led the Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion.  In Dole, the condition\xe2\x80\x94set 21 as the minimum drinking age\xe2\x80\x94 did not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro- vided for highway construction.  Further, in view of the \n \nTwenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether Congress could directly impose a national minimum drinking age.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally funded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply, Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked for any other program.  Nor does the ACA use Medicaid funding to induce States to take action Congress itself could not undertake.  The Federal Government undoubtedly could operate its own health-care program for poor persons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors\xe2\x80\x99 health care.  See supra, at 44.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is what makes this such a simple case, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision so unsettling.  Congress, aiming to assist the needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize state health-insurance programs that meet federal standards.  The principal standard the ACA sets is that the state program cover adults earning no more than 133% of the federal poverty line.  Enforcing that prescription ensures that federal funds will be spent on health care for the poor in furtherance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 present perception of the general welfare.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Chief Justice asserts that the Medicaid expan- sion creates a \xe2\x80\x9cnew health care program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 54.  Moreover, States could \xe2\x80\x9chardly anticipate\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress would \xe2\x80\x9ctransform [the program] so dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 55.  Therefore, The Chief Justice maintains, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 threat to withhold \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d Medicaid funds based on a State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to participate in the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d program is a \xe2\x80\x9cthrea[t] to terminate [an]other .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. independent gran[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 50, 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  And because the threat to withhold a large amount of funds from one program \xe2\x80\x9cleaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],\xe2\x80\x9d The Chief Justice concludes, the Medicaid expansion is unconstitutionally coercive.

By bringing health care within the reach of a larger population of Americans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is an extension of that basic aim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions governing operation of the program, setting conditions ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cLimitation on payments to States for expend- itures attributable to taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396a(t) (2006 ed.), to \xe2\x80\x9cMedical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71396b(v) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).  The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast majority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the existing program and specifies the rate at which States will be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene- ficiaries.  See ACA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72001(a)(1), (3), \n\n124Stat.\n271\xe2\x80\x93272.  The ACA does not describe operational aspects of the program for these newly eligible persons; for that information, one must read the existing Medicaid Act.  See 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396\xe2\x80\x931396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expansion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d health-care program.  To the four categories of beneficiaries for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965, and the three mandatory classes added in the late 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, see supra, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342, the ACA adds an eighth: individuals under 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal poverty level.  The expansion is effectuated by \xc2\xa72001 of the ACA, aptly titled: \xe2\x80\x9cMedicaid Coverage for the Lowest Income Populations.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n124Stat.\n271.  That section amends Title 42, Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX: Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs.  Commonly known as the Medicaid Act, Subchapter XIX filled some 278 pages in 2006.

See Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 594.  Even if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress\xe2\x80\x99 conception of the character of its legislation, how would reviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, purporting to amend a law, is in reality not an amendment, but a new creation?  At what point does an extension become so large that it \xe2\x80\x9ctransforms\xe2\x80\x9d the basic law?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEndeavoring to show that Congress created a new program, The Chief Justice cites three aspects of the expansion.  First, he asserts that, in covering those earning no more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medicaid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not \xe2\x80\x9ccare for the neediest among us.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 53.  What makes that so?  Single adults earning no more than $14,856 per year\xe2\x80\x94133% of the current federal poverty level\xe2\x80\x94surely rank among the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s poor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, according to The Chief Justice, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid benefit package.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That less comprehensive benefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced by the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for many of their Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F20" name="T20">\n\t\t\t\t\t20\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The level of benefits offered therefore does not set apart post-ACA Medicaid recipients from all those entitled to benefits pre-ACA. \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, The Chief Justice correctly notes that the reimbursement rate for participating States is differ- ent regarding individuals who became Medicaid-eligible through the ACA.  Ibid.  But the rate differs only in its generosity to participating States.  Under pre-ACA Medicaid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs of coverage for current enrollees, \xc2\xa71396d(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV); under the ACA, the federal contribution starts at 100% and will eventually settle at 90%, \xc2\xa71396d(y).  Even if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percentage points carries constitutional significance, is it not passing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on state sovereignty might have been averted, or at least mitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry out the same obligations?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider also that Congress could have repealed Medicaid.  See supra, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (citing \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71304); Brief for Petitioners in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93400, p.\xc2\xa041.  Thereafter, Congress could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin- ing the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage required by the ACA.  By what right does a court stop Congress from building up without first tearing down?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Chief Justice finds the Medicaid expansion vulnerable because it took participating States by surprise.

Ante, at 54\xe2\x80\x9355.  For the notion that States must be able to foresee, when they sign up, alterations Congress might make later on, The Chief Justice cites only one case: Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Pennhurst, residents of a state-run, federally funded institution for the mentally disabled complained of abusive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged violation of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act.  451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  We held that the State was not answerable in damages for violating conditions it did not \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily and knowingly accep[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 17, 27.  Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his- tory, we found that the Act did not \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously\xe2\x80\x9d impose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied: that they receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive environment.  Id., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  Satisfied that Congress had not clearly conditioned the States\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of federal funds on the States\xe2\x80\x99 provision of such treatment, we declined to read such a requirement into the Act.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 spending power, we concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not include surprising participating States with postacceptance or \xe2\x80\x98retroactive\xe2\x80\x99 conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPennhurst thus instructs that \xe2\x80\x9cif Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 53 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17).  That requirement is met in this case.  Section 2001 does not take effect until 2014.  The ACA makes perfectly clear what will be required of States that accept Medicaid funding after that date: They must extend eligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133% of the federal poverty line.

If I understand his point correctly, it was incumbent on Congress, in 1965, to warn the States clearly of the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might take.

Whenever a State notifies the Federal Government of a change in its own Medicaid program, the State certifies both that it knows the federally set terms of participation may change, and that it will abide by those changes as a condition of continued participation.

This gets things backwards: Congress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal money in service of the general welfare.  And each successive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees fit.  When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 view, it abridged no State\xe2\x80\x99s right to \xe2\x80\x9cexisting,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpre-existing,\xe2\x80\x9d funds.  But see ante, at 51\xe2\x80\x9352; post, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.).  For, in fact, there are no such funds.

Ante, at 55.  For the foregoing reasons, I disagree that any such withholding would violate the Spending Clause.

That clause provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any provision of [the Medicaid Act], or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held in- valid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71303.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court does not strike down any provision of the ACA.  It prohibits only the \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that decline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  Thus the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of funds to finance the expansion remains intact, and the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to withhold funds for reasons other than noncompliance with the expansion remains unaffected.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven absent \xc2\xa71303\xe2\x80\x99s command, we would have no warrant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion, contra post, at 46\xe2\x80\x9348 (joint opinion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.), not to mention the entire ACA, post, at 49\xe2\x80\x9364 (same).  For when a court confronts an unconstitutional statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s dominant objective.  See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320\n\xe2\x80\x93330 (2006).  In this case, that objective was to increase access to health care for the poor by increasing the States\xe2\x80\x99 access to federal funds.  The Chief Justice is undoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer States funds \xe2\x80\x9cto expand the availability of health care, and requir[e] that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 55.

It can assuredly do that, by exercising the powers accorded to it under the Constitution.  The question in this case, however, is whether the complex structures and provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go be- yond those powers.  We conclude that they do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case is in one respect difficult: it presents two questions of first impression.  The first of those is whether failure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of health insurance) is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause.  Failure to act does result in an effect on commerce, and hence might be said to come under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caffecting commerce\xe2\x80\x9d criterion of Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  But in none of its decisions has this Court extended the Clause that far.  The second question is whether the congressional power to tax and spend, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01, permits the conditioning of a State\xe2\x80\x99s continued receipt of all funds under a massive state-administered federal welfare program upon its acceptance of an expansion to that program.  Several of our opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend cannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal program, but we have never found a law enacted under the spending power to be coercive.  Those questions are difficult.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe case is easy and straightforward, however, in another respect.  What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the text of the 1789 Constitution, by the \n \nTenth Amendment ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the 220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon federal power\xe2\x80\x94upon what it can prescribe with respect to private conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the sovereign States.  Whatever may be the conceptual limits upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax and spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal Government to regulate all private conduct and to com- pel the States to function as administrators of federal programs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat clear principle carries the day here.  The striking case of Wickard v. Filburn, \n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111 (1942)\n, which held that the economic activity of growing wheat, even for one\xe2\x80\x99s own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently that it could be regulated, always has been regarded as the ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow wheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity at all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be federally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out the basis for federal prescription and to extend federal power to virtually all human activity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs for the constitutional power to tax and spend for the general welfare: The Court has long since expanded that beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and spending for those aspects of the general welfare that were within the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers, see United States v. Butler, \n\n297 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9366 (1936).  Thus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted to subjects not mentioned among Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers, and only marginally related to commerce: the De- partment of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The principal practical obstacle that prevents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to assume all the general-welfare responsibilities traditionally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of managing a Federal Government large enough to administer such a system.  That obstacle can be overcome by granting funds to the States, allowing them to administer the program.  That is fair and constitutional enough when the States freely agree to have their powers employed and their employees enlisted in the federal scheme.  But it is a blatant violation of the constitutional structure when the States have no choice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act before us here exceeds federal power both in mandating the purchase of health insurance and in denying nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding.  These parts of the Act are central to its design and operation, and all the Act\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions would not have been enacted without them.  In our view it must follow that the entire statute is inoperative.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\tThe Individual Mandate\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArticle I, \xc2\xa78, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Individual Mandate in the Act commands that every \xe2\x80\x9capplicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individ- ual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  If this provision \xe2\x80\x9cregulates\xe2\x80\x9d anything, it is the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage.  One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by payment of a penalty.  But that failure\xe2\x80\x94that abstention from commerce\xe2\x80\x94is not \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  To be sure, purchasing insurance is \xe2\x80\x9dCommerce\xe2\x80\x9d; but one does not regulate commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Gibbons v.

The former provides that, with a few exceptions, \xe2\x80\x9ceach health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market in a State must accept every employer and individual in the State that applies for such coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x931(a).  That is, an insurer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other things, any pre-existing medical condition that the applicant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover that condition.  See \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x933.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would respond by charging high premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions.  The Act seeks to prevent this through the community-rating provision.  Simply put, the community-rating provision requires insurers to calculate an individual\xe2\x80\x99s insurance premium based on only four factors: (i) whether the individual\xe2\x80\x99s plan covers just the individual or his family also, (ii) the \xe2\x80\x9crating area\xe2\x80\x9d in which the individual lives, (iii) the individual\xe2\x80\x99s age, and (iv) whether the individual uses tobacco.  \xc2\xa7300gg(a)(1)(A).  Aside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and possibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to factor the individual\xe2\x80\x99s health characteristics into the price of his insurance premium.  This creates a new incentive for young and healthy individuals without pre-existing conditions.  The insurance premiums for those in this group will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will subsidize insurance for others in the pool.  Many of them may decide that purchasing health insurance is not an eco- nomically sound decision\xe2\x80\x94especially since the guaranteed-issue provision will enable them to purchase it at the same cost in later years and even if they have developed a pre-existing condition.  But without the contribution of above-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the community-rating provision will not enable insurers to take on high-risk individuals without a massive increase in premiums.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government presents the Individual Mandate as a unique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme governing many parties with countervailing incentives that must be carefully balanced.  Congress has imposed an extensive set of regulations on the health insurance industry, and compliance with those regulations will likely cost the in- dustry a great deal.  If the industry does not respond by increasing premiums, it is not likely to survive.  And if the industry does increase premiums, then there is a seri- ous risk that its products\xe2\x80\x94insurance plans\xe2\x80\x94will become economically undesirable for many and prohibitively ex- pensive for the rest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health-insurance industry.  Government regulation typically imposes costs on the regulated industry\xe2\x80\x94especially regulation that prohibits economic behavior in which most market participants are already engaging, such as \xe2\x80\x9cpiecing out\xe2\x80\x9d the market by selling the product to different classes of people at different prices (in the present context, providing much lower insurance rates to young and healthy buyers).  And many industries so regulated face the reality that, without an artificial increase in demand, they cannot continue on.  When Congress is regulating these industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to enact \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all appropriate legislation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98protec[t]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98advanc[e]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d commerce, NLRB v.

Thus, Congress might protect the imperiled industry by prohibiting low-cost competition, or by according it preferential tax treatment, or even by granting it a direct subsidy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, however, Congress has impressed into service third parties, healthy individuals who could be but are not customers of the relevant industry, to offset the undesirable consequences of the regulation.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated by the fact that they are further removed from the market than unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions, because they are less likely to need extensive care in the near future.  If Congress can reach out and command even those furthest removed from an interstate market to participate in the market, then the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe hideous monster whose devouring jaws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 33, p.\xc2\xa0202 (C.

In New York v. United States, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144 (1992)\n, we held that Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the disposal of radioactive waste produced in several different industries, order the States to take title to that waste. Id., at 174\xe2\x80\x93177.  In Printz v. United States, \n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 898 (1997)\n, we held that Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the distribution of firearms in the interstate mar- ket, compel state law-enforcement officials to perform background checks.  Id., at 933\xe2\x80\x93935.  In United States v. Lopez, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 549 (1995)\n, we held that Congress could not, as a means of fostering an educated interstate labor market through the protection of schools, ban the possession of a firearm within a school zone.  Id., at 559\xe2\x80\x93563.  And in United States v. Morrison, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598 (2000)\n, we held that Congress could not, in an effort to ensure the full participation of women in the interstate economy, subject private individuals and companies to suit for gender-motivated violent torts.  Id., at 609\xe2\x80\x93619.  The lesson of these cases is that the Commerce Clause, even when sup- plemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause, is not carte blanche for doing whatever will help achieve the ends Congress seeks by the regulation of commerce.  And the last two of these cases show that the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when the congressional action directly violates the sovereignty of the States but also when it violates the background principle of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe case upon which the Government principally relies to sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary and Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2005)\n.  That case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain the interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultivation and possession of that drug.  Id., at 15\xe2\x80\x9322.  Raich is no precedent for what Congress has done here.  That case\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, \n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111\n), and of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not represent the expansion of the federal power to direct into a broad new field.  The mandating of economic activity does, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the Commerce Clause into a general authority to direct the economy, that mandating is not \xe2\x80\x9cconsist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, Raich is far different from the Individual Mandate in another respect.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Raich pointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions were the only practicable way of enabling the prohibition of interstate traffic in marijuana to be effectively enforced.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 22.  See also Shreveport Rate Cases, \n\n234 U.\xc2\xa0S. 342 (1914)\n (Necessary and Proper Clause allows regulations of intrastate transactions if necessary to the regulation of an interstate market).  Intrastate marijuana could no more be distinguished from interstate marijuana than, for example, endangered-species trophies obtained before the species was federally protected can be distinguished from trophies obtained afterwards\xe2\x80\x94which made it necessary and proper to prohibit the sale of all such trophies, see Andrus v. Allard, \n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 51 (1979)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith the present statute, by contrast, there are many ways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate by which the regulatory scheme\xe2\x80\x99s goals of reducing insurance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers could be achieved.  For instance, those who did not purchase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when they do enter the health insurance system.  Or they could be denied a full income tax credit given to those who do purchase the insurance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government was invited, at oral argument, to suggest what federal controls over private conduct (other than those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or other constitutional controls) could not be justified as necessary and proper for the carrying out of a general regulatory scheme.

As we said at the outset, whereas the precise scope of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain, the proposition that the Federal Government cannot do everything is a fundamental precept.  See Lopez, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f we were to accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an in- dividual that Congress is without power to regulate\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 5000A is defeated by that proposition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s second theory in support of the In- dividual Mandate is that \xc2\xa75000A is valid because it is actually a \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[ion of] activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. i.e., .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 558\xe2\x80\x93559.  See also Shreveport Rate Cases, supra.  This argument takes a few different forms, but the basic idea is that \xc2\xa75000A regulates \xe2\x80\x9cthe way in which individuals finance their participation in the health-care market.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 33 (emphasis added).  That is, the provision directs the manner in which individuals purchase health care services and related goods (directing that they be purchased through insurance) and is therefore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe primary problem with this argument is that \xc2\xa75000A does not apply only to persons who purchase all, or most, or even any, of the health care services or goods that the mandated insurance covers.  Indeed, the main objection many have to the Mandate is that they have no intention of purchasing most or even any of such goods or services and thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases.  The Government responds that the health-care market involves \xe2\x80\x9cessentially universal participation,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 35.  The principal difficulty with this response is that it is, in the only relevant sense, not true.  It is true enough that everyone consumes \xe2\x80\x9chealth care,\xe2\x80\x9d if the term is taken to include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin.  But the health care \xe2\x80\x9cmarket\xe2\x80\x9d that is the object of the Individual Mandate not only includes but principally consists of goods and services that the young people primarily affected by the Mandate do not purchase.  They are quite simply not participants in that market, and cannot be made so (and thereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of defining participants to include all those who will, later in their lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services covered by the mandated insurance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Such a definition of market participants is unprecedented, and were it to be a premise for the exercise of national power, it would have no principled limits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a variation on this attempted exercise of federal power, the Government points out that Congress in this Act has purported to regulate \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic and financial decision[s] to forego [sic] health insurance coverage and [to] attempt to self-insure,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(A), since those decisions have \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 34.  But as the discussion above makes clear, the decision to forgo participation in an interstate market is not itself commercial activity (or indeed any activity at all) within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate.  It is true that, at the end of the day, it is inevitable that each American will affect commerce and become a part of it, even if not by choice.  But if every person comes within the Commerce Clause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason that he will one day engage in commerce, the idea of a limited Government power is at an end.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most expansive assertion of the commerce power in our history.  A close second is Perez v. United States, \n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146 (1971)\n, which upheld a statute criminalizing the eminently local activity of loan-sharking.  Both of those cases, however, \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tinvolved commercial activity.  To go beyond that, and to say that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make loans affects commerce, so that growing and lending can be federally compelled, is to extend federal power to virtually everything.  All of us consume food, and when we do so the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality must be and even how much we must pay.  But the mere fact that we all consume food and are thus, sooner or later, participants in the \xe2\x80\x9cmarket\xe2\x80\x9d for food, does not empower the Government to say when and what we will buy.  That is essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the purchase of health care.  It exceeds federal power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA few respectful responses to Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s dissent on the issue of the Mandate are in order.  That dissent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that our opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the test contains.  It is true enough that Congress needs only a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rational basis\xe2\x80\x99 for concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15 (em- phasis added).  But it must be activity affecting com- merce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to engage in commerce.  And one is not now purchasing the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future.  Our test\xe2\x80\x99s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that it be commerce which is regulated.  If all inactivity affecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.  Ultimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is really no difference between action and inaction, ante, at 26, a proposition that has never recommended itself, neither to the law nor to common sense.  To say, for example, that the inaction here consists of activity in \xe2\x80\x9cthe self-insurance market,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., seems to us wordplay.  By parity of reasoning the failure to buy a car can be called participation in the non-private-car-transportation market.  Com- merce becomes everything.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent claims that we \xe2\x80\x9cfai[l] to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 35.  But we have done so.  It threatens that order because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Commerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to act) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroying the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s division of governmental powers.  Thus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity of the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional relation between the individual and the National Government.  The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper Clause has been held to include \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to enact criminal laws, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the power to imprison, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the power to create a national bank,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  Is not the power to compel purchase of health insurance much lesser?  No, not if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests upon a theory that everything is within federal control simply because it exists.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent\xe2\x80\x99s exposition of the wonderful things the Fed- eral Government has achieved through exercise of its assigned powers, such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe provision of old-age and survivors\xe2\x80\x99 benefits\xe2\x80\x9d in the Social Security Act, ante, at 2, is quite beside the point.  The issue here is whether the federal government can impose the Individual Mandate through the Commerce Clause.  And the relevant history is not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful results through the proper exercise of its assigned powers in the past, but that it has never before used the Commerce Clause to compel entry into commerce.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The dissent treats the Constitution as though it is an enumeration of those problems that the Federal Government can address\xe2\x80\x94among which, it finds, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe Nation\xe2\x80\x99s course in the economic and social welfare realm,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., and more specifically \xe2\x80\x9cthe problem of the uninsured,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 7. The Constitution is not that.  It enumerates not federally soluble problems, but federally available powers.  The Federal Government can address whatever problems it wants but can bring to their solution only those powers that the Constitution confers, among which is the power to regulate commerce.  None of our cases say anything else.  Article I contains no whatever-it-takes-to-solve-a-national-problem power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to compel entry into the health-insurance market would include the power to compel entry into the new-car or broccoli markets.  The latter purchasers, it says, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas those refusing to purchase health-insurance will ultimately get treated anyway, at others\xe2\x80\x99 expense.  Ante, at 21.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he unique attributes of the health-care market .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. give rise to a significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other markets.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 28.  And \xe2\x80\x9ca vegetable-purchase mandate\xe2\x80\x9d (or a car-purchase mandate) is not \xe2\x80\x9clikely to have a substantial effect on the health-care costs\xe2\x80\x9d borne by other Americans.  Ante, at 29.  Those differences make a very good argument by the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s own lights, since they show that the failure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to purchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare problem that is (in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view) included among the unenumerated \xe2\x80\x9cproblems\xe2\x80\x9d that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to solve.  But those differences do not show that the failure to enter the health-insurance market, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is an activity that Congress can \xe2\x80\x9cregulate.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Of course one day the failure of some of the public to purchase Amer- ican cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer- fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health-care costs that are a burden on the rest of us\xe2\x80\x94in which case, under the theory of Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, moving against those inactivities will also come within the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s unenumerated problem-solving powers.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tThe Taxing Power\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs far as \xc2\xa75000A is concerned, we would stop there.

The Government contends, however, as expressed in the caption to Part II of its brief, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe minimum coverage provision is independently authorized by congress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 52.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cindependently authorized\xe2\x80\x9d suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen in the United States Reports: A penalty for constitutional purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes.  In all our cases the two are mutually exclusive.  The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty or else a tax.  Of course in many cases what was a regu- latory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was im- posed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty.  But we know of no case, and the Government cites none, in which the imposition was, for constitutional purposes, both.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The two are mutually exclusive.  Thus, what the Government\xe2\x80\x99s caption should have read was \xe2\x80\x9calternatively, the minimum coverage provision is not a mandate-with-penalty but a tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is important to bear this in mind in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of those who support it: The issue is not whether Congress  had the power to frame the minimum-coverage provision as a tax, but whether it did so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn answering that question we must, if \xe2\x80\x9cfairly possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Crowell v. Benson, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22, \n62 (1932)\n, construe the provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty, since that would render it constitutional rather than un- constitutional (ut res magis valeat quam pereat).

In a few cases, this Court has held that a \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d imposed upon private conduct was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty.  But we have never held\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94that a penalty imposed for violation of the law was so trivial as to be in effect a tax.  We have never held that any exaction imposed for violation of the law is an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 taxing power\xe2\x80\x94even when the statute calls it a tax, much less when (as here) the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty.  When an act \xe2\x80\x9cadopt[s] the criteria of wrongdoing\xe2\x80\x9d and then imposes a monetary penalty as the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal consequence on those who transgress its standard,\xe2\x80\x9d it creates a regulatory penalty, not a tax.

It is one of the canons of interpretation that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for a lawful act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Powhatan Steamboat Co. v.

Section 5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable individual\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those with religious objections or who participate in a \xe2\x80\x9chealth care sharing ministry,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa75000A(d)(2); those who are \xe2\x80\x9cnot lawfully present\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States, \xc2\xa75000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcerated, \xc2\xa75000A(d)(4).  Section 5000A(e) then creates a separate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford coverage, \xc2\xa75000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to require filing a tax return, \xc2\xa75000A(e)(2); who are members of an Indian tribe, \xc2\xa75000A(e)(3); who experience only short gaps in coverage, \xc2\xa75000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \xe2\x80\x9chave suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain coverage,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa75000A(e)(5).  If \xc2\xa75000A were a tax, these two classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the penalty (renamed tax) alone.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the face of all these indications of a regulatory requirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General assures us that \xe2\x80\x9cneither the Treasury Department nor the Department of Health and Human Services interprets Section 5000A as imposing a legal obligation,\xe2\x80\x9d Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 61, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f [those subject to the Act] pay the tax penalty, they\xe2\x80\x99re in compliance with the law,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (Mar. 26, 2012).  These self-serving litigating positions are entitled to no weight.  What counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely clear.  It is worth noting, moreover, that these assurances contradict the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position in related litigation.  Shortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa738.2\xe2\x80\x933430.1:1 (Lexis Supp. 2011), which states, \xe2\x80\x9cNo resident of [the] Commonwealth .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except as required by a court or the Department of Social Services .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  In opposing Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of standing to challenge \xc2\xa75000A based on this statute, the Government said that \xe2\x80\x9cif the minimum coverage provision is unconstitutional, the [Virginia] statute is unnecessary, and if the minimum coverage provision is upheld, the state statute is void under the Supremacy Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant in No. 11\xe2\x80\x931057 etc. (CA4), p.\xc2\xa029.

It notes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted individual . . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to the income tax itself,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal Revenue Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 53.  The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if IRS penalty-collection were unheard-of or rare.  It is not.  See, e.g., \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible pen- alty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures); \xc2\xa75761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of to- bacco products labeled for export); \xc2\xa79707 (IRS-collectible penalty for failure to make required health-insurance premium payments on behalf of mining employees).  In Reorganized CF&amp;I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213\n, we held that an exaction not only enforced by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d was in fact a penalty.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the concept of penalty means anything,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, \xe2\x80\x9cit means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 224.  See also Lipke v. Lederer, \n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557 (1922)\n (same).  Moreover, while the penalty is assessed and collected by the IRS, \xc2\xa75000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of Veteran Affairs), see \xc2\xa75000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v), (f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for defining its substantive scope\xe2\x80\x94a feature that would be quite extraordinary for taxes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government points out that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he amount of the penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor and [a] ca[p],\xe2\x80\x9d and that individuals who earn so little money that they \xe2\x80\x9care not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty\xe2\x80\x9d (though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the mandate).  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 12, 53.  But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an utterly familiar practice.

The presence of such a requirement suggests a penalty\xe2\x80\x94though one can imagine a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of such a requirement does not suggest a tax.  Penalties for absolute-liability offenses are commonplace.  And where a statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a \xe2\x80\x9csevere penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Staples v. United States, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600, \n618 (1994)\n.  Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter requirement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core, rather than where a tax would be found\xe2\x80\x94in Title IX, containing the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRevenue Provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  In sum, \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a regulatory penalty, not a tax.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it.  Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubl- ing.  Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives.  See Art. I, \xc2\xa77, cl.\xc2\xa01.  That is to say, they must originate in the legislative body most accountable to the people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election, which is never more than two years off.  The Federalist No. 58 \xe2\x80\x9cdefend[ed] the decision to give the origination power to the House on the ground that the Chamber that is more accountable to the people should have the primary role in raising revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Munoz-Flores, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, \n395 (1990)\n.  We have no doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty.  See Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.\xc2\xa0R. 3962, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa7501 (2009); America\xe2\x80\x99s Healthy Future Act of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa71301.  Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, we must observe that rewriting \xc2\xa75000A as a tax in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States according to their population.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl. 4.  Perhaps it is not (we have no need to address the point); but the meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and its application here is a question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-a-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief did not even address the question\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because, until today, no federal court has accepted the implausible argument that \xc2\xa75000A is an exercise of the tax power.  And once respondents raised the issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its reply brief to the issue.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Reply Brief 25.  At oral argument, the most prolonged statement about the issue was just over 50 words.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 79 (Mar. 27, 2012).

Having found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding that these suits do not have \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government and those who support its position on this point make the remarkable argument that \xc2\xa75000A is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, see Brief for Petitioners in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93398 (Anti-Injunction Act), but is a tax for constitutional purposes, see Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Minimum Coverage Brief 52\xe2\x80\x9362.  The rhetorical device that tries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is the same device employed in arguing that for constitutional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax: confusing the question of what Congress did with the question of what Congress could have done.  What qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike what qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is entirely within the control of Congress.  Compare Bailey v. George, \n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16, \n20 (1922)\n (Anti-Injunction Act barred suit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax Law), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36\xe2\x80\x9341 (holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 taxing power).  Congress could have defined \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude some exactions that in fact are \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  It might have prescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the taxing power \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be regarded as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  But there is no such prescription here.  What the Government would have us believe in  these cases is that the very same textual indications that show this is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act show that it is a tax under the Constitution.  That carries ver- bal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the sophists.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tThe Medicaid Expansion\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe now consider respondents\xe2\x80\x99 second challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to attach conditions to federal grants to the States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go along: termination of all the State\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid funding.

C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(D), and without 100% State participation in the Medicaid program, attainment of this goal would be thwarted.  Even if States could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program, while declining to participate in the Expansion, there would be a gaping hole in coverage.

(2) Is the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive?  We now turn to those questions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe answer to the first of these questions\xe2\x80\x94the meaning of coercion in the present context\xe2\x80\x94is straightforward.  As we have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntariness of the States\xe2\x80\x99 choice to accept or decline the offered package.  Therefore, if States really have no choice other than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the conditions cannot be sustained under the spending power.  And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear, theoretical voluntariness is not enough.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the spending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the State\xe2\x80\x99s federal highway funds on the State\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of a minimum drinking age of 21 years.  South Dakota argued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we disagreed, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress ha[d] directed only that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211. Because \xe2\x80\x9call South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5% of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified high- way grant programs,\xe2\x80\x9d we found that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress ha[d] of- fered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Thus, the decision whether to comply with the federal condition \xe2\x80\x9cremain[ed] the prerogative of the States not merely in theory but in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d and so the program at issue did not exceed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power.

The Federal Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are \xe2\x80\x9cfree, as a matter of law, to turn down\xe2\x80\x9d federal funds.  Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93400, p.\xc2\xa017 (emphasis added); see also id., at 25.  According to the Federal Government, neither the amount of the offered federal funds nor the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining whether there is impermissible coercion.  Id., at 41\xe2\x80\x9346.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument ignores reality.  When a heavy federal tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large grants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and to substitute a state alternative.  Even if a State believes that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient, withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge tax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents to support subsidies to participating States.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAcceptance of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpreta- tion of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dic- tate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the state or local level.  Suppose, for example, that Congress enacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the State\xe2\x80\x99s entire annual expenditures for primary and secondary education.  Suppose also that this funding came with conditions governing such things as school curriculum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of school districts, the length and hours of the school day, the  school calendar, a dress code for students, and rules for student discipline.  As a matter of law, a State could turn down that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not only be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support this expensive new program, but they would also be forced to pay an equivalent amount in state taxes.  And if the State gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivisions would surrender their traditional authority in the field of education.  Asked at oral argument whether such a law would be allowed under the spending power, the Solicitor General responded that it would.

In this case, however, there can be no doubt.  In structuring the ACA, Congress unambiguously signaled its belief that every State would have no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expansion.  If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case, then there is no such rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong support to the petitioner States\xe2\x80\x99 argument that refusing to accede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realistic option.

See  \xc2\xa71396a(a) (10)(A)(i)(VIII).  Any State that refuses to expand its Medicaid programs in this way is threatened with a severe sanction: the loss of all its federal Medicaid funds.

But the sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to state expenditures means that a State would be very hard pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by cutting other spending or raising additional revenue.  Arizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expenditures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government to provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s annual state expenditures of $17 billion.  See NASBO Report 7, 47.  Therefore, if Arizona lost federal Medicaid funding, the State would have to commit an additional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an equivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion Medicaid.  This means that the State would have to allocate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.

After Medicaid, the next biggest federal  funding item is aid to support elementary and secondary education, which amounts to 12.8% of total federal outlays to the States, see id., at 7, 16, and equals only 6.6% of all state expenditures combined.  See ibid.  In Arizona, for example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are equal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education funds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t See ibid.

For example, a nonparticipating State might be found to be ineligible for other major federal funding sources, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is premised on the expectation that States will participate in Medicaid.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7602(a)(3) (2006 ed.) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be \xe2\x80\x9celigible for medical assistance under the State[\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid] plan\xe2\x80\x9d).  And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medicaid program would not relieve a State\xe2\x80\x99s hospitals of their obligation under federal law to provide care for patients who are unable to pay for medical services.  The Emer- gency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, \xc2\xa71395dd, requires hospitals that receive any federal funding to provide stabilization care for indigent patients but does not offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out its mandate.  Many of these patients are now covered by Medicaid.  If providers could not look to the Medicaid program to pay for this care, they would find it exceed- ingly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were given substantial state support.  See, e.g., Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No 11\xe2\x80\x93400, p.\xc2\xa011.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the States\xe2\x80\x94go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding\xe2\x80\x94is quite unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spending-power case.  In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount that the States would have lost if every single State had refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking age was approximately $614.7 million\xe2\x80\x94or about 0.19% of all state expenditures combined.  See Nat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987\xe2\x80\x93 1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989), http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditure-report/archives.  South Dakota stood to lose, at most, funding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state expenditures.  See ibid.  Under the ACA, by contrast, the Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of all federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233 billion.  See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47.  South Dakota stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual state expenditures.  See id., at 7, 47.  Withholding $614.7 million, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures combined, is aptly characterized as \xe2\x80\x9crelatively mild encouragement,\xe2\x80\x9d but threatening to withhold $233 billion, equaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a different matter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal and structure of the ACA.  In crafting the ACA, Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care coverage.  To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that every person obtain a minimum level of coverage.  It attempts to reach this goal in several different ways.  The guaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are designed to make qualifying insurance available and affordable for persons with medical conditions that may require expensive care.  Other ACA provisions seek to make such policies more affordable for people of modest means.  Finally, for low-income individuals who are simply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded Medicaid, transforming it from a program covering only members of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a program that provides at least the requisite minimum level of coverage for the poor.  See 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a) (10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 1396u\xe2\x80\x937(a), (b)(5), 18022(a).  This design was intended to provide at least a specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans, but the achievement of that goal obviously depends on participation by every single State.  If any State\xe2\x80\x94not to mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit\xe2\x80\x94chose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping hole in the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true that some persons who are eligible for Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private insurance, either through their employers or by obtain- ing subsidized insurance through an exchange.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93400, at 12.  But the new federal subsidies are not available to those whose income is below the federal poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other than Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage and comply with the Mandate.  The Government counters that these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93400, at 49\xe2\x80\x9350, but that argument misses the point:  Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have coverage and the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s goal of near-universal coverage will be severely frustrated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf Congress had thought that States might actually refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Congress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that the most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously eligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold.  But nowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be found.  By contrast, because Congress thought that some States might decline federal funding for the operation of a \xe2\x80\x9chealth benefit exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress provided a backup scheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation of an exchange, the Federal Government will step in and operate an exchange in that State.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718041(c)(1).  Likewise, knowing that States would not necessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens lawfully present in the United States\xe2\x80\x94because Medicaid does not require States to provide such coverage\xe2\x80\x94Con- gress extended the availability of the new federal insurance subsidies to all aliens.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B(c) (1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals who are \xe2\x80\x9cnot eligible for the medicaid program .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by reason of [their] alien status\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress did not make these subsidies available for citizens with incomes below the poverty level because Congress obviously assumed that they would be covered by Medicaid.  If Congress had contemplated that some of these citizens would be left without Medicaid coverage as a result of a State\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely would have made them eligible for the tax subsidies provided for low-income aliens.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese features of the ACA convey an unmistakable message: Congress never dreamed that any State would refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid.  Congress well understood that refusal was not a practical option.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Government does not dispute the inference that Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it argues that this assumption was based on the fact that ACA\xe2\x80\x99s offer was an \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly generous\xe2\x80\x9d gift.  Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93400, at 50.  As the Federal Government sees things, Congress is like the generous benefactor who offers $1 million with few strings attached to 50 randomly selected individuals.  Just as this benefactor might assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap up his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would gratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go with the expansion of Medicaid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis characterization of the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s offer raises obvious questions.  If that offer is \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly generous,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Federal Government maintains, why have more than half the States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer is coercive?  And why did Congress find it necessary to threaten that any State refusing to accept this \xe2\x80\x9cexceed- ingly generous\xe2\x80\x9d gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds?  Congress could have made just the new funding provided under the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of the Medicaid Expansion.  Congress took such an approach in some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new coverage requirements and funding from the rest of the program so that only new funding was conditioned on new eligibility extensions.  See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, \n\n86Stat.\n1465.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to do otherwise here reflects its understanding that the ACA offer is not an \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly generous\xe2\x80\x9d gift that no State in its right mind would decline.  Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very substantial costs on participating States.  It is true that the Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs associated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying 100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals between 2014 and 2016.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396d(y).  But that is just part of the picture.  Participating States will be forced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after 2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the costs associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state spending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by 2020 as a consequence.  Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, CBO\xe2\x80\x99s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, p.\xc2\xa024 (Mar. 30, 2011); see also R. Bovbjerg, B. Ormond, &amp; V. Chen, Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, State Budgets under Federal Health Reform: The Extent and Causes of Variations in Estimated Impacts 4, n.\xc2\xa027 (Feb. 2011) (estimating new state spending at $43.2 billion through 2019).  After 2019, state spending is expected to increase at a faster rate; the CBO estimates new state spending at $60 billion through 2021.  Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, supra, at 24.  And these costs may increase in the future because of the very real possibility that the Federal Government will change funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds it will cover.  This would leave the States to bear an increasingly large percentage of the bill.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 74\xe2\x80\x9376 (Mar. 28, 2012).  Finally, after 2015, the States will have to pick up the tab for 50% of all administrative costs associated with implementing the new program, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396b(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(5), (7) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), costs that could approach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020, see Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid 30.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was one that Congress understood no State could refuse. The Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 spending power and cannot be implemented.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tF\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid Expansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional.  See Part IV\xe2\x80\x93A to IV\xe2\x80\x93E, supra; Part IV\xe2\x80\x93A, ante, at 45\xe2\x80\x9355 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., joined by Breyer and Kagan, JJ.).  Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional, the question of remedy arises.  The most natural remedy would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion.  However, the Government proposes\xe2\x80\x94in two cursory sentences at the very end of its brief\xe2\x80\x94preserving the Expansion.  Under its proposal, States would receive the additional Medi- caid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would keep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not expand eligibility.  We cannot accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reality that States were given no real choice but to expand Medicaid was not an accident.  Congress assumed States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on States\xe2\x80\x99 having no choice, because its Mandate requires low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion.  Furthermore, a State\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal might subject everyone in the State to much higher insurance premiums.  That is because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s insurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in more detail in the severability section below.  To make the Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s structure and design \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one.  This is no part of our duty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Trade-Mark Cases, \n\n100 U. S. 82, \n99 (1879)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWorse, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed remedy introduces a new dynamic: States must choose between expanding Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States.  If this divisive dynamic between and among States can be introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional choice, not by Court-invented interpretation.  We do not doubt that States are capable of making decisions when put in a tight spot.  We do doubt the authority of this Court to put them there.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government cites a severability clause codified with Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating that if \xe2\x80\x9cany provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71303 (2006 ed.).  But that clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7 should not be invalidated if \xc2\xa71396c, the authorization for the cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional.  It does not tell us that \xc2\xa71396c can be judicially revised, to say what it does not say.  Such a judicial power would not be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps the doctrine of amendatory invalidation\xe2\x80\x94similar to the amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.  The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that it would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but would leave it up to the Court what the \xe2\x80\x9cvalidated\xe2\x80\x9d legislation will contain.  The Court today opts for permitting the cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it might just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds that represent no more than x percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s bud- get.  The Court severs nothing, but simply revises \xc2\xa71396c to read as the Court would desire.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe should not accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it to retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds.  Worse, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a course for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has chosen; but under the Constitution, that power and authority do not rest with this Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tSeverability\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cnear-universal\xe2\x80\x9d health insurance coverage.  \xc2\xa718091(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The two pillars of the Act are the Individ- ual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.  In our view, both these central provisions of the Act\xe2\x80\x94the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\xe2\x80\x94are invalid.  It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well.  The following section explains the severability principles that require this conclusion.  This analysis also shows how closely interrelated the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for withdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV\xe2\x80\x93F, supra, which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act alters its dynamics.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the validity of the remaining provisions.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been well established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provision from the Judiciary Act of 1789.  And while the Court has sometimes applied \xe2\x80\x9cat least a modest presumption in favor of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. severability,\xe2\x80\x9d C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 144 (2010), it has not always done so, see, e.g., Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, \n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 172\n\xe2\x80\x93195 (1999).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn automatic or too cursory severance of statutory provisions risks \xe2\x80\x9crewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R.\xc2\xa0Co., \n\n295 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330, \n362 (1935)\n.  The Judiciary, if it orders uncritical severance, then assumes the legislative function; for it imposes on the Nation, by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decree, its own new statutory regime, consisting of policies, risks, and duties that Congress did not enact.  That can be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than striking the whole statute and allowing Congress to address the conditions that pertained when the statute was considered at the outset.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has applied a two-part guide as the framework for severability analysis.  The test has been deemed \xe2\x80\x9cwell established.\xe2\x80\x9d  Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, \n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678, \n684 (1987)\n.  First, if the Court holds a statutory provision unconstitutional, it then determines whether the now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con- gress intended.  If not, the remaining provisions must be invalidated.  See id., at 685.  In Alaska Airlines, the Court clarified that this first inquiry requires more than ask- ing whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe balance of the legislation is incapable of functioning independently.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 684.  Even if the remaining provisions will operate in some coherent way, that alone does not save the statute.  The question is whether the provisions will work as Congress intended.  The \xe2\x80\x9crelevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether the statute will function in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 685 (emphasis in original).

If Congress would not, those provisions, too, must be invalidated.  See Alaska Airlines, supra, at 685 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he unconstitu- tional provision must be severed unless the statute cre- ated in its absence is legislation that Congress would not have enacted\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Free Enterprise Fund, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 29) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text or historical context makes it \xe2\x80\x98evident\xe2\x80\x99 that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will\xe2\x80\x9d); Ayotte v.

In the ordinary course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate according to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted them (the second inquiry).  This close interaction may explain why the Court has not always been precise in distinguishing between the two.  There are, however, occasions in which the severability standard\xe2\x80\x99s first inquiry (statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining provisions to stand alone).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act was passed to enable affordable, \xe2\x80\x9cnear-universal\xe2\x80\x9d health insurance coverage.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(D). The resulting, complex statute consists of mandates and other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penalties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some governmental expenditures, decreases in others.  Under the severability test set out above, it must be determined if those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended, even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are themselves invalid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress did not intend to establish the goal of near-universal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.  See, e.g., ACA \xc2\xa71563, \n\n124Stat.\n270 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Act will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it did not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals.  The whole design of the Act is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set of regulated parties.  Thus, individuals are required to obtain health insurance.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(a).  Insur- ance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients\xe2\x80\x99 pre-existing conditions and to comply with a host of other regulations.  And the companies must pay new taxes.

States are expected to expand Medicaid eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces called ex- changes where individuals can purchase insurance.  See 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (Medicaid Expansion), 18031 (exchanges).  Some persons who cannot afford insurance are provided it through the Medicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on health-insurance exchanges.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B (2006 ed., Supp. IV), \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal subsidies).  The Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s increased spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal expenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in federal payments to hospitals.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa71395ww(r) (Medicare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, \n\n124Stat.\n847 (\xe2\x80\x9cRev- enue Offset Provisions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Employers with at least 50 employees must either provide employees with adequate health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance through an exchange.  See 26\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74980H (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to individuals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers\xe2\x80\x94while, at the same time, offsetting significant portions of those costs with new benefits to each group.  For ex- ample, the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals.  Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments to hospitals.  Insurance companies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed issue\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity rating\xe2\x80\x9d requirements to give coverage regardless of the insured\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate to buy the insurers\xe2\x80\x99 product and from the new low- income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance companies\xe2\x80\x99 Medicaid-funded managed care programs.  In summary, the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset increases in federal spending.  So, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s major provisions are interdependent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act then refers to these interdependencies as \xe2\x80\x9cshared responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, \n\n124Stat.\n242 (\xe2\x80\x9cShared Responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d); ACA \xc2\xa71501, ibid.

To be sure, an argument can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the parties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonseverable.  The response to this argument is that our cases do not support it.  See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co. of La., \n\n278 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235\n\xe2\x80\x93244 (1929) (holding nonseverable statutory provisions that did not burden the parties).  It would be particularly destructive of sound government to apply such a rule with regard to a multifaceted piece of legislation like the ACA.  It would take years, perhaps decades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated separately\xe2\x80\x94and for some of them (those simply expending federal funds) no one may have separate standing.  The Federal Government, the States, and private parties ought to know at once whether the entire legislation fails.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe opinion now explains in Part V\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x931, infra, why the Act\xe2\x80\x99s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion.  It proceeds from the insurance regulations and taxes (C\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x93a), to the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions (C\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x93b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x93c), and the employer responsibility assessment (C\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x93d).

That result follows from the undoubted inability of the other major provisions to operate as Congress intended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion.  Absent the invalid portions, the other major provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected bur- dens on patients, the health-care community, and the federal budget.

Like the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and taxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknowable.  It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure nor predict.

The ACA\xe2\x80\x99s $455 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434-billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion.  See CBO Estimate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed Congress to find that the ACA \xe2\x80\x9cwill reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwill continue to reduce budget deficits after 2019.\xe2\x80\x9d  ACA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71563(a)(1), (2), \n\n124Stat.\n270.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat finding was critical to the ACA.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshared responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d concept extends to the federal budget.  Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with budget cuts and tax increases.  That is why the United States has explained in the course of this litigation that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure that any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was offset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum in  Support of Government\xe2\x80\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 3\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9391, p. 41.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer be needed to offset the costs of the Medicaid Expansion, the reductions would no longer operate in the manner Congress intended.

The exchanges cannot operate in the manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate, Medicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot remain in force.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act\xe2\x80\x99s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars to subsidize individuals\xe2\x80\x99 purchases on the exchanges.  In- dividuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance to the individual purchaser.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B (2006 ed., Supp. IV); \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to receive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.  See CBO, Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9319 (Mar. 30, 2011).  Without the community-rating insurance regulation, however, the average federal subsidy could be much higher; for community rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums unhealthy individuals would otherwise pay.  Federal subsidies would make up much of the difference.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe result would be an unintended boon to insurance companies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and a corresponding breakdown of the \xe2\x80\x9cshared responsibil- ity\xe2\x80\x9d between the industry and the federal budget that Congress intended.  Thus, the federal subsidies must be invalidated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insurance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance on the exchanges.  Under the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, few, if any, individuals would want to buy individual insurance policies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies would be unavailable outside of an exchange.  Difficulty in attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the exchanges\xe2\x80\x99 onerous regulations.

Without the federal subsidies, individ- uals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling to offer insurance inside of exchanges.  With fewer buyers and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is a second reason why, if community rating is invalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner consistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s design.  A key purpose of an exchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options where prices are standardized regardless of the buy- er\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing conditions.  See ibid.  An individual who shops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate different insurance products.  The products will offer different benefits and prices.  Congress designed the exchanges so the shopper can compare benefits and prices.  But the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress designed if the prices depend on the shopper\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing health conditions.  The prices would vary from person to person.  So without community rating\xe2\x80\x94which prohibits insurers from basing the price of insurance on pre-existing conditions\xe2\x80\x94the exchanges cannot operate in the manner Congress intended.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\td\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tEmployer-Responsibility Assessment\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe employer responsibility assessment provides an incentive for employers with at least 50 employees to provide their employees with health insurance options that meet minimum criteria.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74980H (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  Unlike the Individual Mandate, the employer-responsibility assessment does not require employers to provide an insurance option.  Instead, it re- quires them to make a payment to the Federal Government if they do not offer insurance to employees and if insurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who qualifies for the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s federal subsidies.

First, the ACA makes a direct link between the employer-responsibility assessment and the exchanges.  The financial assessment against employers occurs only under certain conditions.  One of them is the purchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange.  With no exchanges, there are no purchases on the exchanges; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is nothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals (the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regu- lations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the Federal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges and for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reductions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employer-responsibility assessment would upset the ACA\xe2\x80\x99s design of \xe2\x80\x9cshared responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  It would leave employers as the only parties bearing any significant responsibility.

For example, the tax increases are \xe2\x80\x9cRevenue Offset Provisions\xe2\x80\x9d designed to help offset the cost to the Federal Government of programs like the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges\xe2\x80\x99 federal subsidies.  See Title IX, Subtitle A\xe2\x80\x94Revenue Offset Provisions, \n\n124Stat.\n847.  With the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invalidated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs, and they no longer serve the purpose in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of \xe2\x80\x9cshared responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSome provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability.  There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently.  The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the con- text of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unre- lated\xe2\x80\x94hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition, or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support.  When we are confronted with such a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas tree,\xe2\x80\x9d a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous.  We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own.  It is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which.  To sever the statute in that manner \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one.

It is not.  It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching.  It creates a debilitated, inoperable version of health-care regulation that Congress did not enact and the public does not expect.  It makes enactment of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions that certain interests favored under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new design will struggle to retain.  And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, invented and atextual as it is, does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional difficulties.  It creates them.  The holding that the Individual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional question (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves with inadequate deliberation.  And the judgment on the Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism concerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union.  Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must subsidize, by the federal tax dollars taken from their citizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid Expansion.  If that destabilizing political dynamic, so antagonistic to a harmonious Union, is to be introduced at all, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe values that should have determined our course today are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that the Federal Government is one of limited powers.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling undermines those values at every turn.  In the name of restraint, it overreaches.  In the name of constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional questions.  In the name of cooperative federalism, it undermines state sovereignty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Constitution, though it dates from the founding of the Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance to our own times.  The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure.  Structural protections\xe2\x80\x94notably, the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers\xe2\x80\x94are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments.  Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens.  It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most im- portant ones, for which reason they alone were embod- ied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment.  The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty, and when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril.

Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment shall be \xe2\x80\x9cassessed and collected\xe2\x80\x9d in the same manner as a tax and that no suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of the payment.
