Scott Appling fell behind on his bills owed to petitioner law firm Lamar, Archer &amp; Cofrin, LLP, which threatened to withdraw representation and place a lien on its work product if Appling did not pay.  Appling told Lamar that he could cover owed and future legal expenses with an expected tax refund, so Lamar agreed to continue representation.  However, Appling used the refund, which was for much less than he had stated, for business expenses.  When he met with Lamar again, he told the firm he was still waiting on the refund, so Lamar agreed to complete pending litigation.  Appling never paid the final invoice, so Lamar sued him and obtained a judgment.  Shortly thereafter, Appling and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Lamar initiated an adversary proceeding against Appling in Bankruptcy Court, arguing that his debt to Lamar was nondischargeable pursuant to\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A), which bars discharge of specified debts arising from \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s . . . financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appling moved to dismiss on the ground that his alleged misrepresentations were \xe2\x80\x9cstatement[s] respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial condition,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) requires to be \xe2\x80\x9cin writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Bankruptcy Court disagreed and denied Appling\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  Finding that Appling knowingly made two false representations on which Lamar justifiably relied and that Lamar incurred damages as a result, the court concluded that Appling\xe2\x80\x99s debt to Lamar was nondischargeable under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  The District Court affirmed, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d may include a statement about a single asset.  Because Appling\xe2\x80\x99s statements were not in writing, the court held, \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) did not bar him from discharging his debt to Lamar.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: A statement about a single asset can be a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The key word in the relevant statutory phrase here is the preposition \xe2\x80\x9crespecting.\xe2\x80\x9d  In ordinary usage, \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning; about; regarding; in regard to; relating to.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lamar contends that the definitions \xe2\x80\x9cabout,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwith reference to,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cas regards\xe2\x80\x9d denote a more limited scope than \xe2\x80\x9crelated to.\xe2\x80\x9d  And under that more limited meaning, Lamar asserts, a formal financial statement providing a detailed accounting of one\xe2\x80\x99s assets and liabilities would qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ca statement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition,\xe2\x80\x9d but a statement about a single asset would not.  But the overlapping and circular definitions of these words belie the clear distinction Lamar attempts to impose.  And the firm gives no example of a phrase in a legal context similar to the one at issue here in which toggling between \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabout\xe2\x80\x9d has any pertinent significance.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Use of the word \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d in a legal context generally has a broadening effect, ensuring that a provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope covers not only its subject but also matters relating to that subject.  Cf. <i>Kleppe</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 529, 539.  Indeed, this Court has typically read the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one of respecting\xe2\x80\x99s meanings\xe2\x80\x94expansively.  See, <i>e.g</i>., <i>Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Nevils</i>, 581 U. S. ___, ___.  Appling and the United States, as <i>amicus curiae</i>, accordingly advance an expansive interpretation here.   This Court agrees with them that, given the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crespecting,\xe2\x80\x9d Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s statutory construction must be rejected, for it reads \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.  See <i>TRW Inc.</i> v. <i>Andrews</i>,\n\n534 U. S. 19, 31.  Had Congress intended \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) to encompass only statements expressing the balance of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and liabilities, it could have so specified\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g</i>., \xe2\x80\x9cstatement of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court also agrees that a statement is \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition if it has a direct relation to or impact on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial status.  A single asset has a direct relation to and impact on aggregate financial condition, so a statement about that asset bears on a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial condition and can help indicate whether a debtor is solvent or insolvent.  A statement about a single asset, thus, can be a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would yield incoherent results.  For instance, on Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s view, a misrepresentation about a single asset made in the context of a formal financial statement or balance sheet would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d and trigger \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s heightened nondischargeability requirements, but the same misrepresentation made on its own, or in the context of a list of some but not all of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and liabilities, would not.  Lamar does not explain why Congress would draw such seemingly arbitrary distinctions.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The statutory history of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d corroborates this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  Between 1926, when the phrase was introduced, and 1978, when Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code, Courts of Appeals consistently construed the phrase to encompass statements addressing just one or some of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets or liabilities.  When Congress used the materially same language in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2), it presumptively was aware of this longstanding judicial interpretation and intended for the phrase to retain its established meaning.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments are unpersuasive.  First, Lamar contends that Appling\xe2\x80\x99s construction gives \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) an implausibly broad reach, such that little would be covered by \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule rendering nondischargeable debts arising from \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  But \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) still retains significant function when the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d is interpreted to encompass a statement about a single asset.  See, <i>e.g., Husky Int\xe2\x80\x99l Electronics, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ritz</i>, 578 U. S. ___, ___.  Second, Lamar asserts that Appling\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is inconsistent with the overall principle that the Bankruptcy Code exists to afford relief only to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98honest but unfortunate debtor.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cohen </i>v<i>. de la Cruz, </i>\n\n523 U. S. 213, 217.  The text of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2), however, plainly heightens the bar to discharge when the fraud at issue was effectuated via a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  The heightened requirements, moreover, are not a shield for dishonest debtors.  Rather, they reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to balance the potential misuse of such statements by both debtors and creditors.

Scott Appling hired petitioner Lamar, Archer &amp; Cofrin, LLP (Lamar), a law firm, to represent him in a business litigation.  Appling fell behind on his legal bills, and by March 2005, he owed Lamar more than $60,000.  Lamar informed Appling that if he did not pay the outstanding amount, the firm would withdraw from representation and place a lien on its work product until the bill was paid.  The parties met in person that month, and Appling told his attorneys that he was expecting a tax refund of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98approximately $100,000,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d enough to cover his owed and future legal fees.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  Lamar relied on this statement and continued to represent Appling without initiating collection of the overdue amount.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When Appling and his wife filed their tax return, however, the refund they requested was of just $60,718, and they ultimately received $59,851 in October 2005.  Rather than paying Lamar, they spent the money on their business.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Appling and his attorneys met again in November 2005, and Appling told them that he had not yet received the refund.  Lamar relied on that statement and agreed to complete the pending litigation and delay collection of the outstanding fees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In March 2006, Lamar sent Appling its final invoice.  Five years later, Appling still had not paid, so Lamar filed suit in Georgia state court and obtained a judgment for $104,179.60.  Shortly thereafter, Appling and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lamar initiated an adversary proceeding against Appling in Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Georgia.  The firm argued that because Appling made fraudulent statements about his tax refund at the March and November 2005 meetings, his debt to Lamar was nondischargeable pursuant to\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A), which governs debts arising from \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appling, in turn, moved to dismiss, contending that his alleged misrepresentations were \xe2\x80\x9cstatement[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. respecting [his] financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d and were therefore governed by \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B), such that Lamar could not block discharge of the debt because the statements were not \xe2\x80\x9cin writing\xe2\x80\x9d as required for nondischargeability under that provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Bankruptcy Court held that a statement regarding a single asset is not a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d and denied Appling\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  500 B.\xc2\xa0R. 246, 252 (MD Ga. 2013).  After a trial, the Bankruptcy Court found that Appling knowingly made two false representations on which Lamar justifiably relied and that Lamar incurred damages as a result.

When \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d is understood to have one of these more limited meanings, Lamar asserts, a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca statement that is \xe2\x80\x98about,\xe2\x80\x99 or that makes \xe2\x80\x98reference to,\xe2\x80\x99 the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial state or well-being.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.

The interconnected web formed by these words belies the clear distinction Lamar attempts to impose.

In its view, a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9ca representation about a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s asset that is offered as evidence of ability to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11.  Although Appling does not include \xe2\x80\x9cability to pay\xe2\x80\x9d in his proffered definition, he and the United States agree that their respective formulations are functionally the same and lead to the same results.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 50\xe2\x80\x9352, 58.  That is so because to establish the requisite materiality and reliance, a creditor opposing discharge must explain why it viewed the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s false representation as relevant to the decision to extend money, property, services, or credit.  If a given statement did not actually serve as evidence of ability to pay, the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation will not suffice to bar discharge.  But if the creditor proves materiality and reliance, it will be clear the statement was one \xe2\x80\x9crespecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether a statement about a single asset served as evidence of ability to pay thus ultimately always factors into the \xc2\xa7523(a)(2) inquiry at some point.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We agree with both Appling and the United States that, given the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crespecting,\xe2\x80\x9d Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s preferred statutory construction\xe2\x80\x94that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d means only a statement that captures the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial status\xe2\x80\x94must be rejected, for it reads \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.  See <i>TRW Inc.</i> v. <i>Andrews</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19, 31 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] statute ought .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be so construed that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Had Congress intended \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) to encompass only statements expressing the balance of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and liabilities, there are several ways in which it could have so specified, <i>e.g., </i>\xe2\x80\x9cstatement disclosing the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstatement of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  But Congress did not use such narrow language.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We also agree that a statement is \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\xe2\x80\x9d a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition if it has a direct relation to or impact on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial status.  A single asset has a direct relation to and impact on aggregate financial condition, so a statement about a single asset bears on a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial condition and can help indicate whether a debtor is solvent or insolvent, able to repay a given debt or not.  Naturally, then, a statement about a single asset can be a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Further supporting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is that  Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would yield incoherent results.  On Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s view, the following would obtain: A misrepresentation about a single asset made in the context of a formal financial statement or balance sheet would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d and trigger \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s heightened nondischargeability requirements, but the exact same misrepresentation made on its own, or in the context of a list of some but not all of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and liabilities, would not.  Lamar does not explain why Congress would draw such seemingly arbitrary distinctions, where the ability to discharge a debt turns on the superficial packaging of a statement rather than its substantive content.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, a highly general statement like, \xe2\x80\x9cI am above water,\xe2\x80\x9d would need to be in writing to foreclose discharge, whereas a highly specific statement like, \xe2\x80\x9cI have $200,000 of equity in my house,\xe2\x80\x9d would not.  This, too, is inexplicably bizarre.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Lastly, the statutory history of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d corroborates our reading of the text.  That language can be traced back to a 1926 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 that prohibited discharge entirely to a debtor who had \xe2\x80\x9cobtained money or property on credit, or obtained an extension or renewal of credit, by making or publishing, or causing to be made or published, in any manner whatsoever, a materially false statement in writing respecting his financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of May 27, 1926, \xc2\xa76,\n\n44Stat.\n663\xe2\x80\x93664.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When Congress again amended this provision in 1960, it retained the \xe2\x80\x9cstatement in writing respecting .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d language.  See Act of July 12, 1960, Pub. L. 86\xe2\x80\x93621, \xc2\xa72,\n\n74Stat.\n409.  Congress then once more preserved that language when it rewrote and recodified the provision in the modern Bankruptcy Code as \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the historical presence of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition,\xe2\x80\x9d lower courts had ample opportunity to weigh in on its meaning.  Between 1926, when the phrase was introduced, and 1978, when Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code, Courts of Appeals consistently construed the phrase to encompass statements addressing just one or some of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets or liabilities.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  When Congress used the materially same language in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2), it presumptively was aware of the longstanding judicial interpretation of the phrase and intended for it to retain its established meaning.  See <i>Lorillard</i> v. <i>Pons</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, 580 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Bragdon</i> v. <i>Abbott</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 645 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its administrative and judicial interpretations as well\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to its plain-text arguments discussed and rejected above, see <i>supra,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x937, Lamar contends that Appling\xe2\x80\x99s rule undermines the purpose of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2) in two ways.  Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First, Lamar contends that Appling\xe2\x80\x99s construction gives \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) an implausibly broad reach, such that little would be covered by \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule rendering nondischargeable debts arising from \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not so.  Decisions from this Court and several lower courts considering the application of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) demonstrate that the provision still retains significant function when the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d is interpreted to encompass a statement about a single asset.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 523(a)(2)(A) has been applied when a debt arises from \xe2\x80\x9cforms of fraud, like fraudulent conveyance schemes, that can be effected without a false representation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Husky Int\xe2\x80\x99l Electronics, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ritz</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  It also has been used to bar the discharge of debts resulting from misrepresentations about the value of goods, property, and services.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Second, Lamar asserts that Appling\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is inconsistent with the overall principle that the Bankruptcy Code exists to afford relief only to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98honest but unfortunate debtor,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cohen</i>, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 217, because it leaves \xe2\x80\x9cfraudsters\xe2\x80\x9d free to \xe2\x80\x9cswindle innocent victims for money, property or services by lying about their finances, then discharge the resulting debt in bankruptcy, just so long as they do so orally.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 35.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This general maxim, however, provides little support for Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  The text of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2) plainly heightens the bar to discharge when the fraud at issue was effectuated via a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  The heightened requirements, moreover, are not a shield for dishonest debtors.  Rather, they reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to balance the potential misuse of such statements by both debtors and creditors.  As the Court has explained previously:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe House Report on the [Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978] suggests that Congress wanted to moderate the burden on individuals who submitted false financial statements, not because lies about financial condition are less blameworthy than others, but because the relative equities might be affected by practices of consumer finance companies, which sometimes have encouraged such falsity by their borrowers for the very purpose of insulating their own claims from discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Field</i> v. <i>Mans</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59, 76\xe2\x80\x9377 (1995).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Specifically, as detailed in <i>Field</i>, the House Report noted that consumer finance companies frequently collected information from loan applicants in ways designed to permit the companies to later use those statements as the basis for an exception to discharge.  Commonly, a loan officer would instruct a loan applicant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to list only a few or only the most important of his debts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on a form with too little space to supply a complete list of debts, even though the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I have no other debts,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d would be printed at the bottom of the form or the applicant would be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98instructed to write the phrase in his own handwriting.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 77, n.\xc2\xa013.  If the debtor later filed for bankruptcy, the creditor would contend that the debtor had made misrepresentations in his loan application and the creditor would threaten litigation over excepting the debt from discharge.  That threat was \xe2\x80\x9coften enough to induce the debtor to settle for a reduced sum,\xe2\x80\x9d even where the merits of the nondischargeability claim were weak.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93595, p. 131 (1977).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notably, Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cstatement respecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition\xe2\x80\x9d would not bring within \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s reach the very types of statements the House Report described, because those debts-only statements said nothing about assets and thus did not communicate fully the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial status.  Yet in <i>Field</i>, the Court explained that the heightened requirements for nondischargeability under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(B) were intended to address creditor abuse involving such statements.  516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 76\xe2\x80\x9377.
