The District Judge refused this instruction. In affirming petitioner\'s RICO conspiracy conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that, to be convicted of conspiracy to violate 1962(c), a defendant need only agree to the commission of two predicate acts of racketeering activity, and need not agree to personally commit those acts. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/759/1099/">759 F.2d 1099</a>, 1116 (1985). </p><p> The Courts of Appeals disagree as to the proper interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(d), the RICO conspiracy statute. Some require, as the predicate for conviction under 1962(d) of conspiracy to violate 1962(c ), an agreement to personally commit two acts of racketeering activity. See, e.g., United States v.

Other Courts of Appeals agree with the Third Circuit that 1962(d) also makes unlawful an agreement that another violate 1962(c) by committing two acts of racketeering activity. See, e.g., United States v. Carter, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/721/1514/">721 F.2d 1514</a>, 1529-1531 (CA11), cert. denied sub nom. Morris v.

Russello v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/case.html#26">464 U.S. 16, 26</a>, 302 (1983). If the Third Circuit\'s interpretation of 1962(d) is correct, Congress\' intent is being frustrated in those circuits which adhere to the narrower view of RICO conspiracy. If the Third Circuit\'s interpretation is incorrect, defendants are being exposed to conviction for behavior Congress did not intend to reach under 1962(d). I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals. </ul><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] In writing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. 1961 et seq., Congress defined three new substantive offenses, 18 U.S.C. 1962(a), (b), (c), and also made it unlawful to conspire to commit these substantive offenses, 18 U.S.C. 1962(d). Title 18 U.S.C. 1962(c), the relevant substantive offense in this case, provides:</p><ul>"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\'s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."</ul> <p> Title 18 U.S.C. 1961(5) provides that the term "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, a term which in turn is defined at 18 U.S.C. 1961(1). </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
