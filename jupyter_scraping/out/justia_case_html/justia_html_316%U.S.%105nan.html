S. 106</a></p><p></p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>In this case, the National Labor Relations Board found that respondent, in refusing to reemploy a number of its former employees and to employ two new applicants, had discriminated against them in order to discourage membership in a labor union in violation of \xc2\xa7 8(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 151 <em>et seq.</em>  The Board made its order directing employment of these individuals with backpay.  The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board\'s order on the ground that its findings were without substantial support in the evidence.  122 F.2d 587.</p>\n<p>Examination of the record discloses that there was substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded that respondent\'s refusal to employ the men was motivated by its belief that they had engaged or threatened to engage in destruction of respondent\'s property and had threatened to injure some of respondent\'s managerial employees and members of their families.  There was also substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded, as it did, that respondent\'s motive for refusing the employment was discouragement of membership in a labor union.  The possibility of drawing either of two inconsistent inferences from the evidence did not prevent the Board from drawing one of them, as the court below seems to have thought.</p>\n<p>We have repeatedly held that Congress, by providing, \xc2\xa7 10(c), (e), and (f), of the National Labor Relations Act, that the Board\'s findings "as to the Facts, if supported by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 316 U. S. 107</a></p><p> evidence, shall be conclusive," precludes the courts from weighing evidence in reviewing the Board\'s orders, and if the findings of the Board are supported by evidence, the courts are not free to set them aside even though the Board could have drawn different inferences.  <em>Labor Board v.
