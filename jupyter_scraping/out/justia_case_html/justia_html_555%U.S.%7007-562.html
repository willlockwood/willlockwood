The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, finding the state-law claim pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (Labeling Act).

The Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s stated purposes are to inform the public of the health risks of smoking while protecting commerce and the economy from the ill effects of nonuniform requirements to the extent consistent with the first goal.  Although fidelity to these purposes does not demand the pre-emption of state fraud rules, the principal question here is whether that result is nevertheless required by 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71334(b), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not expressly pre-empted by \xc2\xa71334(b).

The <em>Cipollone </em>plurality concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98based on smoking and health\xe2\x80\x99 fairly but narrowly construed\xe2\x80\x9d did not pre-empt the <em>Cipollone</em> plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s common-law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepresented and concealed a material fact, because the claim alleged a violation of a duty not to deceive\xe2\x80\x94a duty that is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d smoking and health.  505 U.

Respondents here also allege a violation of the duty not to deceive as codified in the MUTPA, which, like the common-law duty in <em>Cipollone</em>, has nothing to do with smoking and health.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not analogous to the \xe2\x80\x9cwarning neutralization\xe2\x80\x9d claim found to be pre-empted in <em>Cipollone</em>.  <em>Reilly</em> is consistent with <em>Cipollone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.

Specifically, they allege that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 advertising fraudulently conveyed the message that their \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes deliver less tar and nicotine to consumers than regular brands despite petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge that the message was untrue.  Petitioners deny the charge, asserting that their advertisements were factually accurate.  The merits of the dispute are not before us because the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of petitioners on the ground that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state-law claim is pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, as amended (Labeling Act).  The Court of Appeals reversed that judgment, and we granted certiorari to review its holding that the Labeling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empts respondents\xe2\x80\x99 fraud claim.  We affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents are Maine residents and longtime smokers of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes, which are manufactured by petitioners.  Invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court, respondents filed a complaint alleging that petitioners deliberately deceived them about the true and harmful nature of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes in violation of the MUTPA, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \xc2\xa7207 (Supp. 2008).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondents claim that petitioners fraudulently marketed their cigarettes as being \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and containing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[l]owered [t]ar and [n]icotine\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to convey to consumers that they deliver less tar and nicotine and are therefore less harmful than regular cigarettes.  App. 28a\xe2\x80\x9329a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents acknowledge that testing pursuant to the Cambridge Filter Method[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] indicates that tar and nicotine yields of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights are lower than those of regular cigarettes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 30a.  Respondents allege, however, that petitioners have known at all relevant times that human smokers unconsciously engage in compensatory behaviors not registered by Cambridge Filter Method testing that negate the effect of the tar- and nicotine-reducing features of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes.  <em>Id</em>., at 30a\xe2\x80\x9331a.  By covering filter ventilation holes with their lips or fingers, taking larger or more frequent puffs, and holding the smoke in their lungs for a longer period of time, smokers of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes unknowingly inhale as much tar and nicotine as do smokers of regular cigarettes.  <em>Ibid. </em> \xe2\x80\x9cLight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes are in fact more harmful because the increased ventilation that results from their unique design features produces smoke that is more mutagenic per milligram of tar than the smoke of regular cigarettes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 31a\xe2\x80\x9332a.  Respondents claim that petitioners violated the MUTPA by fraudulently concealing that information and by affirmatively representing, through the use of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clowered tar and nicotine\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors, that their cigarettes would pose fewer health risks.  <em>Id.</em>, at 32a, 33a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Labeling Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71334(b), expressly pre-empts respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state-law cause of action.  Relying on our decisions in <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/504/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/504/index.html">505 U.

S. 525</a> (2001), the District Court concluded that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 MUTPA claim is pre-empted.  The court recast respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim as a failure-to-warn or warning neutralization claim of the kind pre-empted in <em>Cipollone:</em> The claim charges petitioners with \xe2\x80\x9cproduc[ing] a product it knew contained hidden risks \xe2\x80\xa6 not apparent or known to the consumer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a claim that \xe2\x80\x9cruns to what [petitioners] actually said about Lights and what [respondents] claim they should have said.\xe2\x80\x9d  436 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 132, 151 (Me. 2006).  And the difference between what petitioners said and what respondents would have them say is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intertwined with the concern about cigarette smoking and health.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 153 (quoting <em>Reilly</em>, 533 U. S., at 548).  The District Court thus concluded that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim rests on a state-law requirement based on smoking and health of precisely the kind that \xc2\xa71334(b) pre-empts, and it granted summary judgment for petitioners.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed.  The Court of Appeals first rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim as a warning neutralization claim akin to the pre-empted claim in <em>Cipollone</em>.  501 F.\xc2\xa03d 29, 37, 40 (CA1 2007).  Instead, the court concluded that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is in substance a fraud claim that alleges that petitioners falsely represented their cigarettes as \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d or having \xe2\x80\x9clowered tar and nicotine\xe2\x80\x9d even though they deliver to smokers the same quantities of those components as do regular cigarettes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that these alleged misrepresentations were unaccompanied by additional statements in the nature of a warning does not transform the claimed fraud into failure to warn\xe2\x80\x9d or warning neutralization.  <em>Id.</em>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  Finding respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim indistinguishable from the non-pre-empted fraud claim at issue in <em>Cipollone</em>, the Court of Appeals held that it is not expressly pre-empted.  The court also rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is impliedly pre-empted because their success on that claim would stand as an obstacle to the purported policy of the FTC allowing the use of descriptive terms that convey Cambridge Filter Method test results.  Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not expressly pre-empted, the Court of Appeals considered and rejected the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in a similar case.  501 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 45.  Unlike the court below, the Fifth Circuit likened the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to the use of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors to <em>Cipollone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s warning neutralization claim and thus found it expressly pre-empted.  <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, 479 F.\xc2\xa03d 383, 392\xe2\x80\x93393 (2007).

Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute\xe2\x80\x99s express language or through its structure and purpose.  See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/index.html">430 U. S. 519</a>, 525 (1977).  If a federal law contains an express pre-emption clause, it does not immediately end the inquiry because the question of the substance and scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 displacement of state law still remains.  Pre-emptive intent may also be inferred if the scope of the statute indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy the legislative field, or if there is an actual conflict between state and federal law.  <em>Freightliner Corp.</em> v. <em>Myrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/280/index.html">514 U.

The Act required that every package of cigarettes sold in the United States contain a conspicuous warning, and it pre-empted state-law positive enactments that added to the federally prescribed warning.  79 Stat. 283.  Congress amended the Labeling Act a few years later by enacting the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The amendments strengthened the language of the prescribed warning, 84 Stat. 88, and prohibited cigarette advertising in \xe2\x80\x9cany medium of electronic communication subject to [FCC] jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 89.  They also broadened the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  See<em> Cipollone</em>, 505 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion) (discussing the difference in scope of the pre-emption clauses of the 1965 and 1969 Acts).  The Labeling Act has since been amended further to require cigarette manufacturers to include four more explicit warnings in their packaging and advertisements on a rotating basis.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The stated purpose of the Labeling Act is</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cto establish a comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health, whereby\xe2\x80\x94 </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) the public may be adequately informed that cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health by inclusion of a warning to that effect on each package of cigarettes; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) commerce and the national economy may be (A) protected to the maximum extent consistent with this declared policy and (B) not impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\xe2\x80\x9d  79 Stat. 282, 15 U.

Section 5(a) protects cigarette manufacturers from inconsistent state labeling laws by prohibiting the requirement of additional statements relating to smoking and health on cigarette packages.  15 U.

Section 5(b), which is at issue in this case, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71334(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Together, the labeling requirement and pre-emption provisions express Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the prescribed federal warnings are both necessary and sufficient to achieve its purpose of informing the public of the health consequences of smoking.  Because Congress has decided that no additional warning statement is needed to attain that goal, States may not impede commerce in cigarettes by enforcing rules that are based on an assumption that the federal warnings are inadequate.  Although both of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes are furthered by prohibiting States from supplementing the federally prescribed warning, neither would be served by limiting the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to prohibit deceptive statements in cigarette advertising.  Petitioners acknowledge that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress had no intention of insulating tobacco companies from liability for inaccurate statements about the relationship between smoking and health.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 28.  But they maintain that Congress could not have intended to permit the enforcement of <em>state</em> fraud rules because doing so would defeat the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of preventing nonuniform state warning requirements.  15 U.

To determine whether a particular common-law claim is pre-empted, the plurality inquired \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages action constitutes a \xe2\x80\x98requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 advertising or promotion,\xe2\x80\x99 giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 524.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this standard, the plurality held that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepresented and concealed a material fact was not pre-empted.  That claim alleged a violation of the manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 duty not to deceive\xe2\x80\x94a duty that is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d smoking and health.  <em>Id.</em>, at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.  Respondents in this case also allege a violation of the duty not to deceive as that duty is codified in the MUTPA.  The duty codified in that state statute, like the duty imposed by the state common-law rule at issue in <em>Cipollone</em>, has nothing to do with smoking and health.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners endeavor to distance themselves from that holding by arguing that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is more analogous to the \xe2\x80\x9cwarning neutralization\xe2\x80\x9d claim found to be pre-empted in <em>Cipollone</em>.  Although the plurality understood the plaintiff to have presented that claim as a \xe2\x80\x9ctheory of fraudulent misrepresentation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 528, the gravamen of the claim was the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 failure to warn, as it was \xe2\x80\x9cpredicated on a state-law prohibition against statements in advertising and promotional materials that tend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 527.  Thus understood, the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the warning neutralization claim has no application in this case.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners nonetheless contend that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is like the pre-empted warning neutralization claim because it is based on statements that \xe2\x80\x9cmight create a false impression\xe2\x80\x9d rather than statements that are \xe2\x80\x9cinherently false.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 39.  But the extent of the falsehood alleged does not alter the nature of the claim.  Nothing in the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s text or purpose or in the plurality opinion in <em>Cipollone </em>suggests that whether a claim is pre-empted turns in any way on the distinction between misleading and inherently false statements.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 misunderstanding is the same one that led the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, when confronted with a \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors claim, to reach a result at odds with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision in this case.  See <em>Brown</em>,<em> </em>479 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 391\xe2\x80\x93393.  Certainly, the extent of the falsehood alleged may bear on whether a plaintiff can prove her fraud claim, but the merits of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim are not before us.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once that erroneous distinction is set aside, it is clear that our holding in <em>Cipollone </em>that the common-law fraud claim was not pre-empted is directly applicable to the statutory claim at issue in this case.  As was true of the claim in <em>Cipollone</em>, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the deceptive statements \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clowered tar and nicotine\xe2\x80\x9d induced them to purchase petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 product alleges a breach of the duty not to deceive.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  To be sure, the presence of the federally mandated warnings may bear on the materiality of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly fraudulent statements, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that possibility does not change [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] case from one about the statements into one about the warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 44.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Reilly</em> is consistent with <em>Cipollone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  <em>Reilly </em>involved regulations promulgated by the Massachusetts attorney general \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in order to address the incidence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use by children under legal age \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] in order to prevent access to such products by underage customers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U. S., at 533 (quoting 940 Code Mass. Regs. \xc2\xa721.01 (2000)).  The regulations did not pertain to the content of any advertising; rather, they placed a variety of restrictions on certain cigarette sales and the location of outdoor and point-of-sale cigarette advertising.  The attorney general promulgated those restrictions pursuant to his statutory authority to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices.  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93A, \xc2\xa72 (West 1996).  But although the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s authority derived from a general deceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this case, the challenged regulations targeted advertising that tended to promote tobacco use by children instead of prohibiting false or misleading statements.  Thus, whereas the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Cipollone </em>was the common-law fraud rule, the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitions\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Reilly </em>were the targeted regulations.  Accordingly, our holding in <em>Reilly </em>that the regulations were pre-empted provides no support for an argument that a general prohibition of deceptive practices is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d the harm caused by the specific kind of deception to which the prohibition is applied in a given case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true, as petitioners argue, that the appeal of their advertising is based on the relationship between smoking and health.  And although respondents have expressly repudiated any claim for damages for personal injuries, see App. 26a, their actual injuries likely encompass harms to health as well as the monetary injuries they allege.  These arguments are unavailing, however, because the text of \xc2\xa71334(b) does not refer to <em>harms </em>related to smoking and health.  Rather, it pre-empts only <em>requirements and prohibitions</em>\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, rules\xe2\x80\x94that are based on smoking and health.  The MUTPA says nothing about either \xe2\x80\x9csmoking\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chealth.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a general rule that creates a duty not to deceive and is therefore unlike the regulations at issue in <em>Reilly</em>.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue in the alternative that we should reject the express pre-emption framework established by the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality and relied on by the Court in <em>Reilly</em>.  In so doing, they invoke the reasons set forth in the separate opinions of Justice Blackmun (who especially criticized the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the failure-to-warn claim was pre-empted) and Justice Scalia (who argued that the fraud claim also should be pre-empted).  While we again acknowledge that our analysis of these claims may lack \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretical elegance,\xe2\x80\x9d we remain persuaded that it represents \xe2\x80\x9ca fair understanding of congressional purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cipollone</em>,<em> </em>505 U. S., at 529\xe2\x80\x93530, n. 27 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners also contend that the plurality opinion is inconsistent with our decisions in <em>American Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wolens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/219/index.html">513 U. S. 219</a> (1995), and <em>Riegel </em>v. <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  Both cases, however, are inapposite\xe2\x80\x94the first because it involved a pre-emption provision much broader than the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s, and the second because it involved precisely the type of state rule that Congress had intended to pre-empt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At issue in <em>Wolens </em>was the pre-emptive effect of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 49\xc2\xa0U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa71305(a)(1) (1988 ed.), which prohibits States from enacting or enforcing any law \xe2\x80\x9crelating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  The plaintiffs in that case sought to bring a claim under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815, \xc2\xa7505 (West 1992).  Our conclusion that the state-law claim was pre-empted turned on the unusual breadth of the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  We had previously held that the meaning of the key phrase in the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>relating to</em> rates, routes, or services,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is a broad one.  <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/374/index.html">504 U. S. 374</a>, 383\xe2\x80\x93384 (1992) (emphasis added).  Relying on precedents construing the pre-emptive effect of the same phrase in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71144(a), we concluded that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d indicates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to pre-empt a large area of state law to further its purpose of deregulating the airline industry.  504 U. S., at 383\xe2\x80\x93384.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Unquestionably, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d has a broader scope than the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s reference to rules \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d smoking and health; whereas \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d is synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9chaving a connection with,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 384, \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d describes a more direct relationship, see <em>Safeco Ins.

S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn common talk, the phrase \xe2\x80\x98based on\xe2\x80\x99 indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <em>Riegel</em> is similarly misplaced.  The plaintiffs in <em>Riegel </em>sought to bring common-law design, manufacturing, and labeling defect claims against the manufacturer of a faulty catheter.  The case presented the question whether those claims were expressly pre-empted by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360c <em>et seq.</em>  The MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption clause provides that no State \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device \xe2\x80\xa6 any requirement\xe2\x80\x99 relating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riegel</em>, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a); emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The catheter at issue in <em>Riegel </em>had received premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  We concluded that premarket approval imposes \xe2\x80\x9crequirement[s] relating to safety [and] effectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d because the FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no design, manufacturing, or labeling deviations from the specifications in its approved application.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 products liability claims fell within the core of the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision because they sought to impose different requirements on precisely those aspects of the device that the FDA had approved.  Unlike the <em>Cipollone </em>plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s fraud claim, which fell outside of the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive reach because it did not seek to impose a prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cbased on smoking and health,\xe2\x80\x9d the <em>Riegel </em>plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 common-law products liability claims unquestionably sought to enforce \xe2\x80\x9crequirement[s] relating to safety or effectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d under the MDA.  That the \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d language of the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision is, like the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s, much broader than the operative language of the Labeling Act provides an additional basis for distinguishing <em>Riegel</em>.  Thus, contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion, <em>Riegel </em>is entirely consistent with our holding in <em>Cipollone</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we conclude now, as the plurality did in <em>Cipollone</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98based on smoking and health\xe2\x80\x99 fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent statements.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 529.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an alternative to their express pre-emption argument, petitioners contend that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is impliedly pre-empted because, if allowed to proceed, it would present an obstacle to a longstanding policy of the FTC.  According to petitioners, the FTC has for decades promoted the development and consumption of low tar cigarettes and has encouraged consumers to rely on representations of tar and nicotine content based on Cambridge Filter Method testing in choosing among cigarette brands.  Even if such a regulatory policy could provide a basis for obstacle pre-emption, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 description of the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s actions in this regard are inaccurate.  The Government itself disavows any policy authorizing the use of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow tar\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1966, following the publication of the Surgeon General\xe2\x80\x99s report on smoking and health, the FTC issued an industry guidance stating its view that \xe2\x80\x9ca factual statement of the tar and nicotine content (expressed in milligrams) of the mainstream smoke from a cigarette,\xe2\x80\x9d as measured by Cambridge Filter Method testing, would not violate the FTC Act.  App. 478a.  The Commission made clear, however, that the guidance applied only to factual assertions of tar and nicotine yields and did not invite \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral representations \xe2\x80\xa6 made, expressly or by implication, as to reduction or elimination of health hazards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 479a.  A year later, the FTC reiterated its position in a letter to the National Association of Broadcasters.  The letter explained that, as a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission would not challenge statements of tar and nicotine content when \xe2\x80\x9cthey are shown to be accurate and fully substantiated by tests conducted in accordance with the [Cambridge Filter Method].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 368a.  In 1970, the FTC considered providing further guidance, proposing a rule that would have required manufacturers to disclose tar and nicotine yields as measured by Cambridge Filter Method testing.  35 Fed. Reg. 12671.  The leading cigarette manufacturers responded by submitting a voluntary agreement under which they would disclose tar and nicotine content in their advertising, App. 899a\xe2\x80\x93900a, and the FTC suspended its rulemaking, 36 Fed. Reg. 784 (1971).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on these events, petitioners assert that \xe2\x80\x9cthe FTC has <em>required </em>tobacco companies to disclose tar and nicotine yields in cigarette advertising using a government-mandated testing methodology and has <em>authorized </em>them to use descriptors as shorthand references to those numerical test results.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 2 (emphasis in original).  As the foregoing history shows, however, the FTC has in fact never required that cigarette manufacturers disclose tar and nicotine yields, nor has it condoned representations of those yields through the use of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clow tar\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsequent Commission actions further undermine petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  After the tobacco companies agreed to report tar and nicotine yields as measured by the Cambridge Filter Method, the FTC continued to police cigarette companies\xe2\x80\x99 misleading use of test results.  In 1983, the FTC responded to findings that tar and nicotine yields for Barclay cigarettes obtained through Cambridge Filter Method testing were deceptive because the cigarettes in fact delivered disproportionately more tar to smokers than other cigarettes with similar Cambridge Filter Method ratings.  48 Fed. Reg. 15954.  And in 1995, the FTC found that a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s representation \xe2\x80\x9cthat consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand cigarettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands\xe2\x80\x9d was deceptive even though it was based on the results of Cambridge Filter Method testing.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re American Tobacco Co.</em>, 119 F.\xc2\xa0T. C. 3, 4.  The FTC\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was based on its recognition that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n truth and in fact, consumers will not necessarily get less tar\xe2\x80\x9d due to \xe2\x80\x9csuch behavior as compensatory smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This history shows that, contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion, the FTC has no longstanding policy authorizing collateral representations based on Cambridge Filter Method test results.  Rather, the FTC has endeavored to inform consumers of the comparative tar and nicotine content of different cigarette brands and has in some instances prevented misleading representations of Cambridge Filter Method test results.  The FTC\xe2\x80\x99s failure to require petitioners to correct their allegedly misleading use of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors is not evidence to the contrary; agency nonenforcement of a federal statute is not the same as a policy of approval.  Cf. <em>Sprietsma </em>v. <em>Mercury Marine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/51/index.html">537 U.

In 1997, the Commission observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are no official definitions for\xe2\x80\x9d the terms \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow tar,\xe2\x80\x9d and it sought comments on whether \xe2\x80\x9cthere [is] a need for official guidance with respect to the terms\xe2\x80\x9d and whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe descriptors convey implied health claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  62 Fed. Reg. 48163.  In November 2008, following public notice and comment, the Commission rescinded its 1966 guidance concerning the Cambridge Filter Method.  73 Fed. Reg. 74500.  The rescission is a response to \xe2\x80\x9ca consensus among the public health and scientific communities that the Cambridge Filter method is sufficiently flawed that statements of tar and nicotine yields as measured by that method are not likely to help consumers make informed decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 74503.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s notice of its proposal to rescind the guidance also reiterated the original limits of that guidance, noting that it \xe2\x80\x9conly addresse[d] simple factual statements of tar and nicotine yields.  It d[id] not apply to other conduct or express or implied representations, even if they concern[ed] tar and nicotine yields.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 40351.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, neither the handful of industry guidances and consent orders on which petitioners rely nor the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s inaction with regard to \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors even arguably justifies the pre-emption of state deceptive practices rules like the MUTPA.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude, as we did in <em>Cipollone</em>, that the Labeling Act does not pre-empt state-law claims like respondents\xe2\x80\x99 that are predicated on the duty not to deceive.  We also hold that the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s various decisions with respect to statements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly pre-empt respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim.

A plurality of this Court has previously read this clause to \xe2\x80\x9cindicat[e] that Congress intended the phrase \xe2\x80\x98relating to smoking and health\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 to be construed narrowly, so as not to proscribe the regulation of deceptive advertising.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/504/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/504/index.html">505 U.

The FTC has long depended on cooperative state regulation to achieve its mission because, although one of the smallest administrative agencies, it is charged with policing an enormous amount of activity.  See 1 S. Kanwit, Federal Trade Commission \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71:1, 1:2 (2004 ed. and Supp. 2008).  Moreover, when the Labeling Act was amended in 1969 it was not even clear that the FTC possessed rulemaking authority, see 84 Stat. 89, making it highly unlikely that Congress would have intended to assign exclusively to the FTC the substantial task of overseeing deceptive practices in cigarette advertisements.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In his dissent, Justice Thomas criticizes our reliance on the plurality opinion in <em>Cipollone</em>, <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, 14\xe2\x80\x9319, 22, and advocates adopting the analysis set forth by Justice Scalia in his opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part in that case, <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x936, 19\xe2\x80\x9321.  But Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s approach was rejected by seven Members of the Court, and in the almost 17 years since <em>Cipollone </em>was decided Congress has done nothing to indicate its approval of that approach.  Moreover, Justice Thomas fails to explain why Congress would have intended the result that Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s approach would produce\xe2\x80\x94namely, permitting cigarette manufacturers to engage in fraudulent advertising.  As a majority of the Court concluded in <em>Cipollone</em>,<em> </em>nothing in the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s language or purpose supports that result.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The <em>Cipollone</em> plurality further stated that the warning neutralization claim was \xe2\x80\x9cmerely the converse of a state-law <em>requirement </em>that warnings be included in advertising and promotional materials,\xe2\x80\x9d 505 U. S., at 527, evincing the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that warning neutralization and failure-to-warn claims are two sides of the same coin.  Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 criticism of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the failure-to-warn claim, <em>post</em>, at 16, is beside the point, as no such claim is at issue in this litigation.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals observed, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 allegations regarding petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 use of the statements \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clowered tar and nicotine\xe2\x80\x9d could also support a warning neutralization claim.

S. 504</a> (1992).  As in that case, the question before us is whether state-law claims alleging that cigarette manufacturers misled the public about the health effects of cigarettes are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, as amended in 1969 (Labeling Act or Act).  The Labeling Act requires that specific health warnings be placed on all cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71333, in order to eliminate \xe2\x80\x9cdiverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71331.  To that end, \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act pre-empts any \xe2\x80\x9crequirement or prohibition based on smoking and health \xe2\x80\xa6 imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71334(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether \xc2\xa75(b) pre-empts state common-law claims divided the Court in <em>Cipollone</em>.  The plurality opinion found some claims expressly pre-empted and others not, depending on whether \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages</em> action constitutes a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health \xe2\x80\xa6 imposed under State law with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 advertising or promotion.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 524 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  A majority of the Court disagreed with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s predicate-duty approach.  <em>Id., </em>at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <em>id., </em>at 552\xe2\x80\x93554 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  In particular, Justice Scalia recognized that the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa75(b) created an unworkable test for pre-emption with little or no relationship to the text of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 544, 555\xe2\x80\x93556.  The intervening years have vindicated Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s critical assessment; the lower courts have consistently expressed frustration at the difficulty in applying the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality\xe2\x80\x99s test.  Moreover, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent pre-emption decisions have undermined, and in some cases overruled, central aspects of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s atextual approach to express pre-emption generally, <em>Riegel</em> v. <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and to \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act specifically, <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co.</em> v. <em>Reilly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/525/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/525/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/525/index.html">533 U. S. 525</a> (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority today ignores these problems and adopts the methodology of the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality as governing law.  As a consequence, the majority concludes that state-law liability for deceiving purchasers about the health effects of smoking light cigarettes is not a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement or prohibition based on smoking and health\xe2\x80\x9d under the Labeling Act.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to <em>Cipollone</em> is unwise and unnecessary.  The Court should instead provide the lower courts with a clear test that advances Congress\xe2\x80\x99 stated goals by interpreting \xc2\xa75(b) to expressly pre-empt any claim that \xe2\x80\x9cimposes an obligation \xe2\x80\xa6 because of the effect of smoking upon health.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cipollone</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 554 (opinion of Scalia, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 lawsuit under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \xc2\xa7207 (Supp. 2008), is expressly pre-empted under \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act.  The civil action is premised on the allegation that the cigarette manufacturers misled respondents into believing that smoking light cigarettes would be healthier for them than smoking regular cigarettes.  A judgment in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 favor will thus result in a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioners represent the effects of smoking on health in a particular way in their advertising and promotion of light cigarettes.  Because liability in this case is thereby premised on the effect of smoking on health, I would hold that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state-law claims are expressly pre-empted by \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Cipollone</em>, a smoker and her spouse brought state common-law claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn against cigarette manufacturers for their alleged failure to adequately disclose the health risks of smoking.  505 U.

As here, the cigarette manufacturer asserted that the claims were pre-empted by \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In deciding the case, the Court could not agree on the meaning of the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption provision.  It produced three separate opinions, none of which reflected the views of a majority of Justices.  Relying heavily on a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against the pre-emption of state police power regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d a plurality opinion by Justice Stevens settled on a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow reading\xe2\x80\x9d of the Labeling Act that tested \xc2\xa75(b)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive effect under a claim-by-claim approach.  <em>Id.,</em> at 524.  This approach considered each state-law claim and asked whether it is predicated \xe2\x80\x9con a duty \xe2\x80\x98based on smoking and health.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 528; see also <em>id.,</em> at 524.  If so, the claim is pre-empted.  <em>Id.</em>, at 524, 528.<em> </em>If, however, the claim is predicated on a \xe2\x80\x9cmore general obligation\xe2\x80\x9d under state law, it may proceed.  <em>Id., </em>at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying a test that it conceded lacked \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretical elegance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 530, n.\xc2\xa027, the plurality held that the failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that those claims rel[ied] on omissions or inclusions in \xe2\x80\xa6 advertising or promotions\xe2\x80\x9d of cigarettes.  <em>Id.,</em> at 531.  The same was true for one of the fraud claims, which alleged that the cigarette manufacturers had used their advertising to neutralize the federally required warning labels.  <em>Id.</em>, at 527\xe2\x80\x93528.  The plurality determined that these claims were \xe2\x80\x9cpredicated on a state-law prohibition against statements \xe2\x80\xa6 that tend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 527.  Thus, according to the plurality, these state-law claims sought recovery under the theory that the cigarette manufacturer breached a duty based on smoking or health.  But the plurality found that the other fraud claim, which alleged misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, was not pre-empted because it was based on a more general state-law obligation: \xe2\x80\x9cthe duty not to deceive.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.,</em> at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Blackmun, writing for three Justices, departed from the plurality on the antecedent question whether the Labeling Act pre-empted state common-law damages claims at all.  <em>Id.,</em> at 535\xe2\x80\x93542 (opinion, joined by Kennedy and Souter, JJ., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).  He concluded that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98State law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa75(b) referred only to \xe2\x80\x9cpositive enactments such as statutes and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.,</em> at 535.  But Justice Blackmun specifically noted that even if state common-law claims were within the scope of the Labeling Act, he could not join the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s claim-by-claim approach because he \xe2\x80\x9cperceive[d] no principled basis for many of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s asserted distinctions among the common-law claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 543.  Justice Blackmun wrote that Congress could not have \xe2\x80\x9cintended to create such a hodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when it amended the pre-emption provision in 1970,\xe2\x80\x9d and lamented the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulty lower courts w[ould] encounter in attempting to implement\xe2\x80\x9d the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s test.  <em>Id.,</em> at 543\xe2\x80\x93544.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, writing for two Justices, also faulted the plurality for its claim-by-claim approach.  <em>Id.,</em> at 544\xe2\x80\x93556 (opinion, joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Although he agreed with the plurality that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98State law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa75(b) encompassed state common-law claims as well as state statutes and regulations, <em>id.,</em> at 548\xe2\x80\x93549, Justice Scalia objected to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of a presumption against pre-emption to narrowly interpret \xc2\xa75(b), <em>id.</em>, at 544, 545\xe2\x80\x93547.  Because Congress had expressed its intent to pre-empt state law by enacting \xc2\xa75(b), the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility [was] to apply to the text ordinary principles of statutory construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 545.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  By employing its \xe2\x80\x9cnewly crafted doctrine of narrow construction,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Scalia wrote, the plurality arrived at a cramped and unnatural construction of \xc2\xa75(b) that failed to give effect to the statutory text.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at<em> </em>544\xe2\x80\x93548.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying \xe2\x80\x9cordinary principles\xe2\x80\x9d of statutory construction, <em>id.,</em> at 548, Justice Scalia determined that the proper test for pre-emption of state-law claims under \xc2\xa75(b) was far less complicated than the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s claim-by-claim approach.  As he explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce one is forced to select a <em>consistent</em> methodology for evaluating whether a given legal duty is \xe2\x80\x98based on smoking and health,\xe2\x80\x99 it becomes obvious that the methodology must focus not upon the ultimate source of the duty \xe2\x80\xa6 but upon its proximate application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 553.  This \xe2\x80\x9cproximate application\xe2\x80\x9d test, therefore, focuses not on the state-law duty invoked by the plaintiff, but on the effect of the suit on the cigarette manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition\xe2\x80\x9d that would be imposed under state law.  Put simply, if, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever the source of the duty, [the claim] imposes an obligation \xe2\x80\xa6 because of the effect of smoking upon health,\xe2\x80\x9d it is pre-empted.  <em>Id.,</em> at 554; see also <em>id.,</em> at 555 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe test for pre-emption in this setting should be one of practical compulsion, <em>i.e.</em>, whether the law practically compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior that Congress has barred the States from prescribing directly\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Scalia<em> </em>also seconded Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s concern that the lower courts would find the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions between materially identical state-law claims to be incapable of application: \xe2\x80\x9cA disposition that raises more questions than it answers does not serve the country well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 556.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sixteen years later, we must confront <em>Cipollone </em>to resolve the question presented in this case: whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 class-action claims for fraudulent marketing under the MUTPA are pre-empted by \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act.  The majority adheres to <em>Cipollone </em>because it \xe2\x80\x9cremain[s] persuaded\xe2\x80\x9d that the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the \xc2\xa75(b) was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fair.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.

The <em>Cipollone </em>plurality justified what it described as the \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretical [in]elegance\xe2\x80\x9d of its construction of \xc2\xa75(b) by relying on the presumption against pre-emption, which, it argued, required a narrow, but \xe2\x80\x9cfair,\xe2\x80\x9d construction of the statute.  505 U. S., at 530, n.\xc2\xa027.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> id., </em>at 518 (majority opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis presumption reinforces the appropriateness of a narrow reading of \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 523 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e must \xe2\x80\xa6 narrowly construe the precise language of \xc2\xa75(b)\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 524 (\xc2\xa75(b) must be given \xe2\x80\x9ca fair but narrow reading\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 529 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e conclude that the phrase \xe2\x80\x98based on smoking and health\xe2\x80\x99 fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent statements\xe2\x80\x9d).  Of course, as Justice Scalia<em> </em>explained, there was nothing \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d about imposing an artificially narrow construction on the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision. See <em>id.,</em> at 545 (explaining that the presumption against pre-emption \xe2\x80\x9cdissolves once there is conclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the express words of the statute itself\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since <em>Cipollone</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the presumption against pre-emption has waned in the express pre-emption context.  In 2002, for example, the Court unanimously explained that the \xe2\x80\x9ctask of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the [express pre-emption] clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emptive intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sprietsma</em> v. <em>Mercury Marine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/51/index.html">537 U. S. 51</a>, 62\xe2\x80\x9363 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Without referring to any presumption against pre-emption, the Court decided that the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption provision did not pre-empt state-law claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 62\xe2\x80\x9364.  Most other decisions since <em>Cipollone </em>also<em> </em>have refrained from invoking the presumption in the context of express pre-emption. See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn.</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008); <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn.</em> v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/246/index.html">541 U.

As the majority notes, <em>ante, </em>at 5, <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a> (1996), applied the presumption against pre-emption in deciding that the federal manufacturing and labeling requirements of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) did not pre-empt state common-law claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  Like <em>Cipollone </em>before it,<em> Lohr </em>produced a fractured decision featuring three opinions.  518 U. S., at 474 (opinion of Stevens, J.), <em>id.</em>, at 503 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), <em>id.</em>, at 509 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  And, like <em>Cipollone</em>, <em>Lohr</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach to express pre-emption predates the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent jurisprudence on the topic.  In fact, this Court last year revisited the pre-emption provision of the MDA, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a)(1), and did not employ any presumption against pre-emption.  <em>Riegel</em> v. <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  See<em> infra</em>, at 11-13.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More recently, in <em>Reilly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/525/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/525/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/525/index.html">533 U. S. 525</a>, a case revisiting the meaning of \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act, the Court briefly alluded to the presumption, but did not rely on it to reach its decision.  See <em>id., </em>at 541\xe2\x80\x93542, 546\xe2\x80\x93551.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cursory treatment of the presumption in <em>Reilly </em>stands in stark contrast to the First Circuit decision it reversed; the First Circuit relied heavily on the \xe2\x80\x9cfull force\xe2\x80\x9d of the presumption to determine that the regulations at issue were not pre-empted.  See <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v.<em> Reilly</em>, 218 F.\xc2\xa03d 30, 38\xe2\x80\x9341 (2000).  This Court, in overturning that judgment, declined to employ the presumption in its construction of \xc2\xa75(b).  See <em>Reilly</em>,<em> </em>533 U. S., at 546\xe2\x80\x93551.  Justice Stevens highlighted this very point in dissent, arguing that if the presumption had been faithfully applied, the result would have been different.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 591\xe2\x80\x93593.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also relies on <em>Bates</em> v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/431/index.html">544 U. S. 431</a> (2005), where the presumption was again mentioned, but only in dicta.  As in <em>Reilly</em>, the presumption did not drive the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute at issue.  544 U. S., at 449 (explaining that the presumption meant just that the holding of no pre-emption would have been the same \xe2\x80\x9ceven if [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] alternative [construction of the statute] were just as plausible as our reading of the text\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.,</em> at 457 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing that the case should be vacated and remanded and reiterating that the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption does not apply \xe2\x80\xa6 when Congress has included within a statute an express pre-emption provision\xe2\x80\x9d).  At bottom, although the Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the presumption against pre-emption has not been uniform, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption cases since <em>Cipollone </em>have marked a retreat from reliance on it to distort the statutory text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If any doubt remained, it was eliminated last Term in <em>Riegel</em>.  The question in <em>Riegel</em>, as noted above,<em> </em>was whether the MDA expressly pre-empts state common-law claims \xe2\x80\x9cchallenging the safety and effectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Over the dissent of one Justice, the Court held that the state-law claims were pre-empted because the requirements the plaintiffs sought to impose were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable \xe2\x80\xa6 to the device\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under federal law.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a)(1)).  The Court interpreted the statute without reference to the presumption or any perceived need to impose a narrow construction on the provision in order to protect the police power of the States.  Rather, the Court simply construed the MDA in accordance with ordinary principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was not accidental.  The dissent focused on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to invoke the presumption in order to save the state-law claims from pre-emption.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at ___) (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  The dissent was adamant that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal laws containing a preemption clause do not automatically escape the presumption against pre-emption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933); <em>id., </em>at ___ (slip op., at 3) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the text of a pre-emption clause is open to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \xe2\x80\x98accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Bates</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 449)).  In accordance with the presumption, the dissent would have found the state-law claims under review to fall beyond the reach of the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption provision.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at ___); see also <em>id.</em>, at ___, n.\xc2\xa08 (slip op., at 6, n.\xc2\xa08); <em>id.,</em> at ___, n.\xc2\xa09 (slip op., at 7, n.\xc2\xa09) (rejecting the majority\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa7360(d) because \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption against pre-emption [is] operative even in construing a preemption clause\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s clear call for the use of the presumption against pre-emption, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to invoke it was necessarily a rejection of any role for the presumption in construing the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens also declined to invoke the presumption in his opinion.  <em>Id., </em>at ___ (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In his view, the \xe2\x80\x9csignificance of the pre-emption provision in the [MDA] was not fully appreciated until many years after it was enacted\xe2\x80\x9d and, therefore, it is \xe2\x80\x9ca statute whose text and general objective cover territory not actually envisioned by its authors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 1).  But Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion in <em>Riegel</em>\xe2\x80\x94unlike the majority opinion here, the plurality opinion in <em>Cipollone</em>, and the dissenting opinion in <em>Riegel</em>\xe2\x80\x94did <em>not</em> invoke the presumption to bend the text of the statute to meet the perceived purpose of Congress.  Instead, Justice Stevens correctly found that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (1998)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of <em>Riegel</em>, there is no authority for invoking the presumption against pre-emption in express pre-emption cases.  The majority here thus turns to <em>Lohr </em>to revive the presumption and, in turn, to justify its restrictive reading of the Labeling Act\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption provision.  But, as <em>Riegel </em>plainly shows, the Court is no longer willing to unreasonably interpret expressly pre-emptive federal laws in the name of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98congressional purpose,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, or because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has legislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5.  The text  of the statute must control.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Riegel</em> also undermined <em>Cipollone </em>in an even more fundamental way: It conclusively decided that a common-law cause of action imposes a state-law \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98requiremen[t]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that may be pre-empted by federal law.  552 U.

Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation [than regulatory legislation]\xe2\x80\x9d).

According to the majority, that legal duty contrasts with the regulations here, as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he MUTPA says nothing about either \xe2\x80\x98smoking\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98health.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 13; see<em> </em>also<em> ante, </em>at 10.  But the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality expressly rejected any distinction between targeted regulations like those in <em>Reilly</em> and general duties imposed by the common law.  505 U. S., at 522.  In fact, the general duties underlying the failure-to-warn and warning-neutralization claims in <em>Cipollone</em>\xe2\x80\x94which the plurality found to be pre-empted\xe2\x80\x94say nothing about smoking and health.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 524; see also <em>id.</em>, at 553 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the duty to warn about a product\xe2\x80\x99s dangers was not \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically crafted with an eye toward \xe2\x80\x98smoking and health\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, <em>Reilly</em> is better understood as establishing that even a general duty can impose requirements or prohibitions based on smoking and health.  <em>Reilly </em>weakened the force of the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate duty\xe2\x80\x9d approach to the pre-emptive effect of \xc2\xa75(b) and cast doubt on its continuing utility.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach should be discarded because its \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate duty\xe2\x80\x9d approach is unpersuasive as an initial matter.  In considering the warning-neutralization claim, for example, the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality asserted that the claim is predicated on a state-law prohibition against minimizing the health risks associated with smoking.  505 U. S., at 527.  The Court today reaffirms this view.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10; see also <em>ante</em>, at 13 (describing \xc2\xa75(b) as expressly pre-empting \xe2\x80\x9crules \xe2\x80\xa6 that are based on smoking and health\xe2\x80\x9d).  But every products liability action, including a failure-to-warn action, applies generally to <em>all</em> products.  See <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>at 553 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cduty\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crule\xe2\x80\x9d involved in a failure-to-warn claim is no more specific to smoking and health than is a common-law fraud claim based on the \xe2\x80\x9cduty\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crule\xe2\x80\x9d not to use deceptive or misleading trade practices.  Yet only for the latter was the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality content to ignore the context in which the claim is asserted.  This shifting level of generality was identified as a logical weakness in the original <em>Cipollone </em>plurality decision by a majority of the Court, 505 U. S., at 543 (Blackmun<font caps="1">, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 553\xe2\x80\x93554 (opinion of Scalia, J.), and it remains equally unconvincing today.</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is therefore unsurprising that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s defense of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s confusing test is confined to one sentence and a footnote.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile we again acknowledge that our analysis of these claims may lack \xe2\x80\x98theoretical elegance,\xe2\x80\x99 we remain persuaded that it represents \xe2\x80\x98a fair understanding of congressional purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Cipollone</em>,<em> supra, </em>at 529\xe2\x80\x93530, n.\xc2\xa027)); <em>ante, </em>at 10, n.\xc2\xa07.

Respondents, longtime smokers of Marlboro Lights, claim that they have suffered an injury as a result of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 decision to advertise these cigarettes as \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and/or \xe2\x80\x9clow-tar and low nicotine products.\xe2\x80\x9d  436 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.

Respondents thus allege that they were misled into thinking that they were gaining a health advantage by smoking the light cigarettes, <em>ibid</em>., and, as a result, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was an \xe2\x80\x9cunfair or deceptive act or practice\xe2\x80\x9d under the MUTPA.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \xc2\xa7207; 436 F.

The alleged misrepresentation here\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow-tar\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes are not as healthy as advertised\xe2\x80\x94is actionable <em>only</em> because of the effect that smoking light and low-tar cigarettes had on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 health.  Otherwise, any alleged misrepresentation about the effect of the cigarettes on health would be immaterial for purposes of the MUTPA and would not be the source of the injuries that provided the impetus for the class-action lawsuit.  See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinschenk</em>, 2005 ME 28, \xc2\xb617, 868 A.\xc2\xa02d 200, 206 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn act or practice is deceptive [under the MUTPA] if it is a <em>material </em>representation, omission, act or practice that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Therefore, with this suit, respondents seek to <em>require </em>the cigarette manufacturers to provide additional warnings about compensatory behavior, or to <em>prohibit </em>them from selling these products with the \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clow-tar\xe2\x80\x9d descriptors.  This is exactly the type of lawsuit that is pre-empted by the Labeling Act.  Cf.<em>  Rowe</em>, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (finding pre-emption of a Maine regulation of shipping of tobacco products where \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Maine law \xe2\x80\xa6 produces the very effect that the federal law sought to avoid\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the proper test for pre-emption is to look at the factual basis of a complaint to determine if a claim imposes a requirement based on smoking and health, there is no meaningful distinction to be drawn in this case between common-law failure-to-warn claims and claims under the MUTPA.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As the majority readily admits, both types of claims impose duties with respect to the same conduct\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e., </em>the marketing of \xe2\x80\x9clight,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clow-tar,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow-nicotine\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa09.  If the claims arise from identical conduct, the claims impose the same requirement or prohibition with respect to that conduct.  And when that allegedly wrongful conduct involves misleading statements about the health effects of smoking a particular brand of cigarette, the liability and resulting requirement or prohibition are, by definition, based on smoking and health.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, at oral argument, respondents argued that their claims do not impose requirements based on smoking and health because the damages they seek to recover are not based on the effect of smoking on their health; rather, respondents are \xe2\x80\x9casking \xe2\x80\xa6 for the difference in value between a product [they] thought [they] were buying and a product [they] actually bought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  But the requirement or prohibition covered by \xc2\xa75(b) is created by the imposition of liability for particular conduct\xe2\x80\x94here, the way in which petitioners marketed \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow-tar,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clow-nicotine\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes\xe2\x80\x94not by the manner in which respondents have chosen to measure their damages.  No matter how respondents characterize their damages claim, they have not been injured for purposes of the MUTPA, and thus cannot recover, unless their decision to purchase the cigarettes had a negative effect on their health.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, respondents sought \xe2\x80\x9csuch injunctive relief as may be appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d in this case.  App. 42a.  The MUTPA specifically authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cother equitable relief, including an injunction,\xe2\x80\x9d to remedy unfair or deceptive trade practices.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \xc2\xa7213(1) (West 2002).  And a court-crafted injunction prohibiting petitioners from marketing light cigarettes would be no less a requirement or prohibition than the regulations found to be pre-empted in <em>Reilly</em>.  In the end, no matter what form the remedy takes, the liability with respect to the specific claim still creates the requirement or prohibition.  When that liability is necessarily premised on the effects of smoking on health, as respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims are here, the civil action is pre-empted by \xc2\xa75(b) of the Labeling Act.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Court today elects to convert the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality opinion into binding law, notwithstanding its weakened doctrinal foundation, its atextual construction of the statute, and the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 inability to apply its methodology.
