This tract was situated in that part of what was alleged to be a part of Louisiana by the United States between the River Perdido and the River Mississippi, they claiming the same under the cession of France to the United States of Louisiana.  The United States had asserted that this country had been transferred to France by Spain by the Treaty of St. Ildefonso of 1800, and under the treaty with France belonged to the United States.
