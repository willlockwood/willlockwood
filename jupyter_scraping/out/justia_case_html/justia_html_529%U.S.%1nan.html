Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer </i>cannot be distinguished from the instant</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="3">3</a></p><p>case. They themselves foreclose distinctions based upon the "potential future" versus "actual present" nature of the claim, the "general legal" versus the "fact-specific" nature of the challenge, the "collateral" versus the "noncollateral" nature of the issues, or the "declaratory" versus "injunctive" nature of the relief sought. Nor can the Court accept a distinction that limits \xc2\xa7 405(h)\'s scope to claims for monetary benefits or that involve "amounts," as neither the language nor the purposes of \xc2\xa7405 support such a distinction. Neither <i>McNary </i>v. <i>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/479/case.html">498 U. S. 479</a>, nor <i>Mathews </i>v. <i>Eldridge, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html">424 U. S. 319</a>, supports the Council\'s effort to distinguish <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer. </i>The Court\'s approval of a \xc2\xa7 1331 suit against the Immigration and Naturalization Service in <i>McNary </i>rested on the different language of the immigration statute. And <i>Eldridge </i>was a case in which the respondent had complied with, not disregarded, the Social Security Act\'s special review procedures-specifically the nonwaivable and nonexcusable requirement that an individual present a claim to the agency before raising it in court. The upshot is that the Council\'s argument must rest primarily upon <i>Michigan Academy. </i>Pp. 11-15.</p><p>(c) <i>Michigan Academy </i>did not, contrary to the Court of Appeals\' holding, modify the Court\'s earlier holdings by limiting \xc2\xa7 405(h)\'s scope, as incorporated by \xc2\xa7 1395ii, to "amount determinations." That case involved the lawfulness of HHS regulations governing procedures used to calculate Medicare Part B benefits; and the Medicare statute, as it then existed, did not provide for \xc2\xa7 405(g) review of such decisions. The Court ruled that this silence did not itself foreclose \xc2\xa7 1331 review. In response to the argument that \xc2\xa7 405(h) barred \xc2\xa7 1331 review, the Court declined to pass in the abstract on the meaning of \xc2\xa7 405(h) because that section was made applicable to the Medicare Act "to the same extent as" it is applicable to the Social Security Act by virtue of 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395ii. The Court interpreted that phrase to foreclose application of \xc2\xa7 405(h) where its application would preclude judicial review rather than channel it through the agency. As limited by the Court of Appeals, <i>Michigan Academy </i>would have overturned or dramatically limited earlier precedents such as <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer, </i>and would have created a hardly justifiable distinction between "amount determinations" and many similar HHS determinations. This Court does not normally overturn, or so dramatically limit, earlier authority <i>sub </i>silentio, and it did not do so here. Pp. 15-20.</p><p>(d) The Council\'s argument that it falls within the <i>Michigan Academy </i>exception because it can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain \xc2\xa7 1331 review is unconvincing. It argues that review is available only after the Secretary terminates a home\'s provider agreement. But in</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="4">4</a></p><p>Syllabus</p><p>her brief and regulations, the Secretary offers a legally permissible interpretation of the statute: that it permits a dissatisfied nursing home to have an administrative hearing on a determination that it has failed to comply substantially with the statute, agreements, or regulations, whether termination or some other remedy is imposed. See, <i>e. g., Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843. The Secretary also denies that she engages in any practice that forces a home to submit a corrective plan and sacrifice appeal rights in order to avoid termination, or that penalizes more severely a home that chooses to appeal. Because the Council offers no convincing reason to doubt her description of the agency\'s practice, the Court need not decide whether a practice that forced homes to abandon legitimate challenges could amount to the practical equivalent of a total denial of judicial review. If, as the Council argues, the regulations unlawfully limit the extent to which the agency will provide the administrative review channel leading to judicial review, its members remain free, after following the special review route, to contest in court the lawfulness of the relevant regulation or statute. That is true even if the agency does not or cannot resolve the particular contention, because it is the "action" arising under the Medicare Act that must be channeled through the agency. The Council finally argues that, as an association speaking on behalf of its injured members, it has no standing to take advantage of the special review channel. However, it is the members\' rights to review that are at stake, and the statutes creating the special review channel adequately protect those rights.

An association of nursing homes sued, <i>inter alios, </i>the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and another federal party (hereinafter Secretary) in Federal District Court claiming that certain Medicare-related regulations violated various statutes and the Constitution. The association invoked the court\'s federal-question jurisdiction, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331. The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction. It believed that a set of special statutory provisions creates a separate, virtually exclusive, system of administrative and judicial review for denials of Medicare claims; and it held that one of those provisions explicitly barred a \xc2\xa7 1331 suit. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395ii (incorporating into the Medicare Act 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 405(h), which provides that "[n]o action ... to recover on any claim" arising under the Medicare laws shall be "brought under section 1331 ... of title 28"). The Court of Appeals, however, reversed.</p><p>We conclude that the statutory provision at issue, \xc2\xa7 405(h), as incorporated by \xc2\xa7 1395ii, bars federal-question jurisdiction here. The association or its members must proceed instead through the special review channel that the Medicare statutes create. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1395cc(h), (b)(2)(A), 1395ii; \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 405(b), (g), (h).</p><p>*Briefs of <i>amici curiae </i>urging affirmance were filed for the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging by <i>Mark H.

Medicare Act Part A provides payment to nursing homes which provide care to Medicare beneficiaries after a stay in a hospital. To receive payment, a home must enter into a provider agreement with the Secretary of HHS, and it must comply with numerous statutory and regulatory requirements. State and federal agencies enforce those requirements through inspections. Inspectors report violations, called "deficiencies." And "deficiencies" lead to the imposition of sanctions or "remedies." See generally \xc2\xa7 \xc2\xa7 1395i-3, 1395cc.</p><p>The regulations at issue focus on the imposition of sanctions or remedies. They were promulgated in 1994, 59 Fed. Reg. 56116, pursuant to a 1987 law that tightened the substantive standards that Medicare (and Medicaid) imposed upon nursing homes and that significantly broadened the Secretary\'s authority to impose remedies upon violators. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4201-4218, 101 Stat. 1330-160 to 1330-221 (codified as amended at 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395i-3 (1994 ed. and Supp. II!)).</p><p>The remedial regulations (and a related manual) in effect tell Medicare-administering agencies how to impose remedies after inspectors find that a nursing home has violated substantive standards. They divide a nursing home\'s deficiencies into three categories of seriousness depending upon a deficiency\'s severity, its prevalence at the home, its relation with other deficiencies, and the home\'s compliance history. Within each category they list a set of remedies that the agency may, or must, impose. Where, for example, deficiencies "immediately jeopardize the health or safety of ... residents," the Secretary must terminate the home\'s provider agreement or appoint new, temporary management. Where deficiencies are less serious, the Secretary</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="7">7</a></p><p>may impose lesser remedies, such as civil penalties, transfer of residents, denial of some or all payment, state monitoring, and the like. Where a nursing home, though deficient in some respects, is in "[s]ubstantial compliance," i. <i>e., </i>where its deficiencies do no more than create a "potential for [causing] minimal harm," the Secretary will impose no sanction or remedy at all. See generally 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395i-3(h); 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 488.301 (1998); \xc2\xa7 488.400 <i>et seq.; </i>App. 54, 66 (Manual). The statute and regulations also create various review procedures. 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1395cc(b)(2)(A), (h); 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 431.151 <i>et seq. </i>(1998); \xc2\xa7 488.408(g); 42 CFR pt. 498 (1998).</p><p>The association\'s complaint filed in Federal District Court attacked the regulations as unlawful in four basic ways. In its view: (1) certain terms, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>"substantial compliance" and "minimal harm," are unconstitutionally vague; (2) the regulations and manual, particularly as implemented, violate statutory requirements seeking enforcement consistency, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395i-3(g)(2)(D), and exceed the legislative mandate of the Medicare Act; (3) the regulations create administrative procedures inconsistent with the Federal Constitution\'s Due Process Clause; and (4) the manual and other agency publications create legislative rules that were not promulgated consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act\'s demands for "notice and comment" and a statement of "basis and purpose," 5 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 553. See App. 18-19,27-38, 43-49 (Amended Complaint).</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>We next describe the two competing jurisdictional routes through which the association arguably might seek to mount its legal attack. The route it has followed, federal-question jurisdiction, is set forth in 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331, which simply states that "district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." The route that it did not follow, the special Medicare review route, is set forth in a complex</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="8">8</a></p><p>set of statutory provisions, which must be read together. See Appendix, <i>infra. </i>The Medicare Act says that a home"dissatisfied with a determination described in sub <i>section (b)(2) ... </i>shall be entitled to a hearing ... to the same extent as is provided in [the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 ]405(b) ... and to judicial review of the Secretary\'s final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) .... " 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h)(1) (emphasis added).</p><p>The cross-referenced subsection (b)(2) gives the Secretary power to terminate an agreement where, for example, the Secretary</p><blockquote><p>\n<i>"has determined </i>that the provider fails to comply substantially with the provisions [of the Medicare Act] and regulations thereunder .... " \xc2\xa7 1395cc(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>The cross-referenced \xc2\xa7 405(b) describes the nature of the administrative hearing to which the Medicare Act entitles a home that is "dissatisfied" with the Secretary\'s "determination." The cross-referenced \xc2\xa7 405(g) provides that a "dissatisfied" home may obtain judicial review in federal district court of "any final decision of the [Secretary] made after a hearing .... " Separate statutes provide for administrative and judicial review of civil monetary penalty assessments. \xc2\xa7 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1320a-7a(c)(2), (e).</p><p>A related Social Security Act provision, \xc2\xa7 405(h), channels most, if not all, Medicare claims through this special review system. It says:</p><blockquote><p>\n"(h) Finality of [Secretary\'s] decision.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"The findings and decision of the [Secretary] after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the [Secretary] shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein pro-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="9">9</a></p><blockquote><p>\nvided. No action against the United States, the [Secretary], or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 13.1,6 [federal defendant jurisdiction] of title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter." (Emphasis added.)</p></blockquote><p>Section 1395ii makes \xc2\xa7 405(h) applicable to the Medicare Act "to the same extent as" it applies to the Social Security Act.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>The case before us began when the Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc. (Council), an association of about 200 Illinois nursing homes participating in the Medicare (or Medicaid) program, filed the complaint we have described, <i>supra, </i>at 7, in Federal District Court. (Medicaid is not at issue in this Court.) The District Court, as we have said, dismissed the complaint for lack of federal-question jurisdiction. No. 96 C 2953 (ND Ill., Mar. 31, 1997), App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a, 15a. In doing so, the court relied upon \xc2\xa7 405(h) as interpreted by this Court in <i>Weinberger </i>v. <i>Salfi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/749/case.html">422 U. S. 749</a> (1975), and <i>Heckler </i>v. <i>Ringer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/602/case.html">466 U. S. 602</a> (1984). App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a-19a.</p><p>The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal. 143 F. 3d <i>1072 (CA7 </i>1998).

S. 1049 (1993). We granted certiorari to resolve those differences.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Section 405(h) purports to make exclusive the judicial review method set forth in \xc2\xa7 405(g). Its second sentence says that "[n]o findings of fact or decision of the [Secretary] shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided." \xc2\xa7 405(h). Its third sentence, directly at issue here, says that "[n]o action against the United States, the [Secretary], or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of title <i>28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter." </i>(Emphasis added.)</p><p>The scope of the italicized language "to recover on any claim arising under" the Social Security (or, as incorporated through \xc2\xa7 1395ii, the Medicare) Act is, if read alone, uncertain. Those words clearly apply in a typical Social Security or Medicare benefits case, where an individual seeks a monetary benefit from the agency (say, a disability payment, or payment for some medical procedure), the agency denies the benefit, and the individual challenges the lawfulness of that denial. The statute plainly bars \xc2\xa7 1331 review in such a case, irrespective of whether the individual challenges the agency\'s denial on evidentiary, rule-related, statutory, constitutional, or other legal grounds. But does the statute\'s bar apply when one who <i>might </i>later seek money or some other benefit from (or contest the imposition of a penalty by) the agency challenges in advance (in a \xc2\xa7 1331 action) the lawfulness of a policy, regulation, or statute that <i>might </i>later bar recovery of that benefit (or authorize the imposition of the penalty)? Suppose, as here, a group of such individuals, needing advance knowledge for planning purposes, together bring a \xc2\xa7 1331 action challenging such a rule or regulation on general legal grounds. Is such an action one "to recover on any claim arising under" the Social Security or Medicare Acts? That, in effect, is the question before us.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="11">11</a></p><p>III</p><p>In answering the question, we temporarily put the case on which the Court of Appeals relied, <i>Michigan Academy, supra, </i>to the side. Were we not to take account of that case, \xc2\xa7 405(h) as interpreted by the Court\'s earlier cases of <i>Weinberger </i>v. <i>Salfi, supra, </i>and <i>Heckler </i>v. <i>Ringer, supra, </i>would clearly bar this \xc2\xa7 1331 lawsuit.</p><p>In <i>Salfi, </i>a mother and a daughter, filing on behalf of themselves and a class of individuals, brought a \xc2\xa7 1331 action challenging the constitutionality of a statutory provision that, if valid, would deny them Social Security benefits. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 416(c)(5), (e)(2) (imposing a duration-ofrelationship Social Security eligibility requirement for surviving wives and stepchildren of deceased wage earners). The mother and daughter had appeared before the agency but had not completed its processes. The class presumably included some who had, and some who had not, appeared before the agency; the complaint did not say. This Court held that \xc2\xa7 405(h) barred \xc2\xa7 1331 jurisdiction for all members of the class because "it is the Social Security Act which provides both the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation of thee] constitutional contentions." <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 760-761. The Court added that the bar applies "irrespective of whether resort to judicial processes is necessitated by discretionary decisions of the Secretary or by his nondiscretionary application of allegedly unconstitutional statutory restrictions." 422 U. S., at 762. It also pointed out that the bar did not "preclude constitutional challenges," but simply "require[d] that they be brought" under the same "jurisdictional grants" and "in conformity with the same standards" applicable "to nonconstitutional claims arising under the Act." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>We concede that the Court also pointed to certain special features of the case not present here. The plaintiff class had asked for relief that included a direction to the Secretary to pay Social Security benefits to those entitled to them but for</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="12">12</a></p><p>the challenged provision. See <i>id., </i>at 761. And the Court thought this fact helped make clear that the action arose "under the Act whose benefits [were] sought." <i>Ibid. </i>But in a later case, <i>Ringer, </i>the Court reached a similar result despite the absence of any request for such relief. See 466 U. S., at 616, 623.</p><p>In <i>Ringer, </i>four individuals brought a \xc2\xa7 1331 action challenging the lawfulness (under statutes and the Constitution) of the agency\'s determination not to provide Medicare Part A reimbursement to those who had undergone a particular medical operation. The Court held that \xc2\xa7 405(h) barred \xc2\xa7 1331 jurisdiction over the action, even though the challenge was in part to the agency\'s procedures, the relief requested amounted simply to a declaration of invalidity (not an order requiring payment), and one plaintiff had as yet no valid claim for reimbursement because he had not even undergone the operation and would likely never do so unless a court set aside as unlawful the challenged agency "no reimbursement" determination. See <i>id., </i>at 614-616, 621-623. The Court reiterated that \xc2\xa7 405(h) applies where "both the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation" of a claim is the Medicare Act, <i>id., </i>at 615 (quoting <i>Salfi, </i>422 U. S., at 760-761) (internal quotation marks omitted), adding that a "claim for future benefits" is a \xc2\xa7 405(h) "claim," 466 U. S., at 621-622, and that "all aspects" of any such present or future claim must be "channeled" through the administrative process, <i>id., </i>at 614. See also <i>Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. </i>v. <i>Shalala, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/449/case.html">525 U. S. 449</a>, 456 (1999); <i>Califano </i>v. <i>Sanders, 430 </i>U. S. 99, 103-104, n. 3 (1977).</p><p>As so interpreted, the bar of \xc2\xa7 405(h) reaches beyond ordinary administrative law principles of "ripeness" and "exhaustion of administrative remedies," see <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 757-doctrines that in any event normally require channeling a legal challenge through the agency. See <i>Abbott Laboratories </i>v. <i>Gardner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html">387 U. S. 136</a>, 148-149 (1967) (ripeness); <i>McKart </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/185/case.html">395 U. S. 185</a>, 193-196 (1969) (ex-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="13">13</a></p><p>haustion). Indeed, in this very case, the Seventh Circuit held that several of respondent\'s claims were not ripe and remanded for ripeness review of the remainder. 143 F. 3d, at 1077-1078. Doctrines of "ripeness" and "exhaustion" contain exceptions, however, which exceptions permit early review when, for example, the legal question is "fit" for resolution and delay means hardship, see <i>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </i>at 148-149, or when exhaustion would prove "futile," see <i>McCarthy </i>v. <i>Madigan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/140/case.html">503 U. S. 140</a>, 147-148 (1992); <i>McKart, supra, </i>at 197-201. (And sometimes Congress expressly authorizes preenforcement review, though not here. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2618(a)(1)(A) (Toxic Substances Control Act).)</p><p>Insofar as \xc2\xa7 405(h) prevents application of the "ripeness" and "exhaustion" exceptions, i. <i>e., </i>insofar as it demands the "channeling" of virtually all legal attacks through the agency, it assures the agency greater opportunity to apply, interpret, or revise policies, regulations, or statutes without possibly premature interference by different individual courts applying "ripeness" and "exhaustion" exceptions case by case. But this assurance comes at a price, namely, occasional individual, delay-related hardship. In the context of a massive, complex health and safety program such as Medicare, embodied in hundreds of pages of statutes and thousands of pages of often interrelated regulations, any of which may become the subject of a legal challenge in any of several different courts, paying this price may seem justified. In any event, such was the judgment of Congress as understood in <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer. </i>See <i>Ringer, supra, </i>at 627; <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 762.</p><p>Despite the urging of the Council and supporting <i>amici, </i>we cannot distinguish <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer </i>from the case before us. Those cases themselves foreclose distinctions based upon the "potential future" versus the "actual present" nature of the claim, the "general legal" versus the "factspecific" nature of the challenge, the "collateral" versus</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="14">14</a></p><p>"noncollateral" nature of the issues, or the "declaratory" versus "injunctive" nature of the relief sought. Nor can we accept a distinction that limits the scope of \xc2\xa7 405(h) to claims for monetary benefits. Claims for money, claims for other benefits, claims of program eligibility, and claims that contest a sanction or remedy may all similarly rest upon individual fact-related circumstances, may all similarly dispute agency policy determinations, or may all similarly involve the application, interpretation, or constitutionality of interrelated regulations or statutory provisions. There is no reason to distinguish among them in terms of the language or in terms of the purposes of \xc2\xa7 405(h). Section 1395ii\'s blanket incorporation of that provision into the Medicare Act as a whole certainly contains no such distinction. Nor for similar reasons can we here limit those provisions to claims that involve "amounts."</p><p>The Council cites two other cases in support of its efforts to distinguish <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer: McNary </i>v. <i>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/479/case.html">498 U. S. 479</a> (1991), and <i>Mathews </i>v. <i>Eldridge, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html">424 U. S. 319</a> (1976). In <i>Haitian Refugee Center, </i>the Court held permissible a \xc2\xa7 1331 challenge to "a group of decisions or a practice or procedure employed in making decisions" despite an immigration statute that barred \xc2\xa7 1331 challenges to any Immigration and Naturalization Service "\'determination respecting an application for adjustment of status\'" under the Special Agricultural Workers\' program. 498 U. S., at 491-498. <i>Haitian Refugee Center\'s </i>outcome, however, turned on the different language of that different statute. Indeed, the Court suggested that statutory language similar to the language at issue here-any claim "arising under" the Medicare or Social Security Acts, \xc2\xa7 405(h)would have led it to a different legal conclusion. See <i>id., </i>at 494 (using as an example a statute precluding review of " \'all causes ... arising under any of\'" the immigration statutes).</p><p>In <i>Eldridge, </i>the Court held permissible a District Court lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of agency proce-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="15">15</a></p><p>dures authorizing termination of Social Security disability payments without a pretermination hearing. See 424 U. S., at 326-332. <i>Eldridge, </i>however, is a case in which the Court found that the respondent <i>had followed </i>the special review procedures set forth in \xc2\xa7 405(g), thereby <i>complying with, </i>rather than <i>disregarding, </i>the strictures of \xc2\xa7 405(h). See <i>id., </i>at 326-327 (holding jurisdiction available only under \xc2\xa7 405(g)). The Court characterized the constitutional issue the respondent raised as "collateral" to his claim for benefits, but it did so as a basis for requiring the agency to excuse, where the agency would not do so on its own, see <i>Salfi, </i>422 U. S., at 766-767, some (but not all) of the procedural steps set forth in \xc2\xa7 405(g). 424 U. S., at 329-332 (identifying collateral nature of the claim and irreparable injury as reasons to excuse \xc2\xa7 405(g)\'s exhaustion requirements); see also <i>Bowen </i>v. <i>City of New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/467/case.html">476 U. S. 467</a>, 483-485 (1986) (noting that <i>Eldridge </i>factors are not to be mechanically applied). The Court nonetheless held that \xc2\xa7 405(g) contains the nonwaivable and nonexcusable requirement that an individual present a claim to the agency before raising it in court. See <i>Ringer, supra, </i>at 622; <i>Eldridge, supra, </i>at 329; <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 763-764. The Council has not done so here, and thus cannot establish jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 405(g).</p><p>The upshot is that without <i>Michigan Academy </i>the Council cannot win. Its precedent-based argument must rest primarily upon that case.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>The Court of Appeals held that <i>Michigan Academy </i>modified the Court\'s earlier holdings by limiting the scope of "[\xc2\xa7]1395ii and therefore \xc2\xa7 405(h)" to "amount determinations." 143 F. 3d, at 1075-1076. But we do not agree. <i>Michigan Academy </i>involved a \xc2\xa7 1331 suit challenging the lawfulness of HHS regulations that governed procedures used to calculate benefits under Medicare Part B-which Part provides voluntary supplementary medical insurance, <i>e. g., </i>for doctors\' fees. See 476 U. S., at 674-675; <i>United</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="16">16</a></p><p><i>States </i>v. <i>Erika, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/201/case.html">456 U. S. 201</a>, 202-203 (1982). The Medicare statute, as it then existed, provided for only limited review of Part B decisions. It allowed the equivalent of \xc2\xa7 405(g) review for "eligibility" determinations. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395ff(b)(1)(B) (1982 ed.). It required private insurance carriers (administering the Part B program) to provide a "fair hearing" for disputes about Part B "amount determinations." \xc2\xa7 1395u(b)(3)(C). But that was all.</p><p><i>Michigan Academy </i>first discussed the statute\'s total silence about review of "challenges mounted against the <i>method </i>by which ... amounts are to be determined." 476 U. S., at 675. It held that this silence meant that, although review was not available <i>under \xc2\xa7J,05(g), </i>the silence did not itself foreclose other forms of review, say, review in a court action brought under \xc2\xa7 1331. See <i>id., </i>at 674-678. Cf. <i>Erika, supra, </i>at 208 (holding that the Medicare Part B statute\'s <i>explicit </i>reference to carrier hearings for amount disputes does foreclose <i>all </i>further agency or court review of "amount determinations").</p><p>The Court then asked whether \xc2\xa7 405(h) barred 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331 review of challenges to methodology. Noting the Secretary\'s <i>Salfi/Ringer-based </i>argument that \xc2\xa7 405(h) barred \xc2\xa7 1331 review of <i>all </i>challenges arising under the Medicare Act and the respondents\' counterargument that \xc2\xa7 405(h) barred challenges to "methods" only where \xc2\xa7 405(g) review was available, see <i>Michigan Academy, </i>476 U. S., at 679, the Court wrote:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Whichever may be the better reading of <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer, </i>we need not pass on the meaning of \xc2\xa7 405(h) in the abstract to resolve this case. Section 405(h) does not apply on its own terms to Part B of the Medicare program, but is instead incorporated <i>mutatis mutandis </i>by \xc2\xa7 1395ii. The legislative history of both the statute establishing the Medicare program and the 1972 amendments thereto provides specific evidence of Congress\' intent to foreclose review only of \'amount determina-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="17">17</a></p><blockquote><p>\ntions\'-i. <i>e., </i>those [matters] ... remitted finally and exclusively to adjudication by private insurance carriers in a \'fair hearing.\' By the same token, matters which Congress did <i>not </i>delegate to private carriers, such as challenges to the validity of the Secretary\'s instructions and regulations, are cognizable in courts of law." <i>Id., </i>at 680 (footnote omitted).</p></blockquote><p>The Court\'s words do not limit the scope of \xc2\xa7 405(h) itself to instances where a plaintiff, invoking \xc2\xa7 1331, seeks review of an "amount determination." Rather, the Court said that it would <i>"not </i>pass on the meaning of \xc2\xa7 405(h) in the abstract." <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added). Instead it focused upon the Medicare Act\'s cross-referencing provision, \xc2\xa7 1395ii, which makes \xc2\xa7 405(h) applicable <i>"to the same extent as" </i>it is "applicable" to the Social Security Act. (Emphasis added.) It interpreted that phrase as applying \xc2\xa7 405(h) <i>"mutatis mutandis," </i>i. <i>e., </i>"[a]ll necessary changes having been made." Black\'s Law Dictionary 1039 (7th ed. 1999). And it applied \xc2\xa7 1395ii with one important change of detail-a change produced by <i>not </i>applying \xc2\xa7 405(h) where its application to a particular category of cases, such as Medicare Part B "methodology" challenges, would not lead to a channeling of review through the agency, but would mean no review at all. The Court added that a "\'serious constitutional question\' ... would arise if we construed \xc2\xa7 1395ii to deny a judicial forum for constitutional claims arising under Part B." 476 U. S., at 681, n. 12 (quoting <i>Salfi, </i>422 U. S., at 762 (citing <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>Robison, 415 </i>U. S. 361, 366-367 (1974))).</p><p>More than that: Were the Court of Appeals correct in believing that <i>Michigan Academy </i>limited the scope of \xc2\xa7 405(h) itself to "amount determinations," that case would have significantly affected not only Medicare Part B cases but cases arising under the Social Security Act and Medicare Part A as well. It accordingly would have overturned or dramatically limited this Court\'s earlier precedents, such as <i>Salfi </i>and <i>Ringer, </i>which involved, respectively, those programs.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="18">18</a></p><p>It would, moreover, have created a hardly justifiable distinction between "amount determinations" and many other similar HHS determinations, see <i>supra, </i>at 14. And we do not understand why Congress, as JUSTICE STEVENS believes, <i>post, </i>at 30-31 (dissenting opinion), would have wanted to compel Medicare patients, but not Medicare providers, to channel their claims through the agency. Cf. Brief for Respondent 7-8, 18-21, 30-31 (apparently conceding the point). This Court does not normally overturn, or so dramatically limit, earlier authority <i>sub silentio. </i>And we agree with those Circuits that have held the Court did not do so in this instance. See <i>Michigan Assn. of Homes and Servs., </i>127 F. 3d, at 500-501; <i>American Academy of Dermatology, 118 </i>F. 3d, at 1499-1501; <i>St. Francis Medical Center, </i>32 F. 3d, at <i>812; Farkas, </i>24 F. 3d, at 855-861; <i>Abbey, </i>978 F. 2d, at 41-44; <i>National Kidney Patients Assn., </i>958 F. 2d, at 1130-1134.</p><p>JUSTICE THOMAS maintains that <i>Michigan Academy </i>"must have established," by way of a new interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1395ii, the critical distinction between a dispute about an agency determination in a particular case and a more general dispute about, for example, the agency\'s authority to promulgate a set of regulations, i. <i>e., </i>the very distinction that this Court\'s earlier cases deny. <i>Post, </i>at 38 (dissenting opinion). He says that, in this respect, we have mistaken <i>Michigan Academy\'s </i>"reasoning" (the presumption against preclusion of judicial review) for its "holding." <i>Post, </i>at 39-40. And, he finds the holding consistent with earlier cases such as <i>Ringer </i>because, he says, in <i>Ringer </i>everyone simply assumed without argument that \xc2\xa7 1395ii\'s channeling provision fully incorporated the whole of \xc2\xa7 405(h). <i>Post, </i>at 40-42.</p><p>For one thing, the language to which JUSTICE THOMAS points simply says that "Congres[s] inten[ded] to foreclose review only of \'amount determinations\'" and not "matters which Congress did <i>not delegate to private carriers, such as </i>challenges to the validity of the Secretary\'s instructions and regulations," <i>Michigan Academy, supra, </i>at 680 (emphasis</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="19">19</a></p><p>added). That language refers to particular features of the Medicare Part B program-"private carriers" and "amount determinations"-which are not here before us. And its reference to "foreclosure" of review quite obviously cannot be taken to refer to \xc2\xa7 1395ii because, as we have explained, \xc2\xa7 1395ii is a channeling requirement, not a foreclosure provision-of "amount determinations" or anything else. In short, it is difficult to reconcile JUSTICE THOMAS\' characterization of <i>Michigan Academy </i>as a holding that \xc2\xa7 1395ii is "trigger[ed]" only by "challenges to ... particular determinations," <i>post, </i>at 40, with the <i>Michigan Academy </i>language to which he points.</p><p>Regardless, it is more plausible to read <i>Michigan Academy </i>as <i>holding </i>that \xc2\xa7 1395ii does not apply \xc2\xa7 405(h) where application of \xc2\xa7 405(h) would not simply channel review through the agency, but would mean no review at all. And contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA\'S suggestion, <i>post, </i>at 31-32 (dissenting opinion), that single rule applies to Medicare Part A as much as to Medicare Part B. This latter holding, as we have said, has the virtues of consistency with <i>Michigan Academy\'s </i>actual language; consistency with the holdings of earlier cases such as <i>Ringer; </i>and consistency with the distinction that this Court has often drawn between a total preclusion of review and postponement of review. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 762 (distinguishing \xc2\xa7 405(h)\'s channeling requirement from the complete preclusion of judicial review at issue in <i>Robison, supra, </i>at 373); <i>Thunder Basin Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Reich, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/200/case.html">510 U. S. 200</a>, 207, n. 8 (1994) (strong presumption against preclusion of review is not implicated by provision postponing review); <i>Haitian Refugee Center, </i>498 U. S., at 496-499 (distinguishing between <i>Ringer </i>and <i>Michigan Academy </i>and finding the case governed by the latter because the statute precluded all meaningful judicial review). JUSTICE THOMAS refers to an "antichanneling" presumption (a "presumption in favor of preenforcement review," <i>post, </i>at 46-47). But any such presumption must be far weaker than a pre-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="20">20</a></p><p>sumption against preclusion of all review in light of the traditional ripeness doctrine, which often requires initial presentation of a claim to an agency. As we have said, <i>supra, </i>at 13, Congress may well have concluded that a universal obligation to present a legal claim first to HHS, though postponing review in some cases, would produce speedier, as well as better, review overall. And this Court crossed the relevant bridge long ago when it held that Congress, in both the Social Security Act and the Medicare Act, insisted upon an initial presentation of the matter to the agency. <i>Ringer, </i>466 U. S., at 627; <i>Salfi, </i>422 U. S., at 762. <i>Michigan Academy </i>does not require that we reconsider that longstanding interpretation.</p><p align="center">\nv</p><p>The Council argues that in any event it falls within the exception that <i>Michigan Academy </i>creates, for here as there, it can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain judicial review in a \xc2\xa7 1331 action. In other words, the Council contends that application of \xc2\xa7 1395ii\'s channeling provision to the portion of the Medicare statute and the Medicare regulations at issue in this case will amount to the "practical equivalent of a total denial of judicial review." <i>Haitian Refugee Center, supra, </i>at 497. The Council, however, has not convinced us that is so.</p><p>The Council says that the special review channel that the Medicare statutes create applies only where the Secretary <i>terminates </i>a home\'s provider agreement; it is not available in the more usual case involving imposition of a lesser remedy, say, the transfer of patients, the withholding of payments, or the imposition of a civil monetary penalty.</p><p>We have set forth the relevant provisions, <i>supra, </i>at 8-9; Appendix, <i>infra. </i>The specific judicial review provision, \xc2\xa7 405(g), authorizes judicial review of "any final decision of the [Secretary] made after a [\xc2\xa7 405(b)] hearing." A further relevant provision, \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h)(1), authorizes a \xc2\xa7 405(b) hearing whenever a home is "dissatisfied ... with a <i>determi-</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="21">21</a></p><p><i>nation described </i>in subsection (b)(2)." (Emphasis added.) And subsection (b)(2) authorizes the Secretary to terminate an agreement, whenever she <i>"has determined </i>that the provider fails to comply substantially with" statutes, agreements, or "regulations." \xc2\xa7 1395cc(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</p><p>The Secretary states in her brief that the relevant "determination" that entitles a "dissatisfied" home to review is any determination that a provider has failed to comply substantially with the statute, agreements, or regulations, whether termination or <i>"some other remedy </i>is imposed." Reply Brief for Petitioners 14 (emphasis added). The Secretary\'s regulations make clear that she so interprets the statute. See 42 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 498.3(b)(12), 498.1(a)-(b) (1998). The statute\'s language, though not free of ambiguity, bears that interpretation. And we are aware of no convincing countervailing argument. We conclude that the Secretary\'s interpretation is legally permissible. See <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843 (1984); <i>Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, </i>525 U. S., at 453; see also 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii) (providing a different channel for administrative and judicial review of decisions imposing civil monetary penalties.)</p><p>The Council next argues that the regulations, as implemented by the enforcement agencies, deny review in practice by (1) insisting that a nursing home with deficiencies present a corrective plan, (2) imposing no further sanction or remedy if it does so, but (3) threatening termination if it does not. See 42 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 488.402(d), 488.456(b)(ii) (1998). Because a home cannot risk termination, the Council adds, it must always submit a plan, thereby avoiding imposition of a remedy, but simultaneously losing its opportunity to contest the lawfulness of any remedy-related rules or regulations. See \xc2\xa7 498.3(b)(12). And, the Council\'s <i>amici </i>assert, compliance actually harms the home by subjecting it to increased sanctions later on by virtue of the unreviewed deficiency findings,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="22">22</a></p><p>and because the agency makes deficiency findings public on the Internet, \xc2\xa7 488.325.</p><p>The short, conclusive answer to these contentions is that the Secretary denies any such practice. She states in her brief that a nursing home with deficiencies can test the lawfulness of her regulations simply by refusing to submit a plan and incurring a minor penalty. Minor penalties, she says, are the norm, for "terminations from the program are rare and generally reserved for the most egregious recidivist institutions." Reply Brief for Petitioners 18; <i>ibid. </i>(HHS reports that only 25 out of more than 13,000 nursing homes were terminated in 1995-1996). She adds that the "remedy imposed on a facility that fails to submit a plan of correction or to correct a deficiency-and appeals the deficiency-is no different than the remedy the Secretary ordinarily would impose in the first instance." <i>Ibid. </i>Nor do the regulations "cause providers to suffer more severe penalties in later enforcement actions based on findings that are unreviewable." <i>Ibid. </i>The Secretary concedes that a home\'s deficiencies are posted on the Internet, but she notes that a home can post a reply. See <i>id., </i>at 20, n. 20.</p><p>The Council gives us no convincing reason to doubt the Secretary\'s description of the agency\'s general practice. We therefore need not decide whether a general agency practice that forced nursing homes to abandon legitimate challenges to agency regulations could amount to the "practical equivalent of a total denial of judicial review," <i>Haitian </i><i>Refugee Center, </i>498 U. S., at 497. Contrary to what JusTICE THOMAS says, <i>post, </i>at 42-43,51-52, we do not hold that an individual party could circumvent \xc2\xa7 1395ii\'s channeling requirement simply because that party shows that postponement would mean added inconvenience or cost in an isolated, particular case. Rather, the question is whether, as applied generally to those covered by a particular statutory provision, hardship likely found in many cases turns what ap-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="23">23</a></p><p>pears to be simply a channeling requirement into <i>complete </i>preclusion of judicial review. See <i>Haitian Refugee Center, supra, </i>at 496-497. Of course, individual hardship may be mitigated in a different way, namely, through excusing a number of the steps in the agency process, though not the step of presentment of the matter to the agency. See <i>supra, </i>at 14-15; <i>infra, </i>at 24. But again, the Council has not shown anything other than potentially isolated instances of the inconveniences sometimes associated with the postponement of judicial review.</p><p>The Council complains that a host of procedural regulations unlawfully limit the extent to which the agency itself will provide the administrative review channel leading to judicial review, for example, regulations insulating from review decisions about a home\'s level of noncompliance or a determination to impose one, rather than another, penalty. See 42 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 431.153(b), 488.408(g)(2), 498.3(d)(10)(ii) (1998). The Council\'s members remain free, however, after following the special review route that the statutes prescribe, to contest in court the lawfulness of any regulation or statute upon which an agency determination depends. The fact that the agency might not provide a hearing for that <i>particular contention, </i>or may lack the power to provide one, see <i>Sanders, </i>430 U. S., at 109 ("Constitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in administrative hearing procedures ... "); <i>Salfi, </i>422 U. S., at 764; Brief for Petitioners 45, is beside the point because it is the "action" arising under the Medicare Act that must be channeled through the agency. See <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 762. After the action has been so channeled, the court will consider the contention when it later reviews the action. And a court reviewing an agency determination under \xc2\xa7 405(g) has adequate authority to resolve any statutory or constitutional contention that the agency does not, or cannot, decide, see <i>Thunder Basin Coal, 510</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="24">24</a></p><p>u. S., at 215, and n. 20; <i>Haitian Refugee Center, supra, </i>at <i>494; Ringer, </i>466 U. S., at 617; <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 762, including, where necessary, the authority to develop an evidentiary record.</p><p>Proceeding through the agency in this way provides the agency the opportunity to reconsider its policies, interpretations, and regulations in light of those challenges. Nor need it waste time, for the agency can waive many of the procedural steps set forth in \xc2\xa7 405(g), see <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 767, and a court can deem them waived in certain circumstances, see <i>Eldridge, </i>424 U. S., at 330-331, even though the agency technically holds no "hearing" on the claim. See <i>Salfi, supra, </i>at 763-767 (holding that Secretary\'s decision not to challenge the sufficiency of the appellees\' exhaustion was in effect a determination that the agency had rendered a "final decision" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 405(g)); <i>Eldridge, supra, </i>at 331-332, and n.11 (invoking practical conception of finality to conclude that collateral nature of claim and potential irreparable injury from delayed review satisfy the "final decision" requirement of \xc2\xa7 405(g)). At a minimum, however, the matter must be presented to the agency prior to review in a federal court. This the Council has not done.</p><p>Finally, the Council argues that, because it is an association, not an individual, it cannot take advantage of the special review channel, for the statute authorizes review through that channel only at the request of a "dissatisfied" "institution or agency." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h)(1). The Council speaks only on behalf of its member institutions, and thus has standing only because of the injury those members allegedly suffer. See <i>Arizonans for Official English </i>v. <i>Arizona, 520 </i>U. S. 43, 65-66 (1997); <i>Hunt </i>v. <i>Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/333/case.html">432 U. S. 333</a>, 343 (1977). It is essentially their rights to review that are at stake. And the statutes that create the special review channel adequately protect those rights.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="25">25</a></p><p>VI</p><p>For these reasons, this case cannot fit within <i>Michigan Academy\'s </i>exception.

S. 749</a> (1975), and <i>Heckler </i>v. <i>Ringer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/602/case.html">466 U. S. 602</a> (1984), on the one hand, and cases like <i>Bowen </i>v. <i>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/667/case.html">476 U. S. 667</a> (1986), and this case, on the other hand. In the former group, the issue concerned the plaintiffs\' entitlement to benefits; in the latter two, the issue concerns providers\' eligibility for reimbursement. The distinction between those two types of issues mirrors a critical distinction between the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 405, and the Medicare Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395ii.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="31">31</a></p><p>Disputed claims for Social Security benefits always present a simple two-party dispute in which the claimant is seeking a monetary benefit from the Government. A proceeding under \xc2\xa7 405 is correctly described as an action "to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter." \xc2\xa7 405(h). Disputed claims under the Medicare Act, however, typically involve three parties-the patient, the provider, and the Secretary. When the issue involves a dispute over the patient\'s entitlement to benefits, it is fairly characterized as an action "to recover" on a claim that is parallel to a claim for Social Security benefits. The language in \xc2\xa7 1395ii that makes \xc2\xa7 405(h) applicable to the Medicare Act "to the same extent as" it applies to the Social Security Act thus encompasses claims by patients, but does not necessarily encompass providers\' challenges to the Secretary\'s regulations.</p><p>In <i>Ringer, </i>the Court, in effect (and, in my view, erroneously), treated the patients\' claim as a premature action "to recover" benefits that was subject to the strictures in \xc2\xa7 405(h). See 466 U. S., at 620. But in this case, as in <i>Mich</i><i>igan Academy, </i>the plaintiffs are providers, not patients. Their challenges to the Secretary\'s regulations simply do not fall within the "to recover" language of \xc2\xa7 405(h) that was obviously drafted to describe pecuniary claims. The incorporation of that language into the Medicare Act via \xc2\xa7 1395ii provides no textual support for the Court\'s decision today. Moreover, contrary to the Court\'s "Pandora\'s box" rhetoric, <i>ante, </i>at 17-18, adherence to the plain meaning of "to recover" would not make it necessary for the Court to revisit any of its earlier cases. For this reason, as well as the reasons set forth by JUSTICE THOMAS, I find nothing in the relevant statutory text that should be construed to bar this action.</p><p>JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.</p><p>I join the opinion of JUSTICE THOMAS except for Part III, and think it necessary to add a few words in explanation</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="32">32</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>of that vote: I am doubtful whether <i>Bowen </i>v. <i>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/667/case.html">476 U. S. 667</a> (1986), was correctly decided, but that case being on the books, and involving as it does a question of statutory interpretation, I believe it requires affirmance here. There is in my view neither any basis for holding that 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395ii has a different meaning with regard to Part A than with regard to Part B, nor (since repeals by implication are disfavored) any basis for holding that the subsequent addition of a judicial-review provision distantly related to \xc2\xa7 1395ii altered the meaning we had authoritatively pronounced. See <i>post, </i>at 38, n. 7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).</p><p>I do not join Part III of JUSTICE THOMAS\'S opinion because its reliance upon what it calls the presumption of preenforcement review suggests that <i>Michigan Academy </i>was <i>(a fortiori) </i>correctly decided. I might have thought, as an original matter, that the categorical language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1395ii and 405(h) overcame even what JUSTICE THOMAS acknowledges is the <i>stronger </i>presumption of <i>some </i>judicial review. See <i>post, </i>at 45. With regard to the timing of review, I would not even use the word "presumption" (a term which <i>Abbott Laboratories </i>v. <i>Gardner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html">387 U. S. 136</a> (1967), applies only to the preference for judicial review at <i>some </i>point, see <i>id., </i>at 140), since that suggests that some unusually clear statement is required by way of negation. In my view, preenforcement review is better described as the background rule, which can be displaced by any reasonable implication ("persuasive reason to believe," as <i>Abbott Laboratories </i>put it, <i>ibid.) </i>from the statute.</p><p>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, and with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins except as to Part III, dissenting.</p><p>Unlike the majority, I take no position on how 42 U.

S. 667</a> (1986), to hold that this incorporating reference is triggered when a particular fact-bound determination is in dispute, but not in the case, as here, of a "challeng[e] to the validity of the Secretary\'s instructions and regulations." <i>Id., </i>at 680. Though this (or any) interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1395ii is not entirely free from doubt in light of the arguable tension between <i>Michigan Academy </i>and our earlier decision in <i>Heckler </i>v. <i>Ringer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/602/case.html">466 U. S. 602</a> (1984), I would resolve such doubt by following our longstanding presumption in favor of preenforcement judicial review. Accordingly, I would hold that \xc2\xa7 405(h) does not apply to respondent\'s challenge, and therefore does not preclude respondent from bringing suit under general federal-question jurisdiction, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331.</p><p align="center">\nI A</p><p><i>Michigan Academy </i>was the first time we discussed the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1395ii. In earlier Medicare Act cases where the plaintiffs had sought to proceed under general federalquestion jurisdiction, we either had no need to address \xc2\xa7 1395ii, or assumed in passing (and without discussion) that \xc2\xa7 1395ii <i>always </i>incorporates \xc2\xa7 405(h).</p><p>Our decision in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Erika, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/201/case.html">456 U.

We dealt there with a Part B dispute over the appropriate amount of reimbursement for certain medical supplies.2 The statute provided</p><p>1 Section 1395ii provides in relevant part that the provisions of \xc2\xa7 405(h) "shall also apply with respect to [the Medicare Act] to the same extent as they are applicable with respect to [the Social Security Act]."</p><p>2 Part B of the Medicare Act provides voluntary supplemental insurance coverage to eligible individuals for certain physician charges and medical services that are not covered by Part A.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395u (1982 ed.)). But the statutory scheme did not mention the possibility of judicial review of Part B benefit amount determinations, much less review by the Secretary. By contrast, the statute did expressly provide for administrative review by the Secretary and judicial review in two instances: disputes concerning the claimant\'s eligibility for benefits under Part A or Part B, and disputes over benefit amount determinations <i>under Part A. 456 </i>U. S., at 207 (citing 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395ff (1982 ed.)). We found this contrast illuminating: "In the context of the statute\'s precisely drawn provisions, this omission provides persuasive evidence that Congress deliberately intended to foreclose further review of [Part B benefit amount determinations]." 456 U.

These plaintiffs asserted no concrete claim to Part B benefits, for judicial review of such a claim was clearly foreclosed by the statute as interpreted in <i>Erika; </i>they instead invoked federal-question jurisdiction.

The "precisely drawn" provisions on which we had focused in <i>Erika </i>did not support the Secretary\'s proposed inference, as they "simply d[id] not speak to challenges mounted against the <i>method </i>by which such amounts are to be determined." 476 U.

Section 405(h) does not apply on its own terms to Part B of the Medicare program, but is instead incorporated <i>mutatis mutandis </i>by \xc2\xa7 1395ii. The legislative history of both the statute establishing the Medicare program and the 1972 amendments thereto provides specific evidence of Congress\' intent to foreclose review only of \'amount determinations\'-i. <i>e., </i>those \'quite minor matters,\' 118 Congo Rec. 33992 (1972) (remarks of Sen.

In the face of this persuasive evidence of legislative intent, we will not indulge the Government\'s assumption that Congress contemplated review by carriers of \'trivial\' monetary claims, <i>ibid., </i>but intended no review at all of substantial statutory and constitutional challenges to the Secretary\'s administration of Part B of the Medicare program." <i>Id., </i>at 680 (footnotes omitted).</p></blockquote><p>We accordingly held that the physicians\' challenge to the Secretary\'s regulation could proceed under general federalquestion jurisdiction.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>In light of the quoted passage, it is beyond dispute that our holding in <i>Michigan Academy </i>rested squarely on the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1395ii.

Therefore, the majority concludes, <i>Michigan Academy\'s </i>interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1395ii simply does not bear on respondent\'s challenge to the Secretary\'s regulations here. See <i>ante, </i>at 20.</p><p>But \xc2\xa7 1395ii applies to more than just \xc2\xa7 1395ff, the provision concerning benefit amounts; it applies, rather, to the entire Medicare Act, including \xc2\xa7 1395cc, the provision concerning provider agreements that <i>is </i>directly at issue here.

Accordingly, the interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1395ii that we announced in <i>Michigan Academy </i>must have a more general import than a distinction between Part B benefits determinations, on the one hand, and Part B methods guiding such determinations, on the other. <i>Michigan Academy </i>must have established a distinction between, on the one hand, a dispute over <i>any </i>particularized determination and, on the other hand, a "challeng[e] to the validity of the Secretary\'s instructions and regulations," 476 U.

In doing so, the Court confuses the reasoning (more precisely, <i>one half </i>of the reasoning) of <i>Michigan Academy </i>with the holding in that case. In <i>Michigan Academy, </i>we undoubtedly relied on the reality that, if the challenge to the Secretary\'s regulations were not allowed to proceed under general federal-question jurisdiction, the Secretary\'s administration of Part B benefit amount determinations would be entirely insulated from judicial review, a result in tension with the "\'strong presumption that Congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial review\' of executive action."8 476 U.

Accordingly, "[t]he most that can be said is that the point was in the cas[e] if anyone had seen fit to raise it.

Consider how this test would apply to Freeman Ringer, one of the four plaintiffs in <i>Ringer. </i>Ringer sought to challenge the Secretary\'s policy proscribing reimbursement for a certain type of surgery (a Part A benefits issue), invoking general federal-question jurisdiction. He had no concrete reimbursement claim to present, for he did not possess the financial means to pay for the surgery up front and await reimbursement. Nor, apparently, could he obtain private financing for the surgery. See <i>Ringer, </i>466 U.

It seems to me that Ringer is the paradigmatic example of a party who "can obtain no review at all unless [he] can obtain judicial review in a \xc2\xa7 1331 action," <i>ante, </i>at 20, such that he plainly would qualify for the <i>Michigan Academy </i>exception to \xc2\xa7 1395ii as described by the majority.</p><p>The majority purports to reaffirm <i>Ringer in toto, </i>but it does so only by revising that case to hold that Ringer, notwithstanding his own inability to obtain judicial review with-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="43">43</a></p><p>out an anticipatory challenge, did not qualify for the <i>Michigan Academy </i>exception to \xc2\xa7 1395ii because others in his class could afford to pursue review by undergoing the surgery and presenting a concrete claim for reimbursement.

Setting aside the peculiarity of interpreting a statute to deny judicial review to the poor with the promise that the rich will obtain review in their stead,lO the majority\'s gloss on <i>Ringer </i>ignores the <i>Ringer </i>Court\'s own description of its holding. In rejecting plaintiff Ringer\'s attempt to use \xc2\xa7 1331, the <i>Ringer </i>Court did not rely on some notion that Ringer or those similarly situated to him could as a practical matter seek judicial review through some means other than \xc2\xa7 1331; the Court instead reasoned that Ringer\'s claim was "essentially one requesting the payment of benefits for [a particular] surgery, a claim cognizable only under \xc2\xa7 405(g)." 466 u.

Although the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) did not authorize a preenforcement challenge to the type of regulation the Secretary had issued, and indeed expressly enumerated certain <i>other </i>kinds of regulations for which preenforcement review was available, we explained that these indicia of congressional intent must be viewed through the lens of the presumption:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The first question we consider is whether Congress by the [FDCA] intended to forbid pre-enforcement review of this sort of regulation promulgated by the Commissioner. The question is phrased in terms of \'prohibition\' rather than \'authorization\' because a survey of our cases shows that judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress." <i>Abbott Laboratories, </i>387 U. S., at 139-140.</p></blockquote><p>We thus held that the suit could proceed. <i>Id., </i>at 148.</p><p>More recently, in <i>Haitian Refugee Center, </i>we reaffirmed the applicability of the presumption in the context of a preenforcement challenge.

Despite the availability of judicial review of these procedures in the context of statutorily authorized review of orders of exclusion or deportation, and notwithstanding the statute\'s express prohibition of judicial review of an INS "determination respecting an application for adjustment of status [under the amnesty program]," 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1160(e)(1), we held that these factors did not suffice to trump the "strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action." <i>Haitian Refugee Center, </i>498 U.

S., at 762; <i>Thunder Basin Coal, supra, </i>at 207, n. 8; <i>Haitian Refugee Center, supra, </i>at 496-499). But <i>Thunder Basin Coal, </i>as noted, <i>supra, </i>at 45, teaches only that the presumption is not as strong when the problem is one of delayed judicial review rather than complete denial of judicial review-it does not establish that the presumption lacks <i>any </i>force in the former context. And <i>Haitian Refugee Center </i>directly <i>supports </i>the applicability of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review; we there invoked the presumption even though the plaintiffs had a postenforcement review option-voluntarily surrendering themselves for deportation and availing themselves of the statutorily authorized judicial review of an order of exclusion or deportation. 498 U.

Only <i>Salfi </i>provides the majority with modest support insofar as it acknowledged (and distinguished) just the presumption against the <i>com</i><i>plete </i>denial of judicial review, 422 U. S., at 762, omitting mention of the presumption against delayed judicial review. But this omission is readily explained: Presentment of a Social</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="47">47</a></p><p>Security benefits claim for purposes of 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 405(g) is accomplished by the near-costless act of filing an application for benefits, to be contrasted with the extremely burdensome presentment requirement facing the aliens in <i>Haitian Refugee Center </i>or the named plaintiff in <i>Ringer. </i>The only significant hardship facing the claimants in <i>Salfi </i>arose from the possibility that a lengthy administrative review process would postpone a judicial decision ordering the Secretary to pay the disputed benefits; but the Court took care of that problem by leniently construing \xc2\xa7 405(g)\'s requirement of a "final" agency decision and by allowing the Secretary to waive entirely \xc2\xa7 405(g)\'s requirement that decision be made "after a hearing." At bottom, then, the majority cannot demonstrate why the presumption in favor of preenforcement review, which dates at least from <i>Abbott Laboratories, </i>should not be invoked to resolve the debate between our conflicting readings of \xc2\xa7 1395ii.</p><p>There is a practical reason why we employ the presumption not only to questions of whether judicial review is available, but also to questions of <i>when </i>judicial review is available. Delayed review-that is, a requirement that a regulated entity disobey the regulation, suffer an enforcement proceeding by the agency, and only then seek judicial review-may mean no review at all. For when the costs of "presenting" a claim via the delayed review route exceed the costs of simply complying with the regulation, the regulated entity will buckle under and comply, even when the regulation is plainly invalid. See Seidenfeld, Playing Games with the Timing of Judicial Review, 58 Ohio St. L. J. 85, 104 (1997). And we can expect that this consequence will often flow from an interpretation of an ambiguous statute to bar preenforcement review. In <i>Haitian Refugee Center, </i>for example, the aliens\' "postenforcement" review option for asserting their challenge to the agency\'s procedures required the aliens to voluntarily surrender themselves for deportation, suffer an order of deport a-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="48">48</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>tion, and seek judicial review of that order in the court of appeals. These costs of presentment, we explained, were "[q]uite obviously ... tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review for most undocumented aliens." 498 U. S., at 496-497.</p><p>A similar predicament faces the nursing homes represented by respondent in the instant case, who contend that the Secretary\'s regulations (and manual) governing enforcement of substantive standards are unlawful in various respects. The nursing homes\' "postenforcement" review route is delineated by 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h)(1), which provides that "an institution or agency dissatisfied ... with a determination described in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be entitled to a hearing thereon by the Secretary (after reasonable notice) to the same extent as is provided in section 405(b) of this title, and to judicial review of the Secretary\'s final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) of this title." While the meaning of "determination" in the referenced 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1395cc(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) is not entirely free from doubt, the Secretary has interpreted these provisions to mean that administrative and judicial review is afforded for "any determination that a provider has failed to comply substantially with the statute, agreements, or regulations, whether termination or <i>\'some other remedy </i>is imposed.\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 21 (quoting Reply Brief for Petitioners 14 (emphasis in original)). Still, even under the Secretary\'s reading, an inspection team\'s assessment of a deficiency (for noncompliance) against the nursing home does not suffice to trigger administrative and judicial review under \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h). Presentment of a claim via \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h) requires the nursing home not merely to expose itself to an assessment of a deficiency by an inspection team, but also to forbear correction of the deficiency until the Secretary (or her state designees) impose a remedy.</p><p>Respondent and its <i>amici </i>advance several plausible reasons why such forbearance will prove costly-indeed, costly</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="49">49</a></p><p>enough that compliance with the challenged regulations and manual is the more rational option. For one, nursing homes face the prospect of termination-the most severe of remedies-simply by virtue of failing to submit a voluntary plan of correction and correct the deficiencies. See 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 488.456(b)(1) (1998). The Secretary\'s only response is that terminations are rarely imposed in fact, and certainly are not imposed where the provider has postponed correction of its deficiencies in order to preserve its appeal rights. But any such leniency is solely a matter of grace by the Secretary, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, and provides little comfort to a nursing facility pondering the \xc2\xa7 1395cc(h) route to judicial review. And exposure to the termination remedy is not the only consequence faced by a nursing home that forestalls correction of its deficiencies. The Secretary also may impose civil monetary penalties, which accrue for each day of noncompliance, 42 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 488.430, 488.440(b) (1998), and thus quite plainly stand as a calibrated deterrent to the forbearance strategy. Cf. <i>Ex parte Young, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a>, 148 (1908) ("[T]o impose upon a party interested the burden of obtaining a judicial decision ... only upon the condition that if unsuccessful he must suffer imprisonment and pay fines ... is, in effect, to close up all approaches to the courts").12 Other costs of the forbearance strategy are less tangible, but potentially as significant. For example, a finding of a deficiency at a nursing facility-which may well rest on unbalanced or inaccurate data-is posted in a place easily accessible to residents, 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 483.10(g)(1) (1998), disclosed</p><p>12 In <i>Thunder Basin Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Reich, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/200/case.html">510 U. S. 200</a> (1994), the aggrieved mine operator was similarly subject to civil penalties ($5,000) for each day of noncompliance with statutory provisions, which would become final and payable after review by the agency and the appropriate court of appeals. <i>Id., </i>at 204, n. 4, 218. But, unlike the nursing homes at issue here, the aggrieved mine operator apparently had the option of complying and then bringing a judicial challenge. See <i>id., </i>at 221 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="50">50</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>to the public, 42 U.

I read our cases to establish just this sort of analysis: (1) in light of the presumption, construe an ambiguous statute in favor of preenforcement review; (2) apply ripeness doctrine to determine whether the suit should be entertained. Thus, in <i>Abbott Laboratories </i>and its two companion cases, we construed an ambiguous statute to permit preenforcement review, see <i>id., </i>at 148; <i>Gardner </i>v. <i>Toilet Goods Assn., supra, </i>at 168; <i>Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. </i>v. <i>Gardner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/158/case.html">387 U.

In line with this mode of analysis, the court below, after concluding that the Medicare Act does not preclude general federalquestion jurisdiction over a preenforcement challenge to the Secretary\'s regulations, held that respondent\'s AP A notice-and-comment challenge was ripe but that its constitutional vagueness claim was not. 143 F. 3d, at 1076-1077.</p><p>While I express no view on the proper application of ripeness doctrine to respondent\'s claims,14 I am confident that this method of analysis enjoys substantially more support in our cases than does the majority\'s approach, which prescribes a case-by-case hardship inquiry at the threshold stage of determining whether preenforcement review has been precluded by statute. See <i>ante, </i>at 20 (holding that \xc2\xa7 1395ii does not incorporate \xc2\xa7 405(h) where the aggrieved party "can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain judicial review in a \xc2\xa7 1331 action"). While the majority\'s variation would be harmless if its hardship test were no more stringent than the hardship prong of ordinary ripeness doctrine, I presume its test is more exacting-otherwise the majority opinion is no more than a well-disguised application of ripeness doctrine to the facts of this case.15 At bottom, then, the majority superimposes a more burdensome hardship test on ordinary ripeness doctrine for aggrieved persons who</p><p>14 The Secretary did not seek review of the Court of Appeals\' holding that respondent\'s APA notice-and-comment challenge is ripe, Pet. for Cert.

We are told that the relevant hardship is not that endured by the "individual plaintiff," but rather that confronted by the "class" of persons similarly situated to the individual plaintiff. <i>Ante, </i>at 22-23; see <i>supra, </i>at 42-43.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="52">52</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>seek to bring a preenforcement challenge to the Secretary\'s regulations under the Medicare Act.16</p><p>***</p><p>Instead, I would hold that \xc2\xa7 1395ii, as interpreted by <i>Mich</i><i>igan Academy, </i>does not in this case incorporate \xc2\xa7 405(h)\'s preclusion of federal-question jurisdiction, especially in light of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review. I respectfully dissent.</p><p>16 The majority betrays its misunderstanding of the relationship between the presumption in favor of preenforcement review and ripeness doctrine when it says that "any ... presumption [in favor of preenforcement review] must be far weaker than a presumption against preclusion of all review in light of the traditional ripeness doctrine, which often requires initial presentation of a claim to an agency." <i>Ante, </i>at 1920. I do not dispute that respondent must demonstrate that its claims are ripe before the District Court may entertain respondent\'s preenforcement challenge. My point is only that respondent should be <i>permitted </i>to make its ripeness argument and to have that argument assessed according to traditional ripeness doctrine, rather than facing statutory preclusion of review by (inevitably) failing the majority\'s "super-hardship" test. As I explained, <i>supra, </i>at 50, our cases establish a two-step analysis: (1) in light of the presumption in favor of preenforcement review, construe an ambiguous statute to allow pre enforcement review; (2) apply ripeness doctrine to determine whether the suit should be entertained.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
