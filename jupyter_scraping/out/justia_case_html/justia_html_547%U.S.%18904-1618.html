Granting the County summary judgment, the District Court recognized that Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit does not extend to counties, but relied on Circuit precedent to conclude that sovereign immunity extends to counties and municipalities that, as here, exercise power delegated from the State.  The Eleventh Circuit, which was bound by that same precedent, affirmed.  It acknowledged that the County did not assert an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense, which would fail because, under other Circuit precedent, the County did not qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9carm of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals nonetheless concluded that common law has carved out a \xe2\x80\x9cresidual immunity\xe2\x80\x9d that protects political subdivisions such as the County from suit.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0An entity that does not qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9carm of the State\xe2\x80\x9d for Eleventh Amendment purposes cannot assert sovereign immunity as a defense to an admiralty suit.

S. 706</a>, 713.  Thus, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Eleventh Amendment immunity\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 713.  Because preratification sovereignty is the source of immunity from suit, only States and arms of the State possess immunity from suits authorized by federal law.  See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 740.  Accordingly, sovereign immunity does not extend to counties, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lake Country Estates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/391/index.html">440 U.

The County argues unconvincingly that this Court has recognized a distinct \xe2\x80\x9cresidual\xe2\x80\x9d immunity that permits adoption of a broader test than it applies in the Eleventh Amendment context to determine whether an entity is acting as an arm of the State entitled to immunity.  The Court has referenced only the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cresiduary and inviolable sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d that survived the Constitution.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/743/index.html">535 U. S. 743</a>, 751.  Because the County may claim immunity neither based upon its identity as a county nor under an expansive arm-of-the-State test, it is subject to suit unless it was acting as an arm of the State, as delineated by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, in operating the drawbridge.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Alden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 756.  The County conceded below that it was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County and the Eleventh Circuit appear to have understood this concession to be based on the County\xe2\x80\x99s failure to qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9carm of the State\xe2\x80\x9d under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  Moreover, certiorari was granted in this case premised on the conclusion that the County is not an arm of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes, and this Court presumes that to be the case.  The County\xe2\x80\x99s concession and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s presumption are dispositive.

Such recognition cannot be reconciled with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, which applied the general principle that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit against a city to an admiralty suit as early as <em>Workman</em> v. <em>New York City,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/179/552/index.html">179 U. S. 552</a>, 570.  The Court disagrees with the County\xe2\x80\x99s contention that <em>Workman</em> does not govern the instant case under <em>Ex parte New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/256/490/index.html">256 U. S. 490</a>, 498, where, in extending sovereign immunity beyond cases \xe2\x80\x9cin law or equity\xe2\x80\x9d to admiralty cases, the Court concluded that <em>Workman </em>involved only substantive admiralty law, not the power of the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular defendant.  But <em>Workman </em>did so precisely because the Court there held that admiralty courts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations.  See 179 U. S., at 565.  The <em>Workman </em>Court accordingly distinguished between the question before it\xe2\x80\x94whether admiralty courts may, notwithstanding state law, \xe2\x80\x9credress a wrong committed by one over whom such courts have adequate jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 566, such as a municipal corporation\xe2\x80\x94and the question <em>not </em>before it, but before the Court in <em>Ex parte New York</em>\xe2\x80\x94whether admiralty courts may \xe2\x80\x9cgive redress in a case where jurisdiction over the person or property cannot be exerted,\xe2\x80\x9d 179 U. S., at 566.  In the former circumstance, the court should apply general admiralty principles, while in the latter the court lacks the power to do so.  See <em>id., </em>at 570; <em>Ex parte New York</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 499\xe2\x80\x93500, 502\xe2\x80\x93503.<em> </em>Because here, as in <em>Workman </em>and in contrast to <em>Ex parte New York</em>, the defendant was an entity generally within the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, <em>Ex parte New York </em>is inapposite, and <em>Workman</em> compels the conclusion that the County is unprotected by sovereign immunity.

The District Court granted the County\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by sovereign immunity.  Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  We granted certiorari to consider \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether an entity that does not qualify as an \xe2\x80\x98arm of the State\xe2\x80\x99 for Eleventh Amendment purposes can nonetheless assert sovereign immunity as a defense to an admiralty suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  546 U.

On October 6, 2002, James Ludwig requested that the bridge be raised to allow his boat to pass.  The bridge malfunctioned, a portion falling and colliding with Mr. Ludwig\xe2\x80\x99s boat.  As a result of the collision, Mr. Ludwig and his wife incurred damages in excess of $130,000.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ludwigs submitted a claim for those damages to their insurer, Northern, which paid in accordance with the terms of their insurance policy.  Northern then sought to recover its costs by filing suit in admiralty against the County in the District Court.  The County sought summary judgment, arguing that Northern\xe2\x80\x99s claims were barred by sovereign immunity.  The County conceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity did not extend to counties, but nonetheless contended that it was immune under \xe2\x80\x9cthe universal rule of state immunity from suit without the state\xe2\x80\x99s consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Case No. CV403\xe2\x80\x93099, App. 33a.

See The Federalist No. 39, p.\xc2\xa0245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.

The County conceded below that it was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County and the Court of Appeals appear to have understood this concession to be based on the County\xe2\x80\x99s failure to qualify as an arm of the State under our precedent.  See App. 83a, n.\xc2\xa01 (recognizing that the County rightly disclaimed an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense because such a defense would be inconsistent with the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Vierling</em> v. <em>Celebrity Cruises, Inc.</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 1309 (CA11 2003), that the Broward County Port Authority was not an arm of the State); Brief of Appellee Chatham County in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9313308DD (CA11), p.\xc2\xa013 (distinguishing <em>Vierling</em> in part because it dealt with the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity); see also Brief for Respondent 8 (implicitly conceding that respondent is not an arm of the State under our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence).  Moreover, the question on which we granted certiorari is premised on the conclusion that the County is not \xe2\x80\x9can \xe2\x80\x98arm of the State\xe2\x80\x99 for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d 546 U. S. ___ (2005), and we presume that to be the case.  Accordingly, the County\xe2\x80\x99s concession and the presumption un-\nderlying the question on which we granted review are dispositive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an alternative ground for affirmance, the County asks the Court to recognize a distinct sovereign immunity against <em>in personam</em> admiralty suits that bars cases arising from a county\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of core state functions with regard to navigable waters.  Recognition of a distinct immunity in admiralty cases cannot be reconciled with our precedents.  Immunity in admiralty, like other sovereign immunity, is simply an application of \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/256/490/index.html">256 U. S. 490</a>, 497\xe2\x80\x93500 (1921).  Accordingly, this Court has resolved sovereign immunity questions in admiralty by relying upon principles set out in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity cases, rather than by examining the history or jurisprudence specific to suits in admiralty.  See <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 754\xe2\x80\x93769 (an admiralty suit relying heavily on <em>Alden</em>, <em>supra </em>(plaintiff raised a Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 claim), and <em>Seminole Tribe</em> <em>of Fla. </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/44/index.html">517 U. S. 44</a> (1996) (plaintiff alleged violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act)).  Indeed, the Court applied the general principle that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit against a city to an admiralty suit as early as <em>Workman</em> v. <em>New York City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/179/552/index.html"></a><a href="/us/179/552/index.html">179 U. S. 552</a>, which held that such immunity \xe2\x80\x9cafforded no reason for denying redress in a court of admiralty for the wrong which \xe2\x80\xa6 [had] been committed\xe2\x80\x9d by the city of New York, <em>id.,</em> at 570.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The County nonetheless contends\xe2\x80\x94and the Eleventh Circuit, in reliance upon the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in <em>Wickman</em>, held\xe2\x80\x94that the reach of <em>Workman </em>is limited, and that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Ex parte New York</em>, <em>supra, </em>demonstrates that <em>Workman</em> does not govern the instant case.  See <em>Wickman</em>, 195 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 615.  We disagree.  <em>Ex parte New York </em>extended sovereign immunity beyond cases \xe2\x80\x9cin law or equity\xe2\x80\x9d to cases in admiralty.  As the County points out, <em>Ex parte New York </em>concluded that <em>Workman </em>involved only the substantive law of admiralty, and not the power of the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular defendant.  <em>Ex parte New York</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 498. <em> </em>But <em>Workman </em>dealt only with the substantive law of admiralty precisely because the <em>Workman </em>Court held that admiralty courts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations.  See 179 U. S., at 565 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a general rule, municipal corporations, like individuals, may be sued; in other words \xe2\x80\xa6 they are amenable to judicial process for the purpose of compelling performance of their obligations\xe2\x80\x9d).  The <em>Workman </em>Court accordingly distinguished between the question before it\xe2\x80\x94whether courts of admiralty may, notwithstanding state law, \xe2\x80\x9credress a wrong committed by one over whom such courts have adequate jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 566, such as a municipal corporation\xe2\x80\x94and the question <em>not </em>before it, but before the Court in <em>Ex parte New York</em>\xe2\x80\x94whether courts of admiralty may \xe2\x80\x9cgive redress in a case where jurisdiction over the person or property cannot be exerted,\xe2\x80\x9d 179 U. S., at 566.  In the former circumstance, the court should apply general admiralty principles, while in the latter the court lacks the power to do so.  See <em>id., </em>at 570; <em>Ex parte New York</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 499\xe2\x80\x93500, 502\xe2\x80\x93503.<em> </em>Because here, as in <em>Workman </em>and in contrast to <em>Ex parte New York</em>, the defendant was an entity generally within the jurisdiction of the District Court, <em>Ex parte New York </em>is inapposite, and <em>Workman</em> compels the conclusion that the County is unprotected by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the County has failed to demonstrate that it was acting as an arm of the State when it operated the Causton Bluff Bridge, the County is not entitled to immunity from Northern\xe2\x80\x99s suit.
