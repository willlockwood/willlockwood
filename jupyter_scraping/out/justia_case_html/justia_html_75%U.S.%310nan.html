S. 313</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It will be seen by reference to the statutes of the territory of the 29th November, 1861, that the assessor is only authorized to make subsequent assessments upon the property of a citizen or inhabitant which was subject to taxation at a regular or annual assessment and had escaped the tax from mistake or otherwise, and which is a very common provision in every system of taxation.  And if this was the question presented to the court below upon the pleadings or proofs, there could be no doubt as to the correctness of the decision.  But the question presented by the answer was not one of this description, but of double taxation, for if the facts were true as set forth, the property had been taxed either at the regular assessment or had been purchased or procured by the defendants after this assessment, and therefore not the subject of a subsequent tax within the meaning of the statute.  On this ground, the answer presented a perfect defense to the action.</p>\n<p>The court below, however, on motion of the plaintiff, struck out this defense as to all the property except one item of seven or eight thousand dollars in value, which stood in the answer in the same category with all the rest of the property.  This singular mode of meeting a legal defense set up in the pleadings had not been explained by any counsel representing the plaintiff, and in the absence of such explanation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 75 U. S. 314</a></p><p> we can only apply to it the usual and customary principles governing pleadings in like cases, and hold that it was an error which entitled the party aggrieved to a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p>If any authority was needed for so obvious a proposition, we refer to the case of <em>Hozey v. Buchanan.</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/310/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>The Court there said that it would be as novel as it would seem to be unjust to strike out of the answer, on motion of the plaintiff, that which constitutes a good defense and on which the defendant may chiefly rely.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed and remitted to court below.</em></p>\n<p>*  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/215/case.html">41 U.
