The only thing perfectly clear from this record is that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1002">Page 402 U.S. 1000 , 1002</a></p><p> petitioner has no rights under state law to a hearing to correct the reports even if they are total lies. And it appears petitioner will never be informed prior to transmittal of her file to the various \'authorized\' groups. </p><p> The State contends that petitioner will suffer no harm from having the material in her files. We are told everyone will know the report is only an opinion; the decree of the juvenile court will be included; and the file will be treated confidentially. While of course we can not know if the information is false and can not tell which and how many uses will be made of the file, it is apparent that petitioner does raise some serious questions concerning its use. Participation \'in the new Work- Incentive Programs is initiated by a referral by respondent\'s department of, among others, persons who are \'appropriate for referral.\' R.C.W. 74.22. 020; 74.23.040. Those who are referred receive substantial training benefits as well as increased case benefits. R.C.W. 74.22.050, .060; R.C.W. 74.23.060, .070. Similarly, the availability of sheltered workshop programs depends upon a determination by the respondent\'s department that the subject, if a \'disadvantaged person,\' \'can reasonably be expected to benefit from, or in his best interests reasonably requires\' such a program. R.C.W. 28A.10.080(2).\' The only answer that respondent gives to this is that any \'information transmitted to the Employment Security Department under the Work Incentive Program is for the benefit of the recipient.\' How petitioner would benefit from the transmission of the allegedly false material we are not told. </p><p> The Washington State public assistance programs are designed to receive federal assistance whenever federal funds are available. Various provisions in the appropriate title of the Revised Code of Washington dealing with public assistance refer to conformity with and pri- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1003">Page 402 U.S. 1000 , 1003</a></p><p> macy of federal law. E. g., R.C.W. 74.04.055 (if more than one construction possibly favor that \'most likely to satisfy federal laws\'); R. C.W. 74.23.005 (\'The legislature hereby expresses its intention to comply with the requirements under the federal social security act, as amended, creating a work incentive program\' for mothers receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children); R.C.W. 74.23.900 (if any part of the chapter conflicts with federal law it is to that extent inoperative). The record in this case is not clear as to which types of public assistance petitioner is receiving. Prior to the temporary unsuccessful attempt to remove her children from her custody she was receiving AFDC benefits. From the references in the briefs to eligibility for the AFDC Work Incentive Program it would appear that she is now again receiving AFDC benefits. </p><p> When federal funds are used then standards are to be shaped and tested federally. Helvering v. Davis, <a href="/cases/federal/us/301/619/case.html">301 U.S. 619</a>; Ivanhoe Irrig. Dist. v. McCracken, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/275/case.html#295">357 U.S. 275, 295</a>; Rosado v. Wyman, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#427">397 U.S. 397, 427</a>d 442 (concurring opinion). </p><p> If meanwhile she was denied a fair hearing under state law, an important question of procedural due process is raised under the Fourteenth Amendment. For petitioner\'s right to continued assistance-an important property interest-cannot be reduced or terminated without notice and an opportunity to be heard. Cf. Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/337/case.html">395 U.S. 337</a>. </p><p> If petitioner was at the time receiving federal assistance then under HEW Regulations, she was entitled to a fair hearing: </p><p> The Department\'s regulations require that provision be made for granting a fair hearing: </p><ul>\'... to any individual requesting a hearing because his claim for financial or medical assistance is de- <p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="1004">Page 402 U.S. 1000 , 1004</a></p><p> nied, or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness, or because he is aggrieved by any other agency action affecting receipt, suspension, reduction, or termination of such assistance or by agency policy as it affects his situation [45 CFR 205.10(a)(3), emphasis added].\'</p></ul> <p> As the Solicitor General says in his brief, filed at our request: </p><ul>\'One may say, quite simply, that the report which petitioner challenges threatens receipt of AFDC payments by threatening to deprive petitioner of her children, on which her receipt of AFDC benefits depends. One of the federal requirements for a state plan for AFDC is that it must:</ul> <ul>\'(16) provide that where the State agency has reason to believe that the home in which a relative and child receiving aid reside is unsuitable for the child because of the neglect, abuse, or exploitation of such child it shall bring such condition to the attention of the appropriate court or law enforcement agencies in the State, providing such data with respect to the situation it may have [ 42 U.S.C. 602(a)(16) (Supp. IV)].</ul> <ul>\'If any question were now to arise as to the suitability of the home for the children, the prior report might well have an effect on referral of the case to the courts and action by the courts, notwithstanding the 1967 decision of the Juvenile Court. Thus, the report retains a constant potential effect on petitioner\'s custody of her children and thereby on her receipt of assistance.\'</ul> <p> We cannot be sure of the exact posture of this case; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1005">Page 402 U.S. 1000 , 1005</a></p><p> but whether or not the claim at the time was federally funded, a question of national importance is presented. Accordingly I would grant the petition for certiorari. </p><p> Mr. Justice BRENNAN is of the opinion that certiorari should be granted. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Law reviews have been devoting increasing attention to the problem.
