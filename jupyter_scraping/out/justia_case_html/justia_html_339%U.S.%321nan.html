The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="322">Page 339 U.

From the papers submitted on appeal, it does not appear that the statutory sections in question have as yet been construed by the state courts.  We are therefore of opinion that the District Court erred in disposing of the complaint on the merits.  <em>See American Federation of Labor v.
