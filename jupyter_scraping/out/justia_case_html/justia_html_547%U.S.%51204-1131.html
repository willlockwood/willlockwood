DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION<br/>\n547 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 04-1131<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">TERRY L. WHITMAN, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> DEPARTMENT\nOF TRANSPORTATION et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[June 5, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Terry Whitman, the petitioner, is an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is subject to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s drug and alcohol testing program.  Without\nfirst seeking to pursue grievance procedures under his\ncollective-bargaining agreement, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, alleging the FAA tested him in a nonrandom manner, in violation of his constitutional rights and 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa745104(8).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FAA has its own procedural framework for the resolution of claims by its employees; and for this purpose it adopts certain sections of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), including Chapter 71 of Title 5, which sets forth the rules for grievances.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa740122(g)(2)(C).  The District Court held that, under the provisions of the CSRA, it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that because \xe2\x80\x9c5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77121(a)(1), as amended in 1994, does not expressly confer federal court jurisdiction over employment-related claims covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of federal employees\xe2\x80\x99 collective bargaining agreements,\xe2\x80\x9d his claims are precluded.  382 F.\xc2\xa03d 938, 939 (2004).  This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment.  545 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals was correct to say that 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction.  Another statute, however\xe2\x80\x94a very familiar one\xe2\x80\x94grants jurisdiction to the federal courts over \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  The question, then, is not whether 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77121 confers jurisdiction, but whether \xc2\xa77121 (or the CSRA as a whole) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts, see <em>Verizon Md. Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/635/index.html">535 U. S. 635</a>, 642 (2002) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9ceven if [47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa7252(e)(6) does not <em>confer</em> jurisdiction, it at least does not <em>divest</em> the district courts of their authority under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331 to review the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order for compliance with federal law\xe2\x80\x9d), or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing remedies beyond those set out in the CSRA, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Fausto,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/439/index.html">484 U. S. 439</a>, 443\xe2\x80\x93444 (1988); <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> v. <em>Gardner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/index.html">387 U. S. 136</a>, 140 (1967) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is phrased in terms of \xe2\x80\x98prohibition\xe2\x80\x99 rather than \xe2\x80\x98authorization\xe2\x80\x99 because \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In deciding the question of jurisdiction and preclusion, the Court would be required first to ascertain where Whitman\xe2\x80\x99s claims fit within the statutory scheme, as the CSRA provides different treatment for grievances depending on the nature of the claim.  It may be, for example, that the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s actions, as described by the petitioner, constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited personnel practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(b); 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa740122(g)(2)(A).  Both the petitioner and the Government say they do not, but because the ultimate question may be jurisdictional, this concession ought not to be accepted out of hand.  See <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/645/index.html">412 U. S. 645</a>, 652 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9cParties, of course, cannot confer jurisdiction; only Congress can do so\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court of Appeals did not decide whether the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations state a \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited personnel practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The proper course, then, is to remand for the Court of Appeals to address the matter, see <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</em> v. <em>Smith, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/459/index.html">525 U. S. 459</a>, 470 (1999), as well as the ultimate issue of preclusion.  The various other issues raised before this Court, but not decided below, may also be addressed on remand, including: whether the petitioner has challenged final agency action; whether the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies; whether exhaustion is required given this statutory scheme and the Administrative Procedure Act, as interpreted in <em>Darby </em>v. <em>Cisneros,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/137/index.html">509 U. S. 137</a> (1993); and whether the Government has forfeited its exhaustion-of-remedies argument.  It may be that a decision on these questions can obviate the need to decide a more difficult question of preclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
