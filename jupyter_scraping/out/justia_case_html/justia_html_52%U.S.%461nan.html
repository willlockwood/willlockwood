Digges, 52 U.S. 11 How. 461 461 (1850)</h3><p><b>Van Buren v. Digges</b></p><p><b>52 U.S. (11 How.) 461</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Where a contractor engaged to build a house for a certain sum of money, and the owner of the house, when sued, offered to prove that there were various omissions in the work stipulated to be done, and portions of the work were done in a defective manner, not being as well done as contracted for, and filed a bill of particulars of these omissions and defects by way of setoff, this evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p>The old rule that where a party shall have been injured either by a partial failure of consideration for the contract or by the nonfulfillment of the contract or by breach of warranty, he must be driven to a cross-action has been much relaxed in later times.  The case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/50/213/case.html">Withers v. Greene,</a></span></em> 9 How. 213, referred to and reaffirmed.</p>\n<p>Where the contract provided that if the house were not finished by a certain day, a deduction of ten percent from the price should be made, and the defendant offered evidence to prove that this forfeiture was intended by the parties as liquidated damages, the evidence was properly rejected.  It would have been irregular in the court to go out of the terms of the contract.  Unless the forfeiture had been expressly adopted by the parties as the measure of injury or compensation, it would have been irregular to receive the evidence where the inquiry was into the essential justice and fairness of the acts of the parties.</p>\n<p>Where the defendant offered to prove that certain work which he, the defendant, had caused to be done by a third person was usual and proper and necessary to the completion of the house, this evidence was properly rejected.  He should have proved that it came within the contract.  So also evidence was inadmissible that the defendant, in presence of the plaintiff, insisted upon its being within the contract, for this would have been making the defendant the judge in his own case.</p>\n<p>Mere acquiescence by the contractor in the defendant\'s causing certain work to be done by a third person will not exclude the contractor from the benefit of having further time allowed to finish the house.  It was not necessary for him to make a special agreement that further time should be allowed in consequence of the delay caused by this extra work.</p>\n<p>On 7 August, 1844, William H. Digges and William H. Van Buren entered into a contract in the City of Washington, as follows:</p>\n<p>"It is hereby agreed between William Digges, of the City </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 52 U.

That the said W. H. Van Buren is to pay to said William Digges for the house built and finished as above specified the sum of $4,600 in gold or silver current money of the United States, or its equivalent in banknotes, in the following manner; <em>viz.,</em> $1,000 on the 1st day of September, $1,000 on the 1st of October, $1,000 on the 1st of November, and $1,600 on the day that the house is entirely finished and fit to occupy, provided that it shall not be later than 25 December, 1844, he, William Digges, to forfeit ten percent on the whole amount if said house is not entirely completed and fit to occupy at the time agreed upon, <em>viz.,</em> December 25, 1844."</p>\n<p>"If there should be any matters of detail or finish or matters not specified properly and usually attached to or necessary to the completion of a house such as the one above specified, such things are to be considered as included in this agreement."</p>\n<p>"If any disagreement should occur between the parties in this agreement with regard to matters above specified, such disagreement shall be settled finally and without appeal by three persons, one of whom to be selected by each of the parties and the third chosen by the persons thus selected, and, if necessary, by lot."</p>\n<p>"In witness whereof, the said parties have hereunto set their hands and seals this 7th day of August in the year of our Lord 1844."</p>\n<p>"W.

And thereupon the defendant offered to prove by competent witnesses that before receiving the said work and during the progress thereof, he had objected to the sufficiency of various parts of the same as a compliance with the contract, and had communicated said objections to the plaintiff, and that there were various omissions of work stipulated to be done, and various portions of the work contracted for were done in a defective and inferior manner, and not as well as contracted for by the plaintiff, and that some of these defects were not and could not be discovered by the defendant until after the defendant had entered into the possession and use of the house, and the defendant offered to prove by way of setoff, and having filed a bill of particulars of said alleged omissions and defects and given due notice thereof to the plaintiff and of his purpose in reduction of the contract price of the whole work sued for by the plaintiff, the value of said omissions, and the difference in value between the actual work defectively executed and that contracted for, to which evidence so offered, or any of it, the plaintiff objected as inadmissible under the issue, and the court, on the objection of the plaintiff so taken, refused to admit any of said evidence for said purpose, to which refusal the defendant excepts, and tenders to the court this his bill of exceptions, which is thereupon signed and sealed this 14 April, 1847."</p>\n<p>"W.

The case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/50/213/case.html">Withers v. Greene,</a></span></em> 9 How. 213, referred to and reaffirmed.</p>\n<p>Where the contract provided that if the house were not finished by a certain day, a deduction of ten percent from the price should be made, and the defendant offered evidence to prove that this forfeiture was intended by the parties as liquidated damages, the evidence was properly rejected.  It would have been irregular in the court to go out of the terms of the contract.  Unless the forfeiture had been expressly adopted by the parties as the measure of injury or compensation, it would have been irregular to receive the evidence where the inquiry was into the essential justice and fairness of the acts of the parties.</p>\n<p>Where the defendant offered to prove that certain work which he, the defendant, had caused to be done by a third person was usual and proper and necessary to the completion of the house, this evidence was properly rejected.  He should have proved that it came within the contract.  So also evidence was inadmissible that the defendant, in presence of the plaintiff, insisted upon its being within the contract, for this would have been making the defendant the judge in his own case.</p>\n<p>Mere acquiescence by the contractor in the defendant\'s causing certain work to be done by a third person will not exclude the contractor from the benefit of having further time allowed to finish the house.  It was not necessary for him to make a special agreement that further time should be allowed in consequence of the delay caused by this extra work.</p>\n<p>On 7 August, 1844, William H. Digges and William H. Van Buren entered into a contract in the City of Washington, as follows:</p>\n<p>"It is hereby agreed between William Digges, of the City </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 52 U.

S. 472</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DANIEL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The defendant in error, in a form of proceeding practiced in the court of Washington, instituted a suit in the nature of an action of assumpsit against the plaintiff upon a contract in writing for building a house.  The contract between these parties, which is drawn out in much minuteness of detail, it is not deemed necessary to set forth here <em>in extenso</em> in order to a correct understanding of the questions of law raised upon this record.  Enough for that purpose will be shown in the following extracts from the agreement above mentioned.</p>\n<p>After giving the dimensions of the house to be built, the con </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 52 U. S. 473</a></p><p> tract proceeds with these stipulations concerning the work to be done, and the compensation to be paid therefor:</p>\n<p>"House to be built of two stories, with attic chambers above, of first-rate materials throughout, including office and back buildings, and in the best and most modern style of workmanship, and to be entirely finished and fit for occupation on or before 15 December, 1844."</p>\n<p>"For the brick-work throughout, the best hard-burned red brick are to be employed, with sharp river sand and best lime.  For the flooring throughout, the best quality narrow North Carolina yellow heart pine, tongued, grooved, and secret nailed.  Roofs to be slated in the best manner.  Spouting to be thoroughly arranged, in the least conspicuous manner, so as to carry off all the water that falls on roofs of the main building, office, and back buildings.  Door and window frames and doors to be of perfectly seasoned material, warranted not to shrink."</p>\n<p>After a long detail, having reference rather to an enumeration than to the quality of the several things to be done in completing the house and offices, the agreement concludes in these words:</p>\n<p>"That the said William H. Van Buren is to pay to the said William Digges for the house built and finished as above specified, the sum of $4,600 in gold or silver current money of the Unites states, or its equivalent in banknotes, in the following manner, <em>viz.,</em> $1,000 on 1 September; $1000 on 1 October; $1,000 on 1 November; and $1,600 on the day that the house is entirely finished and fit to occupy, provided that it shall not be later than 25 December, 1844, he, the said William Digges, to forfeit ten percent on the whole amount if the said house is not entirely completed and fit to occupy at the time agreed upon, <em>viz.,</em> December 25, 1844."</p>\n<p>Subsequently, <em>viz.,</em> on 1 September, 1844, the above agreement was altered by the parties in the following particulars, <em>viz.,</em></p>\n<p>"that in place of the attic story with rooms, as specified in the above contract, William H. Digges is to build a third story, divided and finished in all respects like the second story,"</p>\n<p>and after reciting some directions with respect to divisions and arrangements in this third story, the new agreement provides for the</p>\n<p>"finishing of a garret to be floored, plastered, and divided as agreed upon, with the necessary stairways, in the best manner and with the same materials employed in the second story."</p>\n<p>For the work to be performed under this new agreement, when it should be completed, the plaintiff in error was to pay the additional sum of $525, but no stipulation appears therein </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 52 U. S. 474</a></p><p> as to the time within which this additional work was to be completed.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in error, the defendant below, pleaded the general issue <em>nonassumpsit,</em> filed a bill of particulars amounting to the sum of $707, for moneys paid, expenses incurred, and damage sustained, by reason of the nonperformance by the plaintiff of his agreement, and filed also with this bill of particulars a notice in writing in which the amount of that bill was claimed in diminution of the plaintiff\'s demand.  Upon the issue joined, the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of $1,223.21, with interest from 21 August, 1845, till payment, and for this sum, with the costs of suit, the court gave judgment against the defendant below.</p>\n<p>At the trial of this cause, there were nine separate prayers to the court, and nine bills of exceptions sealed to the rulings of the court upon the prayers thus presented to them.  Some of these exceptions it will be unnecessary particularly to discuss, as they are clearly embraced, if not within the terms, certainly within the meaning, of others which were taken.  We will therefore examine those exceptions only which are regarded as propounding in themselves some distinct and separate legal principle.</p>\n<p>The first exception by the defendant below, the plaintiff in error here, is as follows:</p>\n<p>"The plaintiff, in support of the issue joined upon the plea of <em>nonassumpsit,</em> produced and proved written contracts between the parties, as follows copied in pages  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/52/461/case.html">52 U. S. 461</a></span>-463, and further offered evidence tending to prove that he had executed the work therein stipulated for, and had delivered it to the defendant, who received it without objection.  And thereupon the defendant offered to prove by competent witnesses that before receiving said work and during the progress thereof, he had objected to the sufficiency of various parts of the same as a compliance with the contract, and had communicated said objections to the plaintiff, and that there were various omissions of work stipulated to be done, and various portions of the work contracted for were done in a defective and inferior manner, and not as well as contracted for by the plaintiff, and that some of these defects were not and could not be discovered by the defendant, until after the defendant had entered into the possession and use of the house, and the defendant offered to prove, by way of setoff, and having filed a bill of particulars of said alleged omissions and defects, and given due notice thereof to the plaintiff, and of his purpose in reduction of the contract price of the whole work sued for by the said plaintiff, the value of said omissions, and the difference in value between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 52 U. S. 475</a></p><p> the actual work defectively executed, and that contracted for; to which evidence so offered or any of it the plaintiff objected as inadmissible under the issue, and the court, on the objection so taken, refused to admit any of said evidence for said purpose."</p>\n<p>The decision of the circuit court rejecting the evidence described and tendered for the purposes set forth in this exception cannot be sustained upon any sound legal principle.</p>\n<p>We are aware of the rule laid down in the earlier English cases which prescribed that in all instances wherein a party shall have been injured either by a partial failure of consideration for the contract or by the nonfulfillment of the contract or by breach of warranty, the person so injured could not in an action against him upon the contract defend himself by alleging and proving these facts, but could obtain redress only by a cross-action against the party from whom the injury shall have proceeded.  This doctrine of the earlier cases has been essentially modified by later decisions and brought by them to the test of justice and convenience, which requires that whenever compensation or an equivalent is claimed by a party in return for the performance of conditions for which such compensation or equivalent has been stipulated, the person so claiming is bound to show a fulfillment in good faith of those conditions, and the party against whom the claim shall be made shall be permitted to repel it by proof of an entire failure to perform or of an imperfect or unfaithful performance, or by proof of injurious consequences resulting from either of these delinquencies, and shall not be driven exclusively to his cross-action.  Of this doctrine the following examples, amongst others to be found, may be adduced from the English courts.</p>\n<p>Per Parke, Justice, in the case of <em>Thornton v. Place,</em> 1 Moody &amp; Robinson 219, it is said:</p>\n<p>"When a party engages to do certain work on certain specified terms and in a specified manner, but in fact does not perform the work so as to correspond with the specification, he is not, of course, entitled to recover the price agreed upon in the specification; nor can he recover according to the actual value of the work, as if there had been no special contract.  What the plaintiff is entitled to recover is the price agreed upon, subject to a deduction, and the measure of that deduction is the sum which it would take to alter the work so as to make it correspond with the specification."</p>\n<p>In <em>Chapel v. Hicks,</em> 2 Carrington &amp; Marshman 214, it is said:</p>\n<p>"In an action on a special contract for work done under the contract and for work and materials generally, the defendant may give in evidence that the work has been done improperly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 52 U. S. 476</a></p><p> and not agreeably to the contract; in that case, the plaintiff will only be entitled to recover the real value of the work done and materials supplied."</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Cutler v. Close,</em> 5 Car. &amp; Payne 337, where a party had contracted to supply and erect a warm air apparatus for a certain sum, it was ruled, in an action for the price the defense to which was that the apparatus did not answer, that if the jury thought it was substantial in the main, though not quite so complete as it might be under the contract, and could be made good at a reasonable rate, the proper course would be to find a verdict for the plaintiff, deducting such sums as would enable the defendant to do what was requisite.  And Tindal, C.J., in his instructions to the jury, uses this language:</p>\n<p>"The plaintiffs say that they have performed their contract, and are entitled to be paid.  On the contrary, the defendant says that the apparatus is not at all of the sort he contracted for, and therefore he is not liable to pay for it.  The law on the subject, as it seems to me, lies in a narrow compass.  If the stove in question is altogether incompetent and unfit for the purpose, and either from that or from the situation in which it is placed, does not at all answer the end for which it was intended, then the defendant is not bound to pay.  If it is perfect, and the fault lies in management at the chapel, then the plaintiffs will be entitled to recover the whole price.  But there is another view of the case.  The apparatus may be in the main substantial, but not quite so complete as it might be according to the contract, and in that case if it can be made good at a reasonable expense, the proper course will be to give your verdict for the plaintiffs, deducting such sum as will enable the defendant to do that which is requisite to make it complete."</p>\n<p>But, as conclusive with this Court upon this point, it may be remarked that it was carefully considered at the last term in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/50/213/case.html">Withers v. Greene,</a></span></em> 9 How. 213; the decisions applicable thereto from the courts both in England and the United States were then collated and examined, and upon that examination the doctrine herein above propounded received the concurrence of all the judges.  Again expressing our approbation of this doctrine, we conclude that the proof tendered, as declared in the first exception of the defendant below, should have been admitted, and that the circuit court erred in ruling its exclusion from the jury.</p>\n<p>The second exception by the defendant states that in addition to the evidence previously tendered by him, he offered proof tending to show the peculiar adaptation of the house contracted for, both in its design and situation, to the defendant\'s personal and professional pursuits and convenience, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 52 U. S. 477</a></p><p> that the amount of ten percentum on the contract price stipulated to be forfeited if the house was not entirely finished and ready for occupation as therein provided on 25 December, 1844, was intended by the parties as and for liquidated damages that would result and fairly belong to the said defendant by reason of said failure to finish the said house on 25 December, 1844, and that the court refused to hear the evidence thus tendered.  In the refusal of the court to admit the evidence thus tendered, we think they decided correctly.  It would have been irregular in the court to go out of the terms of the contract and into the consideration of matters wholly extraneous, and with nothing upon the face of the writing pointing to such matters as proper or necessary to obtain its construction or meaning.  The clause of the contract providing for the forfeiture of ten percentum on the amount of the contract price upon a failure to complete the work by a given day cannot properly be regarded as an agreement or settlement of liquidated damages.  The term "forfeiture" imports a penalty; it has no necessary or natural connection with the measure or degree of injury which may result from a breach of contract or from an imperfect performance.  It implies an absolute infliction, regardless of the nature and extent of the causes by which it is superinduced.  Unless, therefore, it shall have been expressly adopted and declared by the parties to be a measure of injury or compensation, it is never taken as such by courts of justice, who leave it to be enforced where this can be done in its real character -- <em>viz.,</em> that of a penalty.  In a defense like that attempted by the defendant in the circuit court, upon the essential justice and fairness of the acts of the parties, a positive immutable penalty could hardly be applied as a fair test of their merits.</p>\n<p>In the third exception by the defendant it is stated that the plaintiff, having given evidence to show that the defendant, whilst the house in question was being built, made a contract for an alteration in the style and finish of the plastering of the house with a third person, and not with the plaintiff, and thereby the execution of the work on the said building was delayed beyond 25 December, 1844; the defendant offered evidence tending to prove that the said plastering and the style and finish thereof were usual and proper and necessary to the completion of the said house, and further offered to prove that, at the time of the execution of the said plastering, the defendant, in the presence of the plaintiff, insisted on and required him to execute the same as a part of his contract, and that he refused so to do, and that to the admissibility of this evidence, objection being made, it was excluded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 52 U. S. 478</a></p><p> from the jury by the court.  In this decision the court were certainly correct.  The defendant could have no right to insist upon the performance of plastering, or of any other description of work, unless it came within the provisions of the contract; the simple fact that the work demanded was suitable to the style of the defendant\'s house could give him no right to demand its execution unless the plaintiff had contracted for its performance.  It was incumbent, therefore, on the defendant to prove by legal evidence that the work demanded by him was within the provisions of the contract; but instead of doing this, he insisted upon showing merely that he, the defendant, had determined this work to be proper and within the provisions of the contract, and that the plaintiff\'s nonconcurrence in this determination, and consequent refusal to do what the defendant required, were to be received as proof of a failure on the part of the plaintiff to perform his contract and as forming a just ground with the defendant for his resistance to the action.  It would indeed have been strange if the court could have tolerated such an irregularity as this, by which the defendant would have been permitted to become a witness in his own behalf.</p>\n<p>The fourth and fifth exceptions on the part of the defendant below, relating merely to the admissibility of testimony to show a failure to perform or an incomplete performance on the part of the plaintiff, are embraced within the first exception already considered, and the rulings of the court as to these two last instances, being in contravention of our opinion as declared upon the first exception, are pronounced by this Court to be erroneous.</p>\n<p>In the sixth exception of the defendant, two subjects essentially distinct in character are blended.  As to the first, it is stated that the plaintiff, having further given evidence tending to show that, after the plastering of the house was begun, the defendant entered into a contract with the plasterer to make cornices and centerpieces for the parlors and passages; that a delay in the work for a week was occasioned by the negotiation leading to the said agreement, and a further delay of two weeks by the additional plastering, and part of the same being frozen insomuch that the plasterer could not finish the work until some days after 25 December, 1844, and much of the carpenters\' work and the painters\' was thereby postponed and delayed until after the said day, and the said defendant then gave evidence to show that the plaintiff knew of the said agreement for the said additional plastering, and did not object thereto.  And thereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury that if they shall find that any delay </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 52 U. S. 479</a></p><p> was caused in completing the work in consequence of the extra plastering in the parlors and passage, done under the distinct contract therefor given in evidence, and they shall further find that said extra plastering was so done with the full knowledge and sanction of the plaintiff, and without any understanding between him and the defendant at the time, that in consequence thereof a further time should be allowed for completing the building, then the plaintiff is not entitled to any further time for completing the building because of such work, and the delay attending the same.</p>\n<p>The second subject embraced in this exception is the forfeiture of ten percentum upon the contract price of the work, which the court was asked to declare was the amount of liquidated damages, the whole amount of which on the price of the work the defendant was authorized to claim for a failure to complete the work by 25 December, 1844, unless the jury should find that the failure to complete the work proceeded wholly from the acts or default of the defendant.  The refusal by the circuit court of both the instructions appearing upon this exception is entirely approved.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to conceive upon what ground the defendant could be permitted to interpose an obstruction to the fulfillment of the contract, and then to convert that very obstruction into a merit on his own part or into the foundation of a claim against the party whom he had already subjected to the inevitable consequences of the obstruction so interposed -- an inability to comply with his engagement, and a postponement of the fruits of a compliance therewith, if that had been permitted.  Mere acquiescence in this irregularity by the plaintiff should not subject him to further mischief.  With respect to the second subject embraced in this exception, <em>viz.,</em> the forfeiture of ten percentum claimed by the defendant, we deem it unnecessary to add to what has been already said on that subject.  We will here remark, once for all, with respect to this penalty that as it constitutes the only ground for the eighth and ninth exceptions taken by the defendant below, those exceptions must be regarded as expressly overruled.</p>\n<p>By the seventh exception of the defendant below, it appears that the court was asked to propound as the law that if from the evidence it should appear that the plaintiff contracted with the defendant in writing to build, complete, and deliver the said house to him on or before 25 December, 1844, and that the plaintiff failed to do so, and the jury should find that the time for said completion and delivery was not extended beyond the said 25 December, 1844, by the agreement of the said plaintiff and defendant or by the act of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 52 U. S. 480</a></p><p> defendant, then the plaintiff was not entitled to recover in this action, which instruction the court refused to give.</p>\n<p>The ruling of the court, as set forth in this exception, though not reconcilable with its own decision on the first prayer presented to it by the defendant, is in accordance with the opinion we have expressed in reference to the questions raised by that prayer and also with the doctrine ruled by this and in other tribunals upon those questions, as in treating of that first prayer we have already shown.  It places the parties upon the true ground of contestation between them -- <em>viz.,</em> the truth, the extent, and manner of performance on the one hand, the degree of injury, from omission, neglect, or imperfection of performance on the other.  The ruling of the circuit court therefore, upon this exception, is entirely approved, but as that court has erred in its decision in reference to the prayers in the first, fourth, and fifth exceptions of the defendant, its decision as to those prayers is hereby</p>\n<p><em>Reversed with costs, and this cause is remanded to the circuit court with orders for a venire facias for a new trial in conformity with the principles expressed in this opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the County of Washington, and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby reversed with costs, and that this cause be and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court with directions to award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
