It conducts most of its restaurant business through a franchise operation, under which franchisees are licensed to use appellant\'s trademarks and service marks in leased standardized restaurant facilities for a period of 20 years.  The governing contracts provide that the franchise relationship is established in Miami and governed by Florida law, and call for payment of all required monthly fees and forwarding of all relevant notices to the Miami headquarters.  The Miami headquarters sets policy and works directly with the franchisees in attempting to resolve major problems.  Day-to-day monitoring of franchisees, however, is conducted through district offices that, in turn, report to the Miami headquarters.  Appellee is a Michigan resident who, along with another Michigan resident, entered into a 20-year franchise contract with appellant to operate a restaurant in Michigan.  Subsequently, when the restaurant\'s patronage declined, the franchisees fell behind in their monthly payments.  After extended negotiations among the franchisees, the Michigan district office, and the Miami headquarters proved unsuccessful in solving the problem, headquarters terminated the franchise and ordered the franchisees to vacate the premises.  They refused, and continued to operate the restaurant.  Appellant then brought a diversity action in Federal District Court in Florida, alleging that the franchisees had breached their franchise obligations and requesting damages and injunctive relief.  The franchisees claimed that, because they were Michigan residents and because appellant\'s claim did not "arise" within Florida, the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.  But the court held that the franchisees were subject to personal jurisdiction pursuant to Florida\'s long-arm statute, which extends jurisdiction to any person, whether or not a citizen or resident of the State, who breaches a contract in the State by failing to perform acts that the contract requires to be performed there.

S. 464</a></p><p> arises from the alleged contractual breach.  Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.193 (1)(g) (Supp.1984).  The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, sitting in diversity, relied on this provision in exercising personal jurisdiction over a Michigan resident who allegedly had breached a franchise agreement with a Florida corporation by failing to make required payments in Florida.  The question presented is whether this exercise of long-arm jurisdiction offended "traditional conception[s] of fair play and substantial justice" embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/310/case.html">326 U. S. 310</a></span>, 320 (1945).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Burger King Corporation is a Florida corporation whose principal offices are in Miami.  It is one of the world\'s largest restaurant organizations, with over 3,000 outlets in the 50 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 8 foreign nations.  Burger King conducts approximately 80% of its business through a franchise operation that the company styles the "Burger King System" -- "a comprehensive restaurant format and operating system for the sale of uniform and quality food products."  App. 46. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Burger King licenses its franchisees to use its trademarks and service marks for a period of 20 years, and leases standardized restaurant facilities to them for the same term.  In addition, franchisees acquire a variety of proprietary information concerning the "standards, specifications, procedures and methods for operating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 471 U. S. 465</a></p><p> a Burger King Restaurant."  <em>Id.</em> at 52.  They also receive market research and advertising assistance; ongoing training in restaurant management; [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and accounting, cost-control, and inventory-control guidance.  By permitting franchisees to tap into Burger King\'s established national reputation and to benefit from proven procedures for dispensing standardized fare, this system enables them to go into the restaurant business with significantly lowered barriers to entry. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In exchange for these benefits, franchisees pay Burger King an initial $40,000 franchise fee and commit themselves to payment of monthly royalties, advertising and sales promotion fees, and rent computed in part from monthly gross sales.  Franchisees also agree to submit to the national organization\'s exacting regulation of virtually every conceivable aspect of their operations. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Burger King imposes these standards and undertakes its rigid regulation out of conviction that</p>\n<p>"[u]niformity of service, appearance, and quality of product is essential to the preservation of the Burger King image and the benefits accruing therefrom to both Franchisee and Franchisor."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 31.</p>\n<p>Burger King oversees its franchise system through a two-tiered administrative structure.  The governing contracts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 471 U. S. 466</a></p><p> provide that the franchise relationship is established in Miami and governed by Florida law, and call for payment of all required fees and forwarding of all relevant notices to the Miami headquarters. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Miami headquarters sets policy and works directly with its franchisees in attempting to resolve major problems.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a> <a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a> <em>infra.</em>  Day-to-day monitoring of franchisees, however, is conducted through a network of 10 district offices which, in turn, report to the Miami headquarters.</p>\n<p>The instant litigation grows out of Burger King\'s termination of one of its franchisees, and is aptly described by the franchisee as "a divorce proceeding among commercial partners."  5 Record 4.  The appellee John Rudzewicz, a Michigan citizen and resident, is the senior partner in a Detroit accounting firm.  In 1978, he was approached by Brian MacShara, the son of a business acquaintance, who suggested that they jointly apply to Burger King for a franchise in the Detroit area.  MacShara proposed to serve as the manager of the restaurant if Rudzewicz would put up the investment capital; in exchange, the two would evenly share the profits.  Believing that MacShara\'s idea offered attractive investment and tax-deferral opportunities, Rudzewicz agreed to the venture.  6 <em>id.</em> at 438-439, 444, 460.</p>\n<p>Rudzewicz and MacShara jointly applied for a franchise to Burger King\'s Birmingham, Michigan, district office in the autumn of 1978.  Their application was forwarded to Burger King\'s Miami headquarters, which entered into a preliminary agreement with them in February, 1979.  During the ensuing four months, it was agreed that Rudzewicz and MacShara would assume operation of an existing facility in Drayton Plains, Michigan.  MacShara attended the prescribed management courses in Miami during this period, <em>see</em> n.  <a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a> <em>supra,</em> and the franchisees purchased $165,000 worth of restaurant equipment from Burger King\'s Davmor Industries division in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 471 U. S. 467</a></p><p> Miami.  Even before the final agreements were signed, however, the parties began to disagree over site-development fees, building design, computation of monthly rent, and whether the franchisees would be able to assign their liabilities to a corporation they had formed. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  During these disputes, Rudzewicz and MacShara negotiated both with the Birmingham district office and with the Miami headquarters. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  With some misgivings, Rudzewicz and MacShara finally obtained limited concessions from the Miami headquarters, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] signed the final agreements, and commenced operations in June, 1979.  By signing the final agreements, Rudzewicz obligated himself personally to payments exceeding $1 million over the 20-year franchise relationship. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 471 U. S. 468</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Drayton Plains facility apparently enjoyed steady business during the summer of 1979, but patronage declined after a recession began later that year.  Rudzewicz and MacShara soon fell far behind in their monthly payments to Miami.  Headquarters sent notices of default, and an extended period of negotiations began among the franchisees, the Birmingham district office, and the Miami headquarters.  After several Burger King officials in Miami had engaged in prolonged but ultimately unsuccessful negotiations with the franchisees by mail and by telephone, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] headquarters terminated the franchise and ordered Rudzewicz and MacShara to vacate the premises.  They refused, and continued to occupy and operate the facility as a Burger King restaurant.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Burger King commenced the instant action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in May, 1981, invoking that court\'s diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1332(a) and its original jurisdiction over federal trademark disputes pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1338(a). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Burger King alleged that Rudzewicz and MacShara had breached their franchise obligations "within [the jurisdiction of] this district court" by failing to make the required payments "at plaintiff\'s place of business in Miami, Dade County, Florida," \xef\xbf\xbd 6, App. 121, and also charged that they were tortiously infringing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 471 U. S. 469</a></p><p> its trademarks and service marks through their continued, unauthorized operation as a Burger King restaurant, \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 35-53, App. 130-135.  Burger King sought damages, injunctive relief, and costs and attorney\'s fees.  Rudzewicz and MacShara entered special appearances and argued, <em>inter alia,</em> that, because they were Michigan residents, and because Burger King\'s claim did not "arise" within the Southern District of Florida, the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.  The District Court denied their motions after a hearing, holding that, pursuant to Florida\'s long-arm statute,</p>\n<p>"a nonresident Burger King franchisee is subject to the personal jurisdiction of this Court in actions arising out of its franchise agreements."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 138.  Rudzewicz and MacShara then filed an answer and a counterclaim seeking damages for alleged violations by Burger King of Michigan\'s Franchise Investment Law, Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 445.1501 <em>et seq.</em> (1979).</p>\n<p>After a 3-day bench trial, the court again concluded that it had "jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties to this cause."  App. 159.  Finding that Rudzewicz and MacShara had breached their franchise agreements with Burger King and had infringed Burger King\'s trademarks and service marks, the court entered judgment against them, jointly and severally, for $228,875 in contract damages.  The court also ordered them "to immediately close Burger King Restaurant Number 775 from continued operation or to immediately give the keys and possession of said restaurant to Burger King Corporation," <em>id.</em> at 163, found that they had failed to prove any of the required elements of their counterclaim, and awarded costs and attorney\'s fees to Burger King.</p>\n<p>Rudzewicz appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  A divided panel of that Circuit reversed the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 471 U. S. 470</a></p><p> judgment, concluding that the District Court could not properly exercise personal jurisdiction over Rudzewicz pursuant to Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.193(1)(g) (Supp.1984) because</p>\n<p>"the circumstances of the Drayton Plains franchise and the negotiations which led to it left Rudzewicz bereft of reasonable notice and financially unprepared for the prospect of franchise litigation in Florida."</p>\n<p><em>Burger King Corp. v. MacShara,</em> 724 F.2d 1505, 1513 (1984).  Accordingly, the panel majority concluded that "[j]urisdiction under these circumstances would offend the fundamental fairness which is the touchstone of due process."  <em>Ibid.</em> .</p>\n<p>Burger King appealed the Eleventh Circuit\'s judgment to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(2), and we postponed probable jurisdiction.  469 U.S. 814 (1984).  Because it is unclear whether the Eleventh Circuit actually held that Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.193(1)(g) (Supp.1984) <em>itself</em> is unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that jurisdiction by appeal does not properly lie, and therefore dismiss the appeal.

On the other hand, where a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.  Most such considerations usually may be accommodated through means short of finding jurisdiction unconstitutional.  For example, the potential clash of the forum\'s law with the "fundamental substantive social policies" of another State may be accommodated through application of the forum\'s choice-of-law rules. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Similarly, a defendant claiming substantial inconvenience may seek a change of venue. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Nevertheless, minimum requirements inherent in the concept of "fair play and substantial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 471 U.

As we previously have noted, jurisdictional rules may not be employed in such a way as to make litigation "so gravely difficult and inconvenient" that a party unfairly is at a "severe disadvantage" in comparison to his opponent.  <em>The Bremen v.

At the outset, we note a continued division among lower courts respecting whether and to what extent a contract can constitute a "contact" for purposes of due process analysis. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  If the question is whether an individual\'s contract with an out-of-state party alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party\'s home forum, we believe the answer clearly is that it cannot.  The Court long ago rejected the notion that personal jurisdiction might turn on "mechanical" tests, <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/310/case.html#319">326 U.

S. 479</a></p><p> 318 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/313/case.html#316">318 U. S. 316</a></span>.  Instead, we have emphasized the need for a "highly realistic" approach that recognizes that a "contract" is</p>\n<p>"ordinarily but an intermediate step serving to tie up prior business negotiations with future consequences which themselves are the real object of the business transaction."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/313/case.html#316">318 U. S. 316</a></span>-317.  It is these factors -- prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences, along with the terms of the contract and the parties\' actual course of dealing -- that must be evaluated in determining whether the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum.</p>\n<p>In this case, no physical ties to Florida can be attributed to Rudzewicz other than MacShara\'s brief training course in Miami. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Rudzewicz did not maintain offices in Florida and, for all that appears from the record, has never even visited there.  Yet this franchise dispute grew directly out of "a contract which had a <em>substantial</em> connection with that State."  <em>McGee v. International Life Insurance Co.,</em> 355 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/220/case.html#223">355 U. S. 223</a></span> (emphasis added).  Eschewing the option of operating an independent local enterprise, Rudzewicz deliberately "reach[ed] out beyond" Michigan and negotiated with a Florida corporation for the purchase of a long-term franchise and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 471 U. S. 480</a></p><p> the manifold benefits that would derive from affiliation with a nationwide organization.  <em>Travelers Health Assn. v. Virginia,</em> 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/643/case.html#647">339 U. S. 647</a></span>.  Upon approval, he entered into a carefully structured 20-year relationship that envisioned continuing and wide-reaching contacts with Burger King in Florida.  In light of Rudzewicz\' voluntary acceptance of the long-term and exacting regulation of his business from Burger King\'s Miami headquarters, the "quality and nature" of his relationship to the company in Florida can in no sense be viewed as "random," "fortuitous," or "attenuated."  <em>Hanson v. Denckla,</em> 357 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">357 U. S. 253</span>; <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,</em> 465 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/770/case.html#774">465 U. S. 774</a></span>; <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

Rudzewicz\' refusal to make the contractually required payments in Miami, and his continued use of Burger King\'s trademarks and confidential business information after his termination, caused foreseeable injuries to the corporation in Florida.  For these reasons it was, at the very least, presumptively reasonable for Rudzewicz to be called to account there for such injuries.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that, in light of the supervision emanating from Burger King\'s district office in Birmingham, Rudzewicz reasonably believed that "the Michigan office was, for all intents and purposes, the embodiment of Burger King," and that he therefore had no "reason to anticipate a Burger King suit outside of Michigan."  724 F.2d at 1511.  <em>See also post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/case.html#488">471 U. S. 488</a></span>-489 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  This reasoning overlooks substantial record evidence indicating that Rudzewicz most certainly knew that he was affiliating himself with an enterprise based primarily in Florida.  The contract documents themselves emphasize that Burger King\'s operations are conducted and supervised from the Miami headquarters, that all relevant notices and payments must be sent there, and that the agreements were made in and enforced from Miami.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  Moreover, the parties\' actual course of dealing repeatedly confirmed that decisionmaking authority was vested in the Miami headquarters, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 471 U. S. 481</a></p><p> and that the district office served largely as an intermediate link between the headquarters and the franchisees.  When problems arose over building design, site-development fees, rent computation, and the defaulted payments, Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that the Michigan office was powerless to resolve their disputes, and could only channel their communications to Miami.  Throughout these disputes, the Miami headquarters and the Michigan franchisees carried on a continuous course of direct communications by mail and by telephone, and it was the Miami headquarters that made the key negotiating decisions out of which the instant litigation arose.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a> <a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a> <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Moreover, we believe the Court of Appeals gave insufficient weight to provisions in the various franchise documents providing that all disputes would be governed by Florida law.  The franchise agreement, for example, stated:</p>\n<p>"This Agreement shall become valid when executed and accepted by BKC at Miami, Florida; it shall be deemed made and entered into in the State of Florida and shall be governed and construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.  The choice of law designation does not require that all suits concerning this Agreement be filed in Florida."</p>\n<p>App. 72.  <em>See also</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  The Court of Appeals reasoned that choice-of-law provisions are irrelevant to the question of personal jurisdiction, relying on <em>Hanson v. Denckla</em> for the proposition that "the center of gravity for choice-of-law purposes does not necessarily confer the sovereign prerogative to assert jurisdiction."  724 F.2d at 1511-1512, n. 10, citing 357 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/235/case.html#254">357 U. S. 254</a></span>.  This reasoning misperceives the import of the quoted proposition.  The Court in <em>Hanson</em> and subsequent cases has emphasized that choice-of-law <em>analysis</em> -- which focuses on all elements of a transaction, and not simply on the defendant\'s conduct -- is distinct from minimum-contacts jurisdictional analysis -- which focuses at the threshold </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 471 U. S. 482</a></p><p> solely on the defendant\'s purposeful connection to the forum. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Nothing in our cases, however, suggests that a choice-of-law <em>provision</em> should be ignored in considering whether a defendant has "purposefully invoked the benefits and protections of a State\'s laws" for jurisdictional purposes.  Although such a provision, standing alone, would be insufficient to confer jurisdiction, we believe that, when combined with the 20-year interdependent relationship Rudzewicz established with Burger King\'s Miami headquarters, it reinforced his deliberate affiliation with the forum State and the reasonable foreseeability of possible litigation there.  As Judge Johnson argued in his dissent below, Rudzewicz "purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protections of Florida\'s laws" by entering into contracts expressly providing that those laws would govern franchise disputes.  724 F.2d at 1513. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>Nor has Rudzewicz pointed to other factors that can be said persuasively to outweigh the considerations discussed above, and to establish the <em>unconstitutionality</em> of Florida\'s assertion of jurisdiction.  We cannot conclude that Florida had no "legitimate interest in holding [Rudzewicz] answerable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 471 U. S. 483</a></p><p> on a claim related to" the contacts he had established in that State.  <em>Keeton v.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Moreover, although Rudzewicz has argued at some length that Michigan\'s Franchise Investment Law, Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 445.1501 <em>et seq.</em> (1979), governs many aspects of this franchise relationship, he has not demonstrated how Michigan\'s acknowledged interest might possibly render jurisdiction in Florida <em>unconstitutional.</em> [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Finally, the Court of Appeals\' assertion that the Florida litigation "severely impaired [Rudzewicz\'] ability to call Michigan witnesses who might be essential to his defense and counterclaim," 724 F.2d at 1512-1513, is wholly without support in the record. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  And even to the extent that it is inconvenient </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 471 U.

S. 223</a></span>, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also concluded, however, that the parties\' dealings involved "a characteristic disparity of bargaining power" and "elements of surprise," and that Rudzewicz "lacked fair notice" of the potential for litigation in Florida because the contractual provisions suggesting to the contrary were merely "boilerplate declarations in a lengthy printed contract."  724 F.2d at 1511-1512, and n. 10.  <em>See also post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/case.html#489">471 U. S. 489</a></span>-490 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  Rudzewicz presented many of these arguments to the District Court, contending that Burger King was guilty of misrepresentation, fraud, and duress; that it gave insufficient notice in its dealings with him; and that the contract was one of adhesion.  <em>See</em> 4 Record 687-691.  After a 3-day bench trial, the District Court found that Burger King had made no misrepresentations, that Rudzewicz and MacShara "were and are experienced and sophisticated businessmen," and that "at no time" did they "ac[t] under economic duress or disadvantage imposed by" Burger King.  App. 157-158.  <em>See also</em> 7 Record 648-649.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) requires that "[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous," and neither Rudzewicz nor the Court of Appeals has pointed to record evidence that would support a "definite and firm conviction" that the District Court\'s findings are mistaken.  <em>United States v.

To the contrary, Rudzewicz was represented by counsel throughout these complex transactions and, as Judge Johnson observed in dissent below, was himself an experienced accountant</p>\n<p>"who for five months conducted negotiations with Burger King over the terms of the franchise and lease agreements, and who obligated himself personally to contracts requiring over time payments that exceeded $1 million."</p>\n<p>724 F.2d at 1514.

Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(2) is properly invoked only where a court of appeals <em>squarely</em> has "held" that a state statute is unconstitutional on its face or as applied; jurisdiction does not lie if the decision might rest on other grounds.  <em>Public Service Comm\'n v.

S. 42</a></span>, n. 1 (1970) (per curiam), we believe that an appeal cannot lie where a court of appeals\' judgment rests solely on the stipulated applicability of state law.  Rather, it must be reasonably clear that the court independently concluded that the challenged statute governs the case, and held the statute itself unconstitutional as so applied.  The Court of Appeals did neither in this case, concluding simply that "[j]urisdiction under these circumstances would offend the fundamental fairness which is the touchstone of due process."  724 F.2d at 1513.</p>\n<p>Of course, if it were clear under Florida law that \xc2\xa7 48.193(1)(g) governed every transaction falling within its literal terms, there could be no objection to a stipulation that merely recognized this established construction.  But the Florida Supreme Court has not ruled on the breadth of \xc2\xa7 48.193 (1)(g), and several state appellate courts have held that the provision extends only to the limits of the Due Process Clause.  <em>See, e.g., Scordilis v. Drobnicki,</em> 443 So.2d 411, 412-414 (Fla.App.1984); <em>Lakewood Pipe of Texas, Inc. v.

If \xc2\xa7 48.193(1)(g) is construed and applied in accordance with due process limitations as a matter of state law, then an appeal is improper, because the statute cannot be "invalid as repugnant to the Constitution . . . of the United States," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(2), since its boundaries are defined by, rather than being in excess of, the Due Process Clause.  <em>See, e.g., Calder v.

To the contrary, the court found that Burger King had fully complied with Michigan law, App. 159, and there is nothing in Michigan\'s franchise Act suggesting that Michigan would attempt to assert exclusive jurisdiction to resolve franchise disputes affecting its residents.  In any event, minimum-contacts analysis presupposes that two or more States may be interested in the outcome of a dispute, and the process of resolving potentially conflicting "fundamental substantive social policies," <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

Brown, Franchising Realities and Remedies 4-5 (2d ed.1978).

It is undisputed that appellee maintained no place of business in Florida, that he had no employees in that State, and that he was not licensed to do business there.  Appellee did not prepare his French fries, shakes, and hamburgers in Michigan, and then deliver them into the stream of commerce "with the expectation that they [would] be purchased by consumers in" Florida.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/case.html#473">471 U. S. 473</a></span>.  To the contrary, appellee did business only in Michigan, his business, property, and payroll taxes were payable in that State, and he sold all of his products there.</p>\n<p>Throughout the business relationship, appellee\'s principal contacts with appellant were with its Michigan office.  Notwithstanding its disclaimer, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/case.html#478">471 U. S. 478</a></span>, the Court seems ultimately to rely on nothing more than standard boilerplate language contained in various documents, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/case.html#481">471 U. S. 481</a></span>, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 471 U. S. 488</a></p><p> to establish that appellee "<em>purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protections of Florida\'s laws.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/462/case.html#482">471 U. S. 482</a></span>.  Such superficial analysis creates a potential for unfairness not only in negotiations between franchisors and their franchisees but, more significantly, in the resolution of the disputes that inevitably arise from time to time in such relationships.\n</em></p>\n<p>Judge Vance\'s opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adequately explains why I would affirm the judgment of that court.  I particularly find the following more persuasive than what this Court has written today:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in the course of negotiations gave Rudzewicz reason to anticipate a Burger King suit outside of Michigan.  The only face-to-face or even oral contact Rudzewicz had with Burger King throughout months of protracted negotiations was with representatives of the Michigan office.  Burger King had the Michigan office interview Rudzewicz and MacShara, appraise their application, discuss price terms, recommend the site which the defendants finally agreed to, and attend the final closing ceremony.  There is no evidence that Rudzewicz ever negotiated with anyone in Miami or even sent mail there during negotiations.  He maintained no staff in the state of Florida, and as far as the record reveals, he has never even visited the state."</p>\n<p>"The contracts contemplated the startup of a local Michigan restaurant whose profits would derive solely from food sales made to customers in Drayton Plains.  The sale, which involved the use of an intangible trademark in Michigan and occupancy of a Burger King facility there, required no performance in the state of Florida.  Under the contract, the local Michigan district office was responsible for providing all of the services due Rudzewicz, including advertising and management consultation.  Supervision, moreover, emanated from that office alone.  To Rudzewicz, the Michigan office was for all intents and purposes the embodiment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 471 U. S. 489</a></p><p> of Burger King.  He had reason to believe that his working relationship with Burger King began and ended in Michigan, not at the distant and anonymous Florida headquarters. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Given that the office in Rudzewicz\' home state conducted all of the negotiations and wholly supervised the contract, we believe that he had reason to assume that the state of the supervisory office would be the same state in which Burger King would file suit.  Rudzewicz lacked fair notice that the distant corporate headquarters which insulated itself from direct dealings with him would later seek to assert jurisdiction over him in the courts of its own home state. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Just as Rudzewicz lacked notice of the possibility of suit in Florida, he was financially unprepared to meet its added costs.  The franchise relationship in particular is fraught with potential for financial surprise.  The device of the franchise gives local retailers the access to national trademark recognition which enables them to compete with better-financed, more efficient chain stores.  This national affiliation, however, does not alter the fact that the typical franchise store is a local concern serving at best a neighborhood or community.  Neither the revenues of a local business nor the geographical range of its market prepares the average franchise owner for the cost of distant litigation. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The particular distribution of bargaining power in the franchise relationship further impairs the franchisee\'s financial preparedness.  In a franchise contract, \'the franchisor normally occupies [the] dominant role.\' . . ."</p>\n<p>"We discern a characteristic disparity of bargaining power in the facts of this case.  There is no indication that Rudzewicz had any latitude to negotiate a reduced rent or franchise fee in exchange for the added risk of suit in Florida.  He signed a standard form contract whose terms were nonnegotiable and which appeared </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 471 U. S. 490</a></p><p> in some respects to vary from the more favorable terms agreed to in earlier discussions.  In fact, the final contract required a minimum monthly rent computed on a base far in excess of that discussed in oral negotiations.  Burger King resisted price concessions, only to sue Rudzewicz far from home.  In doing so, it severely impaired his ability to call Michigan witnesses who might be essential to his defense and counterclaim."</p>\n<p>"In sum, we hold that the circumstances of the Drayton Plains franchise and the negotiations which led to it left Rudzewicz bereft of reasonable notice and financially unprepared for the prospect of franchise litigation in Florida.  Jurisdiction under these circumstances would offend the fundamental fairness which is the touchstone of due process."</p>\n<p>724 F.2d 1505, 1511-1513 (1984) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
