If in any such case a title so claimed to be perfect shall be established and confirmed, such confirmation shall be for so much land only as such perfect title shall be found to cover, always excepting any part of such land that shall have been disposed of by the United States, and always subject to and not to affect any conflicting private interests, rights, or claims held or claimed adversely to any such claim or title, or adversely to the holder of any such claim or title.  And no confirmation of claims or titles in this section mentioned shall have any effect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 184 U. S. 659</a></p><p> other or further than as a release of all claim of title by the United States, and no private right of any person as between himself and other claimants or persons, in respect of any such lands, shall be in any manner affected thereby."</p>\n<p>But all the powers so conferred upon the Court of Private Land Claims are subject to and controlled by section 13, which enacts that</p>\n<p>"all the foregoing proceedings and rights shall be conducted and decided subject to the following provisions, as well as to the other provisions of this act, namely. . . ."</p>\n<p>Then follow several provisions, the fourth of which is:  "No claim shall be allowed for any land, the right to which has hitherto been lawfully acted upon and decided by Congress, or under its authority."</p>\n<p>The language of this provision appears to us too clear to be misunderstood or evaded.  The manifest intent of Congress appears to have been that with any land, of the right to which Congress, in the exercise of its lawful discretion, had itself assumed the decision, the Court of Private Land Claims should have nothing to do.  The whole jurisdiction conferred upon that court is to confirm or reject claims presented to it, coming within the act.  All the powers conferred upon it are incident to the exercise of that jurisdiction.  When it has no jurisdiction to confirm or reject, it has no authority to inquire into or pass upon the case beyond the decision of the question of jurisdiction.  The peremptory declaration of Congress that "no claim shall be allowed for any land, the right to which has hitherto been lawfully acted upon and decided by Congress" necessarily prohibits the court from passing upon the merits of any such claim.</p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Conway,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/175/60/case.html">175 U. S. 60</a></span>, it was accordingly declared by this Court that the Court of Private Land Claims had no authority to confirm such a claim, and it necessarily follows that it has no authority to express any opinion upon the merits of it when the right to all the land claimed has already been decided by Congress.  <em>Las Animas Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/179/201/case.html">179 U. S. 201</a></span>.  Confusion, rather than certainty, would result from allowing the expression of an opinion to stand, which could not be made the basis of any effectual judgment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="660">Page 184 U. S. 660</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Private Land Claims having discovered that, by the express prohibition of Congress, it was without jurisdiction to decree and confirm the land to the petitioner, the merits of the case cannot be decided, either by that court or by this Court on appeal, and the decree below, which undertook to pass upon the merits, must therefore be reversed, and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction, without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to assert his title in any court of competent authority.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/56/36/case.html">United States v.
