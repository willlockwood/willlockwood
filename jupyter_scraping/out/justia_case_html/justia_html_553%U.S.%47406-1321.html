POTTER, POSTMASTER GENERAL</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931321.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 19, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 27, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner, a 45-year-old postal worker, filed suit claiming that her employer had violated the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(a)\xe2\x80\x94which requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees \xe2\x80\xa6 at least 40 years of age \xe2\x80\xa6 be made free from any discrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by subjecting her to various forms of retaliation after she filed an administrative ADEA complaint.  The District Court granted respondent summary judgment.  The First Circuit affirmed on the ground that \xc2\xa7633a(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d does not cover retaliation.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 633a(a) prohibits retaliation against a federal employee who complains of age discrimination.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In so concluding, the Court follows the reasoning of two prior decisions ruling that retaliation is covered by similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes.  First, in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a>, 237, the Court held that a retaliation claim could be brought under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 shall have the same right \xe2\x80\xa6 as is enjoyed by white citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\xe2\x80\x9d  While \xc2\xa71982 does not use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on race,\xe2\x80\x9d that is its plain meaning.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a>, 177.  Second, the <em>Jackson </em>Court, <em>id.,</em> at 173\xe2\x80\x93174, relied on <em>Sullivan </em>in holding that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681(a), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d in educational programs receiving federal aid, reached retaliation against a public school teacher for complaining about sex discrimination in his school\xe2\x80\x99s athletic program.  544 U. S., at 176\xe2\x80\x93177.  The ADEA language at issue (\xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d) is not materially different from the language at issue in <em>Jackson</em> and is the functional equivalent of the language at issue in <em>Sullivan</em>, see <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 177.  And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases: remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.  Respondent neither asks the Court to overrule <em>Sullivan</em> or <em>Jackson </em>nor questions those decisions\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, and the Government, both in <em>Jackson</em> and in <em>CBOCS West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Humphries</em>, <em>ante,</em> p. ___, has specifically urged the Court to follow <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The three grounds on which the First Circuit sought to distinguish <em>Jackson</em> in support of the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s perception that there is a clear difference between causes of action for discrimination and for retaliation are not persuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Circuit places too much reliance on the fact that the ADEA expressly creates a private right of action, whereas the right of action under Title IX, the statute at issue in <em>Jackson</em>, is implied and not express, see <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a>.  The assertion that this distinction allowed the <em>Jackson</em> Court greater leeway to adopt an expansive interpretation of Title IX improperly conflates the analytically distinct questions whether a statute confers a private right of action and whether the statute\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibition reaches a particular form of conduct.  Moreover, confusing these questions would lead to exceedingly strange results.  For example, Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d either does or does not reach retaliation, and the presence or absence of another statutory provision expressly creating a private right of action cannot alter \xc2\xa71681(a)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Also unavailing is the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to distinguish <em>Jackson</em> on the ground that retaliation claims play a more important role under Title IX than under the ADEA.  This argument ignores the basis for <em>Jackson</em>, which did not hold that Title IX prohibits retaliation because such claims are important as a policy matter, but, instead, relied on an interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9ctext of Title IX.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 173, 178.  <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9cteachers \xe2\x80\xa6 are often in the best position to vindicate [student] rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 181, did not address the question whether the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses retaliation, but was made in response to the school board\xe2\x80\x99s argument that only a \xe2\x80\x9cvictim of the discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d not third parties, should be allowed to assert a retaliation claim,<em> id.</em>, at 179\xe2\x80\x93182.  P.\xc2\xa08. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Finally, the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to distinguish <em>Jackson</em> on the ground that Title IX was adopted in response to <em>Sullivan</em>, whereas there is no evidence in the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history that \xc2\xa7633a was adopted in a similar context, is rejected.  <em>Jackson </em>did not identify any legislative history evidence, but merely observed that because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted Title IX just three years after <em>Sullivan,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> it was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with <em>[Sullivan]</em> and \xe2\x80\xa6 expected [Title IX] to be interpreted in conformity with [it].\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 176.  What <em>Jackson</em> said about the relationship between <em>Sullivan</em> and Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s enactment can also be said about the relationship between <em>Sullivan</em> and \xc2\xa7633a\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, since the latter provision was enacted just five years after <em>Sullivan</em> was decided and two years after Title IX was enacted.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments supporting the contention that \xc2\xa7633a(a) does not encompass retaliation claims are rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Respondent places too much reliance on the presence of an ADEA provision specifically prohibiting retaliation against individuals complaining about private-sector age discrimination, \xc2\xa7623(d), and the absence of a similar provision in \xc2\xa7633a.  Because \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623 and 633a were enacted seven years apart rather than simultaneously, see <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 330, and because they are couched in very different terms\xe2\x80\x94with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) listing specific forbidden employer practices in contrast to \xc2\xa7633a(a)\xe2\x80\x99s broad prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the absence of a federal-sector provision similar to \xc2\xa7623(d) does not provide a sufficient reason to depart from <em>Sullivan</em> and <em>Jackson</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0There is even less merit in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xc2\xa7633a(f), which provides that personnel actions by a federal entity covered by \xc2\xa7633a \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d other than \xc2\xa7633a and \xc2\xa7631(b), which restricts ADEA coverage to persons at least 40 years old.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that recognizing federal-sector retaliation claims would make \xc2\xa7623(d) applicable to federal-sector employers in contravention of \xc2\xa7633a(f) is unsound because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today is not based on \xc2\xa7623(d) but on \xc2\xa7633a(a) itself, \xe2\x80\x9cunaffected by other [ADEA] sections,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lehman</em> v. <em>Nakshian</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/index.html">453 U. S. 156</a>, 168.  P.\xc2\xa013. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Also unavailing is respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the history of congressional and Executive Branch responses to discrimination in federal employment demonstrates that when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7633a, it anticipated that the pre-existing reprisal regulations of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) would be extended to cover federal-sector age discrimination and be the exclusive avenue for asserting retaliation claims.  This argument is not supported by direct evidence, but rests on unsupported speculation, and, in any event, is self-contradictory in that, if \xc2\xa7633a(a) does not confer an antiretaliation right, there is no reason to assume that Congress expected the CSC to issue new regulations prohibiting retaliation.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s final argument\xe2\x80\x94that sovereign immunity principles require that \xc2\xa7633a(a) be read narrowly as prohibiting substantive age discrimination but not retaliation\xe2\x80\x94is unpersuasive.  The rule of construction requiring that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] waiver of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\xa6 be unequivocally expressed in statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly construed \xe2\x80\xa6 in favor of the sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lane</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/187/index.html">518 U. S. 187</a>, 192, is satisfied here by \xc2\xa7633a(c), which unequivocally waives sovereign immunity for a claim brought by \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d by a \xc2\xa7633a violation.  Unlike \xc2\xa7663a(c), \xc2\xa7633a(a) is not a waiver of sovereign immunity; it is a substantive provision outlawing \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  That the \xc2\xa7633a(c) waiver applies to \xc2\xa7633a(a) claims does not mean that \xc2\xa7633a(a) must surmount the same high hurdle as \xc2\xa7633a(c).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  We hold that such a claim is authorized.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Myrna G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez was a window distribution clerk for the United States Postal Service.  In October 2002, petitioner, then 45 years of age, was working full time at the Post Office in Dorado, Puerto Rico.  She requested a transfer to the Post Office in Moca, Puerto Rico, in order to be closer to her mother, who was ill.  The transfer was approved, and in November 2002, petitioner began working at the Moca Post Office in a part-time position.  Later that month, petitioner requested a transfer back to her old job at the Dorado Post Office, but her supervisor converted the Dorado position to part-time, filled it with another employee, and denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After first filing an unsuccessful union grievance seeking a transfer back to her old job, petitioner filed a Postal Service equal employment opportunity age discrimination complaint.   According to petitioner, she was then subjected to various forms of retaliation.  Specifically, petitioner alleges that her supervisor called her into meetings during which groundless complaints were leveled at her, that her name was written on antisexual harassment posters, that she was falsely accused of sexual harassment, that her co-workers told her to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98go back\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to where she \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98belong[ed],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that her work hours were drastically reduced.  476 F.\xc2\xa03d 54, 56 (CA1 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner responded by filing this action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, claiming, among other things, that respondent had violated the federal-sector provision of the ADEA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V), by retaliating against her for filing her equal employment opportunity age discrimination complaint.  Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing that the United States has not waived sovereign immunity for ADEA retaliation claims and that the ADEA federal-sector provision does not reach retaliation.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on the basis of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(1), unequivocally waived the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity, see 476 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 54, 57, but the Court affirmed the decision of the District Court on the alternative ground that the federal-sector provision\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V), does not cover retaliation, <em>id.</em>, at 60, creating a split among the Courts of Appeals.  Compare <em>Forman</em> v. <em>Small</em>, 271 F.\xc2\xa03d 285, 296 (CADC 2001) (ADEA federal-sector provision covers retaliation).  We granted certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal-sector provision of the ADEA provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age . . . shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  The key question in this case is whether the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d includes retaliation based on the filing of an age discrimination complaint.  We hold that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by our prior decisions interpreting similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes.  In <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a> (1969), we considered whether a claim of retaliation could be brought under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71978, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right \xe2\x80\xa6 as is enjoyed by white citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\xe2\x80\x9d  While \xc2\xa71982 does not use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on race,\xe2\x80\x9d that is its plain meaning.  See <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Lane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/509/index.html">541 U. S. 509</a>, 561 (2004) (Scalia,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (describing \xc2\xa71982 as \xe2\x80\x9cbanning public or private racial discrimination in the sale and rental of property\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/index.html">392 U. S. 409</a> (1968).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Sullivan</em>, a white man (Sullivan) held membership shares in a nonstock corporation that operated a park and playground for residents of the area in which he owned a home.  Under the bylaws of the corporation, a member who leased a home in the area could assign a membership share in the corporation.  But when Sullivan rented his house and attempted to assign a membership share to an African-American (Freeman), the corporation disallowed the assignment because of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s race and subsequently expelled Sullivan from the corporation for protesting that decision.  Sullivan sued the corporation, and we held that his claim that he had been expelled \xe2\x80\x9cfor the advocacy of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s cause\xe2\x80\x9d was cognizable under \xc2\xa71982.  396 U. S., at 237.  A contrary holding, we reasoned, would have allowed Sullivan to be \xe2\x80\x9cpunished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities\xe2\x80\x9d and would have given \xe2\x80\x9cimpetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More recently, in <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a> (2005), we relied on <em>Sullivan </em>in interpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681 <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  Jackson, a public school teacher, sued his school board under Title IX, \xe2\x80\x9calleging that the Board retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school\xe2\x80\x99s athletic program.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 171.  Title IX provides in relevant part that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person in the United States shall, <em>on the basis of sex</em>, \xe2\x80\xa6 be subjected to <em>discrimination</em> under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681(a) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added).  Holding that this provision prohibits retaliation, we wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cRetaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act.  It is a form of \xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment.  Moreover, retaliation is discrimination \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x99 because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.  We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person <em>because</em> he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional \xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x99 in violation of Title IX.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 173\xe2\x80\x93174 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation, we found, flowed naturally from <em>Sullivan:</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cRetaliation for Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy of the rights of the girls\xe2\x80\x99 basketball team in this case is \xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x99 just as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of a black lessee in <em>Sullivan </em>was discrimination on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.

The statutory language at issue here (\xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d) is not materially different from the language at issue in <em>Jackson</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) and is the functional equivalent of the language at issue in <em>Sullivan</em>, see <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 177 (describing <em>Sullivan</em> as involving \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases; that is, all three cases involve remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Jackson</em> dissent strenuously argued that a claim of retaliation is conceptually different from a claim of discrimination, see 544 U.

Indeed, in <em>Jackson</em>, the Government contended that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he text . . . of Title IX demonstrate[s] that it encompasses protection against retaliation\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation against a person because that person has filed a sex discrimination complaint is a form of intentional sex discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>8, in <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, O.

We are not persuaded, however, by any of these attempted distinctions.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals first relied on the fact that the ADEA expressly creates a private right of action whereas Title IX, the statute at issue in <em>Jackson</em>, does not.  See 476 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 58.  The Court of Appeals appears to have reasoned that, because the private right of action under Title IX is implied and not express, see <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a> (1979), the <em>Jackson</em> Court had greater leeway to adopt an expansive interpretation of Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reasoning improperly conflates the question whether a statute confers a private right of action with the question whether the statute\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibition reaches a particular form of conduct.  These questions are analytically distinct, and confusing them would lead to exceedingly strange results.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x9d in 20  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681(a), might have a narrower scope and might not reach retaliation if Title IX contained a provision expressly authorizing an aggrieved private party to bring suit to remedy a violation of \xc2\xa71681(a).  We do not see how such a conclusion could be defended.  Section 1681(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d either does or does not reach retaliation, and the presence or absence of another statutory provision expressly creating a private right of action cannot alter \xc2\xa71681(a)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  In addition, it would be perverse if the enactment of a provision explicitly creating a private right of action\xe2\x80\x94a provision that, if anything, would tend to suggest that Congress perceived a need for a strong remedy\xe2\x80\x94were taken as a justification for narrowing the scope of the underlying prohibition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning also seems to lead to the strange conclusion that, despite <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a private party may assert a retaliation claim under Title IX, the Federal Government might not be authorized to impose upon an entity that engages in retaliation the administrative remedies, including the termination of funding, that are expressly sanctioned under \xc2\xa71682.  It would be extremely odd, however, if \xc2\xa71681(a) had a broader scope when enforced by a means not expressly sanctioned by statute than it does when enforced by the means that the statute explicitly provides.  For these reasons, we reject the proposition that <em>Jackson</em> may be distinguished from the present case on the ground that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action is implied.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals next attempted to distinguish <em>Jackson</em> on the ground that retaliation claims play a more important role under Title IX than they do under the ADEA.  The Court of Appeals pointed to our statement in <em>Jackson</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98teachers and coaches . . . are often in the best position to vindicate the rights of their students because they are better able to identify discrimination and bring it to the attention of administrators.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  476 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 58 (quoting <em>Jackson</em>, 544 U. S., at 181).  The Court of Appeals suggested that third parties are not needed to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify instances of age discrimination and bring it to the attention of supervisors\xe2\x80\x9d and that, consequently, there is no need to extend \xc2\xa7633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) to reach retaliation.  476 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 58.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument ignores the basis for the decision in <em>Jackson.  Jackson</em> did not hold that Title IX prohibits retaliation because the Court concluded as a policy matter that such claims are important.  Instead, the holding in <em>Jackson</em> was based on an interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9ctext of Title IX.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 173, 178.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the statements in <em>Jackson</em> on which the Court of Appeals relied did not address the question whether the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses retaliation.  Instead, those statements addressed the school board\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, even if Title IX was held to permit some retaliation claims, only a \xe2\x80\x9cvictim of the discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and not third parties\xe2\x80\x94should be allowed to assert such a claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 179\xe2\x80\x93182.  It was in response to this argument that the Court noted the particular importance of reports of Title IX violations by third parties such as teachers and coaches.  <em>Id.</em>, at 181.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals attempted to distinguish <em>Jackson</em> on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX was adopted in response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Sullivan</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no evidence in the legislative history that the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal sector provisions were adopted in a similar context.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 58\xe2\x80\x9359.  <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Sullivan</em>, however, did not stem from \xe2\x80\x9cevidence in the legislative history\xe2\x80\x9d of Title IX.  <em>Jackson </em>did not identify any such evidence but merely observed that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted Title IX just three years after <em>Sullivan</em> was decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 176.  Due to this chronology, the Court concluded, it was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with <em>[Sullivan]</em> and that it expected its enactment [of Title IX] to be interpreted in conformity with [it].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Cannon</em>,<em> </em>441 U. S., at 699).  See also 544 U. S., at 176 (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX was enacted in 1972, three years after <em>[Sullivan]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 179\xe2\x80\x93180 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Sullivan</em> . . . formed an important part of the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What <em>Jackson</em> said about the relationship between <em>Sullivan</em> and the enactment of Title IX can be said as well about the relationship between <em>Sullivan</em> and the enactment of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  <em>Sullivan</em> was decided in 1969 and \xc2\xa7633a was enacted in 1974\xe2\x80\x94five years after the decision in <em>Sullivan</em> and two years after the enactment of Title IX.  We see no reason to think that Congress forgot about <em>Sullivan</em> during the two years that passed between the enactment of Title IX in 1972 and the enactment of \xc2\xa7633a in 1974.  And if, as <em>Jackson</em> presumed, Congress had <em>Sullivan</em> in mind when it enacted Title IX in 1972, it is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crealistic\xe2\x80\x9d to presume that Congress expected its prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7633a(a) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to be interpreted in conformity with\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d its similarly worded prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d in 20 U.

According to respondent, \xe2\x80\x9cthe strong presumption is that [the] omission reflects that Congress acted intentionally and purposely in including such language in Section 623 of the Act and excluding it from Section 633a.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[N]egative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\xe2\x80\x9d in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 330 (1997).  Here, the two relevant provisions were not considered or enacted together.  Section 623(d), which specifically prohibits private sector retaliation, was enacted in 1967, see \xc2\xa74(d), 81 Stat. 603, but the federal-sector provision, \xc2\xa7633a, was not added until 1974, see \xc2\xa728(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument is also undermined by the fact that the prohibitory language in the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision differs sharply from that in the corresponding ADEA provision relating to private-sector employment.  In the private-sector provision, Congress set out a specific list of forbidden employer practices.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The omission from such a list of a specific prohibition of retaliation might have been interpreted as suggesting that Congress did not want to reach retaliation, and therefore Congress had reason to include a specific prohibition of retaliation,  \xc2\xa7623(d), in order to dispel any such inference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ADEA federal-sector provision, however, was not modeled after \xc2\xa7623(d) and is couched in very different terms.  The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly after\xe2\x80\x9d Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector discrimination ban.  <em>Lehman</em> v. <em>Nakshian</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/index.html"></a><a href="/us/453/156/index.html">453 U.

Like the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision, contains a broad prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a list of specific prohibited practices.  Compare 118 Stat. 814, as amended, 42 U.

And like the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision incorporates certain private-sector provisions but does not incorporate the provision prohibiting retaliation in the private sector.  See 42 U.

Under the reasoning of <em>Sullivan</em>, retaliation for complaining about age discrimination, is \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cjust as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of [the] black lessee in <em>Sullivan</em> was discrimination on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 176\xe2\x80\x93177.  Thus, because \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(d) and 633a were enacted separately and are couched in very different terms, the absence of a federal-sector provision similar to \xc2\xa7623(d) does not provide a sufficient reason to depart from the reasoning of <em>Sullivan</em> and <em>Jackson</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see even less merit in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on 29 U.

After Title VII was made applicable to federal employment in 1972, see Equal Employment Act, \xc2\xa711, 86 Stat. 111, the Civil Service Commission issued new regulations that prohibited discrimination in federal employment based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (but not age), see 5 CFR \xc2\xa7713.211 (1973), as well as \xe2\x80\x9creprisal[s]\xe2\x80\x9d prompted by complaints about such discrimination, \xc2\xa7713.262(a).  When Congress enacted the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provisions in 1974, respondent argues, Congress anticipated that the enactment of \xc2\xa7633a would prompt the Civil Service Commission to \xe2\x80\x9cextend its existing reprisal regulations\xe2\x80\x9d to cover age discrimination complaints and that Congress intended for the civil service process to provide the exclusive avenue for asserting retaliation claims.  Brief for Respondent 27, 33, and n.\xc2\xa07.  Respondent suggests that Congress took this approach because it believed that the Civil Service regulations \xe2\x80\x9creflect[ed] a distinct set of public policy concerns in the civil service sector.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 27.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent cites no direct evidence that Congress actually took this approach;[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests on nothing more than unsupported speculation.  And, in any event, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument contradicts itself.  If, as respondent maintains, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ection 633a(a) does not confer an anti-retaliation right,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 9, then there is no reason to assume that Congress expected the Civil Service Commission to respond to the enactment of \xc2\xa7633a(a) by issuing new regulations prohibiting retaliation.

Respondent contends that the broad waiver of sovereign immunity in the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(1), is beside the point for present purposes because, for many federal agencies, the only provision that waives sovereign immunity for ADEA claims is contained in \xc2\xa7633a, and therefore this waiver provision \xe2\x80\x9cmust be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 44 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/30/index.html">503 U.

Unlike \xc2\xa7663a(c), \xc2\xa7633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) is not a waiver of sovereign immunity; it is a substantive provision outlawing \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  That the waiver in \xc2\xa7633a(c) applies to \xc2\xa7633a(a) claims does not mean that \xc2\xa7633a(a) must surmount the same high hurdle as \xc2\xa7633a(c).

Protection against discrimination may include protection against retaliation for complaining about discrimination, but that is not always the case.  The separate treatment of each in the private-sector provision of the ADEA makes that clear.  In my view, the statutory language and structure, as well as the fact that Congress has always protected federal employees from retaliation through the established civil service process, confirm that Congress did not intend those employees to have a separate judicial remedy for retaliation under the ADEA.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, which at the time applied only to private employers, with the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cpromot[ing] employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; \xe2\x80\xa6 [of] prohibit[ing] arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and of] help[ing] employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621(b).  The 1967 Act implemented this purpose in two principal ways.  First, the statute made it unlawful for an employer to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against any individual \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  Second, Congress enacted a specific antiretaliation provision, which made it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment \xe2\x80\xa6 because such individual \xe2\x80\xa6 has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or because such individual \xe2\x80\xa6 has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under\xe2\x80\x9d the ADEA.  \xc2\xa7623(d).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 (FLSA Amendments), \xc2\xa728(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74, Congress (among other things) extended the ADEA to most Executive Branch employees by adopting 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a.  Like its private-sector counterpart, this federal-sector provision includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of age. Unlike its private-sector counterpart, the federal-sector provision does <em>not</em> include a separate ban on retaliation.  The federal-sector provision specifies only that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age [in various federal agencies] shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7633a(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the absence of an express retaliation provision in \xc2\xa7633a(a), the Court finds that the statute encompasses both discrimination and retaliation claims.  To support this proposition, the Court principally relies on our decisions in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a> (1969), and <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a> (2005).  In my view, the majority reads these cases for more than they are worth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority correctly states, we held in <em>Sullivan</em> that 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982, which prohibits race discrimination in the sale or rental of property, also provides a cause of action for retaliation.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  396 U. S., at 237.  More recently, we held in <em>Jackson</em> that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373\xe2\x80\x94which provides in relevant part that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681(a)\xe2\x80\x94encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination.  544 U. S., at 173\xe2\x80\x93174.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent the majority takes from these precedents the principle that broad antidiscrimination provisions may also encompass an antiretaliation component, I do not disagree.  That is why I am able to join today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>CBOCS West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Humphries, ante</em>, at 14<em> </em>(holding that a retaliation claim is cognizable under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981).  But it cannot be\xe2\x80\x94contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s apparent view\xe2\x80\x94that <em>any</em> time Congress proscribes \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on X,\xe2\x80\x9d it means to proscribe retaliation as well.  That is clear from the private-sector provision of the ADEA, which includes a ban on \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] against any individual \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1), but <em>also</em> includes a separate (and presumably not superfluous) ban on retaliation, \xc2\xa7623(d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, we made this precise observation in <em>Jackson</em> itself.  The respondent in that case argued that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s ban on discrimination could not include a cause of action for retaliation because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, like the private-sector provision of the ADEA, includes discrete discrimination and retaliation provisions.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 (discrimination), 2000e\xe2\x80\x933 (retaliation).  We distinguished Title VII on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX is a broadly written general prohibition on discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII spells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes discrimination in violation of that statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 175.  Thus, while we distinguished Title VII from Title IX in <em>Jackson</em>, we also acknowledged that not every express ban on discrimination must be read as a ban on retaliation as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, although the majority asserts that <em>Jackson</em> rejected the view that \xe2\x80\x9ca claim of retaliation is conceptually different from a claim of discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5, we have since explained that antidiscrimination and antiretaliation provisions are indeed conceptually distinct, and serve distinct purposes.  In <em>Burlington N. &amp; S.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. Co.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/53/index.html">548 U. S. 53</a> (2006), we considered whether the antiretaliation provision in the Title VII private-sector provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a)\xe2\x80\x94which is materially indistinguishable from that in the ADEA\xe2\x80\x94applies \xe2\x80\x9conly [to] those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at 61.  In answering that question in the negative, we explained: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their [protected] status.  The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic guarantees.  The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <em>i.e.</em>, their status.  The antiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <em>i.e.</em>, their conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 63 (citation omitted).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I take from <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Jackson</em> the proposition that broad bans on discrimination, standing alone, may be read to include a retaliation component, the provision at issue here does not stand alone.  And, as <em>Jackson</em> itself makes clear, see 544 U. S., at 173, 175, \xe2\x80\x9cthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/index.html">489 U. S. 803</a>, 809 (1989).  Here the text and structure of the statute, the broader statutory scheme of which it is a part, and distinctions between federal- and private-sector employment convince me that \xc2\xa7633a(a) does not provide a cause of action for retaliation.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).  If, as the majority holds, the ban on \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7633a(a) encompasses both discrimination and retaliation claims, it is difficult to understand why Congress would have felt the need to specify in \xc2\xa7623 separate prohibitions against <em>both </em>\xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>and </em>retaliation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority responds by noting that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]egative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\xe2\x80\x99 in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were \xe2\x80\x98considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 330 (1997)).  Here, the majority notes that \xc2\xa7623 was enacted in 1967, while \xc2\xa7633a was not passed until 1974.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Fair enough, but while I do not quarrel with this principle as a general matter, I do not think it does the work the majority thinks it does.  Congress obviously had the private-sector ADEA provision prominently before it when it enacted \xc2\xa7633a, because the same bill that included \xc2\xa7633a also amended the private-sector provision.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa728(a)(2), 88 Stat. 74 (amending the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d in 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7630(b) to include States and their political subdivisions).  Indeed, it is quite odd to assume, as the majority does, see <em>ante</em>, at 9, 12, that the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7633a was aware of and relied upon our decision in <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x94which interpreted 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982, a wholly unrelated provision\xe2\x80\x94but was not attuned to its own work reflected in the differences between 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623 and 633a.  Even if the negative implication to be drawn from those differences may not be at its \xe2\x80\x9cstrongest\xe2\x80\x9d under these circumstances, it is certainly strong enough.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, and more to the point, we have relied on the differences in language between the federal- and private-sector provisions of the ADEA specifically in our interpretation of \xc2\xa7633a.  In <em>Lehman</em> v. <em>Nakshian</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/index.html">453 U. S. 156</a> (1981), we faced the question whether a person bringing an action under \xc2\xa7633a(c), alleging a violation of \xc2\xa7633a(a), was entitled to a trial by jury.  In holding that there was no jury-trial right available against the Federal Government, we relied on the fact that while the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision did not include a provision for a jury trial, the analogous grant of a right of action in the private-sector provision, \xc2\xa7626(c), \xe2\x80\x9c<em>expressly</em> provides for jury trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 162.  We reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress accordingly demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very \xe2\x80\x98legislation cited.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0But in [\xc2\xa7633a(c)] it failed explicitly to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Galloway</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/372/index.html">319 U. S. 372</a>, 389 (1943)).  So too here.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 demonstrated that it knew how to\xe2\x80\x9d provide a retaliation cause of action \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it wished to do so elsewhere in the very \xe2\x80\x98legislation cited,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cfailed explicitly to do so\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7633a(a).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority argues that this inference is weakened by the fact that, in \xe2\x80\x9cthe private-sector provision, Congress set out a specific list of forbidden employer practices,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, while \xc2\xa7633a(a) is a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad, general ban on \xe2\x80\x98discrimination based on age,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.  This point cuts against the majority.  Section 623 drew a distinction between prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cemployer practices\xe2\x80\x9d that discriminate based on age, and retaliation.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(a) (discriminatory \xe2\x80\x9c[e]mployer practices\xe2\x80\x9d), 623(d) (retaliation).  Section 633a(a) phrased the prohibited discrimination in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Just as Congress did not regard retaliation as included within \xe2\x80\x9cemployer practices,\xe2\x80\x9d but dealt with it separately in \xc2\xa7623(d), the counterpart to \xe2\x80\x9cemployer practices\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7633a\xe2\x80\x94discriminatory \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel actions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94should similarly not be read to include retaliation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument that some meaning ought to attach to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of an antiretaliation provision in \xc2\xa7623 but not in \xc2\xa7633a is further supported by several other factors.  To begin with, Congress <em>expressly</em> made clear that the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s private-sector provisions should not apply to their federal-sector counterpart, by providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny personnel action \xe2\x80\xa6 referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of\xe2\x80\x9d the ADEA, except for one provision not relevant here.  \xc2\xa7633a(f).  The majority sees no \xe2\x80\x9cmerit in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(f).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  But again, we relied on this very provision in <em>Lehman</em>.  We explained that this subsection \xe2\x80\x9cclearly emphasize[s] that [\xc2\xa7633a] was self-contained and unaffected by other sections\xe2\x80\x9d of the ADEA, 453 U. S., at 168, a fact that we used to support our holding that the federal-sector provision does not provide a right to a jury trial, even though the private-sector provision does.  In short, Congress was aware that there were significant differences between the private- and federal-sector portions of the ADEA, and specified that no part of the former should be understood to have been implicitly imported into the latter.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other actions Congress took at the same time that it enacted \xc2\xa7633a in 1974 further underscore the point that Congress deliberately chose to exclude retaliation claims from the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector provision.  The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, as the Act\xe2\x80\x99s name suggests, dealt for the most part not with the ADEA, but with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, extending that statute\xe2\x80\x99s protections to federal employees.  See FLSA Amendments, \xc2\xa76(a)(2), 88 Stat. 58.  In doing so, Congress explicitly subjected federal employers to the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s express antiretaliation provision, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3).  Congress did <em>not</em> similarly subject the Federal Government to the express antiretaliation provision in the ADEA, strongly suggesting that this was a conscious choice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority responds that this \xe2\x80\x9cinference \xe2\x80\xa6 is unfounded\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress had good reason to expect that this broad ban would be interpreted in the same way that <em>Sullivan</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 had interpreted the broad ban on racial discrimination in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa06.  Anything is possible, but again, it seems far more likely that Congress had its eye on the private-sector provision of the ADEA in crafting the federal one, rather than on one of our precedents on a different statute.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But whatever the merits of this argument, it does not rebut the import of other probative provisions of the FLSA Amendments.  In particular, Congress specifically chose in the FLSA Amendments to treat States and the Federal Government differently with respect to the ADEA itself.  It subjected the former to the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s private-sector provision, see FLSA Amendments, \xc2\xa728(a)(2), 88 Stat. 74\xe2\x80\x94including the express prohibition against retaliation in \xc2\xa7623(d)\xe2\x80\x94while creating \xc2\xa7633a as a stand-alone prohibition against discrimination in federal employment, without an antiretaliation provision, see \xc2\xa728(b)(2), <em>ibid.</em>  This decision evinces a deliberate legislative choice <em>not</em> to extend those portions of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s private-sector provisions that are not expressly included in \xc2\xa7633a, as of course Congress specified in \xc2\xa7633a(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given all this, it seems safe to say that the text and structure of the statute strongly support the proposition that Congress did not intend to include a cause of action for retaliation against federal employees in \xc2\xa7633a(a).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But <em>why</em> would Congress allow retaliation suits against private-sector and state employers, but not against the Federal Government?  The answer is that such retaliation was dealt with not through a judicial remedy, but rather the way retaliation in the federal workplace was typically addressed\xe2\x80\x94through the established civil service system, with its comprehensive protection for Government workers.  Congress was quite familiar with that detailed administrative system\xe2\x80\x94one that already existed for most federal employees, but not for private ones.  This approach, unlike the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, is consistent with the fact that Congress has recognized that regulation of the civil service is a complex issue, requiring \xe2\x80\x9ccareful attention to conflicting policy considerations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbalancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Lucas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/367/index.html">462 U. S. 367</a>, 388, 389 (1983).  The resulting system often requires remedies different from those found to be appropriate for the private sector (or even for the States).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before Title VII was extended to federal employees in 1972, discrimination in federal employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was prohibited by executive order.  See Exec. Order No. 11478, 34 Fed. Reg. 12985 (1969).  Civil service regulations implemented this policy by authorizing Executive Branch employees to bring administrative complaints for allegedly dis-\ncriminatory acts, including \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel action[s],\xe2\x80\x9d 5 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.211, 713.214(a)(1)(i) (1972).  These regula-\ntions further provided that such complainants, their\nrepresentatives, and witnesses \xe2\x80\x9cshall be free from\nrestraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or re-\nprisal\xe2\x80\x9d for their involvement in the complaint proc-\ness.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.214(b) (complainants and representatives), 713.218(e) (witnesses).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Civil Service Commission (CSC) promulgated a detailed scheme through which federal employees could vindicate these rights, including the express antiretaliation protections.  More serious personnel actions, known as \xe2\x80\x9cadverse actions,\xe2\x80\x9d could be challenged before the employing agency and appealed to the CSC,  see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.219(a) and (b), 752.203, 771.202, 771.208, 771.222, while less serious personnel actions and \xe2\x80\x9cany [other] matter of concern or dissatisfaction\xe2\x80\x9d could be challenged under alternative procedures that were also appealable to the CSC, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.217(b), 713.218, 713.219(a) and (c), 713.231(a), 771.302(a).  Retaliation was proscribed in all events.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.219(a) and (c) (incorporating Part 771 antiretaliation provisions to complaint procedures except certain appeals to CSC); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7771.105(a)(1) and (b)(1), 771.211(e) (antiretaliation provisions for CSC appeals).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1972, Congress applied Title VII to the federal-sector, Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (EEO Act), \xc2\xa711, 86 Stat. 111, mandating that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll personnel actions\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to federal employees \xe2\x80\x9cshall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(a).  Congress empowered the CSC \xe2\x80\x9cto enforce the provisions of subsection (a) through appropriate remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cissue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this grant of authority, as well as its prior authority under statute and executive order, the CSC revised its regulations both \xe2\x80\x9cto implement the [EEO Act] and to strengthen the system of complaint processing.\xe2\x80\x9d  37 Fed. Reg. 22717 (1972) (Part 713 Subpart B).  As with its prior system of administrative enforcement, the CSC distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaints of discrimination on grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 CFR \xc2\xa7713.211 (1973), on the one hand, and charges by a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplainant, his representative, or a witness who alleges restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal in connection with the presentation of a complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7713.262(a), on the other.  The regulations imposed upon employing agencies the obligation of \xe2\x80\x9ctimely investigation and resolution of complaints including complaints of coercion and reprisal,\xe2\x80\x9d 37 Fed. Reg. 22717; see also 5 CFR \xc2\xa7713.220, and made clear the procedures for processing retaliation claims, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7713.261, 713.262.  The regulations further mandated that the CSC \xe2\x80\x9crequire the [employing] agency to take whatever action is appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to allegations of retaliation if the agency itself has \xe2\x80\x9cnot completed an appropriate inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7713.262(b)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, leading up to the enactment of 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a in 1974, the CSC\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive regulatory scheme set forth a broadly applicable remedy for retaliation against federal employees for filing complaints or otherwise participating in the EEO process.  And when Congress empowered the CSC in 1974 to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce the provisions of [\xc2\xa7633a(a)] through appropriate remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cissue such rules, regulations, orders, and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d under that statute, \xc2\xa728(b)(2), 88 Stat. 75, the assumption that Congress expected the CSC to create an administrative antiretaliation remedy, just as it had for complaints of discrimination under Title VII, is compelling.  And sure enough, the CSC did just that promptly after \xc2\xa7633a was enacted.  See 39 Fed. Reg. 24351 (1974); 5 CFR \xc2\xa7713.511 (1975).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this history of addressing retaliation through administrative means, combined with the complicated nature (relative to the private sector) of federal personnel practices, it is therefore by no means anomalous that Congress would have dealt with the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary objective\xe2\x80\x9d of combating age discrimination through a judicial remedy, <em>Burlington</em>, 548 U. S., at 63, but left it to expert administrators used to dealing with personnel matters in the federal work force to \xe2\x80\x9csecure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic guarantees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority discounts the above argument as \xe2\x80\x9cunsupported speculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante</em>, at 14.  It seems to me that the fact that the Executive Branch had always treated discrimination and retaliation as distinct, and that it enacted administrative remedies for retaliation almost immediately after the passage of the Title VII and ADEA federal-sector provisions, provide plenty of support.  But even if the majority is right, the view that Congress intended to treat retaliation for age discrimination complaints as a problem to be dealt with primarily through administrative procedures, rather than through the judicial process in the first instance, is confirmed by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s passage of the Civil Service Reform Act  of 1978 (CSRA), 92 Stat. 1111.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSRA, as amended, has a detailed comprehensive antiretaliation provision, which generally makes it unlawful for Executive Branch employers to</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ctake or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of \xe2\x80\xa6 (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation [or] (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A).\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(b)(9).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This antiretaliation provision, which plainly applies to retaliation for exercising rights under the civil rights statutes, including the ADEA, is supported by a host of administrative remedies.  If the alleged retaliation results in  adverse actions such as removal, suspension for more than 14 days, or reduction in pay, see \xc2\xa77512, an appeal can be taken directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77513(d), 7701, with judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \xc2\xa77703(b)(1).  Retaliation claims based on less serious allegations are first investigated by the Office of Special Counsel.  If the Office finds that there are reasonable grounds supporting the retaliation charge, it must report its determination to, and may seek corrective action from, the MSPB.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71214(a)(1)(A), (b)(2)(B), (C), and 1214(c).  Again, judicial review in the Federal Circuit is available.  \xc2\xa77703(b)(1).  In all events, upon a finding that retaliation has in fact occurred, the MSPB has the authority to order corrective action, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71214(b)(4), 7701(b)(2), to order attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees on appeal, \xc2\xa77701(g), and to discipline federal employees responsible for retaliatory acts, \xc2\xa71215.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the CSRA was enacted after \xc2\xa7633a.  Nevertheless, we have explained, in the same context of federal employee remedies, that the \xe2\x80\x9cclassic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to \xe2\x80\x98make sense\xe2\x80\x99 in combination, necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Fausto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/439/index.html">484 U. S. 439</a>, 453 (1988).  That is precisely the situation here.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, this is particularly true with respect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of federal employment.  We have explained that the CSRA is an \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 445.  Perhaps the CSRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccivil service remedies [are] not as effective as an individual damages remedy\xe2\x80\x9d that can be obtained in federal court, <em>Bush</em>, 462 U. S., at 372, or perhaps a quicker and more familiar administrative remedy <em>is</em> more effective as a practical matter.  That is not the issue.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 388 (the question whether a judicial remedy against a federal employer for a First Amendment violation should be implied \xe2\x80\x9cobviously cannot be answered simply by noting that existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d).  The CSRA establishes an \xe2\x80\x9celaborate, comprehensive scheme that encompasses substantive provisions forbidding\narbitrary action by supervisors and procedures\xe2\x80\x94administrative and judicial\xe2\x80\x94by which improper action may be redressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 385.  Retaliation as a general matter was already addressed for federal employees.  I would not read into \xc2\xa7633a a judicial remedy for retaliation when Congress\xe2\x80\x94which has \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped considerable familiarity with balancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 389\xe2\x80\x94chose to provide a detailed administrative one.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question whether a ban against \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on\xe2\x80\x9d a protected status such as age can also be read to encompass a ban on retaliation can be answered only after careful scrutiny of the particular provision in question.  In this case, an analysis of the statutory language of \xc2\xa7633a and the broader scheme of which it is a part confirms that Congress did not intend implicitly to create a judicial remedy for retaliation against federal employees, when it did so expressly for private-sector employees.  Congress was not sloppy in creating this distinction; it did so for good reason: because the federal workplace is governed by comprehensive regulation, of which Congress was well aware, while the private sector is not.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To the extent there was any disagreement about whether <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/396/229/index.html">396 U.
