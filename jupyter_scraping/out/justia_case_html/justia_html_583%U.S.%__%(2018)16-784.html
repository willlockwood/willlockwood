Valley View was granted the license and arranged for the Cayman Islands branch of Credit Suisse to wire $55 million to third-party escrow agent Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania.  The Bedford Downs shareholders, including petitioner Merit Management Group, LP, deposited their stock certificates into escrow.  Citizens Bank disbursed the $55 million over two installments according to the agreement, of which petitioner Merit received $16.5 million.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Although Valley View secured the harness-racing license, it was unable to achieve its goal of opening a racetrack casino.  Valley View and its parent company, Centaur, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Respondent FTI Consulting, Inc., was appointed to serve as trustee of the Centaur litigation trust.  FTI then sought to avoid the transfer from Valley View to Merit for the sale of Bedford Downs\xe2\x80\x99 stock, arguing that it was constructively fraudulent under \xc2\xa7548(a)(1)(B).  Merit contended that the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor barred FTI from avoiding the transfer because it was a \xe2\x80\x9csettlement payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. made by or to (or for the benefit of)\xe2\x80\x9d two \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institutions,\xe2\x80\x9d Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank.  The District Court agreed with Merit, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa7546(e) did not protect transfers in which financial institutions served as mere conduits.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The only relevant transfer for purposes of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Before a court can determine whether a transfer was \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of)\xe2\x80\x9d a covered entity, it must first identify the relevant transfer to test in that inquiry.  Merit posits that the relevant transfer should include not only the Valley-View-to-Merit end-to-end transfer, but also all of its component parts, <i>i.e.</i>, the Credit-Suisse-to-Citizens-Bank and the Citizens-Bank-to-Merit transfers.  FTI maintains that the only relevant transfer is the transfer that it sought to avoid, specifically, the overarching transfer between Valley View and Merit.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The language of \xc2\xa7546(e) and the specific context in which that language is used support the conclusion that the relevant transfer for purposes of the safe-harbor inquiry is the transfer the trustee seeks to avoid.  The first clause of the provision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indicates that \xc2\xa7546(e) operates as an exception to trustees\xe2\x80\x99 avoiding powers granted elsewhere in the Code.  The text makes clear that the starting point for the \xc2\xa7546(e) inquiry is the expressly listed avoiding powers and, consequently, the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid in exercising those powers.  The last clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94also focuses on the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  Creating an exception to the exception for \xc2\xa7548(a)(1)(A) transfers, the text refers back to a specific type of transfer that falls within the avoiding powers, signaling that the exception applies to the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid, not any component part of that transfer.  This reading is reinforced by the \xc2\xa7546 section heading, \xe2\x80\x9cLimitations on avoiding powers,\xe2\x80\x9d and is confirmed by the rest of the statutory text: The provision provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may not avoid\xe2\x80\x9d certain transfers, which naturally invites scrutiny of the transfers that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may avoid,\xe2\x80\x9d the parallel language used in the avoiding powers provisions.  The text further provides that the transfer that is saved from avoidance is one \xe2\x80\x9cthat <i>is</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (not one that involves) a securities transaction covered under \xc2\xa7546(e).  In other words, to qualify for protection under the securities safe harbor, \xc2\xa7546(e) provides that the otherwise avoidable transfer itself be a transfer that meets the safe-harbor criteria.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The statutory structure also supports this reading of \xc2\xa7546(e).  The Code establishes a system for avoiding transfers as well as a safe harbor from avoidance.  It is thus only logical to view the pertinent transfer under \xc2\xa7546(e) as the same transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to one of its avoiding powers.  In an avoidance action, the trustee must establish that the transfer it seeks to set aside meets the carefully set out criteria under the substantive avoidance provisions of the Code.  The defendant in that avoidance action is free to argue that the trustee failed to properly identify an avoidable transfer under the Code, including any available arguments concerning the role of component parts of the transfer.  If a trustee properly identifies an avoidable transfer, however, the court has no reason to examine the relevance of component parts when considering a limit to the avoiding power, where that limit is defined by reference to an otherwise avoidable transfer, as is the case with \xc2\xa7546(e).  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The primary argument Merit advances that is moored in the statutory text\xe2\x80\x94concerning Congress\xe2\x80\x99 2006 addition of the parenthetical \xe2\x80\x9c(or for the benefit of)\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7546(e)\xe2\x80\x94is unavailing.  Merit contends that Congress meant to abrogate the Eleventh Circuit decision in <i>In\xc2\xa0re Munford, Inc.,</i> 98 F.\xc2\xa03d 604, which held that \xc2\xa7546(e) was inapplicable to transfers in which a financial institution acted only as an intermediary.  However, Merit points to nothing in the text or legislative history to corroborate its argument.  A simpler explanation rooted in the text of the statute and consistent with the interpretation of \xc2\xa7546(e) adopted here is that Congress added the \xe2\x80\x9cor for the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d language that is common in other substantive avoidance provisions to the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor to ensure that the scope of the safe harbor and scope of the avoiding powers matched.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">That reading would not, contrary to what Merit contends, render other provisions ineffectual or superfluous.  Rather, it gives full effect to the text of \xc2\xa7546(e).  If the transfer the trustee seeks to avoid was made \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d a covered entity, then \xc2\xa7546(e) will bar avoidance without regard to whether the entity acted only as an intermediary.  It will also bar avoidance if the transfer was made \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d that entity, even if it was not made \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d that entity.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Finally, Merit argues that reading the safe harbor so that its application depends on the identity of the investor and the manner in which its investment is held rather than on the general nature of the transaction is incongruous with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purportedly \xe2\x80\x9cprophylactic\xe2\x80\x9d approach to \xc2\xa7546(e).  But this argument is nothing more than an attack on the text of the statute, which protects only certain transactions \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of)\xe2\x80\x9d certain covered entities.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Applying this reading of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor to this case yields a straightforward result.  FTI sought to avoid the Valley-View-to-Merit transfer.  When determining whether the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor saves that transfer from avoidance liability, the Court must look to that overarching transfer to evaluate whether it meets the safe-harbor criteria.  Because the parties do not contend that either Valley View or Merit is a covered entity, the transfer falls outside of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor.

Those powers, referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cavoiding powers,\xe2\x80\x9d are not without limits, however, as the Code sets out a number of exceptions.  The operation of one such exception, the securities safe harbor,11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7546(e), is at issue in this case.  Specifically, this Court is asked to determine how the safe harbor operates in the context of a transfer that was executed via one or more transactions, <i>e.g., </i>a transfer from A\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0D that was executed via B and C as intermediaries, such that the component parts of the transfer include A\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0B\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0D.  If a trustee seeks to avoid the A\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0D transfer, and the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor is invoked as a defense, the question becomes: When determining whether the \xc2\xa7546(e) securities safe harbor saves the transfer from avoidance, should courts look to the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid (<i>i.e., </i>A\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0D) to determine whether that transfer meets the safe-harbor criteria, or should courts look also to any component parts of the overarching transfer (<i>i.e., </i>A\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0B\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0\xe2\x86\x92\xc2\xa0D)?  The Court concludes that the plain meaning of \xc2\xa7546(e) dictates that the only relevant transfer for purposes of the safe harbor is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>Because the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor operates as a limit to the general avoiding powers of a bankruptcy trustee,[<a href="#F1">1</a>] we begin with a review of those powers.  Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code affords bankruptcy trustees the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cse[t] aside certain types of transfers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. recaptur[e] the value of those avoided transfers for the benefit of the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tabb \xc2\xa76.2, p. 474.  These avoiding powers \xe2\x80\x9chelp implement the core principles of bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> \xc2\xa76.1, at 468.  For example, some \xe2\x80\x9cdeter the race of diligence of creditors to dismember the debtor before bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x9d and promote \xe2\x80\x9cequality of distribution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Union Bank</i> v. <i>Wolas</i>,502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 151,162 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tabb \xc2\xa76.2.  Others set aside transfers that \xe2\x80\x9cunfairly or improperly deplete .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. assets or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. dilute the claims against those assets.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6548.01, p. 548\xe2\x80\x9310 (16th ed. 2017); see also Tabb \xc2\xa76.2, at 475 (noting that some avoiding powers are designed \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that the debtor deals fairly with its creditors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>Sections 544 through 553 of the Code outline the circumstances under which a trustee may pursue avoidance.  See, <i>e.g., </i>11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7544(a) (setting out circumstances under which a trustee can avoid unrecorded liens and conveyances); \xc2\xa7544(b) (detailing power to avoid based on rights that unsecured creditors have under nonbankruptcy law); \xc2\xa7545 (setting out criteria that allow a trustee to avoid a statutory lien); \xc2\xa7547 (detailing criteria for avoidance of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpreferential transfers\xe2\x80\x9d).  The particular avoidance provision at issue here is \xc2\xa7548(a), which provides that a \xe2\x80\x9ctrustee may avoid\xe2\x80\x9d certain fraudulent transfers \xe2\x80\x9cof an interest of the debtor in property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7548(a)(1).  Section 548(a)(1)(A) addresses so-called \xe2\x80\x9cactually\xe2\x80\x9d fraudulent transfers, which are \xe2\x80\x9cmade .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. indebted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 548(a)(1)(B) addresses \xe2\x80\x9cconstructively\xe2\x80\x9d fraudulent transfers.  See <i>BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation</i>,511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 531,535 (1994).  As relevant to this case, the statute defines constructive fraud in part as when a debtor:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(B)(i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(ii)(I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation.11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7548(a)(1).</p><p>If a transfer is avoided, \xc2\xa7550 identifies the parties from whom the trustee may recover either the transferred property or the value of that property to return to the bankruptcy estate.  Section 550(a) provides, in relevant part, that \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that a transfer is avoided .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the trustee may recover .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cthe initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made,\xe2\x80\x9d or from \xe2\x80\x9cany immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7550(a).</p><p>B</p><p>The Code sets out a number of limits on the exercise of these avoiding powers.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa7546(a) (setting statute of limitations for avoidance actions); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7546(c)\xe2\x80\x93(d) (setting certain policy-based exceptions to avoiding powers); \xc2\xa7548(a)(2) (setting limit to avoidance of \xe2\x80\x9ca charitable contribution to a qualified religious or charitable entity or organization\xe2\x80\x9d).  Central to this case is the securities safe harbor set forth in \xc2\xa7546(e), which provides (as presently codified and in full):</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title, the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a margin payment, as defined in section 101, 741, or 761 of this title, or settlement payment, as defined in section 101 or 741 of this title, made by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial  institution, financial participant, or securities clearing agency, or that is a transfer made by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, financial participant, or securities clearing agency, in connection with a securities contract, as defined in section 741(7), commodity contract, as defined in section 761(4), or forward contract, that is made before the commencement of the case, except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The predecessor to this securities safe harbor, formerly codified at11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7764(c), was enacted in 1978 against the backdrop of a district court decision in a case called <i>Seligson</i> v. <i>New York Produce Exchange</i>, 394 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 125 (SDNY 1975), which involved a transfer by a bankrupt commodity broker.  See S. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93989, pp.\xc2\xa08, 106 (1978); see also Brubaker, Understanding the Scope of the \xc2\xa7546(e) Securities Safe Harbor Through the Concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cTransfer\xe2\x80\x9d Sought To Be Avoided, 37 Bkrtcy. L. Letter 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (July 2017).  The bankruptcy trustee in <i>Seligson</i> filed suit seeking to avoid over $12 million in margin payments made by the commodity broker debtor to a clearing association on the basis that the transfer was constructively fraudulent.  The clearing association attempted to defend on the theory that it was a mere \xe2\x80\x9cconduit\xe2\x80\x9d for the transmission of the margin payments.  394 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 135.  The District Court found, however, triable issues of fact on that question and denied summary judgment, leaving the clearing association exposed to the risk of significant liability.  See <i>id.,</i> at 135\xe2\x80\x93136.  Following that decision, Congress enacted the \xc2\xa7764(c) safe harbor, providing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a margin payment to or deposit with a commodity broker or forward contract merchant or is a settlement payment made by a clearing organization.\xe2\x80\x9d92Stat.2619, codified at11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7764(c) (repealed 1982).</p><p>Congress amended the securities safe harbor exception over the years, each time expanding the categories of covered transfers or entities.  In 1982, Congress expanded the safe harbor to protect margin and settlement payments \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, or securities clearing agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74,96Stat.236, codified at11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7546(d).

See \xc2\xa7907(b),119Stat.181\xe2\x80\x93182;11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(22A).  And, in 2006, Congress amended the provision to cover transfers made in connection with securities contracts, commodity contracts, and forward contracts.  \xc2\xa75(b)(1),120Stat.2697\xe2\x80\x932698.  The 2006 amendment also modified the statute to its current form by adding the new parenthetical phrase \xe2\x80\x9c(or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d after \xe2\x80\x9cby or to,\xe2\x80\x9d so that the safe harbor now covers transfers made \xe2\x80\x9cby or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d one of the covered entities.  <i>Id., </i>at 2697.</p><p>C</p><p>With this background, we now turn to the facts of this case, which comes to this Court from the world of competitive harness racing (a form of horse racing).  Harness racing is a closely regulated industry in Pennsylvania, and the Commonwealth requires a license to operate a racetrack.

Valley View proceeded with the corporate acquisition required by the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement and arranged for the Cayman Islands branch of Credit Suisse to finance the $55 million purchase price as part of a larger $850 million transaction.  Credit Suisse wired the $55 million to Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, which had agreed to serve as the third-party escrow agent for the transaction.  The Bedford Downs shareholders, including petitioner Merit Management Group, LP, deposited their stock certificates into escrow as well.  At closing, Valley View received the Bedford Downs stock certificates, and in October 2007 Citizens Bank disbursed $47.5 million to the Bedford Downs shareholders, with $7.5 million remaining in escrow at Citizens Bank under the multiyear indemnification holdback period provided for in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.  Citizens Bank disbursed that $7.5 million installment to the Bedford Downs shareholders in October 2010, after the holdback period ended.  All told, Merit received approximately $16.5 million from the sale of its Bedford Downs stock to Valley View.  Notably, the closing statement for the transaction reflected Valley View as the \xe2\x80\x9cBuyer,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bedford Downs shareholders as the \xe2\x80\x9cSellers,\xe2\x80\x9d and $55 million as the \xe2\x80\x9cPurchase Price.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 30.</p><p>In the end, Valley View never got to open its racino.  Although it had secured the last harness-racing license, it was unable to secure a separate gaming license for the operation of the slot machines in the time set out in its financing package.  Valley View and its parent company, Centaur, LLC, thereafter filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The Bankruptcy Court confirmed a reorganization plan and appointed respondent FTI Consulting, Inc., to serve as trustee of the Centaur litigation trust.</p><p>FTI filed suit against Merit in the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to avoid the $16.5 million transfer from Valley View to Merit for the sale of Bedford Downs\xe2\x80\x99 stock.  The complaint alleged that the transfer was constructively fraudulent under \xc2\xa7548(a)(1)(B) of the Code because Valley View was insolvent when it purchased Bedford Downs and \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly overpaid\xe2\x80\x9d for the Bedford Downs stock.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  Merit moved for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), contending that the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor barred FTI from avoiding the Valley View-to-Merit transfer.  According to Merit, the safe harbor applied because the transfer was a \xe2\x80\x9csettlement payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. made by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d a covered \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here, Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank.</p><p>The District Court granted the Rule 12(c) motion, reasoning that the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor applied because the financial institutions transferred or received funds in connection with a \xe2\x80\x9csettlement payment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csecurities contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 541 B.\xc2\xa0R. 850, 858 (ND Ill. 2015).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor did not protect transfers in which financial institutions served as mere conduits.  See 830 F.\xc2\xa03d 690, 691 (2016).  This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuit courts as to the proper application of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p><p>II</p><p>The question before this Court is whether the transfer between Valley View and Merit implicates the safe harbor exception because the transfer was \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0) a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7546(e).  The parties and the lower courts dedicate much of their attention to the definition of the words \xe2\x80\x9cby or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7546(e), and to the question whether there is a requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution\xe2\x80\x9d or other covered entity have a beneficial interest in or dominion and control over the transferred property in order to qualify for safe harbor protection.  In our view, those inquiries put the proverbial cart before the horse.  Before a court can determine whether a transfer was made by or to or for the benefit of a covered entity, the court must first identify the relevant transfer to test in that inquiry.  At bottom, that is the issue the parties dispute in this case.</p><p>On one side, Merit posits that the Court should look not only to the Valley View-to-Merit end-to-end transfer, but also to all its component parts.  Here, those component parts include one transaction by Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank (<i>i.e., </i>the transmission of the $16.5 million from Credit Suisse to escrow at Citizens Bank), and two transactions by Citizens Bank to Merit (<i>i.e., </i>the transmission of $16.5 million over two installments by Citizens Bank as escrow agent to Merit).  Because those component parts include transactions by and to financial institutions, Merit contends that \xc2\xa7546(e) bars avoidance.</p><p>FTI, by contrast, maintains that the only relevant transfer for purposes of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe-harbor inquiry is the overarching transfer between Valley View and Merit of $16.5 million for purchase of the stock, which is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under \xc2\xa7548(a)(1)(B).  Because that transfer was not made by, to, or for the benefit of a financial institution, FTI contends that the safe harbor has no application.</p><p>The Court agrees with FTI.  The language of \xc2\xa7546(e), the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader statutory structure all support the conclusion that the relevant transfer for purposes of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe-harbor inquiry is the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under one of the substantive avoidance provisions.</p><p>A</p><p>Our analysis begins with the text of \xc2\xa7546(e), and we look to both \xe2\x80\x9cthe language itself [and] the specific context in which that language is used .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Co.</i>,519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 337,341 (1997).  The pertinent language provides:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title, the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. settlement payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. made by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0) a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial institution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or that is a transfer made by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0) a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial institution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in connection with a securities contract .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The very first clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94already begins to answer the question.  It indicates that \xc2\xa7546(e) operates as an exception to the avoiding powers afforded to the trustee under the substantive avoidance provisions.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 126 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cA dependent phrase that begins with <i>notwithstanding</i> indicates that the main clause that it introduces or follows derogates from the provision to which it refers\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is, when faced with a transfer that is otherwise avoidable, \xc2\xa7546(e) provides a safe harbor notwithstanding that avoiding power.  From the outset, therefore, the text makes clear that the starting point for the \xc2\xa7546(e) inquiry is the substantive avoiding power under the provisions expressly listed in the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause and, consequently, the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid as an exercise of those powers.</p><p>Then again in the very last clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the text reminds us that the focus of the inquiry is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  It does so by creating an exception to the exception, providing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may not avoid a transfer\xe2\x80\x9d that meets the covered transaction and entity criteria of the safe harbor, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d for an actually fraudulent transfer under \xc2\xa7548(a)(1)(A).11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7546(e).  By referring back to a specific type of transfer that falls within the avoiding power, Congress signaled that the excep- tion applies to the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid, not any component part of that transfer.</p><p>Reinforcing that reading of the safe-harbor provision, the section heading for \xc2\xa7546\xe2\x80\x94within which the securities safe harbor is found\xe2\x80\x94is: \xe2\x80\x9cLimitations on avoiding powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although section headings cannot limit the plain meaning of a statutory text, see <i>Florida Dept. of Revenue</i> v. <i>Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</i>,554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33,47 (2008), \xe2\x80\x9cthey supply cues\xe2\x80\x9d as to what Congress intended, see <i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).  In this case, the relevant section heading demonstrates the close connection between the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid and the transfer that is exempted from that avoiding power pursuant to the safe harbor.</p><p>The rest of the statutory text confirms what the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clauses and the section heading begin to suggest.  The safe harbor provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may not avoid\xe2\x80\x9d certain transfers.  \xc2\xa7546(e).  Naturally, that text invites scrutiny of the transfers that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may avoid,\xe2\x80\x9d the parallel language used in the substantive avoiding powers provisions.  See \xc2\xa7544(a) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may avoid\xe2\x80\x9d transfers falling under that provision); \xc2\xa7545 (providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he trustee may avoid\xe2\x80\x9d certain statutory liens); \xc2\xa7547(b) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may avoid\xe2\x80\x9d certain preferential transfers); \xc2\xa7548(a)(1) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he trustee may avoid\xe2\x80\x9d certain fraudulent transfers).  And if any doubt remained, the language that follows dispels that doubt: The transfer that the \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee may not avoid\xe2\x80\x9d is specified to be \xe2\x80\x9ca transfer that <i>is</i>\xe2\x80\x9d either a \xe2\x80\x9csettlement payment\xe2\x80\x9d or made \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with a securities contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7546(e) (emphasis added).  Not a transfer that involves.  Not a transfer that comprises.  But a transfer that is a securities transaction covered under \xc2\xa7546(e).  The provision explicitly equates the transfer that the trustee may otherwise avoid with the transfer that, under the safe harbor, the trustee may not avoid.  In other words, to qualify for protection under the securities safe harbor, \xc2\xa7546(e) provides that the otherwise avoidable transfer itself be a transfer that meets the safe-harbor criteria.</p><p>Thus, the statutory language and the context in which it is used all point to the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid as the relevant transfer for consideration of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe-harbor criteria.</p><p>B</p><p>The statutory structure also reinforces our reading of \xc2\xa7546(e).  See <i>Hall</i> v. <i>United States</i>,566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506,516 (2012) (looking to statutory structure in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code).  As the Seventh Circuit aptly put it, the Code \xe2\x80\x9ccreates both a system for avoiding transfers and a safe harbor from avoidance\xe2\x80\x94logically these are two sides of the same coin.\xe2\x80\x9d  830 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 694; see also <i>Fidelity Financial Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Fink</i>,522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211,217 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 546 of the Code puts certain limits on the avoidance powers set forth elsewhere\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that structure, it is only logical to view the pertinent transfer under \xc2\xa7546(e) as the same transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to one of its avoiding powers.</p><p>As noted in Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>, the substantive avoidance provisions in Chapter 5 of the Code set out in detail the criteria that must be met for a transfer to fall within the ambit of the avoiding powers.  These provisions, as Merit admits, \xe2\x80\x9cfocus mostly on the characteristics of the transfer that may be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 28.  The trustee, charged with exercising those avoiding powers, must establish to the satisfaction of a court that the transfer it seeks to set aside meets the characteristics set out under the substantive avoidance provisions.  Thus, the trustee is not free to define the transfer that it seeks to avoid in any way it chooses.  Instead, that transfer is necessarily defined by the carefully set out criteria in the Code.  As FTI itself recognizes, its power as trustee to define the transfer is not absolute because \xe2\x80\x9cthe transfer identified must sat- isfy the terms of the avoidance provision the trustee invokes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 23.</p><p>Accordingly, after a trustee files an avoidance action identifying the transfer it seeks to set aside, a defendant in that action is free to argue that the trustee failed to properly identify an avoidable transfer under the Code, including any available arguments concerning the role of component parts of the transfer.  If a trustee properly identifies an avoidable transfer, however, the court has no reason to examine the relevance of component parts when considering a limit to the avoiding power, where that limit is defined by reference to an otherwise avoidable transfer, as is the case with \xc2\xa7546(e), see Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>.</p><p>In the instant case, FTI identified the purchase of Bedford Downs\xe2\x80\x99 stock by Valley View from Merit as the transfer that it sought to avoid.  Merit does not contend that FTI improperly identified the Valley View-to-Merit transfer as the transfer to be avoided, focusing instead on whether FTI can \xe2\x80\x9cignore\xe2\x80\x9d the component parts at the safe-harbor inquiry.  Absent that argument, however, the Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank component parts are simply irrelevant to the analysis under \xc2\xa7546(e).  The focus must remain on the transfer the trustee sought to avoid.</p><p>III</p><p>A</p><p>The primary argument Merit advances that is moored in the statutory text concerns the 2006 addition of the parenthetical \xe2\x80\x9c(or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7546(e).  Merit contends that in adding the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cor for the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d to the requirement that a transfer be \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to\xe2\x80\x9d a protected entity, Congress meant to abrogate the 1998 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <i>In re Munford, Inc.</i>, 98 F. 3d 604, 610 (1996) (<i>per curiam</i>), which held that the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor was inapplicable to transfers in which a financial institution acted only as an intermediary.  Congress abrogated <i>Munford</i>, Merit reasons, by use of the disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor,\xe2\x80\x9d so that even if a beneficial interest, <i>i.e., </i>a transfer \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d a financial institution or other covered entity, is sufficient to trigger safe harbor protection, it is not necessary for the financial institution to have a beneficial interest in the transfer for the safe harbor to apply.  Merit thus argues that a transaction \xe2\x80\x9cby or to\xe2\x80\x9d a financial institution such as Credit Suisse or Citizens Bank would meet the requirements of \xc2\xa7546(e), even if the financial institution is acting as an intermediary without a beneficial interest in the transfer.</p><p>Merit points to nothing in the text or legislative history that corroborates the proposition that Congress sought to overrule <i>Munford</i> in its 2006 amendment.  There is a simpler explanation for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 addition of this language that is rooted in the text of the statute as a whole and consistent with the interpretation of \xc2\xa7546(e) the Court adopts.  A number of the substantive avoidance provisions include that language, thus giving a trustee the power to avoid a transfer that was made to \xe2\x80\x9cor for the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d certain actors.  See \xc2\xa7547(b)(1) (avoiding power with respect to preferential transfers \xe2\x80\x9cto or for the benefit of a creditor\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7548(a)(1) (avoiding power with respect to certain fraudulent transfers \xe2\x80\x9cincluding any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  By adding the same language to the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor, Congress ensured that the scope of the safe harbor matched the scope of the avoiding powers.  For example, a trustee seeking to avoid a preferential transfer under \xc2\xa7547 that was made \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of a creditor,\xe2\x80\x9d where that creditor is a covered entity under \xc2\xa7546(e), cannot now escape application of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor just because the transfer was not \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to\xe2\x80\x9d that entity.</p><p>Nothing in the amendment therefore changed the focus of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe-harbor inquiry on the transfer that is otherwise avoidable under the substantive avoiding powers.  If anything, by tracking language already included in the substantive avoidance provisions, the amendment reinforces the connection between the inquiry under \xc2\xa7546(e) and the otherwise avoidable transfer that the trustee seeks to set aside.</p><p>Merit next attempts to bolster its reading of the safe harbor by reference to the inclusion of securities clearing agencies as covered entities under \xc2\xa7546(e).  Because a securities clearing agency is defined as, <i>inter alia</i>, an intermediary in payments or deliveries made in connection with securities transactions, see15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778c(23)(A) and11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(48) (defining \xe2\x80\x9csecurities clearing agency\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), Merit argues that the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor must be read to protect intermediaries without reference to any beneficial interest in the transfer.  The contrary interpretation, Merit contends, \xe2\x80\x9cwould run afoul of the canon disfavoring an interpretation of a statute that renders a provision ineffectual or superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 25.</p><p>Putting aside the question whether a securities clearing agency always acts as an intermediary without a beneficial interest in a challenged transfer\xe2\x80\x94a question that the District Court in <i>Seligson</i> found presented triable issues of fact in that case\xe2\x80\x94the reading of the statute the Court adopts here does not yield any superfluity.  Reading \xc2\xa7546(e) to provide that the relevant transfer for purposes of the safe harbor is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under a substantive avoiding power, the question then becomes whether that transfer was \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d a covered entity, including a securities clearing agency.  If the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid was made \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d a securities clearing agency (as it was in <i>Seligson</i>), then \xc2\xa7546(e) will bar avoidance, and it will do so without regard to whether the entity acted only as an intermediary.  The safe harbor will, in addition, bar avoidance if the transfer was made \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d that securities clearing agency, even if it was not made \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d that entity.  This reading gives full effect to the text of \xc2\xa7546(e).</p><p>B</p><p>In a final attempt to support its proposed interpretation of \xc2\xa7546(e), Merit turns to what it perceives was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose in enacting the safe harbor.  Specifically, Merit contends that the broad language of \xc2\xa7546(e) shows that Congress took a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive approach to securities and commodities transactions\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwas prophylactic, not surgical,\xe2\x80\x9d and meant to \xe2\x80\x9cadvanc[e] the interests of parties in the finality of transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 41\xe2\x80\x9343.  Given that purported broad purpose, it would be incongruous, according to Merit, to read the safe harbor such that its application \xe2\x80\x9cwould depend on the identity of the investor and the manner in which it held its investment\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the transaction generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 33.  Moreover, Merit posits that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern was plainly broader than the risk that is posed by the imposition of avoidance liability on a securities industry entity because Congress provided a safe harbor not only for transactions \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d those entities (thus protecting the entities from direct financial liability), but also \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d these entities to non-covered entities.  See Reply Brief 10\xe2\x80\x9314.  And, according to Merit, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no reason to believe that Congress was troubled by the possibility that transfers <i>by </i>an industry hub could be unwound but yet was unconcerned about trustees\xe2\x80\x99 pursuit of transfers made <i>through</i> industry hubs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (emphasis in original).</p><p>Even if this were the type of case in which the Court would consider statutory purpose, see, <i>e.g., Watson</i> v. <i>Philip Morris Cos.</i>,551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 142\xe2\x80\x93152 (2007), here Merit fails to support its purposivist arguments.  In fact, its perceived purpose is actually contradicted by the plain language of the safe harbor.  Because, of course, here we do have a good reason to believe that Congress was concerned about transfers \xe2\x80\x9c<i>by</i> an industry hub\xe2\x80\x9d specifically: The safe harbor saves from avoidance certain securities transactions \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d covered entities.  See \xc2\xa7546(e).  Transfers \xe2\x80\x9cthrough\xe2\x80\x9d a covered entity, conversely, appear nowhere in the statute.  And although Merit complains that, absent its reading of the safe harbor, protection will turn \xe2\x80\x9con the identity of the investor and the manner in which it held its investment,\xe2\x80\x9d that is nothing more than an attack on the text of the statute, which protects only certain transactions \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x9d certain covered entities.</p><p>For these reasons, we need not deviate from the plain meaning of the language used in \xc2\xa7546(e).</p><p>IV</p><p>For the reasons stated, we conclude that the relevant transfer for purposes of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor is the same transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to its substantive avoiding powers.  Applying that understanding of the safe-harbor provision to this case yields a straightforward result.  FTI, the trustee, sought to avoid the $16.5 million Valley View-to-Merit transfer.  FTI did not seek to avoid the component transactions by which that overarching transfer was executed.  As such, when determining whether the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor saves the transfer from avoidance liability, <i>i.e., </i>whether it was \xe2\x80\x9cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\xc2\xa0) a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial institution,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court must look to the overarching transfer from Valley View to Merit to evaluate whether it meets the safe-harbor criteria.  Because the parties do not contend that either Valley View or Merit is a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution\xe2\x80\x9d or other covered entity, the transfer falls outside of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor.  The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is therefore affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p></p><p>It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Avoiding powers may be exercised by debtors, trustees, or creditors\xe2\x80\x99 committees, depending on the circumstances of the case.

The resolution of this case is not dependent on the identity of the actor exercising the avoiding power. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2">2</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as: \xe2\x80\x9c(A) a Federal reserve bank, or an entity that is a commercial or savings bank, industrial savings bank, savings and loan association, trust company, federally-insured credit union, or receiver, liquidating agent, or conservator for such entity and, when any such Federal reserve bank, receiver, liquidating agent, conservator or entity is acting as agent or custodian for a customer (whether or not a \xe2\x80\x98customer\xe2\x80\x99, as defined in section 741) in connection with a securities contract (as defined in section 741) such customer; or \xe2\x80\x9c(B) in connection with a securities contract (as defined in section 741) an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\xe2\x80\x9d11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(22). The parties here do not contend that either the debtor or petitioner in this case qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution\xe2\x80\x9d by virtue of its status as a \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101(22)(A).  Petitioner Merit Management Group, LP, discussed this definition only in footnotes and did not argue that it somehow dictates the outcome in this case.  See Brief for Petitioner 45, n.\xc2\xa014; Reply Brief 14, n.\xc2\xa06.  We therefore do not address what impact, if any, \xc2\xa7101(22)(A) would have in the application of the \xc2\xa7546(e) safe harbor. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T3">3</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0A separate provision of the agreement providing that Bedford Downs would sell land to Valley View for $20 million is not at issue in this case. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T4">4</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0In its complaint, FTI also sought to avoid the transfer under \xc2\xa7544(b).
