Second, Congress amended the provisions governing the registration requirements when an offender moves to a different State.  The original Wetterling Act had directed States to require a sex offender to \xe2\x80\x9cregister the new address with a designated law enforcement agency in another State <i>to which the person moves</i> not later than 10 days after such person establishes residence in the new State, if the new State has a registration requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714071(b)(5) (1994 ed.)

Although his offense predated SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Nichols was nevertheless required upon his eventual release in December 2011 to register as a sex offender in Kansas, where he chose to settle.  28 CFR 72.3 (2015).  Nichols complied with SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements\xe2\x80\x94until November 9, 2012, when he abruptly disconnected all of his telephone lines, deposited his apartment keys in his landlord\xe2\x80\x99s drop-box, and boarded a flight to Manila.  When Nichols was a no-show at mandatory sex-offender treatment, a warrant was issued revoking his supervised release.  With the assistance of American security forces, local police in Manila arrested Nichols in December 2012, and federal marshals then escorted him back to the United States, where he was charged with one count of \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly fail[ing] to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA],\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a)(3).  After unsuccessfully moving to dismiss the indictment on the ground that SORNA did not require him to update his registration in Kansas, Nichols conditionally pleaded guilty, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  775 F.\xc2\xa03d 1225 (2014).  Following its own precedent in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Murphy</i>, 664 F.\xc2\xa03d 798 (2011), the panel held that when a sex offender \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98leaves a residence in a state, and then leaves the state entirely, that state remains a jurisdiction involved\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa716913.  775 F.\xc2\xa03d<i>,</i> at 1229.  Over four dissenting votes, the court denied Nichols\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc.  784 F.\xc2\xa03d 666 (2015).  In adhering to <i>Murphy</i>, the Tenth Circuit reentrenched a split created by the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lunsford</i>, 725 F.\xc2\xa03d 859 (2013).  Remarkably, <i>Lunsford</i> also involved a sex offender who moved from the Kansas City area\xe2\x80\x94on the Missouri side\xe2\x80\x94to the Philippines.  Contra the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision below, <i>Lunsford</i> held that that defendant had no obligation to update his registration in Missouri because a sex offender is required \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98keep the registration current\xe2\x80\x99 in the jurisdiction where he \xe2\x80\x98resides,\xe2\x80\x99 not a jurisdiction where he \xe2\x80\x98resided.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 861 (citation omitted).  We granted certiorari to resolve the split.  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As noted, Nichols was required to \xe2\x80\x9cappear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of\xe2\x80\x9d his change of residence.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(c).  Subsection (a) mentions three possible jurisdictions: \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716913(a).  The Philippines is not a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d under SORNA; no foreign country is.  See \xc2\xa716911(10).  Putting these provisions together, SORNA therefore requires a sex offender who changes his residence to appear, within three business days of the change, in person in at least one jurisdiction (but not a foreign country) where he resides, works, or studies, and to inform that jurisdiction of the address change.  Critically, \xc2\xa716913(a) uses only the present tense: \xe2\x80\x9cresides,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis an employee,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis a student.\xe2\x80\x9d  A person who moves from Leavenworth to Manila no longer \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d (present tense) in Kansas; although he once <i>resided</i> in Kansas, after his move he \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d in the Philippines.  It follows that once Nichols moved to Manila, he was no longer required to appear in person in Kansas to update his registration, for Kansas was no longer a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a)\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa716913.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The requirement in \xc2\xa716913(c) to appear in person and register \xe2\x80\x9cnot later than 3 business days <i>after </i>each change of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. residence\xe2\x80\x9d points to the same conclusion.  Nichols could not have appeared in person in Kansas \xe2\x80\x9cafter\xe2\x80\x9d leaving the State.  To be sure, one may argue that the day before his departure was \xe2\x80\x9cnot later than 3 business days after\xe2\x80\x9d his departure, but no one in ordinary speech uses language in such a strained and hypertechnical way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the drafters of SORNA had thought about the problem of sex offenders who leave the country and had sought to require them to (de)register in the departure jurisdiction, they could easily have said so; indeed, that is exactly what the amended Wetterling Act had required.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714071(b)(5) (2000 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9creport the change of address to the responsible agency in the State the person is leaving\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is also what Kansas <i>state</i> law requires: Nichols had a duty to notify, among other entities, \xe2\x80\x9cthe registering law enforcement agency or agencies <i>where last registered</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x934905(g) (2014 Cum. Supp.) (emphasis added).  Congress could have chosen to retain the language in the amended Wetterling Act, or to adopt locution similar to that of the Kansas statute (and echoed in the statutes of many other States, cf. Brief for Petitioner 6, n.\xc2\xa01).  It did neither.  SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s plain text\xe2\x80\x94in particular, \xc2\xa716913(a)\xe2\x80\x99s consistent use of the present tense\xe2\x80\x94therefore did not require Nichols to update his registration in Kansas once he no longer resided there.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government resists this straightforward reading of the statutory text, arguing instead that once an offender registers in a jurisdiction, \xe2\x80\x9cthat jurisdiction necessarily <i>remains</i> \xe2\x80\x98involved pursuant to subsection (a),\xe2\x80\x99 because the offender continues to appear on its registry as a current resident.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 24.  But \xc2\xa716913(a) lists only three possibilities for an \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction: \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student.\xe2\x80\x9d  Notably absent is \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the offender appears on a registry.\xe2\x80\x9d  We decline the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to add an extra clause to the text of \xc2\xa716913(a).  As we long ago remarked in another context, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat the government asks is not a construction of a statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope.  To supply omissions transcends the judicial function.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Iselin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n270 U.\xc2\xa0S. 245,\n251 (1926)\n.  Just so here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Relatedly, the Government points out that among the pieces of information a sex offender must provide as part of his registration is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he address of each residence at which the sex offender resides <i>or will reside</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716914(a)(3) (emphasis added).  The use of the future tense, says the Government, shows that SORNA contemplates the possibility of an offender\xe2\x80\x99s updating his registration before actually moving.  But \xc2\xa716914(a) merely lists the pieces of information that a sex offender must provide if and when he updates his registration; it says nothing about whether the offender has an obligation to update his registration in the first place.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the Government argues that Nichols actually experienced not one but two \xe2\x80\x9cchanges\xe2\x80\x9d of residence\xe2\x80\x94the first when he \xe2\x80\x9cabandoned\xe2\x80\x9d his apartment in Leavenworth by turning in his keys, and the second when he checked into his hotel in Manila.  On the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, a sex offender\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresidence information will change when he leaves the place where he has been residing, and it will change again when he arrives at his new residence.  He must report both of those changes in a timely fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 21.  We think this argument too clever by half; when someone moves from, say, Kansas City, Kansas, to Kansas City, Missouri, we ordinarily would not say he moved twice: once from Kansas City, Kansas, to a state of homelessness, and then again from homelessness to Kansas City, Missouri.  Nor, were he to drive an RV between the cities, would we say that he changed his residence <i>four</i> times (from the house on the Kansas side of the Missouri River to a state of homelessness when he locks the door behind him; then to the RV when he climbs into the vehicle; then back to homelessness when he alights in the new house\xe2\x80\x99s driveway; and then, finally, to the new house in Missouri).  And what if he were to move from Kansas to California and spend several nights in hotels along the way?  Such ponderings cannot be the basis for imposing criminal punishment.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe interpret criminal statutes, like other statutes, in a manner consistent with ordinary English usage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abramski</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4); <i>Flores-Figueroa</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646,\n652 (2009)\n.
