It is a matter of great importance, therefore, that state supreme courts adhere to a correct interpretation of the legislation.  Here, the Oklahoma Supreme Court failed to do so.  By declaring the noncompetition agreements in two employment contracts null and void, rather than leaving that determination to the arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored a basic tenet of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive arbitration law.  The decision must be vacated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis dispute arises from a contract between petitioner Nitro-Lift Technologies, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C., and two of its former employees.  Nitro-Lift contracts with operators of oil and gas wells to provide services that enhance production. Respondents Eddie Lee Howard and Shane D. Schneider entered a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement with Nitro-Lift that contained the following arbitration clause:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Any dispute, difference or unresolved question between Nitro-Lift and the Employee (collectively the \xe2\x80\x9cDisputing Parties\xe2\x80\x9d) shall be settled by arbitration by a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Disputing Parties in an arbitration proceeding conducted in Houston, Texas in accordance with the rules existing at the date hereof of the American Arbitration Association.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 5.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tAfter working for Nitro-Lift on wells in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, respondents quit and began working for one of Nitro-Lift\xe2\x80\x99s competitors.  Claiming that respondents had breached their noncompetition agreements, Nitro-Lift served them with a demand for arbitration.  Respondents then filed suit in the District Court of Johnston County, Oklahoma, asking the court to declare the noncompetition agreements null and void and to enjoin their enforcement.  The court dismissed the complaint, finding that the contracts contained valid arbitration clauses under which an arbitrator, and not the court, must settle the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Oklahoma Supreme Court retained respondents\xe2\x80\x99 appeal and ordered the parties to show cause why the matter should not be resolved by application of Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, \xc2\xa7219A (West 2011), which limits the enforceability of noncompetition agreements.  Nitro-Lift argued that any dispute as to the contracts\xe2\x80\x99 enforceability was a question for the arbitrator.  It relied for support\xe2\x80\x94 as it had done before the trial court\xe2\x80\x94upon several of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases interpreting the FAA, and noted that under Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440, \n446 (2006)\n, \xe2\x80\x9cthis arbitration law applies in both state and federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record in No. 109,003 (Okla.), p. 273.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Oklahoma Supreme Court was not persuaded.  It held that despite the \xe2\x80\x9c[U.\xc2\xa0S.] Supreme Court cases on which the employers rely,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cexistence of an arbitration agreement in an employment contract does not prohibit judicial review of the underlying agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  2011 OK 98, \xc2\xb615, n.\xc2\xa020, \xc2\xb616, 273 P.\xc2\xa03d 20, 26, n.\xc2\xa020, 27.  For that proposition, the court relied on the \xe2\x80\x9cexhaustive overview of the United States Supreme Court decisions construing the Federal Arbitration Act\xe2\x80\x9d in Bruner v. Timberlane Manor Ltd. Partnership, 2006 OK 90, 155 P.\xc2\xa03d 16, which found Supreme Court jurisprudence \xe2\x80\x9cnot to inhibit our review of the underlying contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  273 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 26.  Finding the arbitration clauses no obstacle to its review, the court held that the noncompetition agreements were \xe2\x80\x9cvoid and unenforceable as against Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s public policy,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed in Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, \xc2\xa7219A.  273 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 27.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Oklahoma Supreme Court declared that its decision rests on adequate and independent state grounds.  Id., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, n.\xc2\xa05.  If that were so, we would have no jurisdiction over this case.  See Michigan v. Long, \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1032\n\xe2\x80\x931044 (1983).  It is not so, however, because the court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Oklahoma law was not \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it necessarily depended upon a rejection of the federal claim, which was both \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98properly presented to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98addressed by\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the state court.  Howell v. Mississippi, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440, \n443 (2005)\n (per curiam) (quoting Adams v. Robertson, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, \n86 (1997)\n (per curiam)).  Nitro-Lift claimed that the arbitrator should decide the contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity, and raised a federal-law basis for that claim by relying on Supreme Court cases construing the FAA.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Howell, supra, at 444 (quoting Baldwin v. Reese, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, \n32 (2004)\n; emphasis added).  The Oklahoma Supreme Court acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied, as well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount these controlling decisions.  Its conclusion that, despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence, the underlying contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity is purely a matter of state law for state-court deter-mination is all the more reason for this Court to assert jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Oklahoma Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision disregards this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents on the FAA.  That Act, which \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d Southland Corp. v. Keating, \n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n10 (1984)\n, provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  It is well settled that  \xe2\x80\x9cthe substantive law the Act created [is] applicable in state and federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Southland Corp., supra, at 12; see also Buckeye, supra, at 446.  And when parties commit to arbitrate contractual disputes, it is a mainstay of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive law that attacks on the validity of the contract, as distinct from attacks on the validity of the arbitration clause itself, are to be resolved \xe2\x80\x9cby the arbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Preston v. Ferrer, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346, \n349 (2008)\n; see also Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395 (1967)\n.  For these purposes, an \xe2\x80\x9carbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckeye, supra, at 445, and its validity is subject to initial court determination; but the validity of the remainder of the contract (if the arbitration provision is valid) is for the arbitrator to decide.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis principle requires that the decision below be va-cated.  The trial court found that the contract contained a valid arbitration clause, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court did not hold otherwise.  It nonetheless assumed the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s role by declaring the noncompetition agreements null and void.  The state court insisted that its \xe2\x80\x9c[own] jurisprudence controls this issue\xe2\x80\x9d and permits review of a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract submitted to arbitration where one party assert[s] that the underlying agreement [is] void and unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  273 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 26.  But the Oklahoma Supreme Court must abide by the FAA, which is \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme Law of the Land,\xe2\x80\x9d U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02, and by the opinions of this Court interpreting that law.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to say what a statute means, and once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to respect that understanding of the governing rule of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298, \n312 (1994)\n.  Our cases hold that the FAA forecloses precisely this type of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial hostility towards arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe state court reasoned that Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s statute \xe2\x80\x9caddressing the validity of covenants not to compete, must govern over the more general statute favoring arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  273 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 26, n.\xc2\xa021.  But the ancient interpretive principle that the specific governs the general (generalia specialibus non derogant) applies only to conflict between laws of equivalent dignity.  Where a specific statute, for example, conflicts with a general constitutional provision, the latter governs.  And the same is true where a specific state statute conflicts with a general federal statute.  There is no general-specific exception to the Supremacy Clause, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const. Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[W]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (quoting AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, supra, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937)).  Hence, it is for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance whether the covenants not to compete are valid as a matter of applicable state law.
