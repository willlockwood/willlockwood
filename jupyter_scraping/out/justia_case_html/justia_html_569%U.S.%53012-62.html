Florida, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 423\n.  There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the petitioner was sentenced under Florida\xe2\x80\x99s new sentencing guidelines, which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place at the time of his crime.  The pre-existing guidelines would have required the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been reviewable on appeal.  But under the new guidelines, a sentence within the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.  Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sentence.  Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a significant risk of a higher sentence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines.  Normally, a \xe2\x80\x9cjudge will use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and impose a sentence within the range.\xe2\x80\x9d  Freeman v. United States, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  That the court may impose a sentence outside that range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing.  Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for reasonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark.  Appellate courts may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v. United States, \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338\n, and may \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the extent of the deviation\xe2\x80\x9d from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness review, Gall, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.  The sentencing regime also puts in place procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a non-Guidelines sentence less likely.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s scheme and the federal regime differ, but those differences are not dispositive.  Common sense indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evidence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect.  A retrospective increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  Its principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the status of a \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Changes in law need not bind a sentencing authority for there to be an ex\xc2\xa0post facto violation, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he presence of discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253.  As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two systems is one in degree, not in kind.  The attributes of post-Booker sentencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.  Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with post-Booker \n \nSixth Amendment cases.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment cases, which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant risk\xe2\x80\x9d of a higher sentence.  The Booker remedy was designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a \n \nSixth Amendment violation.  Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall.

We consider here whether there is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.  We hold that there is.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Marvin Peugh and his cousin, Steven Holle- well, ran two farming-related businesses in Illinois.  Grainery, Inc., bought, stored, and sold grain; Agri-Tech, Inc., provided farming services to landowners and tenants.  When the Grainery began experiencing cash-flow problems, Peugh and Hollewell engaged in two fraudulent schemes.  First, they obtained a series of bank loans by representing falsely the existence of contracts for future grain deliveries from Agri-Tech to the Grainery.  When they failed to pay back the principal on these loans, the bank suffered losses of over $2 million.  Second, they ar- tificially inflated the balances of accounts under their con- trol by \xe2\x80\x9ccheck kiting,\xe2\x80\x9d or writing bad checks between their accounts.  This scheme allowed them to overdraw an account by $471,000.  They engaged in their illicit conduct in 1999 and 2000.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen their acts were uncovered, Peugh and Hollewell were charged with nine counts of bank fraud, in violation of \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344.  While Hollewell pleaded guilty to one count of check kiting, Peugh pleaded not guilty and went to trial, where he testified that he had not intended to defraud the banks.  The jury found him guilty of five counts of bank fraud and acquitted him of the remaining counts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt sentencing, Peugh argued that the Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998 version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of his offenses, rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time of sentencing.  The two versions yielded significantly different results for Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s applicable Guidelines sentencing range.  Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s base offense level was 6.  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72F1.1 (Nov. 1998) (USSG).  Thirteen levels were added for a loss amount of over $2.5 million, ibid., and 2 levels for obstruction of justice because of Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s perjury at trial, see USSG \xc2\xa73C1.1 (Nov. 1998). The total offense level under the 1998 Guidelines was therefore 19.  As a first-time offender, Peugh was in Criminal History Category I, and so his sentencing range under the 1998 Guidelines was 30 to 37 months.  USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1998).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 2009 Guidelines in effect when Peugh was sentenced in May 2010 assigned more severe consequences to his acts.  First, the base offense level was raised from 6 to 7 for crimes, like Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s, that have a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more.  See USSG \xc2\xa72B1.1 (Nov. 2009); \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344.  Second, the enhancement for a loss exceeding $2.5 million was 18, a 5-level increase from the 1998 Guidelines.  USSG 2B1.1 (Nov. 2009).  After adding the 2-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s total offense level under the 2009 Guidelines was 27.  With a Criminal History Cate- gory of I, Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing range rose under the 2009 Guidelines to 70 to 87 months.  USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 2009).  The low end of the 2009 Guidelines range was 33 months higher than the high end of the 1998 Guidelines range.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the sentencing hearing, the District Court rejected Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s argument that applying the 2009 Guidelines vio- lated the Ex Post Facto Clause, noting that it was foreclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent.  App. 30 (discussing United States v. Demaree, 459 F.\xc2\xa03d 791 (2006)).  The District Court declined to give Peugh a downward variance, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9ca sentence within the [G]uideline[s] range is the most appropriate sentence in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 100.

To address this problem, Congress created the United States Sentencing Commission.  Mistretta v. United States, \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361\n\xe2\x80\x93367 (1989).  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, \n\n98Stat.\n1987, eliminated parole in the federal system and directed the Sentencing Commission to promulgate uniform guidelines that would be binding on federal courts at sentencing.  Mistretta, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 367.  The Commission produced the now familiar Sentencing Guidelines: a system under which a set of inputs specific to a given case (the particular characteristics of the offense and offender) yielded a predetermined output (a range of months within which the defendant could be sentenced).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn United States v. Booker, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220, \n244 (2005)\n, however, this Court held that mandatory Guidelines ran afoul of the \n \nSixth Amendment by allowing judges to find facts that increased the penalty for a crime beyond \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also Apprendi v. New Jersey, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466, \n490 (2000)\n.  The appropriate remedy for this violation, the Court determined, was to strike those portions of the Sentencing Reform Act that rendered the Guidelines mandatory.  Booker, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 245\xe2\x80\x93258.  Under the resulting scheme, a district court is still required to consult the Guidelines.

On the one hand, we have never accepted the proposition that a law must increase the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible in order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See, e.g., Lindsey v. Washington, \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 397 (1937)\n.  More- over, the fact that the sentencing authority exercises some measure of discretion will also not defeat an ex post facto claim.  See Garner v. Jones, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244, \n253 (2000)\n.  On the other hand, we have made it clear that mere speculation or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively increase the punishment for a crime will not suffice to establish a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 499, \n509 (1995)\n.  The touchstone of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 250 (quoting Morales, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 509).  The question when a change in law creates such a risk is \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of degree\xe2\x80\x9d; the test cannot be reduced to a \xe2\x80\x9csingle formula.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 509 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe most relevant of our prior decisions for assessing whether the requisite degree of risk is present here is Miller v. Florida, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 423 (1987)\n, in which this Court considered an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing guidelines scheme implemented by the State of Florida.  Under Florida\xe2\x80\x99s system, a calculation under the guidelines yielded a presumptive sentencing range.  Id., at 426.  This range was assumed to be appropriate, and the sentencing judge had discretion to fix a sentence within that range \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98without the requirement of a written explanation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(8) (1983)). If the court wished to depart from the guidelines range, however, it was required to give \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing reasons in writing for doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 426.  A within-guidelines sentence was unreviewable; a non-guidelines sentence was subject to appellate review.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petitioner in Miller had been sentenced under new guidelines that yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines that had been in place at the time of his crime, and he had received a sentence at the top of the new range.  Ibid.  This Court found an ex post facto violation.  We emphasized that in order to impose the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence under the pre-existing guidelines, the sentenc- ing judge would have been required to provide clear and convincing reasons in writing for the departure, and the sentence would then have been reviewable on appeal.  Id., at 432.  In contrast, because the sentence imposed was within the new guidelines range, it required no explanation and was unreviewable.  Id., at 432\xe2\x80\x93433.  The fact that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines \xe2\x80\x9ccreate[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before discretion can be exercised\xe2\x80\x9d was sufficient to render the changed guidelines an ex post facto law.  Id., at 435.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMiller thus establishes that applying amended sentencing guidelines that increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion to deviate from the recommended sentencing range.  The sentencing scheme in Miller was designed to channel sen- tences for similarly situated offenders into a specified range.  Its reason-giving requirements and standards of appellate review meant that while variation was possible, it was burdensome; and so in the ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sentence.  Under the Florida system, therefore, an increase in the guidelines range applicable to an offender created a significant risk that he would receive a higher sentence.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The same principles apply here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe post-Booker federal sentencing scheme aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines and that they remain a meaningful benchmark through the process of appellate review.  See Kimbrough, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 107.  As we have described, \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict courts must begin their analysis with the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gall, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50, n.\xc2\xa06 (emphasis added).  Failing to calculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes procedural error.  Id., at 51.

United States, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5).  Even if the sentencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, \xe2\x80\x9cif the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  See also id., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2) (stating that outside the context of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cin the normal course the district judge\xe2\x80\x99s calculation of the Guidelines range applicable to the charged offenses will serve as the basis for the term of imprisonment imposed\xe2\x80\x9d).  That a district court may ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the Guidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing.  Indeed, the rule that an incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error en- sures that they remain the starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, appellate review for reasonableness using the Guidelines as a benchmark helps promote uniformity by \xe2\x80\x9ctend[ing] to iron out sentencing differences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Booker, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 263.  Courts of appeals may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 347, and they may further \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the extent of the deviation\xe2\x80\x9d from the Guidelines as part of their reason- ableness review, Gall, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.  As in Miller, then, the post-Booker sentencing regime puts in place proce- dural \xe2\x80\x9churdle[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that, in practice, make the imposition of a non-Guidelines sentence less likely.  See 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is a more difficult case than Miller, because there are relevant differences between Florida\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing scheme and the current federal sentencing regime.  The Florida Legislature had made a within-guidelines sentence unreviewable; whereas in the federal system, the courts of appeals may\xe2\x80\x94but are not required to\xe2\x80\x94presume that a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable.  And under Florida\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, a sentencing court departing from the guideline range was required to provide \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d reasons for the departure; whereas this Court has not, post-Booker, applied such an exacting across-the-board standard of review to variances.  Rather, we have held that a district court varying from the Federal Guidelines should provide an explanation adequate to the extent of the departure.  See Gall, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut contrary to the arguments advanced by the Government and Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 dissent (hereinafter dissent), see Brief for United States 23\xe2\x80\x9324; post, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, these differences are not dispositive.  Although the federal system\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rules establish gentler checks on the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion than Florida\xe2\x80\x99s did, they nevertheless impose a series of requirements on sentencing courts that cabin the exercise of that discretion.  Common sense indicates that in general, this system will steer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPeugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicating that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended effect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.  Even after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases imposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences that depart downward from the Guidelines on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  See United States Sentencing Commission, 2011 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, p. 63 (Figure G) (16th ed.) (USSC).  In less than one-fifth of cases since 2007 have district courts imposed above- or below-Guidelines sentences absent a Government motion.  See ibid.  See also Baron-Evans &amp; Stith, Booker Rules, 160 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1631, 1677 (2012).  Moreover, the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s data indicate that when a Guidelines range moves up or down, offenders\xe2\x80\x99 sentences move with it.  See USSC, Final Quarterly Data Report, FY 2012, p. 32 (Figure C); USSC, Report on the Continuing Impact of United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing, Pt.

The Framers considered ex post facto laws to be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to the first principles of the social compact and to every principle of sound legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 44, p. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).  The Clause ensures that individuals have fair warning of applicable laws and guards against vindictive legislative action.  See Weaver v. Graham, \n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 24\n\xe2\x80\x9329 (1981); see also post, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  Even where these concerns are not directly implicated, however, the Clause also safeguards \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental fairness interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in having the government abide by the rules of law it establishes to govern the cir-cumstances under which it can deprive a person of his or her liberty or life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carmell, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 533.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sentencing Guidelines represent the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative view of the appropriate sentences for specific crimes.  When Peugh committed his crime, the recommended sentence was 30 to 37 months.  When he was sentenced, it was 70 to 87 months.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he purpose and effect of the change in [the Guidelines calculation] was to increase the rates and length of incarceration for [fraud].\xe2\x80\x9d  Miller, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 431 (citing Florida Bar: Amendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988\xe2\x80\x94Sentencing Guidelines), 451 So.\xc2\xa02d 824, 824, n. (1984) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Such a retrospective increase in the measure of punishment raises clear ex post facto concerns.  We have previously recognized, for instance, that a defendant charged with an increased punishment for his crime is likely to feel enhanced pressure to plead guilty.  See Carmell, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 534, n. 24; Weaver, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32.  This pressure does not disappear simply because the Guidelines range is advisory; the defendant will be aware that the range is intended to, and usually does, exert controlling influence on the sentence that the court will impose.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe are therefore not persuaded by the argument advanced by the Government and also suggested by the dissent that the animating principles of the Ex Post Facto Clause are not implicated by this case.  While the Government argues that the Sentencing Commission is insulated from legislative interference, see Brief for United States 42\xe2\x80\x9344, our precedents make clear that the coverage of the Ex Post Facto Clause is not limited to legislative acts, see Garner, 529 U. S., at 247, 257 (recognizing that a change in a parole board\xe2\x80\x99s rules could, given an adequate showing, run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause).  It is true that we held, in Irizarry v. United States, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 708\n\xe2\x80\x93714 (2008), that a defendant does not have an \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation subject to due process protection\xe2\x80\x9d that he will be sentenced within the Guidelines range.  But, contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, see post, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313, the Ex Post Facto Clause does not merely protect reliance interests.  It also reflects principles of \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carmell, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s principal argument that there is no constitutional violation in this case is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the sta- tus of a \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Whereas the pre-Booker Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] the force and effect of laws,\xe2\x80\x9d Booker, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 234, the post-Booker Guidelines, the Government contends, have lost that status due to their advisory nature.

So, for example, a law can run afoul of the Clause even if it does not alter the statutory maximum punishment attached to a crime.  In Lindsey v. Washington, \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 397\n, this Court considered an ex post facto challenge to a Washington law altering the statutory penalty for grand larceny from a range of 0 to 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment to a mandatory term of 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  Although the upper boundary of the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s power to punish remained unchanged, it was enough that the petitioners were \xe2\x80\x9cdeprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would give them freedom from custody and control prior to the expiration of the 15-year term.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 402 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition, our cases make clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he presence of discretion does not displace the protections of the Ex Post Facto Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253.  In a series of cases, for example, this Court has considered the validity under the Ex Post Facto Clause of state laws altering the terms on which discretionary parole or early release was available to prisoners.  See Garner, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n; Morales, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 499\n; Weaver, \n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 24\n.  Although these cases reached differing conclusions with respect to whether there was an ex post facto violation, in none of them did we indicate that the mere fact that the prisoner was not guaranteed parole but rather received it at the will of the parole board was fatal to his claim.  See Garner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253; Morales, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 508\xe2\x80\x93510, and n.\xc2\xa06; Weaver, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government does not challenge these holdings but rather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise to an ex post facto violation.  It contrasts the Sentenc- ing Guidelines with the Florida system at issue in Miller, which, the Government indicates, really did place \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial legislative constraint on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of sentencing discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 21.  But as we have explained at length, the difference between the federal system and the scheme the Court considered in Miller is one in degree, not in kind.  The Florida system did not achieve its \xe2\x80\x9cbinding legal effect,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 22, by mandating a within-guidelines sentence in every case.  Rather, it achieved its \xe2\x80\x9cbinding legal effect\xe2\x80\x9d through a set of procedural rules and standards for appellate review that, in combination, encouraged district courts to sentence within the guidelines.  See Miller, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 432\xe2\x80\x93433.  We have detailed all of the ways in which the federal sentencing regime after Booker does the same.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government elaborates its argument that the Sentencing Guidelines do not have adequate legal force to constitute an ex post facto violation by reviewing the various features of the post-Booker sentencing regime that, in its view, tend to render the Guidelines purely advisory.  As we have noted, district courts may not presume that a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable; they may \xe2\x80\x9cin appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views,\xe2\x80\x9d Pepper, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 23); and all sentences are reviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.

On the Government\xe2\x80\x99s account, the Guidelines are just one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court can consult, no different from a \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy paper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 28.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that district courts are not required to consult any policy paper in order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must they \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the extent of [their] deviation\xe2\x80\x9d from a given policy paper and \xe2\x80\x9censure that the justification is suffi- ciently compelling to support the degree of the variance,\xe2\x80\x9d Gall, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50.  Courts of appeals, in turn, are not permitted to presume that a sentence that comports with a particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of appeals, in considering whether the district court\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure from a given policy paper in determining whether the district court abused its discretion, see id., at 51.  It is simply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are merely a volume that the district court reads with academic interest in the course of sentencing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, as the Government and the dissent point out, notwithstanding a rule that retrospective application of a higher Guidelines range violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, sentencing courts will be free to give careful consideration to the current version of the Guidelines as representing the most recent views of the agency charged by Congress with developing sentencing policy.  See post, at 8 (citing Demaree, 459 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 795).  But this does not render our holding \xe2\x80\x9cpurely semantic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 795.  District courts must begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense and use them to calculate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines will anchor both the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion and the appellate review process in all of the ways we have described.  The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the status of one of many reasons a district court might give for deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is simply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Finally, the Government contends that a rule that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated by the application of an increased Guidelines range would be in tension with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s post-Booker cases and, indeed, would \xe2\x80\x9clargely undo .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Booker remedy\xe2\x80\x9d for the \n \nSixth Amendment violation found there.  Brief for United States 35.  If the Guidelines are binding enough to trigger an ex post facto violation, the argument goes, then they must be binding enough to trigger a \n \nSixth Amendment violation as well.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument assumes that the \n \nSixth Amendment and the Ex Post Facto Clause share a common boundary; that only where judge-found facts are the basis of a higher sentence in a manner that raises \n \nSixth Amendment concerns can a set of sentencing rules be sufficiently determinate to run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  But the \n \nSixth Amendment and Ex Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct.  Our \n \nSixth Amendment cases have focused on when a given finding of fact is required to make a defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty.  Our ex post facto cases, in contrast, have focused on whether a change in law creates a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant risk\xe2\x80\x9d of a higher sentence; here, whether a sentence in conformity with the new Guidelines is substantially likely.  The Booker remedy was designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this distinction: it is intended to promote sentencing uniformity while avoiding a \n \nSixth Amendment violation.  In light of the statistics invoked by petitioner, see supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, it appears so far to be achieving this balance.  Nothing that we say today \xe2\x80\x9cundo[es]\xe2\x80\x9d the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe arguments put forward by the Government and the dissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh\xe2\x80\x99s case falls within Calder\xe2\x80\x99s third category of ex post facto violations.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [government] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering the substantive \xe2\x80\x98formula\xe2\x80\x99 used to calculate the applicable sentencing range.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morales, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 505.

Doing so created a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant risk\xe2\x80\x9d of a higher sentence for Peugh, Garner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251, and offended \xe2\x80\x9cone of the principal interests that the Ex Post Facto Clause was designed to serve, fundamental justice,\xe2\x80\x9d Carmell, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*Justice Kennedy joins this opinion except as to Part III\xe2\x80\x93C.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Compare United States v.

Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.).  Under our precedents, the relevant inquiry for determining whether a law \xe2\x80\x9cinflicts a greater punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d is whether the \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive application of the change in [the] law created \xe2\x80\x98a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner v.

The retroactive application of subsequently amended Guidelines does not create a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient risk\xe2\x80\x9d of increasing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s punishment for two reasons.  First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion of district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  Second, to the extent that the amended Guidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive a harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 persuasive force, not any legal effect.  The Guidelines help district judges to impose sentences that comply with \xc2\xa73553(a).  The risk of an increased sentence is, in essence, the risk of a more accurate sentence\xe2\x80\x94i.e., a sentence more in line with the statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x99s penological goals.  Guideline changes that help district courts achieve such pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create a risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose if district courts consider the \xe2\x80\x9crange established\xe2\x80\x9d by the Guidelines, \xc2\xa73553(a)(4).  For this reason, district courts must \xe2\x80\x9cbegin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 49.  But the fact that courts must give due consideration to the recommendation expressed in the correct Guidelines does not mean that the Guidelines constrain the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to impose an appropriate sentence; it simply means that district courts must consider the correct vari-ables before exercising their discretion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit district court discretion because sentences falling outside the Guidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive unreasonableness.  Brief for Petitioner 25.  I doubt, however, that reversal is a likely outcome when a district judge can justify his sentence based on agreement with either of two Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94the old or the new.  If a dis- trict court calculated the sentencing range under the new Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a below-Guidelines sentence that fell within the range provided by the old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such a sentence \xe2\x80\x9csubstantively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  To do so would cast doubt on every within-Guidelines sentence issued un-der the old Guidelines.  Similarly, it is hard to imagine that a court of appeals would reverse a sentence for substantive unreasonableness if it was above the range of the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense but fell within the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines.  This case provides an apt example.  After considering all of the \xc2\xa73553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that a sentence within the amended Guidelines range was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most appropriate sentence in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 100.  The same sentence would undoubtedly be upheld on appeal if the District Court, on remand, once again determined that a sentence within the amended Guidelines was appropriate in light of all the facts.  The essential point is that once new Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness review does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of district courts to sentence offenders within either of the two ranges.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority argues that our opinion in Miller v. Flor-ida, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 423 (1987)\n, supports its conclusion that retroactive application of advisory Guidelines violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But Miller leads to the opposite conclusion.  There, Florida superimposed narrowed presumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory sentencing ranges for particular crimes.  482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 425\xe2\x80\x93426.  If a judge imposed a sentence within that narrower presumptive range, he did not need to give a written explanation of his reasons for selecting that sentence, and the sentence was not subject to appellate review.  Ibid.  If the judge imposed a sentence outside the presumptive range, however, he was required to provide \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear and convincing reasons,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 426 (quoting Fla.

In concluding that retroactive application of this scheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, we reasoned that the Florida guidelines did not \xe2\x80\x9csimply provide flexible \xe2\x80\x98guideposts\xe2\x80\x99 for use in the exercise of discretion: instead, they create[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before discretion c[ould] be exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 435.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court cites Miller for the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat applying amended sentencing guidelines that increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion to deviate from the recommended sentencing range.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  But that claim is not supported by Miller.  The guidelines in Miller violated the Ex Post Facto Clause precisely because they constrained the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such thing.  Indeed, our post-Booker opinions have made abundantly clear that the Guidelines do not create a \xe2\x80\x9chigh hurdle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 or any hurdle at all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat must be cleared before discretion can be exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  Miller, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435.

But, the Guidelines do this by helping district courts impose sentences that are consistent with \xc2\xa73553(a).  It is difficult to see how an advi-sory Guideline, designed to lead courts to impose sentences more in line with fixed statutory objectives, could ever constitute an ex\xc2\xa0post facto violation.

Rita, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 348; see also \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(b)(1)(A).  In crafting the Guidelines, the Commission began with \xe2\x80\x9can empirical examination of 10,000 presentence reports setting forth what judges had done in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rita, supra, at 349 (citing United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa71A1.1, comment., n.\xc2\xa03 (Nov. 2006) (USSG)).  The Commission then \xe2\x80\x9cmodif[ied] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rita, supra, at 349.  While an individual judge has limited experience upon which to draw, the Commission \xe2\x80\x9chas the capacity . . . to base its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kimbrough v.

It consults with \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutors, defenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology, and others,\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that the Guidelines continue to further \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s goals.  Rita, supra, at 350; see also Booker, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 263 (noting that the Commission would \xe2\x80\x9cmodify its Guidelines in light of what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be better sentencing practices\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of this extensive study, amendments to the Guidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better comport with the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors.  If the Commission has fulfilled its mission of recommending sentences that are generally consistent with \xc2\xa73553(a)(2), then sentences should fall within the Guidelines range most of the time.  This, in part, explains why within-Guidelines sentences are presumed, on appeal, to reflect a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary decision\xe2\x80\x9d by the district court that \xe2\x80\x9caccords with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rita, supra, at 351.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAgain, this case furnishes a ready example.  Prior to pe-titioner\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cto consider\xe2\x80\x9d whether fraud guidelines were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sufficient to deter and punish\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d particular offenses, in light of increases to statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes other than bank fraud.  USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason for Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002, \xc2\xa7905(b)(2), \n\n116Stat.\n805).  This produced amended Guidelines, which were based on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s further assessment of \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic crime issues over a number of years.\xe2\x80\x9d  USSG App. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2001).  With an amended Guidelines sentencing range, the District Court concluded that a within-Guidelines sentence was \xe2\x80\x9cthe most appropriate sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 100.  Neither the statutory sentencing range nor \xc2\xa73553(a) changed between the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s offense and sentencing.  Thus, it is quite incorrect to say that reliance on information reflected in the amended Guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is underscored by the fact that even the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding\xe2\x80\x94which requires district courts to calculate the Guidelines range in effect at the time of the offense\xe2\x80\x94will not eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d of a higher sentence.  The district judge remains free to consider the range produced by the amended Guidelines.  See Demaree, 459 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 795 (\xe2\x80\x9cA judge is certainly entitled to take advice from the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the mere fact that new Guidelines have been promulgated creates some risk of an increased sentence, even if district courts are required to calculate the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense.  Petitioner has presented no evidence indicating what portion of the risk of an increased sentence flows from the retroactive application of the amended Guidelines and what portion flows from their very existence.  In the absence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory Guidelines could be ex post facto laws, which I do not, I would not find the \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d of an increased sentence created by the retroactive application of the Guidelines to be \xe2\x80\x9csuf-ficient\xe2\x80\x9d for ex post facto purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s opinion also demonstrates the unworkability of our ex post facto jurisprudence.  Under our current precedent, whenever a change in the law creates a \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d of an increased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is \xe2\x80\x9csufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d see Morales, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 509, or sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98significant,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d see ante, at 19, to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Our analysis under that test has devolved into little more than an exercise in judicial intuition.  I would return to the original meaning of the Clause as stated in Justice Chase\xe2\x80\x99s classic Calder formulation, under which laws of this sort are ex post facto only when they retro-actively increase the punishment \xe2\x80\x9cannexed to the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Dall., at 390.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court addressed the Ex Post Facto Clause a mere decade after the Constitution was ratified.  In Calder, Justice Chase described four types of ex post facto laws.  3 Dall., at 390.  As relevant, Justice Chase\xe2\x80\x99s third category indicated that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\xe2\x80\x9d violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Ibid.  Justice Chase\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on increases in the punishment \xe2\x80\x9cannexed to the crime\xe2\x80\x9d was grounded in the English common law and accurately reflected the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, infra.  Unfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated from this formulation.  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Kring v. Missouri, \n\n107 U.\xc2\xa0S. 221 (1883)\n, the Court declared that \xe2\x80\x9cany law passed after the commission of an offence which . . . \xe2\x80\x98in relation to that offence, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage,\xe2\x80\x99 is an ex post facto law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 235 (quoting Justice Washington\xe2\x80\x99s jury charge in United States v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (CC Pa. 1809) (emphasis added).  It took nearly a century for the Court to decide that Kring\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeparture from Calder\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause was .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unjustified.\xe2\x80\x9d  Collins v.

While Morales avoided the over-breadth of Kring\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisadvantage the de-fendant\xe2\x80\x9d test, it failed to reconnect our ex post facto ju-risprudence to the original understanding of the term.*  The \xe2\x80\x9csufficient risk\xe2\x80\x9d test also depends upon empirical analysis that cannot yield determinative answers and which courts are ill equipped to handle.  See, e.g., Gar- ner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the rule does not by its own terms show a significant risk, the respondent must demonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule\xe2\x80\x99s practical implementation by the agency charged with exercising discretion, that its retroactive application will result in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier rule\xe2\x80\x9d).  More fundamentally, the \xe2\x80\x9csufficient risk\xe2\x80\x9d test, like the \xe2\x80\x9cdisadvantage the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d test, wrongly focuses on the particular sentence that the defendant might receive, rather than on the punishment \xe2\x80\x9cannexed to the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe practical difficulties with the test are apparent even from our application in Morales, where we considered an amendment to California\xe2\x80\x99s parole procedures that allowed, under certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to decrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings.  Under the sufficient risk test, we were compelled to speculate about the possible effects of the new law on various individuals\xe2\x80\x99 prison terms.  Ultimately, we held that the amendment did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow class of prisoners covered by the amendment [could not] reasonably expect that their prospects for early release on parole would be enhanced by the opportunity of annual hearings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morales, supra, at 512.  But nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post Facto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expectations that prisoners and defendants have about how many days they will spend in prison.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the Latin phrase \xe2\x80\x98ex post facto\xe2\x80\x99 literally encompasses any law passed \xe2\x80\x98after the fact,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Collins, 497 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 41, the Court has long recognized that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwas a term of art with an established meaning\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the founding.  Ibid.  Blackstone offers the first key to understanding this \xe2\x80\x9cestablished meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  He explic-itly opposed laws that rendered innocent conduct crimi- nal after the fact.  See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *44 (hereinafter Blackstone).  Such laws deprive citizens of notice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to man\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creason and freewill.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *39; see id., at *46.  Blackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate.  Id., at *44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]x post facto laws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation\xe2\x80\x9d).  For this reason, ex post facto laws have rightly been described as \xe2\x80\x9cformidable instruments of tyranny,\xe2\x80\x9d id., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton), and their prohibition a \xe2\x80\x9cbulwark in favour of the personal security of the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d Calder, supra, at 390 (opinion of Chase, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough Blackstone confined his discussion of ex post facto laws to those laws retroactively declaring innocent acts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws retroactively increasing the punishment were also understood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding.  See, e.g., 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View of the Laws of England, as treated in a Course of Vinerian Lectures 638 (1792) (discussing \xe2\x80\x9cacts of parliament, which principally affect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law\xe2\x80\x9d); 3 J.

Justice Chase\xe2\x80\x99s formulation reflects this understanding.  Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\xe2\x80\x9d is ex post facto).  Under this view, courts must compare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time of the offense with the punishment affixed at the time of sentencing.  If the latter is harsher than the former, the court must apply the punishment in effect at the time of the offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt common law, it was quite easy to identify when a law retroactively increased the punishment, because the criminal law generally \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed a particular sentence for each offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France, Germany 1700\xe2\x80\x931900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa ed. 1987).  In a world of determinate sentencing, a retro-active increase in the punishment affixed to a crime rend-ers an act \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed,\xe2\x80\x9d Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for an ex post facto violation.  The key point is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ex post facto [C]lause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed by a statute, rather than to the sentence actually imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lindsey v.

See Ross\xe2\x80\x99 Case, 19 Mass. 165, 170 (1824) (\xe2\x80\x9cA party ought to know, at the time of committing the offence, the whole extent of the punishment; for it may sometimes be a matter of calculation, whether he will commit the offence, considering the severity of the punishment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because increasing the punishment affixed to the crime deprives people of the opportunity to plan their conduct in light of the law, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems to come within the same mischief as the creation of a crime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed together.\xe2\x80\x9d  Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRetroactive laws that merely create a risk that a defendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not implicate traditional ex post facto concerns.  An individual contemplating the commission of a given offense knows he may be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed range.  He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he may even have good reasons for expecting leniency.  But he does not have any guarantees.  See Garner, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258 (Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cDiscretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the sentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of the risks that the offender knowingly assumes\xe2\x80\x9d).  The law provides the defendant with only one assurance: He will be sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by statute.  Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a particular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not deprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the concerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe statutory range in effect at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s offense remained in effect at his sentencing.  The Guidelines sentencing range is not the punishment affixed to the offense.  See in Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, supra.  Accordingly, sentencing petitioner under the amended Guidelines did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Because the Court concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was an error to which I succumbed.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970679">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x9362\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tMARVIN PEUGH, PETITIONER v.
