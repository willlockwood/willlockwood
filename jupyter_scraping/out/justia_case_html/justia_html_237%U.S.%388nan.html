The complainant accordingly asked that the writing of June 10th be annulled, the oral contract be declared in force, and, in harmony therewith, judgment for $18,020.12.</p>\n<p>The Export &amp; Import Lumber Company denied the allegations in the complaint except as specifically admitted, but said the written contract of June 10th was in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 237 U. S. 390</a></p><p> force and $2,500 had been paid thereunder and accepted by complainant.  It further set up that, by the contract of May 6th, it became obligated to furnish the China Import &amp; Export Lumber Company designated logs within a specified time; on June 10th, it transferred this duty to the complainant, which failed fully to comply therewith, and, as a consequence, $8,750 had to be deducted from the sale price which otherwise would have been received.  It therefore claimed damages to that extent, and asked judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p>Counsel admitted of record that 32,032 cubic feet of logs were delivered by complainant to the China Import &amp; Export Lumber Company, and unquestionably appellant collected therefor 90 cents per foot, $28,828.80, less $8,750.</p>\n<p>The court below held (26 Phil.Rep. 602; 27 Phil.Rep. ___) the contract of June 10th was procured by fraud; the rights of the parties depended upon the oral agreement; the deduction of $8,750 from stipulated sale price should be taken into consideration; complainant was entitled to its expenses of $7,211.43, and that the balance of amount actually collected by appellant should be equally divided.  A certain credit of $450, explanation of which is now unnecessary, having been allowed, judgment was entered April 3, 1914, against appellant for $13,195.12, together with $2,683.01 interest from November 14, 1910, when the original complaint was filed -- in all, $15,878.13.  The Port Banga Lumber Company has not appealed, and this is the maximum recovery which appellant can suffer.</p>\n<p>According to appellant\'s theory, the written contract of June 10th remained in force.  A settlement thereunder would require a debit against it for logs delivered -- 32,032 cubic feet at 20 cents -- of $6,406.40, and necessitate credits of $2,500, alleged payment on account, and $8,750, damages sustained.  The resulting balance of $4,843.60, with interest from November 14, 1910, to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 237 U. S. 391</a></p><p> April 3, 1914, $984.87, or $5,828.47, is the greatest sum for which it could have recovered judgment.</p>\n<p>The maximum amount fairly in dispute is therefore the judgment of $15,878.13 against appellant, plus $5,828.47, which it sought to recover from appellee -- a total of $21,706.60.  <em>Dushane v.
