Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\xe2\x80\x99s (FISC) approval.  Surveillance under \xc2\xa71881a is subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, congressional supervision, and compliance with the \n \nFourth Amendment.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x94attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizations\xe2\x80\x94are United States persons who claim that they engage in sensitive international communications with individuals who they believe are likely targets of \xc2\xa71881a surveillance.  On the day that the FISA Amendments Act was enacted, they filed suit, seeking a declaration that \xc2\xa71881a is facially unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against \xc2\xa71881a-authorized surveillance.  The District Court found that respondents lacked standing, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that respondents showed (1) an \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that their communications will be intercepted at some time in the future, and (2) that they are suffering present injuries resulting from costly and burdensome measures they take to protect the confidentiality of their international communications from possible \xc2\xa71881a surveillance.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Respondents do not have Article III standing.

This argument fails.  Initially, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d standard is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened injury\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 standing theory also rests on a speculative chain of possibilities that does not establish that their potential injury is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a.  First, it is highly speculative whether the Government will imminently target communications to which respondents are parties.  Since respondents, as U.\xc2\xa0S. persons, cannot be targeted under \xc2\xa71881a, their theory necessarily rests on their assertion that their foreign contacts will be targeted.  Yet they have no actual knowledge of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71881a targeting practices.  Second, even if respondents could demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, they can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to use \xc2\xa71881aauthorized surveillance instead of one of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s numerous other surveillance methods, which are not challenged here.  Third, even if respondents could show that the Government will seek FISC authorization to target respondents\xe2\x80\x99 foreign contacts under \xc2\xa71881a, they can only speculate as to whether the FISC will authorize the surveillance.  This Court is reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.  See, e.g., Whitmore, supra, at 159\xe2\x80\x93160.  Fourth, even if the Government were to obtain the FISC\xe2\x80\x99s approval to target respondents\xe2\x80\x99 foreign contacts under \xc2\xa71881a, it is unclear whether the Government would succeed in acquiring those contacts\xe2\x80\x99 communications.  And fifth, even if the Government were to target respondents\xe2\x80\x99 foreign contacts, respondents can only speculate as to whether their own communications with those contacts would be incidentally acquired.

They claim that they suffer ongoing injuries that are fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a because the risk of \xc2\xa71881a surveillance requires them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of their communications.  But respondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.  Because they do not face a threat of certainly impending interception under \xc2\xa71881a, their costs are simply the product of their fear of surveillance, which is insufficient to create standing.  See Laird v. Tatum, \n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9315.  Accordingly, any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a.

Contrary to their claim, their alleged injuries are not the same kinds of injuries that supported standing in cases such as Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167\n, Meese v. Keene, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465\n, and Monsanto, supra.  And their suggestion that they should be held to have standing because otherwise the constitutionality of \xc2\xa71881a will never be adjudicated is both legally and factually incorrect.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Valley Forge Christian College v.

Before doing so, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence normally must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval.  Respondents are United States persons whose work, they allege, requires them to engage in sensitive international communications with individ- uals who they believe are likely targets of surveillance under \xc2\xa71881a.  Respondents seek a declaration that \xc2\xa71881a is unconstitutional, as well as an injunction against \xc2\xa71881a-authorized surveillance.  The question before us is whether respondents have Article III standing to seek this prospective relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents assert that they can establish injury in fact because there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that their communications will be acquired under \xc2\xa71881a at some point in the future.  But respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory of future injury is too speculative to satisfy the wellestablished requirement that threatened injury must be \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending.\xe2\x80\x9d  E.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149, \n158 (1990)\n.  And even if respondents could demonstrate that the threatened injury is certainly impending, they still would not be able to establish that this injury is fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a.  As an alternative argument, respondents contend that they are suffering present injury because the risk of \xc2\xa71881a-authorized surveillance al- ready has forced them to take costly and burdensome meas- ures to protect the confidentiality of their international communications.  But respondents cannot manufacture stand- ing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.  We therefore hold that respondents lack Article III standing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1978, after years of debate, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to authorize and regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance of communications for foreign intelligence purposes.  See \n\n92Stat.\n1783, \n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71801 et\xc2\xa0seq.; 1 D.\xc2\xa0Kris &amp; J. Wilson, National Security Investigations &amp; Prosecutions \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73.1, 3.7 (2d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Kris &amp; Wilson).  In enacting FISA, Congress legislated against the backdrop of our decision in United States v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., \n\n407 U.\xc2\xa0S. 297 (1972)\n (Keith), in which we explained that the standards and procedures that law enforcement officials must follow when conducting \xe2\x80\x9csurveillance of \xe2\x80\x98ordinary crime\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d might not be required in the context of surveillance conducted for domestic national-security purposes.  Id., at 322\xe2\x80\x93323.  Although the Keith opinion expressly disclaimed any ruling \xe2\x80\x9con the scope of the President\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance power with respect to the activities of foreign powers,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 308, it implicitly suggested that a special framework for foreign intelligence surveillance might be constitutionally permissible, see id., at 322\xe2\x80\x93323.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn constructing such a framework for foreign intel- ligence surveillance, Congress created two specialized courts.  In FISA, Congress authorized judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to approve electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes if there is probable cause to believe that \xe2\x80\x9cthe target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,\xe2\x80\x9d and that each of the specific \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7105(a)(3), \n\n92Stat.\n1790; see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7105(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), ibid.; 1 Kris &amp; Wilson \xc2\xa77:2, at 194\xe2\x80\x93195; id., \xc2\xa716:2, at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.

Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA) to conduct warrantless wiretapping of telephone and e-mail communications where one party to the communication was located outside the United States and a participant in \xe2\x80\x9cthe call was reasonably believed to be a member or agent of al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist organization,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 403a.

In January 2007, the FISC issued orders authorizing the Government to target international communications into or out of the United States where there was probable cause to believe that one participant to the communication was a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization.

Id., at 405a; see id., at 312a, 404a.  After a FISC Judge subsequently narrowed the FISC\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of such surveillance, however, the Executive asked Congress to amend FISA so that it would provide the intelligence community with additional authority to meet the challenges of modern technology and international terrorism.

This argument fails.  As an initial matter, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d standard is inconsistent with our requirement that \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whitmore, supra, at 158 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra, at 345; Laidlaw, supra, at 190; Defenders of Wildlife, supra, at 565, n.\xc2\xa02; Babbitt, supra, at 298.  Furthermore, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument rests on their highly speculative fear that: (1) the Government will decide to target the communications of non-U.\xc2\xa0S. persons with whom they communicate; (2) in doing so, the Government will choose to invoke its authority under \xc2\xa71881a rather than utilizing another method of surveillance; (3)\xc2\xa0the Article III judges who serve on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court will conclude that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed surveillance procedures satisfy \xc2\xa71881a\xe2\x80\x99s many safeguards and are consistent with the \n \nFourth Amendment; (4) the Government will succeed in inter- cepting the communications of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contacts; and (5)\xc2\xa0respondents will be parties to the particular communications that the Government intercepts.  As discussed below, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory of standing, which relies on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy the requirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending.  See Summers, supra, at 496 (rejecting a standing theory premised on a speculative chain of possibilities); Whitmore, supra, at 157\xe2\x80\x93160 (same).  Moreover, even if respondents could demonstrate injury in fact, the second link in the above-described chain of contingencies\xe2\x80\x94which amounts to mere speculation about whether surveillance would be under \xc2\xa71881a or some other authority\xe2\x80\x94shows that respondents cannot satisfy the requirement that any injury in fact must be fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, it is speculative whether the Government will imminently target communications to which respondents are parties.  Section 1881a expressly provides that respondents, who are U.\xc2\xa0S. persons, cannot be targeted for surveillance under \xc2\xa71881a.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71881a(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3); 667 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 173 (Raggi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Accordingly, it is no surprise that respondents fail to offer any evidence that their communications have been monitored under \xc2\xa71881a, a failure that substantially undermines their standing theory.  See ACLU, 493 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 655\xe2\x80\x93656, 673\xe2\x80\x93674 (opinion of Batchelder, J.) (concluding that plaintiffs who lacked evidence that their communications had been intercepted did not have standing to challenge alleged NSA surveillance).  Indeed, respondents do not even allege that the Government has sought the FISC\xe2\x80\x99s approval for surveillance of their communications.  Accordingly, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory necessarily rests on their assertion that the Government will target other individuals\xe2\x80\x94namely, their foreign contacts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet respondents have no actual knowledge of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71881a targeting practices.  Instead, respondents merely speculate and make assumptions about whether their communications with their foreign contacts will be acquired under \xc2\xa71881a.  See 667 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 185\xe2\x80\x93187 (opinion of Raggi, J.).  For example, journalist Christopher Hedges states:  \xe2\x80\x9cI have no choice but to assume that any of my international communications may be subject to government surveillance, and I have to make decisions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in light of that assumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 366a (emphasis added and deleted).  Similarly, attorney Scott McKay asserts that, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause of the [FISA Amendments Act], we now have to assume that every one of our international communications may be monitored by the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 375a (emphasis added); see also id., at 337a, 343a\xe2\x80\x93344a, 350a, 356a.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing\xe2\x80\x9d standing\xe2\x80\x94and, at the summary judgment stage, such a party \xe2\x80\x9ccan no longer rest on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98mere allegations,\xe2\x80\x99 but must \xe2\x80\x98set forth\xe2\x80\x99 by affidavit or other evidence \xe2\x80\x98specific facts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561.  Respondents, however, have set forth no specific facts demonstrating that the communications of their foreign contacts will be targeted.  More- over, because \xc2\xa71881a at most authorizes\xe2\x80\x94but does not mandate or direct\xe2\x80\x94the surveillance that respondents fear, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 allegations are necessarily conjectural.  See United Presbyterian Church in U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Reagan, 738 F.\xc2\xa02d 1375, 1380 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.); 667 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 187 (opinion of Raggi, J.).  Simply put, respondents can only speculate as to how the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence will exercise their discretion in determining which communications to target.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, even if respondents could demonstrate that the targeting of their foreign contacts is imminent, respondents can only speculate as to whether the Government will seek to use \xc2\xa71881aauthorized surveillance (rather than other methods) to do so.  The Government has numerous other methods of conducting surveillance, none of which is challenged here.  Even after the enactment of the FISA Amendments Act, for example, the Government may still conduct electronic surveillance of persons abroad under the older provisions of FISA so long as it satisfies the applicable requirements, including a demonstration of probable cause to believe that the person is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.  See \xc2\xa71805.  The Government may also obtain information from the intelligence services of foreign nations.  Brief for Petitioners 33.  And, although we do not reach the question, the Government contends that it can conduct FISA-exempt human and technical surveillance programs that are governed by Executive Order 12333.  See Exec. Order No. 12333, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71.4, 2.1\xe2\x80\x932.5, 3 CFR 202, 210\xe2\x80\x93212 (1981), reprinted as amended, note following \n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401, pp. 543, 547\xe2\x80\x93548.  Even if respondents could demonstrate that their foreign contacts will imminently be targeted\xe2\x80\x94indeed, even if they could show that interception of their own communications will imminently occur\xe2\x80\x94they would still need to show that their injury is fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a.  But, because respondents can only speculate as to whether any (asserted) interception would be under \xc2\xa71881a or some other authority, they cannot satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, even if respondents could show that the Government will seek the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to acquire the communications of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 foreign contacts under \xc2\xa71881a, respondents can only speculate as to whether that court will authorize such surveillance.  In the past, we have been reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.  In Whitmore, for example, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s theory of standing hinged largely on the probability that he would obtain federal habeas relief and be convicted upon retrial.  In holding that the plaintiff lacked standing, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is just not possible for a litigant to prove in advance that the judicial system will lead to any particular result in his case.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 159\xe2\x80\x93160; see Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 562.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe decline to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the decisions of independent actors.  Section 1881a mandates that the Government must obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval of targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and a governmental certification regarding proposed surveillance.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3).

This improperly waters down the fundamental requirements of Article III.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that they have standing because they incurred certain costs as a reasonable reaction to a risk of harm is unavailing\xe2\x80\x94because the harm respondents seek to avoid is not certainly impending.  In other words, respondents cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.  See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 660, \n664 (1976)\n (per curiam); National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Assn., Inc., 468 F.\xc2\xa03d 826, 831 (CADC 2006).  Any ongoing injuries that respondents are suffering are not fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff would be able to secure a lower standard for Article III standing simply by making an expenditure based on a nonparanoid fear.  As Judge Raggi accurately noted, under the Second Circuit panel\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, respondents could, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the price of a plane ticket, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. transform their standing burden from one requiring a showing of actual or imminent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interception to one requiring a showing that their subjective fear of such interception is not fanciful, irrational, or clearly unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  667 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 180 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, allowing respondents to bring this action based on costs they incurred in response to a speculative threat would be tantamount to accepting a repackaged version of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 first failed theory of standing.  See ACLU, 493 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 656\xe2\x80\x93657 (opinion of Batchelder, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother reason that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 present injuries are not fairly traceable to \xc2\xa71881a is that even before \xc2\xa71881a was enacted, they had a similar incentive to engage in many of the countermeasures that they are now taking.  See id., at 668\xe2\x80\x93670.  For instance, respondent Scott McKay\xe2\x80\x99s declaration describes\xe2\x80\x94and the dissent heavily relies on\xe2\x80\x94Mr. McKay\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that thousands of communications involving one of his clients were monitored in the past.

Thus, because the Government was allegedly conducting surveillance of Mr. McKay\xe2\x80\x99s client before Congress enacted \xc2\xa71881a, it is difficult to see how the safeguards that Mr. McKay now claims to have implemented can be traced to \xc2\xa71881a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause respondents do not face a threat of certainly impending interception under \xc2\xa71881a, the costs that they have incurred to avoid surveillance are simply the product of their fear of surveillance,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and our decision in Laird makes it clear that such a fear is insufficient to create standing.  See 408 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 10\xe2\x80\x9315.  The plaintiffs in Laird argued that their exercise of \n \nFirst Amendment rights was being \xe2\x80\x9cchilled by the mere existence, without more, of [the Army\xe2\x80\x99s] investigative and data-gathering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 10.  While acknowledging that prior cases had held that constitutional violations may arise from the chilling effect of \xe2\x80\x9cregulations that fall short of a direct prohibi- tion against the exercise of \n \nFirst Amendment rights,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court declared that none of those cases involved a \xe2\x80\x9cchilling effect aris[ing] merely from the individual\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or from the individual\xe2\x80\x99s concomitant fear that, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency might in the future take some other and additional action detrimental to that individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 11.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llegations of a subjective \xe2\x80\x98chill\xe2\x80\x99 are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, the plaintiffs in Laird\xe2\x80\x94and respondents here\xe2\x80\x94lack standing.

Keene, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465 (1987)\n, and Monsanto.  Brief for Respondents 24.  As an initial matter, none of these cases holds or even suggests that plaintiffs can establish standing simply by claiming that they experienced a \xe2\x80\x9cchilling effect\xe2\x80\x9d that resulted from a governmental policy that does not regulate, constrain, or compel any action on their part.  Moreover, each of these cases was very different from the present case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Laidlaw, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 standing was based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe proposition that a company\xe2\x80\x99s continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 184.  Because the unlawful discharges of pollutants were \xe2\x80\x9cconcededly ongoing,\xe2\x80\x9d the only issue was whether \xe2\x80\x9cnearby residents\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94who were members of the organizational plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94acted reasonably in refraining from using the polluted area.  Id., at 183\xe2\x80\x93184.  Laidlaw is therefore quite unlike the present case, in which it is not \xe2\x80\x9cconcede[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that respondents would be subject to unlawful surveillance but for their decision to take preventive measures.  See ACLU, 493 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 686 (opinion of Batchelder, J.)

Laidlaw would resemble this case only if (1) it were undisputed that the Government was using \xc2\xa71881a-authorized surveillance to acquire respondents\xe2\x80\x99 communications and (2) the sole dispute concerned the reasonableness of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 preventive measures.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Keene, the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to label three films as \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical propaganda.\xe2\x80\x9d  481 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467.  The Court held that the plaintiff, who was an attorney and a state legislator, had standing because he demonstrated, through \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed affidavits,\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9ccould not exhibit the films without incurring a risk of injury to his reputation and of an impairment of his political career.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 467, 473\xe2\x80\x93475.

In Monsanto, conventional alfalfa farmers had standing to seek injunctive relief because the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deregulate a variety of genetically engineered alfalfa gave rise to a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered varieties of alfalfa.\xe2\x80\x9d  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  The standing analysis in that case hinged on evidence that genetically engineered alfalfa \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seed fields [we]re currently being planted in all the major alfalfa seed production areas\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; the bees that pollinate alfalfa \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98have a range of at least two to ten miles\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and the alfalfa seed farms were concentrated in an area well within the bees\xe2\x80\x99 pollination range.

It would be wrong, they maintain, to \xe2\x80\x9cinsulate the government\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance activities from meaningful judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 60.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion is both legally and factually incorrect.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 489; Schlesinger, 418 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227; see also Richardson, 418 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 179; Raines, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 835 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, our holding today by no means insulates \xc2\xa71881a from judicial review.  As described above, Congress created a comprehensive scheme in which the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court evaluates the Government\xe2\x80\x99s certifications, targeting procedures, and minimization procedures\xe2\x80\x94including assessing whether the targeting and minimization procedures comport with the \n \nFourth Amendment.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71881a(a), (c)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3).  Any dissatisfaction that respondents may have about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings\xe2\x80\x94or the congressional delineation of that court\xe2\x80\x99s  role\xe2\x80\x94is irrelevant to our standing analysis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAdditionally, if the Government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived from a \xc2\xa71881a acquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it must provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected person may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71806(c), 1806(e), 1881e(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, if the Government were to prosecute one of respondent-attorney\xe2\x80\x99s foreign clients using \xc2\xa71881a-authorized surveillance, the Government would be required to make a disclosure.  Although the foreign client might not have a viable \n \nFourth Amendment claim, see, e.g., United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259, \n261 (1990)\n, it is possible that the monitoring of the target\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with his or her attorney would provide grounds for a claim of standing on the part of the attorney.  Such an attorney would certainly have a stronger evidentiary basis for establishing standing than do respondents in the present case.  In such a situation, unlike in the present case, it would at least be clear that the Government had acquired the foreign client\xe2\x80\x99s communications using \xc2\xa71881a-authorized surveillance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, any electronic communications service provider that the Government directs to assist in \xc2\xa71881a surveillance may challenge the lawfulness of that directive before the FISC.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71881a(h)(4), (6).  Indeed, at the behest of a service provider, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review previously analyzed the constitutionality of electronic surveillance directives issued pursuant to a now-expired set of FISA amendments.  See In re Directives Pursuant to Section 105B of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 551 F. 3d 1004, 1006\xe2\x80\x931016 (2008) (holding that the provider had standing and that the directives were constitutional).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe hold that respondents lack Article III standing because they cannot demonstrate that the future injury they purportedly fear is certainly impending and because they cannot manufacture standing by incurring costs in anticipation of non-imminent harm.

Congress enacted \xc2\xa71881a in 2008, as an amendment to the pre-existing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71801 et seq.  Before the amendment, the Act authorized the Government (acting within the United States) to monitor private electronic communications between the United States and a foreign country if (1) the Government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was, in significant part, to obtain foreign intelligence information (which includes information concerning a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign power\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cterritory\xe2\x80\x9d related to our \xe2\x80\x9cnational defense\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csecurity\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. foreign affairs\xe2\x80\x9d), (2) the Government\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance target was \xe2\x80\x9ca foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) the Government used surveillance procedures designed to \xe2\x80\x9cminimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of\xe2\x80\x9d any private information acquired about Americans.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71801(e), (h), 1804(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition the Government had to obtain the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  To do so, it had to submit an application describing (1) each \xe2\x80\x9cspecific target,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the information sought,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) the \xe2\x80\x9ctype of communications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71804(a).  It had to certify that, in significant part, it sought to obtain foreign intelligence information.  Ibid.  It had to demonstrate probable cause to believe that each specific target was \xe2\x80\x9ca foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71804(a), 1805(a).  It also had to describe instance-specific procedures to be used to minimize intrusions upon Americans\xe2\x80\x99 privacy (compliance with which the court subsequently could assess).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71804(a), 1805(d)(3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe addition of \xc2\xa71881a in 2008 changed this prior law in three important ways.  First, it eliminated the requirement that the Government describe to the court each specific target and identify each facility at which its surveillance would be directed, thus permitting surveillance on a programmatic, not necessarily individualized, basis.  \xc2\xa71881a(g).  Second, it eliminated the requirement that a target be a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign power or an agent of a foreign power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Third, it diminished the court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to insist upon, and eliminated its authority to supervise, instance-specific privacy-intrusion minimization procedures (though the Government still must use court-approved general minimization procedures).  \xc2\xa71881a(e).  Thus, using the authority of \xc2\xa71881a, the Government can obtain court approval for its surveillance of electronic communications between places within the United States and targets in foreign territories by showing the court (1) that \xe2\x80\x9ca sig-nificant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) that it will use general targeting and privacy-intrusion minimization procedures of a kind that the court had previously approved.  \xc2\xa71881a(g).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is similarly important to understand the kinds of communications in which the plaintiffs say they engage and which they believe the Government will intercept.

First, the plaintiffs have engaged, and continue to engage, in electronic communications of a kind that the 2008 amendment, but not the prior Act, authorizes the Government to intercept.  These communications include discussions with family members of those detained at Guantanamo, friends and acquaintances of those persons, and investigators, experts and others with knowledge of circumstances related to terrorist activities.  These persons are foreigners located outside the United States.  They are not \xe2\x80\x9cforeign power[s]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cagent[s] of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. foreign power[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  And the plaintiffs state that they exchange with these persons \xe2\x80\x9cforeign intelligence information,\xe2\x80\x9d defined to include information that \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cinternational terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe national defense or the security of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71801 (2006 ed. and Supp. V); see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 342a, 366a, 373a\xe2\x80\x93374a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the plaintiffs have a strong motive to engage in, and the Government has a strong motive to listen to, conversations of the kind described.  A lawyer representing a client normally seeks to learn the circumstances surrounding the crime (or the civil wrong) of which the client is accused.  A fair reading of the affidavit of Scott McKay, for example, taken together with elementary considerations of a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to his client, indicates that McKay will engage in conversations that concern what suspected foreign terrorists, such as his client, have done; in conversations that concern his clients\xe2\x80\x99 families, colleagues, and contacts; in conversations that concern what those persons (or those connected to them) have said and done, at least in relation to terrorist activities; in conversations that concern the political, social, and commercial environments in which the suspected terrorists have lived and worked; and so forth.  See, e.g., id., at 373a\xe2\x80\x93374a.  Journalists and human rights workers have strong similar motives to conduct conversations of this kind.  See, e.g., id., at 342a (Declaration of Joanne Mariner, stating that \xe2\x80\x9csome of the information [she] exchange[s] by telephone and e-mail relates to terrorism and counterterrorism, and much of the information relates to the foreign affairs of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the Government has a strong motive to conduct surveillance of conversations that contain material of this kind.  The Government, after all, seeks to learn as much as it can reasonably learn about suspected terrorists (such as those detained at Guantanamo), as well as about their contacts and activities, along with those of friends and family members.  See Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Statement of Administration Policy on S. 2248, p. 4 (Dec. 17, 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cPart of the value of the [new authority] is to enable the Intelligence Community to collect expeditiously the communications of terrorists in foreign countries who may contact an associate in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the Government is motivated to do so, not simply by the desire to help convict those whom the Government believes guilty, but also by the critical, overriding need to protect America from terrorism.  See id., at 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cProtection of the American people and American interests at home and abroad requires access to timely, accurate, and insightful intelligence on the capabilities, intentions, and activities of . . . terrorists\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s past behavior shows that it has sought, and hence will in all likelihood continue to seek, information about alleged terrorists and detainees through means that include surveillance of electronic communications.  As just pointed out, plaintiff Scott McKay states that the Government (under the authority of the pre-2008 law) \xe2\x80\x9cintercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 email communications involving [his client] Mr. Al-Hussayen.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 370a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the Government has the capacity to conduct electronic surveillance of the kind at issue.  To some degree this capacity rests upon technology available to the Government.  See 1 D. Kris &amp; J. Wilson, National Security Investigations &amp; Prosecutions \xc2\xa716:6, p. 562 (2d ed. 2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cNSA\xe2\x80\x99s technological abilities are legendary\xe2\x80\x9d); id., \xc2\xa716:12, at 572\xe2\x80\x93577 (describing the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to monitor \xe2\x80\x9cvery broad facilities\xe2\x80\x9d such as international switches).

This capacity also includes the Government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to obtain the kind of information here at issue from private carriers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon.  See \n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71881a(h).  We are further told by amici that the Government is expanding that capacity.  See Brief for Electronic Privacy Information Center et\xc2\xa0al. as 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (National Security Agency will be able to conduct surveillance of most electronic communications between domestic and foreign points).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, to exercise this capacity the Government must have intelligence court authorization.  But the Government rarely files requests that fail to meet the statu-tory criteria.  See Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant Attorney General, to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 1 (Apr. 30, 2012) (In 2011, of the 1,676 applications to the intelligence court, two were withdrawn by the Government, and the remaining 1,674 were approved, 30 with some mod-ification), online at http://www.justice.gov/nsd/foia/ foia_library/2011fisa-ltr.pdf. (as visited Feb. 22, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  As the intelligence court itself has stated, its review under \xc2\xa71881a is \xe2\x80\x9cnar-rowly circumscribed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In\xc2\xa0re Proceedings Required by \xc2\xa7702(i) of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08\xe2\x80\x9301 (Aug. 17, 2008), p. 3.  There is no reason to believe that the communications described would all fail to meet the conditions necessary for approval.  Moreover, compared with prior law, \xc2\xa71881a simplifies and thus expedites the approval process, making it more likely that the Government will use \xc2\xa71881a to obtain the necessary approval.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that (1) similarity of content, (2) strong motives, (3) prior behavior, and (4) capacity all point to a very strong likelihood that the Government will intercept at least some of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 communications, including some that the 2008 amendment, \xc2\xa71881a, but not the pre-2008 Act, authorizes the Government to intercept.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, nothing suggests the presence of some special factor here that might support a contrary conclusion.  The Government does not deny that it has both the motive and the capacity to listen to communications of the kind described by plaintiffs.  Nor does it describe any system for avoiding the interception of an electronic communication that happens to include a party who is an American lawyer, journalist, or human rights worker.  One can, of course, always imagine some special circumstance that negates a virtual likelihood, no matter how strong.  But the same is true about most, if not all, ordinary inferences about future events.  Perhaps, despite pouring rain, the streets will remain dry (due to the presence of a special chemical).  But ordinarily a party that seeks to defeat a strong natural inference must bear the burden of showing that some such special circumstance exists.  And no one has suggested any such special circumstance here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsequently, we need only assume that the Government is doing its job (to find out about, and combat, terrorism) in order to conclude that there is a high probability that the Government will intercept at least some elec-tronic communication to which at least some of the plaintiffs are parties.  The majority is wrong when it describes the harm threatened plaintiffs as \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority more plausibly says that the plaintiffs have failed to show that the threatened harm is \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But, as the majority appears to concede, see ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, and n.\xc2\xa05, certainty is not, and never has been, the touchstone of standing.  The future is inherently uncertain.  Yet federal courts frequently entertain actions for injunctions and for declaratory relief aimed at preventing future activities that are reasonably likely or highly likely, but not absolutely certain, to take place.  And that degree of certainty is all that is needed to support standing here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending\xe2\x80\x9d is not to the contrary.  Sometimes the Court has used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending\xe2\x80\x9d as if the phrase described a sufficient, rather than a necessary, condition for jurisdiction.  See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553, \n593 (1923)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the injury is certainly impending that is enough\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Babbitt, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 298 (same).  On other occasions, it has used the phrase as if it concerned when, not whether, an alleged injury would occur.  Thus, in Lujan, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564, n.\xc2\xa02, the Court considered a threatened future injury that consisted of harm that plaintiffs would suffer when they \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d visited a gov-ernment project area that (they claimed) would suffer environmental damage.  The Court wrote that a \xe2\x80\x9cmere pro-fession of an intent, some day, to return\xe2\x80\x9d to the project area did not show the harm was \xe2\x80\x9cimminent,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d might mean nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cin this lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 564\xe2\x80\x93565, n.\xc2\xa02 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 93 (2003)\n, the Court denied standing because the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s future injury (stemming from a campaign finance law) would not affect him until his reelection.  That fact, the Court said, made the injury \xe2\x80\x9ctoo remote temporally to satisfy Article III standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 225\xe2\x80\x93226.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn still other occasions, recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0imminence\xe2\x80\x99 is concededly a somewhat elastic concept,\xe2\x80\x9d Lujan, supra, at 565, n.\xc2\xa02, the Court has referred to, or used (sometimes along with \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending\xe2\x80\x9d) other phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that suggest less than absolute, or literal certainty.

The Court has often found standing where the occurrence of the relevant injury was far less certain than here.  Consider a few, fairly typical, cases.  Consider Pennell, supra.  A city ordinance forbade landlords to raise the rent charged to a tenant by more than 8 percent where doing so would work an unreasonably severe hardship on that tenant.  Id., at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  A group of landlords sought a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional.  The Court held that, to have standing, the landlords had to demonstrate a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 8 (emphasis added).  It found that the landlords had done so by showing a likelihood of enforcement and a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., that the ordinance would make the landlords charge lower rents\xe2\x80\x94even though the landlords had not shown (1) that they intended to raise the relevant rents to the point of causing unreasonably severe hardship; (2) that the tenants would challenge those increases; or (3) that the city\xe2\x80\x99s hearing examiners and arbitrators would find against the landlords.  Here, even more so than in Pennell, there is a \xe2\x80\x9crealistic danger\xe2\x80\x9d that the relevant harm will occur.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOr, consider Blum, supra.  A group of nursing home residents receiving Medicaid benefits challenged the constitutionality (on procedural grounds) of a regulation that permitted their nursing home to transfer them to a less desirable home.  Id., at 999\xe2\x80\x931000.  Although a Medicaid committee had recommended transfers, Medicaid-initiated transfer had been enjoined and the nursing home itself had not threatened to transfer the plaintiffs.  But the Court found \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe threat of transfers\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98imaginary or speculative\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cquite realistic,\xe2\x80\x9d hence \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1000\xe2\x80\x931001 (quoting Younger v.

The plaintiff, a candidate for the United States House of Representatives, self-financed his campaigns.  He challenged the constitutionality of an election law that relaxed the limits on an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s contributions when a self-financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s spending itself exceeded certain other limits.  His opponent, in fact, had decided not to take advantage of the increased contribution limits that the statute would have allowed.  Id., at 734.  But the Court nonetheless found standing because there was a \xe2\x80\x9crealistic and impending threat,\xe2\x80\x9d not a certainty, that the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent would do so at the time the plaintiff filed the complaint.  Id., at 734\xe2\x80\x93735.  The threat facing the plaintiffs here is as \xe2\x80\x9crealistic and impending.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOr, consider MedImmune, supra.  The plaintiff, a patent licensee, sought a declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid.  But, the plaintiff did not face an imminent threat of suit because it continued making royalty payments to the patent holder.  In explaining why the plaintiff had standing, we (1) assumed that if the plaintiff stopped making royalty payments it would have standing (despite the fact that the patent holder might not bring suit), (2) rejected the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable ap-prehension of imminent suit\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, and (3) in-stead suggested that a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine threat of enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d was likely sufficient.  Id., at 128, 129, 132, n.\xc2\xa011 (internal quotation marks omitted).

In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59 (1978)\n, for example, the plaintiffs, a group of individuals living near a proposed nuclear powerplant, challenged the constitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act, a statute that limited the plant\xe2\x80\x99s liability in the case of a nuclear accident.  The plaintiffs said that, without the Act, the defendants would not build a nuclear plant.  And the building of the plant would harm them, in part, by emitting \xe2\x80\x9cnon-natural radiation into [their] environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 74.  The Court found standing in part due to \xe2\x80\x9cour generalized concern about exposure to radiation and the apprehension flowing from the uncertainty about the health and genetic consequences of even small emissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The defendant, say, has threatened to load wheat onto a ship bound for India despite a promise to send the wheat to the United States.  No one can know for certain that this will happen.  Perhaps the defendant will change his mind; perhaps the ship will turn and head for the United States.  Yet, despite the uncertainty, the Constitution does not prohibit a federal court from hearing such a claim.  See 23 R.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWithout expressing views about that probability, we found standing because the plaintiffs would suffer present harm by trying to combat the threat.  Ibid.  The plaintiffs, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cwould have to conduct testing to find out whether and to what extent their crops have been contaminated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  And they would have to take \xe2\x80\x9cmeasures to minimize the likelihood of potential contamination and to ensure an adequate supply of non-genetically-engineered alfalfa.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We held that these \xe2\x80\x9charms, which [the plaintiffs] will suffer even if their crops are not actually infected with\xe2\x80\x9d the genetically modified gene, \xe2\x80\x9care sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the constitutional standing analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tVirtually identical circumstances are present here.  Plaintiff McKay, for example, points out that, when he communicates abroad about, or in the interests of, a client (e.g., a client accused of terrorism), he must \xe2\x80\x9cmake an assessment\xe2\x80\x9d whether his \xe2\x80\x9cclient\xe2\x80\x99s interests would be compromised\xe2\x80\x9d should the Government \xe2\x80\x9cacquire the communications.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 375a.  If so, he must either forgo the communication or travel abroad.  Id., at 371a\xe2\x80\x93372a (\xe2\x80\x9cI have had to take measures to protect the confidentiality of information that I believe is particularly sensitive,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9ctravel that is both time-consuming and expensive\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSince travel is expensive, since forgoing communication can compromise the client\xe2\x80\x99s interests, since McKay\xe2\x80\x99s assessment itself takes time and effort, this case does not differ significantly from Monsanto.  And that is so whether we consider the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 present necessary expenditure of time and effort as a separate concrete, particularized, imminent harm, or consider it as additional evidence that the future harm (an interception) is likely to occur.  See also Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 183\xe2\x80\x93184 (holding that plaintiffs who curtailed their recreational activities on a river due to reasonable concerns about the effect of pollutant discharges into that river had standing); Meese v. Keene, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465, \n475 (1987)\n (stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to take . . . affirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm  . . . constitutes a cognizable injury\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority cannot find support in cases that use the words \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending\xe2\x80\x9d to deny standing.  While I do not claim to have read every standing case, I have examined quite a few, and not yet found any such case.  The majority refers to Whitmore v. Arkansas, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149 (1990)\n.  But in that case the Court denied standing to a prisoner who challenged the validity of a death sentence given to a different prisoner who refused to challenge his own sentence.  The plaintiff feared that in the absence of an appeal, his fellow prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence would be missing from the State\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty database and thereby skew the database against him, making it less likely his challenges to his own death penalty would succeed.  The Court found no standing.  Id., at 161.  But the fellow prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s lack of appeal would have harmed the plaintiff only if (1) the plaintiff separately obtained federal habeas relief and was then reconvicted and resentenced to death, (2) he sought review of his new sentence, and (3) during that review, his death sentence was affirmed only because it was compared to an artificially skewed database.  Id., at 156\xe2\x80\x93157.  These events seemed not very likely to occur.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332 (2006)\n, taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a tax break offered by state and local governments to a car manufacturer.  We found no standing.  But the plaintiffs would have suffered resulting injury only if that the tax break had depleted state and local treasuries and the legislature had responded by raising their taxes.  Id., at 344.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Lujan, the case that may come closest to supporting the majority, the Court also found no standing.  But, as I pointed out, supra, at 11, Lujan is a case where the Court considered when, not whether, the threatened harm would occur.  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564, n.\xc2\xa02.  The relevant injury there consisted of a visit by environmental group\xe2\x80\x99s members to a project site where they would find (unlawful) environmental depredation.  Id., at 564.  The Court pointed out that members had alleged that they would visit the project sites \xe2\x80\x9csoon.\xe2\x80\x9d  But it wrote that \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d might refer to almost any time in the future.  Ibid., n.\xc2\xa02.  By way of contrast, the ongoing threat of terrorism means that here the relevant interceptions will likely take place imminently, if not now.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has, of course, denied standing in other cases.  But they involve injuries less likely, not more likely, to occur than here.  In a recent case, Summers v. Earth Island Institute, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 488 (2009)\n, for example, the plaintiffs challenged a regulation exempting certain timber sales from public comment and administrative appeal.  The plaintiffs claimed that the regulations injured them by interfering with their esthetic enjoyment and recreational use of the forests.  The Court found this harm too unlikely to occur to support standing.  Id., at 496.  The Court noted that one plaintiff had not pointed to a specific affected forest that he would visit.  The Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here may be a chance, but . . . hardly a likelihood,\xe2\x80\x9d that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwanderings will bring him to a parcel about to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 495 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t4 \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, as the Court concedes, see ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, and n.\xc2\xa05, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending\xe2\x80\x9d does not refer to absolute certainty.  As our case law demonstrates, what the Constitution requires is something more akin to \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chigh probability.\xe2\x80\x9d  The use of some such standard is all that is necessary here to ensure the actual concrete injury that the Constitution demands.  The considerations set forth in Parts II and III, supra, make clear that the standard is readily met in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile I express no view on the merits of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims, I do believe that at least some of the plaintiffs have standing to make those claims.
