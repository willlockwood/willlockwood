UNITED STATES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">LOGAN <em>v</em>. UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x936911.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 30, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 4, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">Under federal law, the maximum prison term for a felon convicted of possessing a firearm is ordinarily 10 years.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).  If the offender\xe2\x80\x99s prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies,]\xe2\x80\x9d however, the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA) mandates a minimum term of 15 years.  See \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  Congress defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include specified crimes \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B), but also provided that a state-law misdemeanor may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d if the offense is punishable by a term of more than two years, \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)(B).  Congress amended \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) in 1986 to exclude from qualification for enhanced sentencing  \xe2\x80\x9cany conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights [<em>i.e.</em>, rights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury] restored.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and received a 15-year sentence, the mandatory minimum under ACCA.  In imposing this sentence, the court took account of three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each of them punishable by a 3-year maximum sentence, and none of them revoking any of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights.  Logan challenged his sentence on the ground that his state-court convictions fell within \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d exemption from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Rights retained, Logan argued, should be treated the same as rights revoked but later restored.  The District Court disagreed, holding that the exemption applies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The exemption contained in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0 The ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94giving back something that has been taken away\xe2\x80\x94does not include retention of something never lost.  Moreover, the context in which \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d appears in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning.  In \xc2\xa7921(a)(20), the words \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d appear in the company of \xe2\x80\x9cexpunged,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cset aside,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpardoned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Each of those terms describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction.  In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone.  He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Logan\xe2\x80\x99s dominant argument against a plain-meaning approach is not persuasive.  He relies on the harsh result a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, he maintains, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment.  Logan urges that this result is not merely anomalous; it is absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights occurs automatically upon release from prison.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Logan\xe2\x80\x99s harsh or absurd consequences argument overlooks \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d clause, under which an offender gains no exemption from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s application through an expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Many States that restore felons\xe2\x80\x99 civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities.  Further, Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The resolution Logan proposes, in any event, would correct one potential anomaly while creating others.  Under Logan\xe2\x80\x99s proposed construction, all crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights [have been] restored\xe2\x80\x9d in a State that does not revoke any offender\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights, while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.  Accepting Logan\xe2\x80\x99s argument would also undercut \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)(B), which subjects to ACCA state misdemeanor convictions punishable by more than two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  Because misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights, reading the word \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cretained\xe2\x80\x9d would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but would be released from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights.  This Court is disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).  Even assuming that when Congress revised \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) in 1986, it labored under the misapprehension that all misdemeanants and felons at least temporarily forfeit civil rights, and indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake, this Court is not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can the Court recast \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 stead.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x94which was adopted 10 years after \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) was given its current shape and which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted \xe2\x80\xa6 of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94cautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny the \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights.  Tailored to \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(B)(ii), corresponding to \xc2\xa7921(a)(20), which specifies expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction.  That provision also demonstrates that the words \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away.  It provides for restoration of civil rights as a qualifying dispensation only \xe2\x80\x9cif the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights\xe2\x80\x9d in the first place.  Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) also rebuts Logan\xe2\x80\x99s absurdity argument.  Statutory terms may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words could not conceivably have been intended to apply to the case at hand.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Green</em> v. <em>Bock Laundry Machine Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/504/index.html">490 U. S. 504</a>, 511.  In \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(B)(ii), however, Congress explicitly distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cretained,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby making it more than conceivable that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, meant to do the same in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20).

Logan pleaded guilty in a United States District Court to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  Logan\xe2\x80\x99s record as a recidivist, which included three relevant state convictions, led the District Court to impose a 15-year prison term, the minimum sentence mandated by the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.\xc2\xa0V).  For ACCA sentence-enhancement purposes, a prior conviction may be disregarded if the conviction \xe2\x80\x9chas been expunged, or set aside,\xe2\x80\x9d or the offender \xe2\x80\x9chas been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) (2000 ed.).  None of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions have been expunged or set aside.  Nor has he been pardoned for any past crime.  And, bearing importantly on the instant petition, the three state-court convictions that triggered Logan\xe2\x80\x99s ACCA-enhanced sentence occasioned no loss of civil rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Challenging his enhanced sentence, Logan presents this question: Does the \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d exemption contained in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) encompass, and therefore remove from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s reach, state-court convictions that at no time deprived the offender of civil rights?  We hold that the \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) exemption provision does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 921(a)(20) sets out postconviction events\xe2\x80\x94expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights\xe2\x80\x94that extend to an offender a measure of forgiveness, relieving him from some or all of the consequences of his conviction.  Congress might have broadened the \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) exemption provision to cover convictions attended by no loss of civil rights.  The national lawmakers, however, did not do so.  Section 921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s failure to exempt convictions that do not revoke civil rights produces anomalies.  But so does the extension of the \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) exemption that Logan advances.  We are not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can we recast \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 stead.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal law generally prohibits the possession of a firearm by a person convicted of \xe2\x80\x9ca crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  Ordinarily, the maximum felon-in-possession sentence is 10 years.  See \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).

(In 1991, he had been convicted in an Illinois court of unlawful possession of a controlled substance.  <em>Id.,</em> at\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310, 12.)  The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years, the mandatory minimum under ACCA.  In imposing that enhanced sentence, the District Court took account of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each punishable by a maximum sentence of three years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  <em>Id.,</em> at\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both in the District Court and on appeal, Logan argued that his Wisconsin misdemeanor convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicate offenses because they caused no loss of his civil rights.  Rights retained, he urged, are functionally equivalent to rights revoked but later restored.  If the exemption contained in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) covered the three state-court misdemeanor convictions, Logan\xe2\x80\x99s maximum sentence, in lieu of the 15-year mandatory minimum under ACCA, would have been 10 years, see \xc2\xa7924(a)(2), and the United States Sentencing Guidelines would have indicated a sentence range of 37 to 46 months, see Brief for Petitioner\xc2\xa05.  The District Court rejected Logan\xe2\x80\x99s argument, holding that the \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) exemption provision \xe2\x80\x9capplies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored pursuant to state statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 11.

See Brief for Petitioner\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.  Thus the sole matter in dispute is whether Logan fits within the exemption from an ACCA-enhanced sentence for convictions \xe2\x80\x9cexpunged, or set aside\xe2\x80\x9d or offenders who \xe2\x80\x9cha[ve] been pardoned or ha[ve] had civil rights restored.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(20).

Persons convicted of misdemeanors, however, even if they are repeat offenders, generally retain their civil rights and are not subject to firearms disabilities.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With this background in view, we turn to the proper interpretation of the \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) exemption from ACCA-enhanced sentencing for offenders who have had their \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored.\xe2\x80\x9d  Logan\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanor convictions, we reiterate, did not result in any loss of the rights to vote, hold public office, or serve on juries.  Should he nonetheless be ranked with offenders whose rights were terminated but later restored?  The ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d affords Logan no aid.  In line with dictionary definitions,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the Court of Appeals stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe word \xe2\x80\x98restore\xe2\x80\x99 means to give back something that had been taken away.\xe2\x80\x9d  453 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa0805.  Accord <em>McGrath</em>, 60 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa01007 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98restoration\xe2\x80\x99 of a thing never lost or diminished is a definitional impossibility.\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Indelicato</em>, 97 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa0629 (\xe2\x80\x9cClearly the ordinary reading of the word \xe2\x80\x98restored\xe2\x80\x99 supports the government.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The context in which the word \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d appears in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning.  Words in a list are generally known by the company they keep.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Dole</em> v. <em>Steelworkers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/26/index.html">494 U. S. 26</a>, 36 (1990); <em>Beecham</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/index.html">511 U. S. 368</a>, 371 (1994).  In \xc2\xa7921(a)(20), the words \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d appear in the company of the words \xe2\x80\x9cexpunged,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cset aside,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpardoned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Each term describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction.  In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone.  He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Opposing a plain-meaning approach to the language Congress enacted, Logan relies dominantly on the harsh results a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment.  <em>E.g.</em>, Reply Brief 8 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]ndividuals who have committed more serious crimes than Petitioner may nonetheless have their rights restored, whereas misdemeanants who never lost their rights must suffer enhanced sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Logan urges that this result\xe2\x80\x94treating those who never lost their civil rights more harshly than those who lost, then regained, those rights\xe2\x80\x94is not merely anomalous; it rises to the level of the absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights is automatic and occurs immediately upon release from prison.  See <em>Caron</em>, 524 U. S., at\xc2\xa0313 (automatic restoration of rights qualifies for \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Logan\xe2\x80\x99s argument, we note, overlooks \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  Under that provision, an offender gains no exemption from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s application through an expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Many States that restore felons\xe2\x80\x99 civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities.  See Brief for United States\xc2\xa030 (citing, <em>inter alia</em>, La. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714:95.1(C) (West Supp. 2007), under which felons\xe2\x80\x99 firearms disabilities are lifted only after 10 years and only if no further felony convictions intervene).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We further note that Wisconsin has addressed, and prospectively eliminated, the anomaly Logan asserts he encountered: Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years of imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates.  See <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935,\xc2\xa0n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can demur to Logan\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a literal reading of \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) could produce anomalous results, for the resolution he proposes\xe2\x80\x94reading into the exemption convictions under which civil rights are retained\xe2\x80\x94would correct one potential anomaly while creating others.  See <em>McGrath</em>, 60 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa01009.  Under Logan\xe2\x80\x99s proposed construction, the most dangerous recidivists in a State that does not revoke any offender\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights could fall within \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption.  For example, Maine does not deprive any offenders of their civil rights.  See Lodging for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> (NACDL Lodging), App.\xc2\xa01, pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9324.  As Logan would have us read \xc2\xa7921(a)(20), all Maine crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights [have been] restored,\xe2\x80\x9d while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>McGrath</em>, the Second Circuit incisively identified Congress\xe2\x80\x99 response to <em>Dickerson</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa03, as the cause of the multiple anomalies \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) may produce:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Congress\xe2\x80\x99] decision to have restoration triggered by events governed by state law insured anomalous results.  The several states have considerably different laws governing pardon, expungement, and forfeiture and restoration of civil rights.  Furthermore, states have drastically different policies as to when and under what circumstances such discretionary acts of grace should be extended\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [Anomalies generated by \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)] are the inevitable consequence of making access to the exemption depend on the differing laws and policies of the several states.\xe2\x80\x9d  60 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa01009.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAccord 453 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa0807 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress replaced <em>Dickerso[n]</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 it ensured that similarly situated people would be treated differently\xe2\x80\x94for states vary widely in which if any civil rights a convict loses and whether these rights are restored.\xe2\x80\x9d).

Because state-law misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] Logan\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reading of the word \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cretained\xe2\x80\x9d would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but that same offender would be released from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights.  We are disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We may assume, <em>arguendo</em>, that when Congress revised \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) in 1986, see <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa03, it labored under the misapprehension that all offenders\xe2\x80\x94misdemeanants as well as felons\xe2\x80\x94forfeit civil rights, at least temporarily.  Even indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] we could hardly divine the revision the Legislature would favor.  Perhaps Congress would choose to exempt offenders who never lost their civil rights.  See <em>McGrath</em>, 60 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa01009.  But it is also plausible that Congress would remove the exemption for civil rights restoration as insufficiently indicative of official forgiveness.  Or, Congress might elect to include restorations of civil rights along with expungements, set asides, and pardons only if the restoration was nonautomatic, <em>i.e.</em>, granted on a case-by-case basis.  Homing in on the disparities resulting from diverse state legislation, see <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310, Congress might even revise \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) to provide, in accord with <em>Dickerson</em>, that federal rather than state law defines a conviction for purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922 and 924.  See 453 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa0806\xe2\x80\x93807.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In all events, a measure adopted ten years after \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) was given its current shape cautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny that exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights.  In 1996, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone \xe2\x80\x9cwho has been convicted \xe2\x80\xa6 of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Pub. L.\xc2\xa0104\xe2\x80\x93208, Tit.\xc2\xa0VI, \xc2\xa7658, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93371 to 3009\xe2\x80\x93372.  Tailored to \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, corresponding to \xc2\xa7921(a)(20), which reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored <em>(if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense)</em> unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) tracks \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) in specifying expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction.  But the emphasized parenthetical qualification shows that the words \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away.  See 453 F.\xc2\xa03d, at\xc2\xa0808.  Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) casts considerable doubt on Logan\xe2\x80\x99s hypothesis that, had Congress adverted to the issue when it drafted \xc2\xa7921(a)(20), it would have placed in the same category persons who regained civil rights and persons who retained civil rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(B)(ii) is also relevant to Logan\xe2\x80\x99s absurdity argument.  See <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.  Statutory terms, we have held, may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words \xe2\x80\x9ccould not conceivably have been intended to apply\xe2\x80\x9d to the case at hand.  <em>Cabell</em> v. <em>Markham</em>, 148 F.\xc2\xa02d 737, 739 (CA2) (L.\xc2\xa0Hand, J.), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/404/index.html">326 U. S. 404</a> (1945); see <em>Green</em> v. <em>Bock Laundry Machine Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/504/index.html">490 U. S. 504</a>, 511 (1989) (Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1) \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t mean what it says\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  In this case, it can hardly be maintained that Congress could not have meant what it said.  Congress explicitly distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cretained\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(B)(ii).  It is more than \xe2\x80\x9cconceivable\xe2\x80\x9d that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, see <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa03, meant to do the same in \xc2\xa7921(a)(20).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Congress framed \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) to serve two purposes.  See Tr. of Oral Arg.\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9329.  It sought to qualify as ACCA predicate offenses violent crimes that a State classifies as misdemeanors yet punishes by a substantial term of imprisonment, <em>i.e.</em>, more than two years.  See \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)(B).  Congress also sought to defer to a State\xe2\x80\x99s dispensation relieving an offender from disabling effects of a conviction.  See <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa03.  Had Congress included a retention-of-rights exemption, however, the very misdemeanors it meant to cover would escape ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  See <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa010.  Logan complains of an anomalous result.  Yet the solution he proposes would also produce anomalies.  See <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa09.  Having no warrant to stray from \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)\xe2\x80\x99s text, we hold that the words \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights restored\xe2\x80\x9d do not cover the case of an offender who lost no civil rights.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is </p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Firearms Owners\xe2\x80\x99 Protection Act, 100 Stat. 449, included a \xe2\x80\x9csafety valve\xe2\x80\x9d provision under which persons subject to federal firearms disabilities, including persons whose civil rights have not been restored, may apply to the Attorney General for relief from the disabilities.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7925(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V).
