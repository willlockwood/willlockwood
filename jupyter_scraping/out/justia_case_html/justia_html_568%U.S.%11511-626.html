He had it towed several times before deciding on a marina owned by the city of Riviera Beach (City).  After various disputes with Lozman and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina, the City brought a federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home, seeking a lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass.  Lozman moved to dismiss the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction.  The District Court found the floating home to be a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under the Rules of Construction Act, which defines a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d as including \xe2\x80\x9cevery description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\xe2\x80\x9d 1  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73, concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper, and awarded the City dockage fees and nominal damages.

This interpretation is too broad.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation,\xe2\x80\x9d the conveyance of persons or things from one place to another, must be applied in a practical way.  Stewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 481\n.  Consequently, a structure does not fall within the scope of the statutory phrase unless a reasonable observer, looking to the home\xe2\x80\x99s physical characteristics and activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water.

It had no steering mechanism, had an unraked hull and rectangular bottom 10 inches below the water, and had no capacity to generate or store electricity.  It also lacked self-propulsion, differing significantly from an ordinary houseboat.

The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, read naturally, lends itself to that interpretation:  The term \xe2\x80\x9ccontrivance\xe2\x80\x9d refers to something \xe2\x80\x9cemployed in contriving to effect a purpose\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9ccraft\xe2\x80\x9d explains that purpose as \xe2\x80\x9cwater carriage and transport\xe2\x80\x9d; the addition of \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccraft\xe2\x80\x9d emphasizes the point; and the words, \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\xe2\x80\x9d drive the point home.  Both Evansville &amp; Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola Bottling Co., \n\n271 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19\n, and Stewart, supra, support this conclusion.  Evansville involved a wharfboat floated next to a dock, used to transfer cargo, and towed to harbor each winter; and Stewart involved a dredge used to remove silt from the ocean floor, which carried a captain and crew and could be navigated only by manipulating anchors and cables or by being towed.  Water transportation was not the primary purpose of either structure; neither was in motion at relevant times; and both were sometimes attached to the ocean bottom or to land.  However, Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s dredge, which was regularly, but not primarily, used to transport workers and equipment over water, fell within the statutory definition while Evansville\xe2\x80\x99s wharfboat, which was not designed to, and did not, serve a transportation function, did not.  Lower court cases, on balance, also tend to support this conclusion.  Further, the purposes of major federal maritime statutes\xe2\x80\x94e.g., admiralty provisions provide special attachment procedures lest a vessel avoid liability by sailing away, recognize that sailors face special perils at sea, and encourage shipowners to engage in port-related commerce\xe2\x80\x94reveal little reason to classify floating homes as \xe2\x80\x9cvessels.\xe2\x80\x9d  Finally, this conclusion is consistent with state laws in States where floating home owners have congregated in communities.

But the Court has considered only objective evidence, looking to the views of a reasonable observer and the physical attributes and behavior of the structure.  They also argue against using criteria that are too abstract, complex, or open-ended.  While this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is neither perfectly precise nor always determinative, it is workable and consistent and should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases.  And contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the Court sees nothing to be gained by a remand.

Rather, the statute applies to an \xe2\x80\x9cartificial contrivance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. capable of being used .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a means of transportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]ransportation\xe2\x80\x9d involves the \xe2\x80\x9cconveyance (of things or persons) from one place to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 Oxford English Dictionary 424 (2d ed. 1989) (OED).

Consequently, in our view a structure does not fall within the scope of this statutory phrase unless a reasonable observer, looking to the home\xe2\x80\x99s phys- ical characteristics and activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThough our criterion is general, the facts of this case illustrate more specifically what we have in mind.  But for the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s home suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport persons or things over water.  It had no rudder or other steering mechanism.  649 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1269.  Its hull was unraked, ibid., and it had a rectangular bottom 10 inches below the water.  Brief for Petitioner 27; App. 37.  It had no special capacity to generate or store electricity but could obtain that utility only through ongoing connections with the land.  Id., at 40.  Its small rooms looked like ordinary nonmaritime living quarters.  And those inside those rooms looked out upon the world, not through watertight portholes, but through French doors or ordinary windows.  Id., at 44\xe2\x80\x9366.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough lack of self-propulsion is not dispositive, e.g., The Robert W. Parsons, \n\n191 U.\xc2\xa0S. 17, \n31 (1903)\n, it may be a relevant physical characteristic.  And Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s home differs significantly from an ordinary houseboat in that it has no ability to propel itself.  Cf. 33 CFR \xc2\xa7173.3 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cHouseboat means a motorized vessel .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. designed primarily for multi-purpose accommodation spaces with low freeboard and little or no foredeck or cockpit\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s home was able to travel over water only by being towed.  Prior to its arrest, that home\xe2\x80\x99s travel by tow over water took place on only four occasions over a period of seven years.  Supra, at 2.  And when the home was towed a significant distance in 2006, the towing company had a second boat follow behind to prevent the home from swinging dangerously from side to side.  App. 104.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe home has no other feature that might suggest a design to transport over water anything other than its own furnishings and related personal effects.  In a word, we can find nothing about the home that could lead a reasonable observer to consider it designed to a practical degree for \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur view of the statute is consistent with its text, precedent, and relevant purposes.  For one thing, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, read naturally, lends itself to that interpretation.  We concede that the statute uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cevery,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to \xe2\x80\x9cevery description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73 (emphasis added).  But the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontrivance\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9csomething contrived for, or employed in contriving to effect a purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 OED 850 (def. 7).  The term \xe2\x80\x9ccraft\xe2\x80\x9d explains that purpose as \xe2\x80\x9cwater carriage and transport.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1104 (def. V(9)(b)) (de- fining \xe2\x80\x9ccraft\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cvesse[l] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for\xe2\x80\x9d that purpose).  The ad-dition of the word \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccraft,\xe2\x80\x9d yielding the term \xe2\x80\x9cwatercraft,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasizes the point.  And the next few words, \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\xe2\x80\x9d drive the point home.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, the bulk of precedent supports our conclusion.  In Evansville &amp; Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola Bottling Co., \n\n271 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19 (1926)\n, the Court held that a wharfboat was not a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  The wharfboat floated next to a dock; it was used to transfer cargo from ship to dock and ship to ship; and it was connected to the dock with cables, utility lines, and a ramp.  Id., at 21.  At the same time, it was capable of being towed.  And it was towed each winter to a harbor to avoid river ice.  Id., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  The Court reasoned that, despite the annual movement under tow, the wharfboat \xe2\x80\x9cwas not used to carry freight from one place to another,\xe2\x80\x9d nor did it \xe2\x80\x9cencounter perils of navigation to which craft used for transportation are exposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 22.  (See Appendix, infra, for photograph of a period wharfboat).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in Stewart also supports our conclusion.  We there considered the application of the statutory definition to a dredge.  543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 494.  The dredge was \xe2\x80\x9ca massive floating platform\xe2\x80\x9d from which a suspended clamshell bucket would \xe2\x80\x9cremov[e] silt from the ocean floor,\xe2\x80\x9d depositing it \xe2\x80\x9conto one of two scows\xe2\x80\x9d floating alongside the dredge.  Id., at 484.  Like more traditional \xe2\x80\x9cseagoing vessels,\xe2\x80\x9d the dredge had, e.g., \xe2\x80\x9ca captain and crew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining area.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Unlike more ordinary vessels, it could navigate only by \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulating its anchors and cables\xe2\x80\x9d or by being towed.  Ibid.  Nonetheless it did move. In fact it moved over water \xe2\x80\x9cevery couple of hours.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 485.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe held that the dredge was a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  We wrote that \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s definition \xe2\x80\x9cmerely codified the meaning that the term \xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99 had acquired in general maritime law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 490.  We added that the question of the \xe2\x80\x9cwatercraft\xe2\x80\x99s use \xe2\x80\x98as a means of transportation on water\xe2\x80\x99 is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. practical,\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cmerely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. theoretical.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 496.  And we pointed to cases holding that dredges ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cserved a waterborne transportation function,\xe2\x80\x9d namely that \xe2\x80\x9cin performing their work they carried machinery, equipment, and crew over water.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 491\xe2\x80\x93492 (citing, e.g., Butler v. Ellis, 45 F.\xc2\xa02d 951, 955 (CA4 1930)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court of Appeals pointed out, in Stewart we also wrote that \xc2\xa73 \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require that a watercraft be used primarily for that [transportation] purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 495; that a \xe2\x80\x9cwatercraft need not be in motion to qualify as a vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.; and that a structure may qualify as a vessel even if attached\xe2\x80\x94but not \xe2\x80\x9cpermanently\xe2\x80\x9d attached\xe2\x80\x94to the land or ocean floor.  Id., at 493\xe2\x80\x93494.  We did not take these statements, however, as implying a universal set of sufficient conditions for application of the definition.  Rather, they say, and they mean, that the statutory definition may (or may not) apply\xe2\x80\x94not that it automatically must apply\xe2\x80\x94where a structure has some other primary purpose, where it is stationary at relevant times, and where it is attached\xe2\x80\x94but not permanently attached\xe2\x80\x94to land.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter all, a washtub is normally not a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d though it does not have water transportation as its primary purpose, it may be stationary much of the time, and it might be attached\xe2\x80\x94but not permanently attached\xe2\x80\x94to land.  More to the point, water transportation was not the primary purpose of either Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s dredge or Evansville\xe2\x80\x99s wharfboat; neither structure was \xe2\x80\x9cin motion\xe2\x80\x9d at relevant times; and both were sometimes attached (though not permanently attached) to the ocean bottom or to land.  Nonetheless Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s dredge fell within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition while Evansville\xe2\x80\x99s wharfboat did not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe basic difference, we believe, is that the dredge was regularly, but not primarily, used (and designed in part to be used) to transport workers and equipment over water while the wharfboat was not designed (to any practical degree) to serve a transportation function and did not do so.  Compare Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., \n\n119 U.\xc2\xa0S. 625 (1887)\n (floating drydock not a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d because permanently fixed to wharf), with Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v.

See Brief for Seattle Floating Homes As- sociation et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 1.  A Washington State environmental statute, for example, defines a floating home (for regulatory purposes) as \xe2\x80\x9ca single-family dwelling unit constructed on a float, that is moored, anchored, or otherwise secured in waters, and is not a vessel, even though it may be capable of being towed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa790.58.270(5)(b)(ii) (Supp. 2012).  A California statute defines a floating home (for tax purposes) as \xe2\x80\x9ca floating structure\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned and built to be used, or is modified to be used, as a stationary waterborne residential dwelling,\xe2\x80\x9d and which (unlike a typical houseboat), has no independent power generation, and is dependent on shore utilities.  Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa718075.55(d) (West 2006).  These States, we are told, treat structures that meet their \xe2\x80\x9cfloating home\xe2\x80\x9d definitions like ordinary land-based homes rather than like vessels.

Consistency of interpretation of related state and federal laws is a virtue in that it helps to create simplicity making the law easier to understand and to follow for lawyers and for nonlawyers alike.

First, they ar- gue against use of any purpose-based test lest we introduce into \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d determinations a subjective element\xe2\x80\x94namely, the owner\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  That element, they say, is often \xe2\x80\x9cunverifiable\xe2\x80\x9d and too easily manipulated.  Its introduction would \xe2\x80\x9cfoment unpredictability and invite gamesmanship.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 33.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe agree with the City about the need to eliminate the consideration of evidence of subjective intent.  But we cannot agree that the need requires abandonment of all criteria based on \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. Stewart, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 495 (discussing transportation purpose).  Indeed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the use of a human \xe2\x80\x9ccontrivance\xe2\x80\x9d without some consideration of human purposes.  At the same time, we have sought to avoid subjective elements, such as owner\xe2\x80\x99s intent, by permitting consideration only of objective evidence of a waterborne transportation purpose.  That is why we have referred to the views of a reasonable observer.  Supra, at 1.  And it is why we have looked to the physical attributes and behavior of the structure, as objective manifestations of any relevant purpose, and not to the subjective intent of the owner.

Brief for Respondent 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  A court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, e.g., admiralty jurisdiction, may turn on application of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  And jurisdictional tests, often applied at the outset of a case, should be \xe2\x80\x9cas simple as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hertz Corp. v.

And we also understand that our approach is neither perfectly pre-cise nor always determinative.  Satisfaction of a design-based or purpose-related criterion, for example, is not always sufficient for application of the statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  A craft whose physical characteristics and activities objectively evidence a waterborne transportation purpose or function may still be rendered a nonvessel by later physical alterations.  For example, an owner might take a structure that is otherwise a vessel (even the Queen Mary) and connect it permanently to the land for use, say, as a hotel.  See Stewart, supra, at 493\xe2\x80\x93494.  Further, changes over time may produce a new form, i.e., a newly designed structure\xe2\x80\x94in which case it may be the new de-sign that is relevant.  See Kathriner v. Unisea, Inc., 975 F.\xc2\xa02d 657, 660 (CA9 1992) (floating processing plant was no longer a vessel where a \xe2\x80\x9clarge opening [had been] cut into her hull\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor is satisfaction of the criterion always a necessary condition, see Part IV, infra.  It is conceivable that an owner might actually use a floating structure not designed to any practical degree for transportation as, say, a ferry boat, regularly transporting goods and persons over water.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNonetheless, we believe the criterion we have used, taken together with our example of its application here, should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases where \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity\xe2\x80\x9d to transport over water is in doubt.  Moreover, borderline cases will always exist; they require a method for resolution; we believe the method we have used is workable; and, unlike, say, an \xe2\x80\x9canything that floats\xe2\x80\x9d test, it is consistent with statutory text, purpose, and precedent.  Nor do we believe that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach would prove any more workable.  For example, the dissent suggests a relevant distinction between an own- er\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclothes and personal effects\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clarge appliances (like an oven or a refrigerator).\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 8 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  But a transportation function need not turn on the size of the items in question, and we believe the line between items being transported from place to place (e.g., cargo) and items that are mere appurtenances is the one more likely to be relevant.  Cf. Benedict, American Admiralty \xc2\xa7222, at 121 (\xe2\x80\x9cA ship is usually described as consisting of the ship, her tackle, apparel, and furniture .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the dissent and the Solicitor General (as amicus for Lozman) argue that a remand is warranted for further factfinding.  See post, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29\xe2\x80\x9331.  But neither the City nor Lozman makes such a request.  Brief for Respondent 18, 49, 52.  And the only potentially relevant factual dispute the dis- sent points to is that the home suffered serious damage during a tow.  Post, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.

Before its arrest, it moved significant distances only twice in seven years.  And when it moved, it carried, not passengers or cargo, but at the very most (giving the benefit of any factual ambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its owner\xe2\x80\x99s personal effects, and personnel present to assure the home\xe2\x80\x99s safety.  649 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1268; Brief for Respondent 32; Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\xe2\x80\x9338.

At its core, vessel status has always rested upon the objective physical characteristics of a vessel (such as its structure, shape, and materials of construction), as well as its usage history.  But over time, several important principles have guided both this Court and the lower courts in determining what kinds of watercraft fall properly within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider the most basic of requirements.  For a watercraft to be \xe2\x80\x9cpractically capable\xe2\x80\x9d of maritime transportation, it must first be \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d of such transportation.  Only those structures that can simultaneously float and carry people or things over water are even presumptively within \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Stopping here, as the Eleventh Circuit essentially did, results in an overinclusive test.  Section 3, after all, does not drag every bit of floating and towable flotsam and jetsam into admiralty jurisdiction.  Rather, the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being used\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpractical\xe2\x80\x9d have real significance in our maritime jurisprudence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[A] water craft is not \xe2\x80\x98capable of being used\xe2\x80\x99 for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stewart, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 494.  So, to take an obvious example, a floating bridge over water does not constitute a vessel; such mooring is clearly permanent.  Cf. The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 216 (1867).  Less dramatically, a watercraft whose objective physical connections to land \xe2\x80\x9cevidence a permanent location\xe2\x80\x9d does not fall within \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  See, e.g., Evansville, 271 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 22 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The wharfboat] served at Evansville as an office, warehouse and wharf, and was not taken from place to place.

Stewart, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 493.  \xe2\x80\x9cPurpose,\xe2\x80\x9d in this context, is determined solely by an objective inquiry into a craft\xe2\x80\x99s function.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]either size, form, equipment nor means of propulsion are determinative factors upon the question of [vessel status],\xe2\x80\x9d though all may be considered.  The Robert W. Parsons, \n\n191 U. S. 17, \n30 (1903)\n.  Moreover, in assessing a particular structure\xe2\x80\x99s function, we have consis- tently examined its past and present activities.  Stewart, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 495; Cope, 119 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 627.  Of course, a seaborne craft is not excluded from vessel status simply because its \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is not maritime transport. Stewart, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 497.  We held as much in Stewart when we concluded that a dredge was a vessel notwithstanding that its \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cdredging rather than transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 486, 495.

Fortunately, courts do not consider each floating structure anew.  So, for example, when we were confronted in Stewart with the question whether a dredge is a \xc2\xa73 vessel, we did not commence with a clean slate; we instead sought guidance from previous cases that had confronted similar structures.  See id., at 490, and n.\xc2\xa05; see also Norton v.

First, the capacity to float and carry things or people is an obvious prerequisite to vessel status.  Second, structures or ships that are permanently moored or fixed in place are not \xc2\xa73 vessels.  Likewise, structures that are practically incapable of maritime transport are not vessels, whether they are ships that have been altered so that they may no longer be put to sea, dead ships, or ships removed from navigation for extended periods of time.  Third, those watercraft whose physical characteristics and usage history reveal no maritime transport purpose or use are not \xc2\xa73 vessels.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority does not appear to disavow the legal principles described above.

This phrasing has never appeared in any of our cases and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s use of it, despite its seemingly objective gloss, effectively (and erroneously) introduces a subjective component into the vessel-status inquiry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, in applying this test the majority points to some characteristics of Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft that have no relationship to maritime transport, such as the style of the craft\xe2\x80\x99s rooms or that \xe2\x80\x9cthose inside those rooms looked out upon the world, not through water-tight portholes, but through French doors or ordinary windows.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 5.  The majority never explains why it believes these particular esthetic elements are important for determining vessel status.  In fact, they are not.  Section 3 is focused on whether a structure is \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  By importing windows, doors, room style, and other esthetic criteria into the \xc2\xa73 analysis, the majority gives our vessel test an \xe2\x80\x9cI know it when I see it\xe2\x80\x9d flavor.  Jacobellis v. Ohio, \n\n378 U.\xc2\xa0S. 184, \n197 (1964)\n (Stewart, J., concurring).  But that has never been nor should it be the test: A badly designed and unattractive vessel is different from a structure that lacks any \xe2\x80\x9cpractical capacity\xe2\x80\x9d for maritime transport.  In the major- ity\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, the two appear to be one and the same.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the craft\xe2\x80\x99s past voyages is also strange.  The majority notes that Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft could be and was, in fact, towed over long distances, including over 200 miles at one point.  Ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x936.  But the major- ity determines that, given the design of Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft, this is \xe2\x80\x9cfar too little actual \xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 to bring the floating home within the terms of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  This is because \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it moved, it carried, not passengers or cargo, but at the very most (giving the benefit of any factual ambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its owner\xe2\x80\x99s personal effects, and personnel present to assure the home\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI find this analysis confusing.  The majority accepts that the record indicates that Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft traveled hundreds of miles while \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying people or things.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 1.  But then, in the same breath, the majority concludes that a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable observer\xe2\x80\x9d would nonetheless conclude that the craft was not \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to any practical degree for carrying people or things on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The majority fails to explain how a craft that apparently did carry people and things over water for long distances was not \xe2\x80\x9cpractically capable\xe2\x80\x9d of maritime transport. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not to say that a structure capable of such feats is necessarily a vessel.  A craft like Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s might not be a vessel, for example, if it could only carry its owner\xe2\x80\x99s clothes and personal effects, or if it is only capable of transporting itself and its appurtenances.  Jerome B. Gru- bart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., \n\n513 U. S. 527, \n535 (1995)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]aritime law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ordinarily treats an \xe2\x80\x98appurtenance\xe2\x80\x99 attached to a vessel in navigable waters as part of the vessel itself\xe2\x80\x9d).  But if such a craft can carry large appliances (like an oven or a refrigerator) and all of the other things we might find in a normal home in addition to the occupants of that home, as the existing record suggests Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft may have done, then it would seem to be much more like a mobile home (and therefore a vessel) than a firmly rooted residence.  The simple truth is that we know very little about the craft\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities and what did or did not happen on its various trips.  By fo- cusing on the little we do know for certain about this craft (i.e., its windows, doors, and the style of its rooms) in determining whether it is a vessel, the majority renders the \xc2\xa73 inquiry opaque and unpredictable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the little we do know about Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft suggests only that it was an unusual structure.  A sur- veyor was unable to find any comparable craft for sale in the State of Florida.  App. 43.  Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s home was neither obviously a houseboat, as the majority describes such ships, ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, nor clearly a floating home, ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  See App. 13, 31, 79 (sale, lease, and surveying documents describing Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft as a \xe2\x80\x9chouseboat\xe2\x80\x9d).  The only clear difference that the majority identifies between these two kinds of structures is that the former are self-propelled, while the latter are not.  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  But even the majority recognizes that self-propulsion has never been a prerequisite for vessel status.  Ante, at 5 (citing The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 31); see Norton, 321 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571.  Consequently, it is unclear why Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft is a floating home, why all floating homes are not vessels,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t or why Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft is not a vessel.  If windows, doors, and other esthetic attributes are what take Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft out of vessel status, then the major- ity\xe2\x80\x99s test is completely malleable.  If it is the craft\xe2\x80\x99s lack of self-propulsion, then the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test is unfaithful to our longstanding precedents.  See The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  If it is something else, then that something is not apparent from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWorse still, in straining to find that Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft was a floating home and therefore not a vessel, the major- ity calls into question the conclusions of numerous lower courts that have found houseboats that lacked self-propulsion to be \xc2\xa73 vessels.  See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (citing Miami River Boat Yard, Inc. v. 60\xe2\x80\x99 Houseboat, 390 F. 2d 596, 597 (CA5 1968); Sea Village Marina, LLC v. A 1980 Carlcraft Houseboat, No. 09\xe2\x80\x933292, 2009 WL 3379923, *5\xe2\x80\x93*6 (D NJ, Oct. 19, 2009); Hudson Harbor 79th Street Boat Basin, Inc. v. Sea Casa, 469 F. Supp. 987, 989 (SDNY 1979)).  The majority incorrectly suggests that these cases applied an \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98anything that floats\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d test.  Ante, at 9.  These cases suggest something different.  Many of these decisions in assessing the crafts before them looked carefully at these crafts\xe2\x80\x99 structure and function, and determined that these ships had capabilities similar to other long-established vessels, suggesting a significant maritime transportation function.  See Miami River Boat Yard, 390 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 597 (likening houseboat at issue to a \xe2\x80\x9cbarg[e]\xe2\x80\x9d); Sea Village Marina, 2009 WL 3379923, *7 (\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the available evidence, [the houseboats in question] float and can be towed to a new marina without substantial effort .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x9d); Hudson Harbor, 469 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 989 (houseboat \xe2\x80\x9cwas capable of being used at least to the extent that a \xe2\x80\x98dumb barge\xe2\x80\x99 is capable of being used\xe2\x80\x9d and comparable to a \xe2\x80\x9cyach[t]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Their holdings are consistent with older cases, see, e.g., The Ark, 17 F. 2d 446, 447 (SD Fla. 1926), and the crafts at issue in these cases have been widely accepted as vessels by most treatises in this area, see 1 S. Friedell, Benedict on Admiralty \xc2\xa7164, p. 10\xe2\x80\x936, n. 2 (7th ed. rev. 2012); 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty &amp; Maritime Law \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x936, p. 153, n. 10 (5th ed. 2011); 1 R. Force &amp; M. Norris, The Law of Seamen \xc2\xa72:12, p. 2\xe2\x80\x9382 (5th ed. 2003).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test necessitates jettisoning these other precedents is simply wrong.  And, in its rejection, the majority works real damage to what has long been a settled area of maritime law.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith a more developed record, Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft might be distinguished from the houseboats in those lower court cases just discussed.  For example, if Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft\xe2\x80\x99s previous voyages caused it serious damage, then that would strongly suggest that it lacked a maritime trans- portation purpose or function.  There is no harm in remanding the case for further factfinding along the lines described above, cautioning the lower courts to be aware that features of Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cincomparable\xe2\x80\x9d craft, see App. 43, may distinguish it from previous precedents.  At most, such a remand would introduce a relatively short delay before finally ending the years-long battle between Lozman and the city of Riviera Beach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, there is great harm in stretching the facts below and overriding settled and likely correct lower court precedents to reach the unnecessary conclusion that Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft was not a vessel.  Without an objective application of the \xc2\xa73 standard, one that relies in a predictable fashion only on those physical characteristics of a craft that are related to maritime transport and use, parties will have no ex ante notion whether a particular ship is a vessel.  As a wide range of amici have cautioned us, numerous maritime industries rely heavily on clear and predictable legal rules for determining which ships are vessels.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s distorted application of our settled law to the facts of this case frustrates these ends.  Moreover, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision reaches well beyond rel- atively insignificant boats like Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft, id., at 79 (listing purchase price of Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft as $17,000), because it specifically disapproves of lower court decisions dealing with much larger ships, see ante, at 10 (questioning Holmes v. Atlantic Sounding Co., 437 F.\xc2\xa03d 441 (CA5 2006) (finding a 140-foot-long and 40-foot-wide dormitory barge with 50 beds to be a \xc2\xa73 vessel)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is not clear that Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft is a \xc2\xa73 vessel.  It is clear, however, that we are not in a good position to make such a determination based on the limited record we pos- sess.  The appropriate response is to remand the case for further proceedings in light of the proper legal standard.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29\xe2\x80\x9331.  The Court resists this move and in its haste to christen Lozman\xe2\x80\x99s craft a nonvessel delivers an analysis that will confuse the lower courts and upset our longstanding admiralty precedent.
