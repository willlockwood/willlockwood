The plaintiff and defendant having some controversy about a tract of land, in Luzerne county, agreed to try the right to the possession in a summary manner, in the Court of Common Pleas, and the proceedings were drawn up, as if it had been a plaint under the landlord and tenant act.* The Jury having awarded possession to Lee, (the defendant in error,) judgment was rendered for him; and a writ of possession was issued, by virtue of which Fitzalden was turned out, and Lee put into possession. On error being brought, Ingersoll admitted that he could not support the judgment; but contended, that, as this proceeding was a matter of mutual consent and agreement, the Court ought not to aid the plaintiff in error to get back the possession of the land. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 2 U.S. 205, 206</a></p><p> The Court reversed the judgment. </p><p> Afterwards, Serjeant moved for a writ of restitution; and urged that it was a matter of right. 9 Vin. 589. 90.
