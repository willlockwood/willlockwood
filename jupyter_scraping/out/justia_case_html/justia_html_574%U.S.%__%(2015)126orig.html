In 1998, Kansas filed an original action in this Court contending that Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s increased groundwater pumping was subject to regulation by the Compact to the extent that it depleted stream flow in the Basin.  This Court agreed.  Ensuing negotiations resulted in the 2002 Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement), which established mechanisms to accurately measure water and promote compliance with the Compact.  The Settlement identified the Accounting Procedures, a technical appendix, as the tool by which the States would measure stream flow depletion, and thus consumption, due to groundwater pumping.  The Settlement also reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9cimported water\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, water brought into the Basin by human activity\xe2\x80\x94would not count toward a State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption.

Nebraska responded that the Accounting Procedures improperly charged the State for using imported water and requested that the Accounting Procedures be modified accordingly.  The Court appointed a Special Master.  His report concludes that Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly failed\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the Compact, recommends that Nebraska disgorge a portion of its gains in addition to paying damages for Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s loss, and recommends denying Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s request for an injunction.  In addition, the report recommends reforming the Accounting Procedures.

Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it could not have anticipated unprecedented drought conditions fails, because its efforts to comply would have been inadequate absent the luckiest of circumstances.  Nor can the State find refuge in the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s retrospective compliance calculation methods, because it had been warned each year leading up to the final compliance check that it had exceeded its allotment.  The Court therefore agrees with the Master that Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly exposed Kansas to a substantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of receiving less water than it was entitled to under the Compact.  Report 130.  In other words, Nebraska recklessly gambled with Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s rights.

Nebraska contends that disgorgement is improper because it did not act \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately,\xe2\x80\x9d which it argues is required for disgorgement in a private contract suit.  But disgorgement is appropriate where one State has recklessly gambled with another State\xe2\x80\x99s rights to a scarce natural resource. This Court has said that awarding actual damages in a compact case may be inadequate to deter an upstream State from ignoring its obligations where it is advantageous to do so. <i>Texas </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 482 U. S., at 132.<i> </i>Here, Nebraska took full advantage of its favorable geographic position. And because of the higher value of water on Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s farmland than on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s, Nebraska could take Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s water, pay damages, and still benefit. This Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial authority extends to providing a remedy capable of stabilizing the Compact and deterring future breaches, and a disgorgement award appropriately does so here. Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        \n            \n        (b)\xc2\xa0Contrary to Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s contentions, the Master\xe2\x80\x99s partial disgorgement award is sufficient to achieve those goals.  The \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility inherent in equitable remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Plata</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, allows the Court to order partial disgorgement if appropriate to the facts of the particular case, cf. <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  The Special Master properly took into account Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s incentives, past behavior, and especially its more recent successful compliance efforts to determine that a small disgorgement award suffices.  For related reasons, Kansas has failed to demonstrate a \xe2\x80\x9ccognizable danger of recurrent violation\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to obtain an injunction.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>W. T. Grant Co.</i>,\n\n345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 629\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        3.\xc2\xa0The Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to amend the Accounting Procedures so that they no longer charge Nebraska for imported water is adopted, and Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s exception is overruled.  As the Special Master found, in dry conditions, the Accounting Procedures improperly treat Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s use of imported water as if it were use of Basin water.  Nothing suggests that anyone seriously thought the Accounting Procedures would systematically err in this way.  Rather, the Procedures\xe2\x80\x99 designers assumed that they had succeeded in their goal to implement a strict demarcation between virgin and imported water.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        Kansas argues that in spite of these failures, the States must be held to the bargain they struck.  That is the ordinary rule.  But two special considerations warrant conforming the Accounting Procedures to the Compact and the Settlement.  First, the remedy is necessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting the States\xe2\x80\x99 intended apportionment of interstate waters, as reflected in those documents.  Doing so is consistent with past instances where this Court opted to modify a technical agreement to correct material errors in the way it operates and thus align it with the compacting States\xe2\x80\x99 intended apportionment.  Second, this remedy is required to avert an outright breach of the Compact\xe2\x80\x94and so a violation of federal law.  As written, the Accounting Procedures go beyond the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries and deprive Nebraska of its compact rights.  The Master\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9c5-run formula\xe2\x80\x9d solves this problem by excluding imported water from the calculation of each State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption.  Given Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s failure despite ample opportunity to devise another solution or to demonstrate flaws in this one, as well the long and contentious history of this case that casts doubt on the States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to come to an agreement themselves, the Court adopts the Master\xe2\x80\x99s solution.

The first round of litigation ended with a settlement agreement designed to elaborate on, and promote future compliance with, the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  The States now bring new claims against each other arising from the implementation of that settlement.  Kansas seeks exceptional relief\xe2\x80\x94both partial disgorgement of gains and an injunction\xe2\x80\x94for Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s conceded overconsumption of water.  For its part, Nebraska requests amendment of a technical appendix to the settlement, so that allocations of water will faithfully reflect the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent as expressed in both the body of that agreement and the Compact itself.  We referred the case to a Special Master and now accept his recommendations as to appropriate equitable remedies: for Kansas, partial disgorgement but no injunction; and for Nebraska, reform of the appendix.</p><p>I</p><p>                    The Republican River originates in Colorado; crosses the northwestern corner of Kansas into Nebraska; flows through much of southwestern Nebraska; and finally cuts back into northern Kansas.  Along with its many tributaries, the river drains a 24,900-square-mile watershed, called the Republican River Basin.  The Basin contains substantial farmland, producing (among other things) wheat and corn.</p><p>                    During the Dust Bowl of the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, the Republican River Basin experienced an extended drought, interrupted once by a deadly flood.  In response, the Federal Government proposed constructing reservoirs in the Basin to control flooding, as well as undertaking an array of irrigation projects to disperse the stored water.  But the Government insisted that the three States of the Basin first agree to an allocation of its water resources.  As a result of that prodding, the States negotiated and ratified the Republican River Compact; and in 1943, as required under the Constitution, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa03, Congress approved that agreement.  By act of Congress, the Compact thus became federal law.  See Act of May 26, 1943, ch. 104,57Stat.86.</p><p>                    The Compact apportions among the three States the \xe2\x80\x9cvirgin water supply originating in\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and, as we will later discuss, originating <i>only</i> in\xe2\x80\x94the Republican River Basin.  Compact Art.\xc2\xa0III; see <i>infra</i>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9328.  \xe2\x80\x9cVirgin water supply,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the Compact, means \xe2\x80\x9cthe water supply within the Basin,\xe2\x80\x9d in both the River and its tributaries, \xe2\x80\x9cundepleted by the activities of man.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compact<i> </i>Art. II.  The Compact gives each State a set share of that supply\xe2\x80\x94roughly, 49% to Nebraska, 40% to Kansas, and 11% to Colorado\xe2\x80\x94for any \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficial consumptive use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, Art.\xc2\xa0IV; see Art.\xc2\xa0II (defining that term to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthat use by which the water supply of the Basin is consumed through the activities of man\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, the Compact charges the chief water official of each State with responsibility to jointly administer the agreement.  See <i>id.,</i> Art.\xc2\xa0IX.  Pursuant to that provision, the States created the Republican River Compact Administration (RRCA).  The RRCA\xe2\x80\x99s chief task is to calculate the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s annual virgin water supply by measuring stream flow throughout the area, and to determine (retrospectively) whether each State\xe2\x80\x99s use of that water has stayed within its allocation.</p><p>                    All was smooth sailing for decades, until Kansas complained to this Court about Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s increased pumping of groundwater, resulting from that State\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of wells hydraulically connected to the Republican River and its tributaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bill of Complaint, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1997, No. 126, Orig., p. 5 (May 26, 1998).  Kansas contended that such activity was subject to the Compact: To the extent groundwater pumping depleted stream flow in the Basin, it counted against the pumping State\xe2\x80\x99s annual allotment of water.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  Nebraska maintained, to the contrary, that groundwater pumping fell outside the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s scope, even if that activity diminished stream flow in the area.  A Special Master we appointed favored Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Compact; we summarily agreed, and recommitted the case to him for further proceedings.  See <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Nebraska</i>,530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1272 (2000).  The States then entered into negotiations, aimed primarily at determining how best to measure, and reflect in Compact accounting, the depletion of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s stream flow due to groundwater pumping.  During those discussions, the States also addressed a range of other matters affecting Compact administration.  The talks bore fruit in 2002, when the States signed the Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement).</p><p>                    The Settlement established detailed mechanisms to promote compliance with the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  The States agreed that the Settlement was not \xe2\x80\x9cintended to, nor could [it], change [their] respective rights and obligations under the Compact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Settlement \xc2\xa7I(D).  Rather, the agreement aimed to accurately measure the supply and use of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s water, and to assist the States in staying within their prescribed limits.  To smooth out year-to-year fluctuations and otherwise facilitate compliance, the Settlement based all Compact accounting on 5-year running averages, reduced to 2-year averages in \xe2\x80\x9cwater-short\xe2\x80\x9d periods.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7IV(D), V(B).  That change gave each State a chance to compensate for one (or more) year\xe2\x80\x99s overuse with another (or more) year\xe2\x80\x99s underuse before exceeding its allocation.  The Settlement further provided, in line with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, that groundwater pumping would count as part of a State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption to the extent it depleted the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s stream flow.  An appendix to the agreement called the \xe2\x80\x9cAccounting Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d described how a later-developed \xe2\x80\x9cGroundwater Model\xe2\x80\x9d (essentially, a mass of computer code) would perform those computations.  <i>Id.</i>, App. C; <i>id.</i>, App. J1. And finally, the Settlement made clear, in accordance with the Compact, that a State\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cimported water\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, water farmers bring into the area (usually for irrigation) that eventually seeps into the Republican River\xe2\x80\x94would <i>not </i>count toward the State\xe2\x80\x99s allocation, because it did not originate in the Basin.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7II, IV(F).  Once again, the Settlement identified the Accounting Procedures and Groundwater Model as the tools to calculate (so as to exclude) that consumption.</p><p>                    But there were more rapids ahead: By 2007, Kansas and Nebraska each had complaints about how the Settlement was working.  Kansas protested that in the 2005\xe2\x80\x932006 accounting period\xe2\x80\x94the first for which the Settlement held States responsible\xe2\x80\x94Nebraska had substantially exceeded its allocation of water.  Nebraska, for its part, maintained that the Accounting Procedures and Groundwater Model were charging the State for use of imported water\xe2\x80\x94specifically, for water originating in the Platte River Basin.  The States brought those disputes to the RRCA and then to non-binding arbitration, in accordance with the Settlement\xe2\x80\x99s dispute resolution provisions.  After failing to resolve the disagreements in those forums, Kansas sought redress in this Court, petitioning for both monetary and injunctive relief.  We referred the case to a Special Master to consider Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  See 563 U. S. ___ (2011).  In that proceeding, Nebraska asserted a counterclaim requesting a modification of the Accounting Procedures to ensure that its use of Platte River water would not count toward its Compact allocation.</p><p>                    After two years of conducting hearings, receiving evidence, and entertaining legal arguments, the Special Master issued his report and recommendations.  The Master concluded that Nebraska had \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly failed\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the Compact in the 2005\xe2\x80\x932006 accounting period, by consuming 70,869 acre-feet of water in excess of its prescribed share.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  Report 112.  To remedy that breach, the Master proposed awarding Kansas $3.7 million for its loss, and another $1.8 million in partial disgorgement of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s still greater gains.  The Master, however, thought that an injunction against Nebraska was not warranted.  In addition, the Master recommended reforming the Accounting Procedures in line with Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s request, to ensure that the State would not be charged with using Platte River water.</p><p>                    Kansas and Nebraska each filed exceptions in this Court to parts of the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s report.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  Nebraska objects to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d breach and his call for partial disgorgement of its gains.  Kansas asserts that the Master should have recommended both a larger disgorgement award and injunctive relief; the State also objects to his proposed change to the Accounting Procedures.  In reviewing those claims, this Court gives the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings \xe2\x80\x9crespect and a tacit presumption of correctness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Colorado</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310,317 (1984).  But we conduct an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent review of the record,\xe2\x80\x9d and assume \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate responsibility for deciding\xe2\x80\x9d all matters.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Having carried out that careful review, we now overrule all exceptions and adopt the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations.</p><p>II</p><p>                    The Constitution gives this Court original jurisdiction to hear suits between the States.  See Art. III, \xc2\xa72.  Proceedings under that grant of jurisdiction are \xe2\x80\x9cbasically equi-table in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Kentucky</i>,410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 641,648 (1973).<b> </b>When the Court exercises its original jurisdiction over a controversy between two States, it serves \xe2\x80\x9cas a substitute for the diplomatic settlement of controversies between sovereigns and a possible resort to force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>North Dakota</i> v. <i>Minnesota</i>,263 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365\xe2\x80\x93373 (1923).  That role significantly \xe2\x80\x9cdiffer[s] from\xe2\x80\x9d the one the Court undertakes \xe2\x80\x9cin suits between private parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 372; see Frankfurter &amp; Landis, The Compact Clause of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L. J. 685, 705 (1925) (When a \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy concerns two States we are at once in a world wholly different from that of a law-suit between John Doe and Richard Roe over the metes and bounds of Blackacre\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this singular sphere, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court may regulate and mould the process it uses in such a manner as in its judgment will best promote the purposes of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kentucky</i> v. <i>Dennison</i>, 24 How. 66, 98 (1861).</p><p>                    Two particular features of this interstate controversy further distinguish it from a run-of-the-mill private suit and highlight the essentially equitable character of our charge.  The first relates to the subject matter of the Compact and Settlement: rights to an interstate waterway.  The second concerns the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s status as not just an agreement, but a federal law.  Before proceeding to the merits of this dispute, we say a few words about each.</p><p>                    This Court has recognized for more than a century its inherent authority, as part of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s grant of original jurisdiction, to equitably apportion interstate streams between States.  In <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,185 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125,145 (1902), we confronted a simple consequence of geography: An upstream State can appropriate all water from a river, thus \xe2\x80\x9cwholly depriv[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a downstream State \xe2\x80\x9cof the benefit of water\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cby nature\xe2\x80\x9d would flow into its territory.  In such a circumstance, the downstream State lacks the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s usual power to respond\xe2\x80\x94the capacity to \xe2\x80\x9cmake war[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. grant letters of marque and reprisal,\xe2\x80\x9d or even enter into agreements without the consent of Congress.  <i>Id.,</i> at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cBound hand and foot by the prohibitions of the Constitution, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a resort to the judicial power is the only means left\xe2\x80\x9d for stopping an inequitable taking of water.  <i>Id.,</i> at 144 (quoting <i>Rhode Island</i> v. <i>Massachusetts</i>, 12 Pet. 657, 726 (1838)).</p><p>                    This Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to apportion interstate streams encourages States to enter into compacts with each other.  When the division of water is not \xe2\x80\x9cleft to the pleasure\xe2\x80\x9d of the upstream State, but States instead \xe2\x80\x9cknow[\xc2\xa0] that some tribunal can decide on the right,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversies will [probably] be settled by compact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>, 185 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144.  And that, of course, is what happened here: Kansas and Nebraska negotiated a compact to divide the waters of the Republican River and its tributaries.  Our role thus shifts: It is now to declare rights under the Compact and enforce its terms.  See <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 554,567 (1983).</p><p>                    But in doing so, we remain aware that the States bargained for those rights in the shadow of our equitable apportionment power\xe2\x80\x94that is, our capacity to prevent one State from taking advantage of another.  Each State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright to invoke the original jurisdiction of this Court [is] an important part of the context\xe2\x80\x9d in which any compact is made.  <i>Id.,</i> at 569.  And it is \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to conceive\xe2\x80\x9d that a downstream State \xe2\x80\x9cwould trade away its right\xe2\x80\x9d to our equitable apportionment if, under such an agreement, an upstream State could avoid its obligations or otherwise continue overreaching.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Accordingly, our enforcement authority includes the ability to provide the remedies necessary to prevent abuse.  We may invoke equitable principles, so long as consistent with the compact itself, to devise \xe2\x80\x9cfair .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. solution[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to the state-parties\xe2\x80\x99 disputes and provide effective relief for their violations.  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124,134 (1987) (supplying an \xe2\x80\x9cadditional enforcement mechanism\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure an upstream State\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with a compact).[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>                    And that remedial authority gains still greater force because the Compact, having received Congress\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, counts as federal law.  See <i>Cuyler</i> v. <i>Adams</i>,449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433,438 (1981) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ongressional consent transforms an interstate compact .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into a law of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  Of course, that legal status underscores a limit on our enforcement power: We may not \xe2\x80\x9corder relief inconsistent with [a compact\xe2\x80\x99s] express terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564.  But within those limits, the Court may exercise its full authority to remedy violations of and promote compliance with the agreement, so as to give complete effect to public law.  As we have previously put the point: When federal law is at issue and \xe2\x80\x9cthe public interest is involved,\xe2\x80\x9d a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cequitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Warner Holding Co.</i>,328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395,398 (1946); see <i>Virginian R. Co.</i> v. <i>Railway Employees</i>,300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 515,552 (1937) (\xe2\x80\x9cCourts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther\xe2\x80\x9d to give \xe2\x80\x9crelief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  In exercising our jurisdiction, we may \xe2\x80\x9cmould each decree to the necessities of the particular case\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caccord full justice\xe2\x80\x9d to all parties.  <i>Porter</i>, 328 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 398 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>Kentucky</i> v. <i>Dennison</i>, 65 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98.  These principles inform our consideration of the dispute before us.</p><p>III</p><p>                    We first address Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s breach of the Compact and Settlement and the remedies appropriate to that violation.  Both parties assent to the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s finding that in 2005\xe2\x80\x932006 Nebraska exceeded its allocation of water by 70,869 acre-feet\xe2\x80\x94about 17% more than its proper share.  See Report 88\xe2\x80\x9389; App. B to Reply Brief for Kansas.  They similarly agree that this overconsumption resulted in a $3.7 million loss to Kansas; and Nebraska has agreed to pay those damages.  See Reply Brief for Kansas 9, 55; Brief for Nebraska 7.  But the parties dispute whether Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s conduct warrants additional relief.  The Master determined that Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly exposed Kansas to a substantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of breach, and so \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly failed\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the Compact.  Report 130, 112; see <i>supra,</i> at 5.  Based in part on that finding, he recommended disgorgement of $1.8 million, which he described as \xe2\x80\x9ca small portion of the amount by which Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s gain exceeds Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s loss.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 179.  But he declined to grant Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s request for injunctive relief against Nebraska.  See <i>id.,</i> at 180\xe2\x80\x93186.  As noted previously, see <i>supra,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936, each party finds something to dislike in the Master\xe2\x80\x99s handling of this issue: Nebraska contests his finding of a \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d Compact violation and his view that disgorgement is appropriate; Kansas wants a larger disgorgement award and an injunction regulating Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s future conduct.  We address those exceptions in turn.</p><p>A</p><p>1</p><p>                    When they entered into the Settlement in 2002, the States understood that Nebraska would have to significantly reduce its consumption of Republican River water.  See Report 106.  The Settlement, after all, charged Nebraska for its depletion of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s stream flow due to groundwater pumping\xe2\x80\x94an amount the State had not previously counted toward its allotment.  See <i>supra</i>, at 3.  Nebraska did not have to achieve all that reduction in the next year: The Settlement\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of multi-year averages to measure consumption allowed the State some time\xe2\x80\x94how much depended on whether and when \xe2\x80\x9cwater-short\xe2\x80\x9d conditions existed\xe2\x80\x94to come into compliance.  See Settlement \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7IV(D), V(B)(2)(e)(i), App. B; <i>supra</i>, at 4.  As it turned out, the area experienced a drought in 2006; accordingly, Nebraska first needed to demonstrate compliance in that year, based on the State\xe2\x80\x99s average consumption of water in 2005 and 2006.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  And at that initial compliance check, despite having enjoyed several years to prepare, Nebraska came up markedly short.</p><p>                    Nebraska contends, contrary to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s finding, that it could not have anticipated breaching the Compact in those years.  By its account, the State took \xe2\x80\x9cpersistent and earnest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94steps to comply with the agreement, including amending its water law to reduce groundwater pumping.  Brief for Nebraska 9, 17.  And Nebraska could not have foreseen (or so it claims) that those measures would prove inadequate.  First, Nebraska avers, drought conditions between 2002 and 2006 reduced the State\xe2\x80\x99s yearly allotments to historically low levels; the Master was thus \xe2\x80\x9cunfair to suggest Nebraska should have anticipated what never before was known.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 17.  And second, Nebraska stresses, the RRCA determines each State\xe2\x80\x99s use of water only retrospectively, calculating each spring what a State consumed the year before; hence, Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9ccould not have known\xe2\x80\x9d that it was out of compliance in 2006 \xe2\x80\x9cuntil early 2007\xe2\x80\x94when it was already too late.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 18; see <i>supra,</i> at 3.</p><p>                    But that argument does not hold water: Rather, as the Special Master found, Nebraska failed to put in place adequate mechanisms for staying within its allotment in the face of a known substantial risk that it would otherwise violate Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  See Report 105\xe2\x80\x93112, 130.  As an initial matter, the State\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to reduce its use of Republican River water came at a snail-like pace.  The Nebraska Legislature waited a year and a half after signing the Settlement to amend the State\xe2\x80\x99s water law.  See \xc2\xa755, 2004 Neb. Laws p. 352, codified at Neb. Rev. Stat. 46\xe2\x80\x93715.  And the fix the legislature adopted\xe2\x80\x94the development of regional water management plans meant to decrease groundwater pumping\xe2\x80\x94did not go into effect for still another year.  Nebraska thus wasted the time following the Settlement\xe2\x80\x94a crucial period to begin bringing down the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption.  Indeed, the State\xe2\x80\x99s overuse of Republican River water actually <i>rose </i>significantly<i> </i>from 2003 through 2005, making compliance at the eventual day of reckoning ever more difficult to achieve.  See Report 108\xe2\x80\x93109.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  And to make matters worse, Nebraska knew that decreasing pumping does not instantly boost stream flow: A time lag, of as much as a year, exists between the one and the other.  See <i>id.,</i> at 106.  So Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s several-year delay in taking any corrective action foreseeably raised the risk that the State would breach the Compact.</p><p>                    Still more important, what was too late was also too little.  The water management plans finally adopted in 2005 called for only a 5% reduction in groundwater pumping, although no evidence suggested that would suffice.  The testimony presented to the Special Master gave not a hint that the state and local officials charged with formulating those plans had conducted a serious appraisal of how much change would be necessary.  See <i>id.</i>, at 107\xe2\x80\x93108.  And the State had created no way to enforce even the paltry goal the plans set.  The Nebraska Legislature chose to leave operational control of water use in the hands of district boards consisting primarily of irrigators, who are among the immediate beneficiaries of pumping.  No sanctions or other mechanisms held those local bodies to account if they failed to meet the plans\xe2\x80\x99 benchmark.  They bore no legal responsibility for complying with the Compact, and assumed no share of the penalties the State would pay for violations.  See <i>id.,</i> at 110\xe2\x80\x93111.  Given such a dearth of tools or incentives to achieve compliance, the wonder is only that Nebraska did not still further exceed its allotment.</p><p>                    Nor do Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s excuses change our view of its misbehavior.  True enough, the years following the Settlement were exceptionally arid.  But the Compact and Settlement (unsurprisingly) contemplate wet and dry years alike.  By contrast, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s plans could have brought it into compliance only if the Basin had received a stretch of copious rainfall.  See <i>id.,</i> at 109\xe2\x80\x93110.  And Nebraska cannot take refuge in the timing of the RRCA\xe2\x80\x99s calculations.  By the time the compliance check of 2006 loomed, Nebraska knew that it had exceeded its allotment (by an ever greater margin) in each of the three previous years.  As Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s own witnesses informed the Special Master, they \xe2\x80\x9ccould clearly see\xe2\x80\x9d by the beginning of 2006 \xe2\x80\x9cthat [the State] had not done enough\xe2\x80\x9d to come into compliance.  <i>Id.,</i> at 109 (quoting Tr. 1333 (Aug. 21, 2012)).  Indeed, in that year, Nebraska began purchasing its farmers\xe2\x80\x99 rights to surface water in order to mitigate its anticipated breach.  But that last-minute effort, in the Master\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cfell woefully short\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as at that point could only have been expected.  Report 109.<i> </i>From the outset of the Settlement through 2006, Nebraska headed\xe2\x80\x94absent the luckiest of circumstances\xe2\x80\x94straight toward a Compact violation.</p><p>                    For these reasons, we agree with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly exposed Kansas to a substantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of receiving less water than the Compact provided, and so \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly failed\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the obligations that agreement imposed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 130, 112.  In the early years of the Settlement, as the Master explained, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s compliance efforts were not only inadequate, but also \xe2\x80\x9creluctant,\xe2\x80\x9d showing a disinclination \xe2\x80\x9cto take [the] firm action\xe2\x80\x9d necessary \xe2\x80\x9cto meet the challenges of foresee-ably varying conditions in the Basin.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 105.  Or said another way, Nebraska recklessly gambled with Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s rights, consciously disregarding a substantial probability that its actions would deprive Kansas of the water to which it was entitled.  See Tr. 1870 (Aug. 23, 2012) (Master\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Nebraska showed \xe2\x80\x9creckless indifference as to compliance back in \xe2\x80\x9905 and \xe2\x80\x9906\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>2</p><p>                    After determining that Kansas lost $3.7 million from Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s breach, the Special Master considered the case for an additional monetary award.  Based on detailed evidence, not contested here, he concluded that an acre-foot of water is substantially more valuable on farmland in Nebraska than in Kansas.  That meant Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s reward for breaching the Compact was \xe2\x80\x9cmuch larger than Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 loss, likely by more than several multiples.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 178.  Given the circumstances, the Master thought that Nebraska should have to disgorge part of that additional gain, to the tune of $1.8 million.  In making that recommendation, he relied on his finding\xe2\x80\x94which we have just affirmed\xe2\x80\x94of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s culpability.  See <i>id.,</i> at 130.  He also highlighted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s broad remedial powers in compact litigation, noting that such cases involve not private parties\xe2\x80\x99 private quarrels, but States\xe2\x80\x99 clashes over federal law.  See <i>id.,</i> at 131, 135; <i>supra,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x939.</p><p>                    Nebraska (along with the dissent) opposes the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s disgorgement proposal on the ground that the State did not \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately act[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d to violate the Compact.  Reply Brief for Nebraska 33; see <i>post</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Relying on private contract law, Nebraska cites a Restatement provision declaring that a court may award disgorgement in certain cases in which \xe2\x80\x9ca deliberate breach of contract results in profit to the defaulting promisor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \xc2\xa739(1) (2010) (Restatement); see Reply Brief for Nebraska 32.  Nebraska then points out that the Master, even though finding a \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d exposure of Kansas to significant risk, rejected the idea that \xe2\x80\x9cNebraska officials [had] deliber-ately set out to violate the Compact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Nebraska 16 (quoting Report 111).  Accordingly, Nebraska concludes, no disgorgement is warranted.</p><p>                    But that argument fails to come to terms with what the Master properly understood as the wrongful nature of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  True enough, as the Master said, that Nebraska did not purposefully set out to breach the Compact.  But still, as he also found, the State \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly exposed Kansas to a substantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of breach, and blithely proceeded.  Report 130.  In some areas of the law and for certain purposes, the distinction between purposefully invading and recklessly disregarding another\xe2\x80\x99s rights makes no difference.  See <i>Bullock </i>v. <i>BankChampaign, N.\xc2\xa0A.</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe include as intentional .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reckless conduct\xe2\x80\x9d of the kind that the law \xe2\x80\x9coften treats as the equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst</i> v. <i>Hochfelder</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185\xe2\x80\x93194, n.\xc2\xa012 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ecklessness is [sometimes] considered to be a form of intentional conduct for purposes of imposing liability\xe2\x80\x9d).  And indeed, the very Restatement Nebraska relies on treats the two similarly.  It assimilates \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cconscious wrongdoing,\xe2\x80\x9d which it defines as acting (as Nebraska did) \xe2\x80\x9cdespite a known risk that the conduct .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. violates [another\xe2\x80\x99s] rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement \xc2\xa739, Comment <i>f</i>; <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa751(3).  Conversely, the Restatement distinguishes \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d from behavior (<i>not </i>akin to Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s) amounting to mere \xe2\x80\x9cinadvertence, negligence, or unsuccessful attempt at performance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, \xc2\xa739, Comment <i>f</i>.</p><p>                    And whatever is true of a private contract action, the case for disgorgement becomes still stronger when one State gambles with another State\xe2\x80\x99s rights to a scarce natural resource.  From the time this Court began to apportion interstate rivers, it has recognized part of its role as guarding against upstream States\xe2\x80\x99 inequitable takings of water.  And as we have noted, that concern persists even after States enter into a compact: This Court may then exercise remedial authority to ensure compliance with the compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms\xe2\x80\x94thus preventing a geographically favored State from appropriating more than its share of a river.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8.  Indeed, the formation of such a compact provides this Court with enhanced remedial power because, as we have described, the agreement is also an Act of Congress, and its breach a violation of federal law.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939; <i>Porter</i>,328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395 (exercising equitable power to disgorge profits gained from violating a federal statute).  Consistent with those principles, we have stated that awarding actual damages for a compact\xe2\x80\x99s infringement may be inadequate, because that remedy alone \xe2\x80\x9cwould permit [an upstream State] to ignore its obligation to deliver water as long as it is willing\xe2\x80\x9d to pay that amount.  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 132.  And as the Solicitor General noted in argument here, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is important that water flows down the river, not just money.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 24.  Accordingly, this Court may order disgorgement of gains, if needed to stabilize a compact and deter future breaches, when a State has demonstrated reckless disregard of another, more vulnerable State\xe2\x80\x99s rights under that instrument.</p><p>                    Assessed in this light, a disgorgement order constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable\xe2\x80\x9d remedy for Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s breach.  <i>Texas </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>,<i> </i>482 U.S., at 134.  \xe2\x80\x9cPossessing the privilege of being upstream,\xe2\x80\x9d Nebraska can (physically, though not legally) drain all the water it wants from the Republican River.  Report 130.  And the higher value of water on Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s farmland than on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s means that Nebraska can take water that under the Compact should go to Kansas, pay Kansas actual damages, and still come out ahead.  That is nearly a recipe for breach\xe2\x80\x94for an upstream State to refuse to deliver to its downstream neighbor the water to which the latter is entitled.  And through 2006, Nebraska took full advantage of its favor-able position, eschewing steps that would effectively control groundwater pumping and thus exceeding its allotment.  In such circumstances, a disgorgement award appropri-ately reminds Nebraska of its legal obligations, deters future violations, and promotes the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s successful administration.  See <i>Porter</i>, 328 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 400 (\xe2\x80\x9cFuture compliance may be more definitely assured if one is compelled to restore one\xe2\x80\x99s illegal gains\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  We thus reject Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s proposed remedy.</p><p>B</p><p>                    Kansas assails the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommended disgorgement award from the other direction, claiming that it is too low to ensure Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s future compliance.  See Brief for Kansas 55\xe2\x80\x9359.  Notably, Kansas does not insist on all of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s gain.  It recognizes the difficulty of ascertaining that figure, given the evidence the parties presented.  See <i>id.,</i> at 56; see also Report 177\xe2\x80\x93178.  And still more important, it \xe2\x80\x9cagrees\xe2\x80\x9d with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Court should select a \xe2\x80\x9cfair point on th[e] spectrum\xe2\x80\x9d between no profits and full profits, based on the totality of facts and interests in the case.  Brief for Kansas 57 (quoting Report 135); see Sur-Reply Brief for Kansas 5.  In setting that point, however, Kansas comes up with a higher number\xe2\x80\x94or actually, a trio of them.  The State first asks us to award \xe2\x80\x9ctreble damages of $11.1 million,\xe2\x80\x9d then suggests that we can go \xe2\x80\x9cup to roughly $25 million,\xe2\x80\x9d and finally proposes a \xe2\x80\x9c1:1 loss-to-disgorgement ratio,\xe2\x80\x9d which means $3.7 million of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s gains.  Brief for Kansas 57; Sur-Reply Brief for Kansas 5, 7.</p><p>                    We prefer to stick with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s single number.  As an initial matter, we agree with both the Master and Kansas that disgorgement need not be all or nothing.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \xc2\xa72.4(1), p. 92 (2d ed. 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cBalancing of equities and hardships may lead the court to grant some equitable relief but not\xe2\x80\x9d the full measure requested); Restatement \xc2\xa739, Comment <i>i</i>; <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa750, Comment <i>a</i>; <i>National Security Systems, Inc. </i>v. <i>Iola</i>, 700 F.\xc2\xa03d 65, 80\xe2\x80\x9381, 101\xe2\x80\x93102 (CA3 2012).  In exercising our original jurisdiction, this Court recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility [is] inherent in equitable remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Plata</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 41) (quoting <i>Hutto</i> v. <i>Finney</i>,437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678,687, n.9 (1978)), and awards them \xe2\x80\x9cwith reference to the facts of the particular case,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 131 (quoting <i>Haffner</i> v. <i>Dobrinski</i>,215 U.\xc2\xa0S. 446,450 (1910)).  So if partial disgorgement will serve to stabilize a compact by conveying an effective message to the breaching party that it must work hard to meet its future obligations, then the Court has discretion to order only that much.  Cf. <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,14 (2001) (concluding that a master \xe2\x80\x9cacted properly in carefully analyzing the facts of the case and in only awarding as much prejudgment interest as was required by a balancing of the equities\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    And we agree with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that a relatively small disgorgement award suffices here.  That is because, as the Master detailed, Nebraska altered its conduct after the 2006 breach, and has complied with the Compact ever since.  See Report 112\xe2\x80\x93118, 180.  In 2007, Nebraska enacted new legislation establishing a mechanism to accurately forecast the State\xe2\x80\x99s annual allotment of Republican River water.  \xc2\xa723, 2007 Neb. Laws p. 1600, codified at Neb. Rev. Stat. 46\xe2\x80\x93715(6).  Further, a new round of water management plans called for localities to reduce groundwater pumping by five times as much as the old (5%) target.  And most important, those plans implemented a system for the State, in dry years, to force districts to curtail both surface water use and groundwater pumping.  That \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory back-stop,\xe2\x80\x9d as Nebraska calls it, corrects the State\xe2\x80\x99s original error of leaving all control of water use to unaccountable local actors.  Report 113 (quoting Direct Testimony of Brian Dunnigan, Director, Nebraska Department of Resources \xc2\xb643 (July 25, 2012)); see <i>supra,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Testimony before the Master showed that if the scheme had been in effect between 2002 and 2006, Nebraska would have lived within its allocation throughout that period.  See Report 117.  The Master thus reasonably concluded that the current water management plans, if implemented in good faith, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be effective to maintain compliance even in extraordinarily dry years.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at 118.  And so the Master had good cause to recommend the modest award he did, which serves as an ever-present reminder to Nebraska, but does not assume its continuing misconduct.</p><p>                    Truth be told, we cannot be sure why the Master selected the exact number he did\xe2\x80\x94why, that is, he arrived at$1.8 million, rather than a little more or a little less.  The Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report, in this single respect, contains less explanation than we might like.  But then again, any hard number reflecting a balance of equities can seem random in a certain light\xe2\x80\x94as Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s own briefs, with their ever-fluctuating ideas for a disgorgement award, amply attest.  What matters is that the Master took into account the appropriate considerations\xe2\x80\x94weighing Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s incentives, past behavior, and more recent compliance efforts\xe2\x80\x94in determining the kind of signal necessary to prevent another breach.  We are thus confident that in approving the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation for about half again Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s actual damages, we award a fair and equitable remedy suited to the circumstances.</p><p>                    For related reasons, we also reject Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s request for an injunction ordering Nebraska to comply with the Compact and Settlement.  Kansas wants such an order so that it can seek contempt sanctions against Nebraska for any future breach.  See Brief for Kansas 36\xe2\x80\x9344.  But we agree with the Master that Kansas has failed to show, as it must to obtain an injunction, a \xe2\x80\x9ccognizable danger of recurrent violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>W. T. Grant Co.</i>,345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 629,633 (1953).  As just discussed, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s new compliance measures, so long as followed, are up to the task of keeping the State within its allotment.  And Nebraska is now on notice that if it relapses, it may again be subject to disgorgement of gains\xe2\x80\x94either in part or in full, as the equities warrant.  That, we trust, will adequately guard against Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s repeating its former practices.</p><p>IV</p><p>                    The final question before us concerns the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s handling of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  As we have noted, Nebraska contended that the Settlement\xe2\x80\x99s Accounting Procedures inadvertently charge the State for using \xe2\x80\x9cimported water\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94specifically, water from the Platte River\xe2\x80\x94in conflict with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent in both the Compact and the Settlement.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The Master agreed, and recommended modifying the Procedures by adopting an approach that the parties call the \xe2\x80\x9c5-run formula,\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of Platte River water will not count toward its Compact allotment.  Kansas now objects to that proposed remedy.</p><p>                    The Compact, recall, apportions the virgin water supply of the Republican River and its tributaries\xe2\x80\x94nothing less, but also nothing more.  See Compact Art.\xc2\xa0III; <i>supra,</i> at 2.  One complexity of that project arises from water\xe2\x80\x99s .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. well, fluid quality.  Nebraska imports water from the Platte River, outside the Republican River Basin and thus outside the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s scope, to irrigate farmland.  And that imported water simply will not stay still: Some of it seeps through the ground and raises stream flow in the Republican River and its tributaries.  See Second Report of Special Master, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1999, No. 126, Orig., pp. 62\xe2\x80\x9363 (Second Report).  In negotiating the Settlement, the States undertook\xe2\x80\x94as part of their effort to accurately apportion <i>the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s</i> water\xe2\x80\x94to exclude all such imported water from their calculations.  Reflecting the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s own scope, \xc2\xa7IV(F) of the Settlement states, in no uncertain terms, that \xe2\x80\x9cBeneficial Consumptive Use of Imported Water Supply shall not count as Computed Beneficial Consumptive Use\xe2\x80\x9d of Republican River Basin water.  Which means, without all that distracting capitalization, that when Nebraska consumes imported water that has found its way into the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s streams, that use shall not count toward its Compact allotment.  But that edict of course requires calculating (in order to exclude) the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of imported water.  The Settlement\xe2\x80\x99s Accounting Procedures, in tandem with its Groundwater Model, are the tools the parties employ to make that computation.</p><p>                    But as the Master found, the Procedures (and Model) founder in performing that task in dry conditions: They treat Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s use of imported water as if it were use of Basin water.  That failure flows from the way the Procedures measure a State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of water resulting from groundwater pumping.  According to the Settlement, such pumping is to count against a State\xe2\x80\x99s allotment only to the extent it reduces stream flow in specified areas\xe2\x80\x94which it rarely does in a 1-to-1 ratio and sometimes does not do at all.  See <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa7IV(C)(1); Report 19; n.\xc2\xa01, <i>supra.</i>  Most notable here, pumping cannot deplete an already wholly dry stream\xe2\x80\x94and in arid conditions, some of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s tributaries in fact run dry.  As the Master put the point, stream flow in a given area \xe2\x80\x9cfall[s] as groundwater pumping increases until it hits zero, at which point it falls no more even as groundwater pumping continues.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 34.  When that point arrives, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s continued pumping should not count as consumption of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s virgin water.  But\xe2\x80\x94and here lies the rub\xe2\x80\x94imported water (from the Platte) can create stream flow in what would otherwise be a dry riverbed.  And the Accounting Procedures (and Model) fail to account for that possibility; accordingly, they see depletion of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s stream flow\xe2\x80\x94the sole measure of the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption\xe2\x80\x94where they should not.  The result is to count imported water toward the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of Basin water.  In 2006, for example, the Procedures charged Nebraska with using 7,797 acre-feet of Platte River water, over 4% of the State\xe2\x80\x99s allotment.  By our estimate, just that single year\xe2\x80\x99s miscalculation cost Nebraska over $1 million.  See <i>id.,</i> at 37, 176.</p><p>                    The Master specifically determined, and our review of the relevant testimony confirms, that the parties did not know the Accounting Procedures would have that effect.  See <i>id.</i>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9332.  The States intended the Procedures (as per the Compact and Settlement) to count only consumption of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s own water supply\xe2\x80\x94and correlatively, to exclude use of water from the Platte.  See <i>id.,</i> at 23\xe2\x80\x9325; see also Second Report 37, 64 (same conclusion reached by the Special Master approving the Settlement).  There is no evidence that anyone seriously thought, much less discussed, that the Accounting Procedures might systematically err in accomplishing those computations.  See Report 26\xe2\x80\x9327.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]  And because no one knew of the fault in the Procedures, no one could possibly trade it off for other items during the parties\xe2\x80\x99 negotiations.  Thus, as the Master found, Nebraska did not receive anything, nor did Kansas give up anything, in exchange for the (unknown) error.  See <i>id.,</i> at 28\xe2\x80\x9331.  To the contrary, as all witnesses explained, the designers of the Procedures worked single-mindedly to implement the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s and Settlement\xe2\x80\x99s strict demarcation between virgin and imported water\xe2\x80\x94and assumed they had succeeded.  See <i>id.,</i> at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.</p><p>                    But even if all that is so, Kansas argues (along with the dissent) that a deal is a deal is a deal\xe2\x80\x94and this deal did not include the 5-run formula the Master now proposes.  See Brief for Kansas 31\xe2\x80\x9334; <i>post, </i>at 15\xe2\x80\x9319.  On that view, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 clear intent to exclude imported water does not matter; nor does their failure to appreciate that the Procedures, in opposition to that goal, would count such water in material amounts.  According to Kansas, so long as the parties bargained (as they did) for the Procedures they got, that is the end of the matter:  No one should now be heard to say that there is a better mode of accounting.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 54\xe2\x80\x9355.</p><p>                    That argument, however, does not pass muster.  Of course, courts generally hold parties to the deals they make; and of course, courts should hesitate, and then hesitate some more, before modifying a contract, even to remove an inadvertent flaw.  But in this Compact case, two special (and linked) considerations warrant reforming the Accounting Procedures as the Master has proposed\xe2\x80\x94or better phrased, warrant <i>conforming </i>those Procedures to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 underlying agreements.  First, that remedy is necessary to prevent serious inaccuracies from distorting the States\xe2\x80\x99 intended apportionment of interstate waters, as reflected in both the Compact and the Settlement.  And second, it is required to avert an outright breach of the Compact\xe2\x80\x94and so a violation of federal law.  We address each point in turn.</p><p>                    In resolving water disputes, this Court has opted to correct subsidiary technical agreements to promote accuracy in apportioning waters under a compact.  In <i>Texas </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>, for example, the parties entered into a compact that based division of the Pecos River on certain conditions existing in 1947.  The States further agreed that those conditions were described and defined in a particular engineering report.  But that report turned out to contain material errors.  Notwithstanding Texas\xe2\x80\x99s objection that the parties had assented to its use, we set aside the flawed study and adopted a new technical document that more accurately depicted the real-world conditions of the compact\xe2\x80\x99s specified baseline year.  See446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 540 (1980) (<i>per curiam</i>) (setting aside the old document); 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 562\xe2\x80\x93563 (describing the litigation);467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1238 (1984) (approving the new document); 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 127 (describing that approval).</p><p>                    Similarly, in <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86 (2004), we modified an agreement to ensure that it would correctly measure Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the Arkansas River Compact.  The parties had consented to use a computer model on a year-by-year basis to gauge their consumption of water.  See <i>id.,</i> at 102 (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]oth [States] agreed to theuse of annual measurement\xe2\x80\x9d).  But after a time, a special master determined that annual accounting produced serious errors, whereas employing a 10-year measuring period accurately determined compact compliance.  Over Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s protest, we accordingly approved the Master\xe2\x80\x99s alteration of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to assess compliance each year.  And in countering Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the introduction of a 10-year measuring period, we posited that the compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters, albeit unaware of \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex computer modeling[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would have preferred accurate measurement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.[<a href="#F10">10</a>]</p><p>                    The teaching of those cases applies as well to this one: In each, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to devise \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable solutions\xe2\x80\x9d to interstate water disputes encompasses modifying a technical agreement to correct material errors in the way it operates and thus align it with the compacting States\xe2\x80\x99 intended apportionment.  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 134; cf. <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 102 (\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, a \xe2\x80\x98credit\xe2\x80\x99 for surplus water that rests upon <i>in</i>accurate measurement is not really a credit at all\xe2\x80\x9d).  Much as in <i>Texas </i>v. <i>New Mexico </i>and <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>, the subsidiary Accounting Procedures here failed to accurately measure what they were supposed to.  Modifying those Procedures does no more than make them consonant with the Compact and Settlement, ensuring that they help to realize, rather than frustrate, the agreed-upon division of water.</p><p>                    Indeed, the case for modification is still stronger here, because (as we explain below) the Accounting Procedures as written affirmatively violate the Compact.  That accord is the supreme law in this case: As the States explicitly recognized, they could not change the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms even if they tried.  See Settlement \xc2\xa7I(D) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Stipulation and the Proposed Consent Judgment are not intended to, nor could they, change the States\xe2\x80\x99 respective rights and obligations under the Compact\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is a function of the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s status as federal law, which binds the States unless and until Congress says otherwise.  And Congress, of course, has not said otherwise here.  To enter into a settlement contrary to the Compact is to violate a federal statute.  See <i>Vermont</i> v. <i>New York</i>,417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 270,278 (1974) (<i>per curiam</i>).  And as we have discussed, our equitable authority to grant remedies is at its apex when public rights and obligations are thus implicated.  See <i>Porter</i>, 328 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 398; <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p><p>                    The Accounting Procedures\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of imported water first conflicts with the Compact by going beyond its boundaries\xe2\x80\x94in essence, by regulating water <i>ultra vires</i>.  According to its terms, the Compact pertains, and pertains only, to \xe2\x80\x9cvirgin water supply originating in\xe2\x80\x9d the Republican River Basin.  Compact Art.\xc2\xa0III; see <i>supra,</i> at 2, 21.  The agreement\xe2\x80\x99s very first Article drives that point home: \xe2\x80\x9cThe physical and other conditions peculiar to the Basin constitute the basis for this compact,\xe2\x80\x9d and nothing in it relates to any other waterway.  To divide or otherwise regulate streams <i>outside</i> the Basin, the States would have to enter into a separate agreement and gain congressional approval.  (The reason no one thought the Settlement needed such consent is precisely because it purported to stay within the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s limits.  See Settlement \xc2\xa7I(D))  And yet, the Accounting Procedures have the effect of including such outside water within the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment scheme (by counting its use against a State\xe2\x80\x99s allotment).  The Procedures make water from the Platte subject to the Compact, in contravention of its scope; or conversely stated, they expand the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed scope to cover water from the Platte.  That is not within the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority.</p><p>                    What is more, the Procedures\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of imported water deprives Nebraska of its rights under the Compact to the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s own water supply.  That is because the inescapable effect of charging Nebraska for the use of imported water, as the Procedures do, is to reduce the amount of Republican River water the State may consume.  Suppose the Compact grants 100 units of Republican River water to Nebraska and Kansas alike; and further assume that the Accounting Procedures count 10 units of Platte River water toward Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s allotment.  That means Nebraska may now consume only 90 units of Republican River water (or else pay Kansas damages).  The Procedures thus change the States\xe2\x80\x99 shares of Basin water, to Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s detriment: Nebraska now has less, and Kansas relatively more, than the Compact allows.  That, too, lies outside what the States can do.</p><p>                    In light of all the above, we think the Master\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution the best one possible.  The 5-run formula that he recommends conforms the Procedures to both the Compact and the Settlement by excluding imported water from the calculation of each State\xe2\x80\x99s consumption.  See Report 55\xe2\x80\x9356; <i>id</i>., at App. F.  Kansas has not provided any workable alternative to align the Accounting Procedures with the Compact and Settlement.  Nor has Kansas credibly shown that this simple change will introduce any other inaccu-racy into Compact accounting.  See <i>id.,</i> at 58\xe2\x80\x9368.  The amendment will damage Kansas in no way other than by taking away something to which it is not entitled.  In another case, with another history, we might prefer to instruct the parties to figure out for themselves how to bring the Accounting Procedures into line with the Compact.  See <i>New York</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,256 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296,313 (1921) (noting that negotiation is usually the best way to solve interstate disputes).  But we doubt that further discussion about this issue will prove productive.  Arbitration has already failed to produce agreement about how to correct the Procedures.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5.  And before the Special Master, both parties indicated that further \xe2\x80\x9cdispute resolution proceedings before the RRCA or an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x9d would be \xe2\x80\x9cfutile.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 69 (quoting Case Management Order No. 9 \xc2\xb65 (Jan. 25, 2013)).  We accordingly adopt the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to amend the Accounting Procedures so that they no longer charge Nebraska for imported water.</p><p>V</p><p>                    Nebraska argues here for a cramped view of our authority to order disgorgement.  Kansas argues for a similarly restrictive idea of our power to modify a technical document.  We think each has too narrow an understanding of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s role in disputes arising from compacts apportioning interstate streams.  The Court has broad remedial authority in such cases to enforce the compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  Here, compelling Nebraska to disgorge profits deters it from taking advantage of its upstream position to appropriate more water than the Compact allows.  And amending the Accounting Procedures ensures that the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s provisions will govern the division of the Republican River Basin\xe2\x80\x99s (and only that Basin\xe2\x80\x99s) water supply.  Both remedies safeguard the Compact; both insist that States live within its law.

It is of course true, as the dissent says, that in neither case did the Court reform a compact.  See <i>post</i>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.<i> </i>What the Court did do, contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s protestations, was what we do here: modify an ancillary agreement to make sure it accurately implemented a compact\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment.  In <i>Texas </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>, we interpreted a compact term, as the dissent says, see <i>post,</i> at 16; but we additionally threw out a technical report that the parties agreed would effectuate that term when it later proved erroneous.  And similarly in <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Colorado</i>, we altered an ancillary agreement to measure water usage year by year.  The dissent contends that the States in that case had no such agreement, though acknowledging that they had one to calculate damages on an annual basis.  See <i>post,</i> at 17.  But the two were one and the same.  Damages arise from violations, and violations occur when a State consumes too much water.  In calling for year-by-year measurement of damages, the agreement also called for year-by-year assessment of consumption.  And nothing supports the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that this agreement applied only retrospectively, rather than to assess both usage and damages on an ongoing basis.  So to impose a 10-year measuring period, consistent with accurate apportionment under the Compact, we had to alter the agreement. </span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3244092">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 126, Orig.</p><p>_________________</p><p>STATE OF KANSAS, PLAINTIFF <i>v.</i> STATES OF NEBRASKA AND COLORADO</p><p>on exceptions to report of special master</p><p>[February 24, 2015]</p><p>                    Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p><p>                    I join Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.

The object of the original Restatements was \xe2\x80\x9cto present an orderly statement of the general common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement of Conflict of Laws, Introduction, p. viii (1934).  Over time, the Restatements\xe2\x80\x99 authors have abandoned the mission of describing the law, and have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for what the law ought to be.  Keyes, The Restatement (Second): Its Misleading Quality and a Proposal for Its Amelioration, 13 Pepp. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 23, 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (1985).  Section 39 of the Third Restatement of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment is illustrative; as Justice Thomas notes, <i>post</i>, at 8 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), it constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98novel extension\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the law that finds little if any support in case law.  Restatement sections such as that should be given no weight whatever as to the current state of the law, and no more weight regarding what the law ought to be than the recommendations of any respected lawyer or scholar.

In exercising our original jurisdiction in this case, we have a responsibility to act in accordance with the rule of law and with appropriate consideration for the sovereign interests of the States before us.  I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Nebraska knowingly, but not deliberately, breached the Republican River Compact, and I agree that there is no need to enter an injunction ordering Nebraska to comply with the Compact.  But that is where my agreement ends.

Today, however, the majority disregards these limits.  Invoking equitable powers, without equitable principles, the majority ignores the principles of contract law that we have traditionally applied to compact disputes between sovereign States.  It authorizes an arbitrary award of disgorgement for breach of that contract.  And, it invents a new theory of contract reformation to rewrite the agreed-upon terms of that contract.  I respectfully dissent from these holdings.</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>                    The States in this action disagree about their rights and responsibilities under the Republican River Compact and their 2002 Final Settlement Stipulation (Settlement), and have asked this Court to resolve what is, in essence, a contract dispute.  \xe2\x80\x9cAn interstate compact, though provided for in the Constitution, and ratified by Congress, is nonetheless essentially a contract between the signatory States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>,501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 221,242 (1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Likewise, a legal settlement agreement is a contract.  <i>Kokkonen</i> v. <i>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America</i>,511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 375\xe2\x80\x93382 (1994).</p><p>                    The Court should therefore interpret the agreements at issue according to \xe2\x80\x9cthe principles of contract law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tarrant Regional Water Dist. </i>v. <i>Herrmann</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11).  Under these principles, the Compact and Settlement are \xe2\x80\x9clegal document[s] that must be construed and applied in accordance with [their] terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124,128 (1987) (<i>Texas III</i>); see also <i>Kaktovik </i>v. <i>Watt</i>, 689 F.\xc2\xa02d 222, 230 (CADC 1982) (applying \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar principles of contract law\xe2\x80\x9d to a settlement agreement\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    That command is even stronger in the context of interstate compacts, which must be approved by Congress under the Compact Clause of the Constitution.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 3; <i>Alabama </i>v. <i>North Carolina</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330\xe2\x80\x93352 (2010).  Because these compacts are both contracts and federal law, we must be more careful to adhere to their express terms, not less so.  <i>Ibid.</i>  If judges had the power to apply their own notions of fairness \xe2\x80\x9cto the implementation of federal statutes, [they] would be potent lawmakers indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 352<i>.  </i>Thus, to the extent that we have departed from contract law principles when adjudicating disputes over water compacts, it has been to <i>reject</i> loose equitable powers of the sort the majority now invokes.  See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 351\xe2\x80\x93353 (rejecting an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in interstate compacts).  We have repeatedly said that \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not order relief inconsistent with the express terms of a compact, no matter what the equities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 352 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p><p>B</p><p>                    Rather than apply \xe2\x80\x9cthe principles of contract law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Tarrant Regional Water Dist.</i>,<i> supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11), the majority calls upon broad equitable power.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x939.  It evidently draws this power from its \xe2\x80\x9cinherent authority\xe2\x80\x9d to apportion interstate streams in the absence of an interstate water compact.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  In the major-ity\xe2\x80\x99s view, States bargain for water rights \xe2\x80\x9cin the shadow of our equitable apportionment power,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus we \xe2\x80\x9cmay invoke equitable principles\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdevise fair .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. solutions\xe2\x80\x9d to disputes between States about the bargains they struck.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8 (internal quotation marks and alterationomitted).</p><p>                    That conclusion gets things backwards: As we have explained, once a compact is formed, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts have no power to substitute their own notions of an equitable apportionment for the apportionment chosen by Congress\xe2\x80\x9d and the States.  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 554,568 (1983) (<i>Texas II\xc2\xa0</i>) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>                    The majority next asserts \xe2\x80\x9cstill greater\xe2\x80\x9d equitable power by equating contract disputes between sovereign States with cases involving federal law and the public interest.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Although the majority recognizes that it \xe2\x80\x9cmay not order relief inconsistent with a compact\xe2\x80\x99s express terms,\xe2\x80\x9d it claims enlarged powers \xe2\x80\x9cwithin those limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen federal law is at issue and the public interest is involved,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority says, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable powers are \xe2\x80\x9ceven broader and more flexible\xe2\x80\x9d than when it resolves a private-law dispute.  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>                    But the precedents on which the majority relies to jus-tify this power have nothing to do with water disputes between States.  The majority cites <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Warner Holding Co.</i>,328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395 (1946), which involved a suit by the Administrator of the Office of Price Administration for an injunction against a landlord who had charged too much rent in violation of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.  In that case, the Court recognized a public interest in the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s effort to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the Act, and \xe2\x80\x9cto give effect to its purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 398, 400.  The Court reasoned that, \xe2\x80\x9csince the public interest is involved in a proceeding of this nature, [a district court\xe2\x80\x99s] equitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 398.  The authority <i>Porter </i>cited for this point was <i>Virginian R. Co.</i> v. <i>Railway Employees</i>,300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 515 (1937), a case on which the majority likewise relies.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  But that case, like <i>Porter</i>, did not involve a state party or an interstate water dispute; instead, it concerned a dispute between private parties\xe2\x80\x94a railroad and its employees\xe2\x80\x99 union\xe2\x80\x94arising under the Railway Labor Act.  <i>Virginian R.\xc2\xa0Co., supra,</i> at 538.  As in <i>Porter</i>, the Court recognized a public interest in the enforcement of a federal administrative scheme, explaining that Congress had made a \xe2\x80\x9cdeclaration of public interest and policy which should be persuasive in inducing courts to give relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  300 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 552.</p><p>                    This case, by contrast, involves the inherent authority of sovereign States to regulate the use of water.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpower to control navigation, fishing, and other public uses of water\xe2\x80\x9d is not a function of a federal regulatory program; it \xe2\x80\x9cis an essential attribute of [state] sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tarrant Regional Water Dist.</i>,<i> </i>569 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 15) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, when the Court resolves an interstate water dispute, it deals not with public policies created by federal statutes, but pre-existing sovereign rights, allocated according to the mutual agreement of the parties with the consent of Congress.  Al-though the consent of Congress makes statutes of compacts, our flexibility in overseeing a federal statute that pertains to the exercise of these sovereign powers is not the same as the flexibility <i>Porter </i>claimed for courts engaged in supervising the administration of a federal regulatory program.  Authority over water is a core attribute of state sovereignty, and \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]ederal courts should pause before using their inherent equitable powers to intrude into the proper sphere of the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Missouri</i> v. <i>Jenkins</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70,131 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring).</p><p>                    Moreover, even if the involvement of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interests\xe2\x80\x9d might augment the Court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable powers in the context of disputes involving regulated parties and their regulators, it does not have the same effect in a dispute between States.  States\xe2\x80\x94unlike common carriers and landlords\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpossess sovereignty concurrent with that of the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452,457 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).  States thus come before this Court as sovereigns, seeking our assistance in resolving disputes \xe2\x80\x9cof such seriousness that it would [otherwise] amount to a <i>casus belli</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nebraska</i> v. <i>Wyoming</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,8 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Federalist Papers emphasized that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s role in resolving interstate disputes \xe2\x80\x9c[would] not change the principle\xe2\x80\x9d of state sovereignty, and they gave assurances that the Court would take \xe2\x80\x9call the usual and most effectual precautions\xe2\x80\x9d necessary for impartial and principled adjudication.  The Federalist No. 39, pp. 245\xe2\x80\x93246 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).</p><p>                    For that reason, when the parties before this Court are States, the Court should be more circumspect in its use of equitable remedies, not less.  We have explained, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e are especially reluctant to read absent terms into an interstate compact given the federalism and separation-of-powers concerns that would arise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign States, to which the political branches consented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alabama</i>, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352.  The use of unbounded equitable power against States similarly threatens \xe2\x80\x9cto violate principles of state sovereignty and of the separation of powers,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jenkins</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 130 (Thomas, J., concurring).  In controversies among States, the Court should therefore \xe2\x80\x9cexercise the power to impose equitable remedies only sparingly, subject to clear rules guiding its use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 131.</p><p>II</p><p>                    Applying ordinary contract principles, I would reject the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to order disgorgement of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s profits for breach of a compact.  That remedy is not available for a nondeliberate breach of a contract.  And even if it were, such an award must be based on Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s profits, not the arbitrary number the Master selected.</p><p>A</p><p>1</p><p>                    Although our precedents have not foreclosed disgorgement of profits as a remedy for breach of a water compact, they have suggested that disgorgement would be avail-able, if at all, only for the most culpable breaches: those that are \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Texas III</i>, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 132.  The traditional remedy for breach of a water compact has been performance through delivery of water.  See <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,23 (2001) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Although we deviated from that traditional remedy in <i>Texas III</i>, when we authorized money damages, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 132, the majority cites no case in which we have ever awarded disgorgement.  The lone reference to that remedy in our precedents is dictum in <i>Texas III</i> asserting that the money damages award in that case would not encourage efficient breaches of water compacts \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the authority to order .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whatever additional sanction might be thought necessary for deliberate failure to perform .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    The lack of support for disgorgement in our compact cases comports with the general law of remedies.  The usual remedy for breach of a contract is damages based on the injured party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cactual loss caused by the breach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7347, Comment <i>e</i>, p. 116 (1979).  Disgorgement, by contrast, is an extraordinary remedy that goes beyond a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s damages, requiring the breaching party to refund additional profits gained in the breach.  See 3 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \xc2\xa712.7(3), pp. 166\xe2\x80\x93167 (2d ed. 1993).  In American law, disgorgement of profits is not generally an available rem-edy for breach of contract.  <i>Id.</i>, \xc2\xa712.7(4), at 171.</p><p>                    Even if <i>Texas III</i> supported a narrow exception for cases involving deliberate breach of a water compact, that exception would not apply here.  Although it is uncontested that Nebraska breached the Compact and that Kansas lost $3.7 million as a result, <i>ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, the Master expressly found that there is no evidence that Nebraska deliber-ately breached the Compact.  Report of Special Master 111, 130 (Report).  In fact, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s efforts \xe2\x80\x9cwere earnest and substantial enough to preclude a finding that this was a consciously opportunistic breach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 131.  And although the majority adopts the finding that Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly failed\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the Compact, <i>ante,</i> at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), a finding that I do not dispute, neither the parties nor the majority disagrees with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Nebraska did not intentionally or deliberately breach the Compact, <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9314.  Under such circumstances, disgorgement is not an available remedy.</p><p>2</p><p>                    The Special Master nevertheless recommended disgorgement because Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly exposed Kansas to a substantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of noncompliance.

That section proposes awarding disgorgement when a party\xe2\x80\x99s profits from its breach are greater than the loss to the other party.  The remedy is thought necessary because one party may \xe2\x80\x9cexploit the shortcomings\xe2\x80\x9d of traditional damages remedies by breaching contracts when its expected profits exceed the damages it would be required to pay to the other party.  Restatement (Third) of Restitution \xc2\xa739, Comment <i>b</i>, at 649.  In other words, the remedy \xe2\x80\x9ccondemns a form of consciousadvantage-taking\xe2\x80\x9d and seeks to thwart an \xe2\x80\x9copportunistic calculation\xe2\x80\x9d that breaching is better than performing.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    This Court, however, has never before relied on \xc2\xa739 nor adopted its proposed theory of disgorgement.  And for good reason: It lacks support in the law.  One reviewer of \xc2\xa739 has described it as a \xe2\x80\x9cnovel extension\xe2\x80\x9d of restitution principles that \xe2\x80\x9cwill alter the doctrinal landscape of contract law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roberts<i>, </i>Restitutionary Disgorgement for Opportunistic Breach of Contract and Mitigation of Damages<i>, </i>42 Loyola (LA) L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 131, 134 (2008).  And few courts have ever relied on \xc2\xa739.  The sheer novelty of this proposed remedy counsels against applying it here.</p><p>                    In any event, \xc2\xa739 opines that disgorgement should be available only when a party <i>deliberately</i> breaches a contract.  This makes sense.  If disgorgement is an antidote for \xe2\x80\x9cefficient breach,\xe2\x80\x9d then it need only be administered when \xe2\x80\x9cconscious advantage-taking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copportunistic calculation\xe2\x80\x9d are present.  But as noted above, the Master expressly found that no deliberate breach occurred.  Report 130.  The Master\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xc2\xa739 was accordingly misplaced.</p><p>3</p><p>                    Perhaps recognizing the weakness in the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, the majority takes a different approach, fashioning a new remedy of disgorgement for reckless breach.  According to the majority, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was essentially reckless, <i>ante,</i> at 14, and the Court may order disgorgement \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a State has demonstrated reckless disregard\xe2\x80\x9d for another State\xe2\x80\x99s contractual rights, <i>ante,</i> at 16.  As with the Restatement\xe2\x80\x99s proposed theory, there is no basis for that proposition in our cases.</p><p>                    Because disgorgement is available, if at all, only in cases of <i>deliberate</i> breach, the majority asserts that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n some areas of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d the line between intent and reckless disregard \xe2\x80\x9cmakes no difference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  Accepting the truth of that proposition in some circumstances, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s caveat acknowledges that it is not true in others.  Indeed, the law often places significant weight on the distinction between intentional and reckless conduct.  See, <i>e.g., Kawaauhau</i> v. <i>Geiger</i>,523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57,61 (1998) (discussing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98willful,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cintentional\xe2\x80\x9d conduct, and distinguishing those terms from \xe2\x80\x9creckless\xe2\x80\x9d conduct); see also <i>Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. </i>v. <i>SEB S.\xc2\xa0A.</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2011) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314) (distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9cwillful blindness\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9crecklessness\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    The majority provides scant support for its conclusion that breach of an interstate water compact is an area in which the line between intent and recklessness is practically irrelevant.  It first relies on <i>Bullock </i>v. <i>BankChampaign, N.\xc2\xa0A.</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 1), in which the Court determined the mental state necessary for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the Bankruptcy Code.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  In the absence of a fiduciary relationship, however, <i>Bullock</i> has little relevance.  Cf. <i>Harris Trust and Sav. Bank</i> v. <i>Salomon Smith Barney Inc.</i>,530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238,250 (2000) (noting the special disgorgement rules that apply \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a trustee in breach of his fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries transfers trust property to a third person\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    The majority next relies on <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst</i> v. <i>Hochfelder</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185 (1976), which addressed \xe2\x80\x9cscienter\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15 (citing 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 193\xe2\x80\x93194, n. 12).  The Court noted that it used the term \xe2\x80\x9cscienter\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 194, n.\xc2\xa012.  It then asserted\xe2\x80\x94in dictum and without support\xe2\x80\x94that recklessness is considered to be a form of intentional conduct in some areas of the law, but it declined to address whether reckless conduct could be sufficient for \xc2\xa710(b) liability.  <i>Ibid.</i>  That dictum is hardly sufficient grounds for claiming that recklessness and intent are equivalent mental states in compact disputes between States.</p><p>                    If anything, the reverse is true.  Disgorgement is strong medicine, and as with other forms of equitable power, we should impose it against the States \xe2\x80\x9conly sparingly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jenkins</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 131 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The majority insists that the justification for disgorgement is enhanced \xe2\x80\x9cwhen one State gambles with another State\xe2\x80\x99s rights to a scarce natural resource.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  But the way this Court has always discouraged gambling with this scarce resource is to require delivery of water, not money.  Prior to 1987, \xe2\x80\x9cwe had never even suggested that monetary damages could be recovered from a State as a remedy for its violation of an interstate compact apportioning the flow of an interstate stream.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 23 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  If a State\xe2\x80\x99s right to the \xe2\x80\x9cscarce natural resource\xe2\x80\x9d of water is the problem, then perhaps the Court ought to follow its usual practice of ordering specific performance rather than improvising a new remedy of \xe2\x80\x9creckless disgorgement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>B</p><p>                    The majority compounds its errors by authorizing an arbitrary amount of disgorgement.  As explained above, the measure of the disgorgement award should be the profits derived from a deliberate breach.  Yet the Special Master acknowledged that its $1.8 million award was not based on any measure of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s profits from breaching the Compact.  Report 179\xe2\x80\x93180.  The Master gave no dollar estimate of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s profits and said only that its gain was \xe2\x80\x9cvery much larger than Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 loss\xe2\x80\x9d of $3.7 million, \xe2\x80\x9clikely by more than several multiples.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 178.  Despite producing no estimate more precise than \xe2\x80\x9cvery much larger,\xe2\x80\x9d the Master ordered a disgorgement award of $1.8 million.  <i>Id.,</i> at 178\xe2\x80\x93179.</p><p>                    The majority explains that \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot be sure why the Master selected the exact number he did.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  Indeed.  Neither the majority nor the Special Master nor I can identify a justifiable basis for this amount.  It appears that $1.8 million just feels like not too much, but not too little.</p><p>                    We should hold ourselves to a higher standard.  In other contexts, we have demanded that district courts \xe2\x80\x9cprovide proper justification\xe2\x80\x9d for a monetary award rather than divining an amount that appears to be \xe2\x80\x9cessentially arbitrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perdue</i> v. <i>Kenny A.</i>,559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 542,557 (2010).  We should do the same ourselves if we are going to award disgorgement here.  As with ordinary damages, disgorgement should not be awarded \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond an amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable certainty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7352.  And a disgorgement award ought to be calculated based on something more than the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s intuitions.</p><p>                    The majority claims that the Master \xe2\x80\x9ctook into account the appropriate considerations,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cNebraska\xe2\x80\x99s incentives, past behavior, and more recent compliance efforts\xe2\x80\x9d in reaching the award.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  But it makes no difference that he took those factors into account if he arrived at a number that has no articulable relationship to Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s profits.  Equitable disgorgement is not an arbitrary penalty designed to compel compliance, nor should it become one.</p><p>                    What is more, the Master considered factors beyond those relevant to the calculation of a disgorgement award.  In his view, $1.8 million \xe2\x80\x9cmoves substantially towards turning the actual recovery by Kansas, net of reasonable transaction costs, into an amount that approximates a full recovery for the harm suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 179.  In other words, $1.8 million makes Kansas whole because it is a reasonable estimate of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction costs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which presumably means the State\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and litigation costs.  But, under the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d we generally do not award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cto a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</i> v. <i>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources</i>,532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598,602 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And neither the majority, nor Kansas, nor the Special Master offers any support for the proposition that a disgorgement award can smuggle in an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  If disgorgement were an appropriate remedy in this case, then the Court should require a calculation based on Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s profits rather than Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction costs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>III</p><p>A</p><p>                    I would also reject the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to reform the Settlement because that recommendation conflicts with the equitable doctrine of reformation.  The remedy of reformation is available to correct a contract if, \xe2\x80\x9cowing to mutual mistake, the language used therein did not fully or accurately express the agreement and intention of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co.</i> v. <i>Government of Philippine Islands</i>,247 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385,389 (1918).  The well-established rule is that, when a written contract \xe2\x80\x9cfails to express the agreement because of a mistake of both parties as to the contents or effect of the writing, the court may at the request of a party reform the writing to express the agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7155, at 406.</p><p>                    Reformation is thus available only when the parties reach an agreement but then \xe2\x80\x9cfail to express it correctly in the writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, Comment <i>a</i>, at 406.  If \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties make a written agreement that they would not otherwise have made because of a mistake other than one as to expression, the court will not reform a writing to reflect the agreement that it thinks they would have made.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> Comment <i>b</i>, at 408.  Because modifying a written agreement is an extraordinary step, a party seeking reformation must prove the existence of a mutual mistake of expression by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>Comment <i>c</i>, at 410.</p><p>                    Nebraska cannot meet that burden because the States made no mistake in reducing their agreement to writing.  Here are the terms the States agreed upon in their binding Settlement:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cBeneficial Consumptive Use of Imported Water Supply shall not count as Computed Beneficial Consumptive Use or Virgin Water Supply.  .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Determinations of Beneficial Consumptive Use from Imported Water Supply (whether determined expressly or by implication) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be calculated in accordance with the [Republican River Compact Admin. (RRCA)] Accounting Procedures and by using the RRCA Groundwater Model.\xe2\x80\x9d  Settlement \xc2\xa7IV(F), p.\xc2\xa025.</p><p>The States thus agreed not to count water imported from outside the Republican River Basin.  But in the very same provision, they agreed to calculate the use of imported water using the RRCA Accounting Procedures and the RRCA Groundwater Model.  The terms of the Settlement are thus crystal clear: The accounting procedures control determinations of consumptive use of imported water.  And the parties do not contend that they made any drafting mistake in recording the accounting procedures or the groundwater model.</p><p>                    Instead, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 mistake was their belief that the accounting procedures and water model they agreed upon would accurately exclude imported water from the calculation of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s consumptive use.  They were wrong about this.  In fact, under dry weather conditions, when native water flows are depleted, the water model charges Nebraska for pumping imported water.  Report 32\xe2\x80\x9337.  The parties did not realize the magnitude of this error.  To the extent they thought about it at all, they realized the water model was not perfectly precise, but assumed that only very small, immaterial amounts of imported water would make their way into the calculations.  See <i>id.,</i> at 27.  A key member of the modeling committee testified that he was \xe2\x80\x9cintellectually aware\xe2\x80\x9d of the imported-water issue, but that \xe2\x80\x9cwe didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that was going to be a big issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. 727 (testimony of Willem Schre\xc3\xbcder).</p><p>                    There is <i>no</i> testimony from any source suggesting that the parties agreed to a different water model.  See Report 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Nebraska thus cannot meet its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x985-run formula,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 20, but failed to express that agreement accurately in writing.</p><p>                    If there is any mistake in this Settlement, it is not a mistake in writing, but in thinking.  The parties knew what the methodology was and they expressly agreed to that methodology.  They simply thought the methodology would work better than it did.  See Tr. 727.  Even though the methodology they agreed upon was imperfect, a writing may be reformed only to conform with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 actual agreement, not to create a better one.</p><p>                    The appropriate equitable remedy, if any, in these circumstances would be rescission, not reformation.  In general, if there is a mutual mistake \xe2\x80\x9cas to a basic assumption on which the contract was made,\xe2\x80\x9d the adversely affected party may seek to avoid the contract.  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7152, at 385; see also <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa7155, Comment <i>b</i>, Illustration 4, at 409 (noting that reformation is not available to remedy a mistake as to something other than reducing the agreement to writing).  The States have not asked for rescission, of course, but it is incorrect to suggest, see <i>ante,</i> at 27, that there is no other solution to this problem.</p><p>B</p><p>                    Realizing that ordinary reformation is not available for Nebraska, the majority again summons its equitable power and renegotiates the accounting procedures to create what it considers a fairer agreement for the States.  In doing so, it announces a new doctrine of reformation: In resolving water disputes, the Court will \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect subsidiary technical agreements to promote accuracy in apportion[ment].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 24.  From here on out, the Court will \xe2\x80\x9cmodif[y] a technical agreement to correct material errors in the way it operates and thus align it with the compacting States\xe2\x80\x99 intended apportionment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 25.</p><p>                    As this case illustrates, adopting this novel remedy is a mistake.  The majority fails in its attempt to conform this new doctrine of \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical agreement correction\xe2\x80\x9d with both principles of equity and our precedent governing compact disputes.  And after creating an unjustified doctrine, the majority misapplies it.</p><p>1</p><p><b> </b>To begin, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on equitable power is misplaced.  That a court is exercising equitable power means only that it must look to established principles of equity.  And reformation <i>is</i> the equitable doctrine that Nebraska seeks in this case.  The Court should thus follow the rules of reformation, just as it would adhere to the contours of any other equitable doctrine.  Indeed, we have demanded as much from lower courts when they exercise their power to grant other forms of equitable relief, such as a permanent injunction.  See <i>eBay Inc.</i> v. <i>Merc-Exchange, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.</i>,547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388\xe2\x80\x93394 (2006).  If a court fails to apply the proper standard for a permanent injunction, it is no answer to recite the obvious fact that the court acted in equity.<b> </b>See <i>id., </i>at 394.</p><p>                    Putting aside the assertion of equitable power, there is no support in our precedents for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine of \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical agreement correction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority first suggests that this Court reformed a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical document\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 540 (1980) (<i>per curiam</i>) (<i>Texas I\xc2\xa0</i>).  <i>Ante,</i> at 24.  But there was no reformation at issue in that case\xe2\x80\x94either of the compact or an ancillary technical agreement\xe2\x80\x94only the interpretation of the words in the Pecos River Compact.  <i>Texas I</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 540<i>; </i>see Report of Special Master on Obligation of New Mexico to Texas under the Pecos River Compact, O. T. 1975, No. 65, Orig., pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9316, 34\xe2\x80\x9337 (filed Oct. 15, 1979) (purporting to interpret the compact).</p><p>                    The majority also claims that in <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86 (2004), we \xe2\x80\x9capproved the Master\xe2\x80\x99s alteration of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. .\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 24.  But nothing in <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Colorado </i>supports revising the express terms of a settlement agreement.  In that case, the Court adopted a Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to calculate water usage based on a 10\xe2\x80\x93year average rather than a single year.  543 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  There is no suggestion in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion (nor in the briefs filed in that case) that the States had previously agreed to use a 1-year method for calculating water usage or that anyone thought \xe2\x80\x9creformation\xe2\x80\x9d of the compact or any ancillary agreement was needed.  To the contrary, the Court explained that the compact simply did \xe2\x80\x9cnot define the length of time over which\xe2\x80\x9d the States must make the relevant measurements.  <i>Id.,</i> at 100.  There was thus nothing to rewrite, nothing to reform.  The majority suggests that the States in that case had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98agreed to the use of annual measurement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for calculating future water usage, <i>ante,</i> at 24 (quoting <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Colorado</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 102), but the quoted passage refers to the unrelated fact that the States had, earlier in the litigation, \xe2\x80\x9cagreed to the use of annual measurement for purposes of calculating <i>past</i> damages,\xe2\x80\x9d not future water usage, 543<i> </i>U.\xc2\xa0S<i>.,</i> at 102 (emphasis added).  That litigation stipulation did not apply to the calculation of <i>future </i>water usage or <i>future </i>damages.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Even if the majority were correct that a damages calculation is simply the flip side of a water usage calculation, <i>ante, </i>at 25, n.\xc2\xa010, that conclusion plainly would apply only to calculation of past water usage.  It is thus no surprise that the Court held that any pre-existing damages agreements did not govern the method of measuring future compliance.  <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Colorado</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 103.  Given that the Court plainly did not apply any such agreements, it cannot be said to have altered them.</p><p>2</p><p>                    Having improperly invented the doctrine of \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical agreement correction,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority proceeds to misapply it.  In \xe2\x80\x9ccorrecting\xe2\x80\x9d the accounting procedures, the majority purports to align them with the intent of the compacting parties.  <i>Ante, </i>at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  But we know that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reformed contract does not match the \xe2\x80\x9cStates\xe2\x80\x99 intended apportionment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 25.  We know this because the Settlement expressly states that, for purposes of apportioning the flow, imported water use would be calculated using the agreed-upon \xe2\x80\x9cAccounting Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cGroundwater Model.\xe2\x80\x9d  Settlement \xc2\xa7IV(F), at 25.  The States never intended to adopt the 5-run formula, and the Court has simply picked a winner and adopted Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s 5-run proposal, notwithstanding a binding agreement to the contrary.</p><p><b> </b>The majority also misapplies its \xe2\x80\x9ccorrection\xe2\x80\x9d remedy in claiming that its fix will prevent the existing accounting procedures from \xe2\x80\x9caffirmatively violat[ing] the Compact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 26.  I cannot see how this is true.  First, the existing procedures do not violate the Compact.  We should favor an interpretation of the Compact that would render its performance possible, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible or meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 S. Williston, Law of Contracts \xc2\xa7620, p. 1202 (1920).  Read in light of this principle, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cVirgin Water Supply\xe2\x80\x9d must be interpreted to allow for some imperfection in the groundwater models.  After all, groundwater models are approximations of the physical world.  Tr. 722\xe2\x80\x93726.  No accounting procedure can plausibly track every drop of water through the 24,900 square mile Basin.  <i>Id.</i>, at 724.</p><p>                    Second, even if the existing accounting procedures would violate the Compact because they allocate some imported water, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccorrection\xe2\x80\x9d will not solve the problem.  Because water models are always approximations, even the 5-run formula will be imprecise and will therefore violate the Compact if it is read to require the States accurately to account for every drop of imported water.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    Claiming to draw from a vast reservoir of equitable power, the Court ignores the limits of its role in resolving water-compact disputes between States.  And in the name of protecting downstream States from their upstream neighbors, it diminishes the sovereign status of each of them.</p><p>                    We owe the parties better.  I would apply the same principles of contract law that we have previously applied to water disputes between States.  Under those principles, I would sustain Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s and Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to order $1.8 million in disgorgement, and overrule Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 exception to that recommendation.  I would also sustain Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 exception to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to reform the Settlement.</p><p>                    I agree only with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions to overrule Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s finding that it know-ingly failed to comply with the Compact, and Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 ex-ception to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation not to issuean injunction requiring Nebraska to comply with theCompact.</p><p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
