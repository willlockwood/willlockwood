Giles was convicted.  While his appeal was pending, this Court held that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause gives defendants the right to cross-examine witnesses who give testimony against them, except in cases where an exception to the confrontation right was recognized at the founding.  <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a>, 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  The State Court of Appeal concluded that the Confrontation Clause permitted the trial court to admit into evidence the unconfronted testimony of the murder victim under a doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.  It concluded that Giles had forfeited his right to confront the victim\xe2\x80\x99s testimony because it found Giles had committed the murder for which he was on trial\xe2\x80\x94an intentional criminal act that made the victim unavailable to testify.  The State Supreme Court affirmed on the same ground.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory of forfeiture by wrongdoing is not an exception to the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation requirement because it was not an exception established at the founding.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9320; 22\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Common-law courts allowed the introduction of statements by an absent witness who was \xe2\x80\x9cdetained\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ckept away\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cmeans or procurement\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant.  Cases and treatises indicate that this rule applied only when the defendant engaged in conduct <em>designed</em> to prevent the witness from testifying.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The manner in which this forfeiture rule was applied makes plain that unconfronted testimony would not be admitted without a showing that the defendant intended to prevent a witness from testifying.  In cases where the evidence suggested that the defendant wrongfully caused the absence of a witness, but had not done so to prevent the witness from testifying, unconfronted testimony was excluded unless it fell within the separate common-law exception to the confrontation requirement for statements made by speakers who were both on the brink of death and aware that they were dying.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Not only was California\xe2\x80\x99s proposed exception to the confrontation right plainly not an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptio[n] established at the time of the founding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crawford, supra,</em> at 54; it is not established in American jurisprudence since<em> </em>the founding.  No case before 1985 applied forfeiture to admit statements outside the context of conduct designed to prevent a witness from testifying.  The view that the exception applies only when the defendant intends to make a witness unavailable is also supported by modern authorities, such as Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6), which \xe2\x80\x9ccodifies the forfeiture doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> 547 U. S.813, 833.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d) The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that no<em> </em>testimony would come in at common law under a forfeiture theory unless it was confronted is not supported by the cases.  In any event, if the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s theory were true, it would not support a broader forfeiture exception but would eliminate the forfeiture exception entirely.  Previously confronted testimony by an unavailable witness is always admissible, wrongful procurement or not.  See <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 68.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0 Acts of domestic violence are often intended to dissuade a victim from resorting to outside help.  A defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior abuse, or threats of abuse, intended to dissuade a victim from resorting to outside help would be highly relevant to determining the intent of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent act causing the witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence, as would evidence of ongoing criminal proceedings at which the victim would have been expected to testify.  Here, the state courts did not consider Giles\xe2\x80\x99 intent, which they found irrelevant under their interpretation of the forfeiture doctrine.  They are free to consider intent on remand.

No witness saw the shooting, but Giles\xe2\x80\x99 niece heard what transpired from inside the house.  She heard Giles and Avie speaking in conversational tones.  Avie then yelled \xe2\x80\x9cGranny\xe2\x80\x9d several times and a series of gunshots sounded.  Giles\xe2\x80\x99 niece and grandmother ran outside and saw Giles standing near Avie with a gun in his hand.  Avie, who had not been carrying a weapon, had been shot six times.  One wound was consistent with Avie\xe2\x80\x99s holding her hand up at the time she was shot, another was consistent with her having turned to her side, and a third was consistent with her having been shot while lying on the ground.  Giles fled the scene after the shooting.  He was apprehended by police about two weeks later and charged with murder.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At trial, Giles testified that he had acted in self-defense.  Giles described Avie as jealous, and said he knew that she had once shot a man, that he had seen her threaten people with a knife, and that she had vandalized his home and car on prior occasions.  He said that on the day of the shooting, Avie came to his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house and threatened to kill him and his new girlfriend, who had been at the house earlier.  He said that Avie had also threatened to kill his new girlfriend when Giles and Avie spoke on the phone earlier that day.  Giles testified that after Avie threatened him at the house, he went into the garage and retrieved a gun, took the safety off, and started walking toward the back door of the house.  He said that Avie charged at him, and that he was afraid she had something in her hand.  According to Giles, he closed his eyes and fired several shots, but did not intend to kill Avie.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prosecutors sought to introduce statements that Avie had made to a police officer responding to a domestic-violence report about three weeks before the shooting.  Avie, who was crying when she spoke, told the officer that Giles had accused her of having an affair, and that after the two began to argue, Giles grabbed her by the shirt, lifted her off the floor, and began to choke her.  According to Avie, when she broke free and fell to the floor, Giles punched her in the face and head, and after she broke free again, he opened a folding knife, held it about three feet away from her, and threatened to kill her if he found her cheating on him.  Over Giles\xe2\x80\x99 objection, the trial court admitted these statements into evidence under a provision of California law that permits admission of out-of-court statements describing the infliction or threat of physical injury on a declarant when the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the prior statements are deemed trustworthy.  Cal. Evid. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71370 (West Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A jury convicted Giles of first-degree murder.  He appealed.  While his appeal was pending, this Court decided in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a>, 53\xe2\x80\x9354 (2004), that the Confrontation Clause requires that a defendant have the opportunity to confront the witnesses who give testimony against him, except in cases where an exception to the confrontation right was recognized at the time of the founding.  The California Court of Appeal held that the admission of Avie\xe2\x80\x99s unconfronted statements at Giles\xe2\x80\x99 trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause as construed by <em>Crawford </em>because <em>Crawford </em>recognized a doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.  19 Cal. Rptr. 3d 843, 847 (2004) (officially depublished).  It concluded that Giles had forfeited his right to confront Avie because he had committed the murder for which he was on trial, and because his intentional criminal act made Avie unavailable to testify.  The California Supreme Court affirmed on the same ground.  40 Cal. 4th 833, 837, 152 P. 3d 433, 435 (2007).  We granted certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right \xe2\x80\xa6 to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Amendment contemplates that a witness who makes testimonial statements admitted against a defendant will ordinarily be present at trial for cross-examination, and that if the witness is unavailable, his prior testimony will be introduced only if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.  <em>Crawford, </em>541 U. S., at 68.  The State does not dispute here, and we accept without deciding, that Avie\xe2\x80\x99s statements accusing Giles of assault were testimonial.  But it maintains (as did the California Supreme Court) that the Sixth Amendment did not prohibit prosecutors from introducing the statements because an exception to the confrontation guarantee permits the use of a witness\xe2\x80\x99s unconfronted testimony if a judge finds, as the judge did in this case, that the defendant committed a wrongful act that rendered the witness unavailable to testify at trial.  We held in <em>Crawford</em> that the Confrontation Clause is \xe2\x80\x9cmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 54.  We therefore ask whether the theory of forfeiture by wrongdoing accepted by the California Supreme Court is a founding-era exception to the confrontation right.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously acknowledged that two forms of testimonial statements were admitted at common law even though they were unconfronted.  See <em>id.</em>, at 56, n.\xc2\xa06, 62.  The first of these were declarations made by a speaker who was both on the brink of death and aware that he was dying.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>King </em>v. <em>Woodcock, </em>1 Leach 500, 501\xe2\x80\x93504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353\xe2\x80\x93354 (1789); <em>State</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, 3 N.\xc2\xa0C. 31 (Super. L. &amp; Eq. 1798); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Veitch</em>, 28 F. Cas. 367, 367\xe2\x80\x93368 (No. 16,614) (CC DC 1803); <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 4 Va. 78, 80\xe2\x80\x9381 (Gen. Ct. 1817).  Avie did not make the unconfronted statements admitted at Giles\xe2\x80\x99 trial when she was dying, so her statements do not fall within this historic exception.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second common-law doctrine, which we will refer to as forfeiture by wrongdoing, permitted the introduction of statements of a witness who was \xe2\x80\x9cdetained\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ckept away\xe2\x80\x9d by the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans or procurement\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 6 How. St. Tr. 769, 771 (H. L. 1666) (\xe2\x80\x9cdetained\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 12 How. St. Tr. 833, 851 (H. L. 1692) (\xe2\x80\x9cmade him keep away\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Queen </em>v. <em>Scaife, </em>117 Q.\xc2\xa0B. 238, 242, 117 Eng. Rep. 1271, 1273 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1851) (\xe2\x80\x9ckept away\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 425 (4th ed. 1762) (hereinafter Hawkins) (same); T.\xc2\xa0Peake, Compendium of the Law of Evidence 62 (2d ed. 1804) (\xe2\x80\x9csent\xe2\x80\x9d away); 1 G.\xc2\xa0Gilbert, Law of Evidence 214 (1791) (\xe2\x80\x9cdetained and kept back from appearing by the means and procurement of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d).  The doctrine has roots in the 1666 decision in <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, at which judges concluded that a witness\xe2\x80\x99s having been \xe2\x80\x9cdetained by the means or procurement of the prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d provided a basis to read testimony previously given at a coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest.  6 How. St. Tr., at 770\xe2\x80\x93771.  Courts and commentators also concluded that wrongful procurement of a witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence was among the grounds for admission of statements made at bail and committal hearings conducted under the Marian statutes, which directed justices of the peace to take the statements of felony suspects and the persons bringing the suspects before the magistrate, and to certify those statements to the court, <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344; J.\xc2\xa0Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance 10\xe2\x80\x9312, 16\xe2\x80\x9320 (1974).  See 2 Hawkins 429.  This class of confronted statements was also admissible if the witness who made them was dead or unable to travel.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The terms used to define the scope of the forfeiture rule suggest that the exception applied only when the defendant engaged in conduct <em>designed </em>to prevent the witness from testifying.  The rule required the witness to have been \xe2\x80\x9ckept back\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdetained\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cmeans or procurement\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant.  Although there are definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprocurement\xe2\x80\x9d that would merely require that a defendant have caused the witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence, other definitions would limit the causality to one that was <em>designed </em>to bring about the result \xe2\x80\x9cprocured.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto <em>contrive</em> and effect\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>ibid.</em> (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto get; to gain; to obtain; as by request, loan, effort, labor or purchase\xe2\x80\x9d); 12 Oxford English Dictionary 559 (2d ed. 1989) (def. I(3)) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o contrive or devise with care (an action or proceeding); to endeavour to cause or bring about (mostly something evil) <em>to</em> or <em>for</em> a person\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, while the term \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d could sweep in all cases in which a defendant caused a witness to fail to appear, it can also connote that a defendant forfeits confrontation rights when he uses an intermediary for the purpose of making a witness absent.  See 9 <em>id.</em>, at 516 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] person who intercedes for another or uses influence in order to bring about a desired result\xe2\x80\x9d); N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 822 (1869) (\xe2\x80\x9cThat through which, or by the help of which, an end is attained\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cases and treatises of the time indicate that a purpose-based definition of these terms governed.  A number of them said that prior testimony was admissible when a witness was kept away by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmeans and contrivance.\xe2\x80\x9d See 1 J. Chitty, A Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 81 (1816) (\xe2\x80\x9ckept away by the means and contrivance of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d); S. Phillipps, A Treatise on the Law of Evidence 165 (1814) (\xe2\x80\x9ckept out of the way by the means and contrivance of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Drayton</em> v. <em>Wells</em>, 10 S.\xc2\xa0C. L. 409, 411 (S. C. 1819) (\xe2\x80\x9ckept away by the contrivance of the opposite party\xe2\x80\x9d).  This phrase requires that the defendant have schemed to bring about the absence from trial that he \xe2\x80\x9ccontrived.\xe2\x80\x9d  Contrivance is commonly defined as the act of \xe2\x80\x9cinventing, devising or planning,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Webster, <em>supra</em>, at 47, \xe2\x80\x9cingeniously endeavoring the accomplishment of anything,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe bringing to pass by planning, scheming, or stratagem,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[a]daption of means to an end; design, intention,\xe2\x80\x9d 3 Oxford English Dictionary, <em>supra</em>, at 850.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An 1858 treatise made the purpose requirement more explicit still, stating that the forfeiture rule applied when a witness \xe2\x80\x9chad been kept out of the way by the prisoner, or by some one on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, <em>in order to prevent him from giving evidence against him</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  E. Powell, The Practice of the Law of Evidence 166 (1st ed. 1858) (emphasis added).  The wrongful-procurement exception was invoked in a manner consistent with this definition.  We are aware of no case in which the exception was invoked although the defendant had not engaged in conduct designed to prevent a witness from testifying, such as offering a bribe. </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The manner in which the rule was applied makes plain that unconfronted testimony would <em>not</em> be admitted without a showing that the defendant intended to prevent a witness from testifying.  In cases where the evidence suggested that the defendant had caused a person to be absent, but had not done so to prevent the person from testifying\xe2\x80\x94as in the typical murder case involving accusatorial statements by the victim\xe2\x80\x94the testimony was excluded unless it was confronted or fell within the dying-declaration exception.  Prosecutors do not appear to have even <em>argued</em> that the judge could admit the unconfronted statements because the defendant committed the murder for which he was on trial.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider <em>King </em>v. <em>Woodcock</em>.  William Woodcock was accused of killing his wife, Silvia, who had been beaten and left near death.  A Magistrate took Silvia Woodcock\xe2\x80\x99s account of the crime, under oath, and she died about 48 hours later.  The judge stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[g]reat as a crime of this nature must always appear to be, yet the inquiry into it must proceed upon the rules of evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Leach, at 500, 168 Eng. Rep., at 352.  Aside from testimony given at trial in the presence of the prisoner, the judge said, there were \xe2\x80\x9ctwo other species which are admitted by law: The one is the dying declaration of a person who has received a fatal blow; the other is the examination of a prisoner, and the depositions of the witnesses who may be produced against him\xe2\x80\x9d taken under the Marian bail and committal statutes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 501, 168 Eng. Rep., at 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (footnote omitted).  Silvia Woodcock\xe2\x80\x99s statement could not be admitted pursuant to the Marian statutes because it was unconfronted\xe2\x80\x94the defendant had not been brought before the examining Magistrate and \xe2\x80\x9cthe prisoner therefore had no opportunity of contradicting the facts it contains.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 502, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353.  Thus, the statements were admissible only if the witness \xe2\x80\x9capprehended that she was in such a state of mortality as would inevitably oblige her soon to answer before her Maker for the truth or falsehood of her assertions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 503, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353\xe2\x80\x93354 (footnote omitted).  Depending on the account one credits, the court either instructed the jury to consider the statements only if Woodcock was \xe2\x80\x9cin fact under the apprehension of death,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 354, or determined for itself that Woodcock was \xe2\x80\x9cquietly resigned and submitting to her fate\xe2\x80\x9d and admitted her statements into evidence, 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown 356 (1803).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0King </em>v. <em>Dingler,</em> 2 Leach 561,<em> </em>168 Eng. Rep. 383 (1791),<em> </em>applied the same test to exclude unconfronted statements by a murder victim.  George Dingler was charged with killing his wife Jane, who suffered multiple stab wounds that left her in the hospital for 12 days before she died.  The day after the stabbing, a Magistrate took Jane Dingler\xe2\x80\x99s deposition\xe2\x80\x94as in <em>Woodcock, </em>under oath\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cof the facts and circumstances which had attended the outrage committed upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Leach, at 561, 168 Eng. Rep., at 383.  George Dingler\xe2\x80\x99s attorney argued that the statements did not qualify as dying declarations and were not admissible Marian examinations because they were not taken in the presence of the prisoner, with the result that the defendant did not \xe2\x80\x9chave, as he is entitled to have, the benefit of cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 562, 168 Eng. Rep., at 384.  The prosecutor agreed, but argued the deposition should still be admitted because \xe2\x80\x9cit was the best evidence that the nature of the case would afford.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 563, 168 Eng. Rep., at 384.  Relying on <em>Woodcock, </em>the court \xe2\x80\x9crefused to receive the examination into evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 563, 168 Eng. Rep., at 384.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many other cases excluded victims\xe2\x80\x99 statements when there was insufficient evidence that the witness was aware he was about to die.  See <em>Thomas John\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 1 East 357, 358 (P.\xc2\xa0C. 1790); <em>Welbourn\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 1 East 358, 360 (P.\xc2\xa0C. 1792); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woods</em>, 28 F. Cas. 762, 763 (No. 16,760) (CC DC 1834); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>State</em>, 17 Miss. 115, 120 (1847); <em>Montgomery</em> v. <em>State</em>, 11 Ohio 424, 425\xe2\x80\x93426 (1842); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>State</em>, 26 Tenn. 542, 543 (1847); <em>Smith</em> v. <em>State</em>, 28 Tenn. 9, 23 (1848).  Courts in all these cases did not even consider admitting the statements on the ground that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime was to blame for the witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence\xe2\x80\x94even when the evidence establishing that was overwhelming.  The reporter in <em>Woodcock </em>went out of his way to comment on the strength of the case against the defendant: \xe2\x80\x9cThe evidence, independent of the information or declarations of the deceased, was of a very pressing and urgent nature against the prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Leach, at 501, 168<em> </em>Eng. Rep., at 352.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State</em>, <em>supra,</em> the evidence that the defendant had caused the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death included, but was not limited to, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s having obtained arsenic from a local doctor a few days before his wife became violently ill; the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s paramour testifying at trial that the defendant admitted to poisoning his wife; the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s having asked a physician \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the presence of arsenic could be discovered in the human stomach a month after death\xe2\x80\x9d; and, the answer to that inquiry apparently not having been satisfactory, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s having tried to hire a person to burn down the building containing his wife\xe2\x80\x99s body.  <em>Id.</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  If the State\xe2\x80\x99s reading of common law were correct, the dying declarations in these cases and others like them would have been admissible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judges and prosecutors also failed to invoke forfeiture as a sufficient basis to admit unconfronted statements in the cases that did apply the dying-declarations exception.  This failure, too, is striking.  At a murder trial, presenting evidence that the defendant was responsible for the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death would have been no more difficult than putting on the government\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief.  Yet prosecutors did not attempt to obtain admission of dying declarations on wrongful-procurement-of-absence grounds before going to the often considerable trouble of putting on evidence to show that the crime victim had not believed he could recover.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 4 Va., at 80\xe2\x80\x9381 (three witnesses called to testify on the point); <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 4 Va. 111, 116\xe2\x80\x93117 (Gen. Ct. 1817) (testimony elicited from doctor and witness); <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>State</em>, 19 Tenn. 265, 278\xe2\x80\x93279 (1838) (doctor questioned about expected fatality of victim\xe2\x80\x99s wound and about victim\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State offers another explanation for the above cases.  It argues that when a defendant committed some act of wrongdoing that rendered a witness unavailable, he forfeited his right to object to the witness\xe2\x80\x99s testimony on confrontation grounds, but not on hearsay grounds.  See Brief for Respondent 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  No case or treatise that we have found, however, suggested that a defendant who committed wrongdoing forfeited his confrontation rights but not his hearsay rights.  And the distinction would have been a surprising one, because courts prior to the founding excluded hearsay evidence in large part <em>because </em>it was unconfronted.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 2 Hawkins 606 (6th ed. 1787); 2 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 313 (1736). As the plurality said in <em>Dutton </em>v.<em> Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/74/index.html">400 U. S. 74</a>, 86 (1970), \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t seems apparent that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause and the evidentiary hearsay rule stem from the same roots.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State and the dissent note that common-law authorities justified the wrongful-procurement rule by invoking the maxim that a defendant should not be permitted to benefit from his own wrong.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, G. Gilbert, Law of Evidence 140\xe2\x80\x93141 (1756) (if a witness was \xe2\x80\x9cdetained and kept back from appearing by the means and procurement\xe2\x80\x9d testimony would be read because a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cshall never be admitted to shelter himself by such evil Practices on the Witness, that being to give him Advantage of his own Wrong\xe2\x80\x9d).  But as the evidence amply shows, the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cevil Practices\xe2\x80\x9d to which these statements referred was conduct <em>designed</em> to prevent a witness from testifying.  The absence of a forfeiture rule covering this sort of conduct would create an intolerable incentive for defendants to bribe, intimidate, or even kill witnesses against them.  There is nothing mysterious about courts\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to carry the rationale further.  The notion that judges may strip the defendant of a right that the Constitution deems essential to a fair trial, on the basis of a prior <em>judicial</em> assessment that the defendant is guilty as charged, does not sit well with the right to trial by jury.  It is akin, one might say, to \xe2\x80\x9cdispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crawford, </em>541 U. S., at 62.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only was the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed exception to the right of confrontation plainly not an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptio[n] established at the time of the founding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 54; it is not established in American jurisprudence <em>since </em>the founding.  American courts never\xe2\x80\x94prior to 1985\xe2\x80\x94invoked forfeiture outside the context of deliberate witness tampering.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court first addressed forfeiture in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/98/145/index.html">98 U. S. 145</a> (1879), where, after hearing testimony that suggested the defendant had kept his wife away from home so that she could not be subpoenaed to testify, the trial court permitted the government to introduce testimony of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s wife from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior trial.  See<em> id.</em>, at 148\xe2\x80\x93150.  On appeal, the Court held that admission of the statements did not violate the right of the defendant to confront witnesses at trial, because when a witness is absent by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful procurement,\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cis in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9ctheir evidence is supplied in some lawful way.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 158.  <em>Reynolds </em>invoked broad forfeiture principles to explain its holding.  The decision stated, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Constitution does not guarantee an accused person against the legitimate consequences of his own wrongful acts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and that the wrongful-procurement rule \xe2\x80\x9chas its foundation\xe2\x80\x9d in the principle that no one should be permitted to take advantage of his wrong, and is \xe2\x80\x9cthe outgrowth of a maxim based on the principles of common honesty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 159.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reynolds</em> relied on these maxims (as the common-law authorities had done) to be sure.  But it relied on them (as the common-law authorities had done) to admit prior testimony in a case where the defendant had engaged in wrongful conduct designed to prevent a witness\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion indicated that it was adopting the common-law rule.  It cited leading common-law cases\xe2\x80\x94<em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case, Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case, </em>and <em>Scaife</em>\xe2\x80\x94described itself as \xe2\x80\x9ccontent with\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9clong-established usage\xe2\x80\x9d of the forfeiture principle, and admitted prior confronted statements under circumstances where admissibility was open to no doubt under <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>.  <em>Reynolds, supra,</em> at 158\xe2\x80\x93159.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the State\xe2\x80\x99s rule had an historical pedigree in the common law or even in the 1879 decision in <em>Reynolds</em>, one would have expected it to be routinely invoked in murder prosecutions like the one here, in which the victim\xe2\x80\x99s prior statements inculpated the defendant.  It was never invoked in this way.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The earliest case identified by the litigants and <em>amici</em> <em>curiae</em> which admitted unconfronted statements on a forfeiture theory without evidence that the defendant had acted with the purpose of preventing the witness from testifying was decided in 1985.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rouco, </em>765 F.\xc2\xa02d 983 (CA11).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997, this Court approved a Federal Rule of Evidence, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cForfeiture by wrongdoing,\xe2\x80\x9d which applies only when the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cengaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule of Evid. 804(b)(6). We have described this as a rule \xe2\x80\x9cwhich codifies the forfeiture doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U. S. 813</a>, 833 (2006).  Every commentator we are aware of has concluded the requirement of intent \xe2\x80\x9cmeans that the exception applies only if the defendant has in mind the particular purpose of making the witness unavailable.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \xc2\xa78:134, p. 235 (3d ed. 2007); 5 J. Weinstein &amp; M.

Brown, McCormick on Evidence 176 (6th ed. 2006).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The commentators come out this way because the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that knowledge is sufficient to show intent is emphatically <em>not</em> the modern view.  See 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa75.2, p. 340 (2d ed. 2003).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, our interpretation of the common-law forfeiture rule is supported by (1) the most natural reading of the language used at common law; (2) the absence of common-law cases <em>admitting </em>prior statements on a forfeiture theory when the defendant had not engaged in conduct designed to prevent a witness from testifying; (3) the common law\xe2\x80\x99s uniform exclusion of unconfronted inculpatory testimony by murder victims (except testimony given with awareness of impending death) in the innumerable cases in which the defendant was on trial for killing the victim, but was not shown to have done so for the purpose of preventing testimony; (4) a subsequent history in which the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s broad forfeiture theory has not been applied.  The first two and the last are highly persuasive; the third is in our view conclusive.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent evades the force of that third point by claiming that <em>no </em>testimony would come in at common law based on a forfeiture theory unless it was confronted.  It explains the exclusion of murder victims\xe2\x80\x99 testimony by arguing that wrongful procurement was understood to be a basis for admission of Marian depositions\xe2\x80\x94which the defendant would have had the opportunity to confront\xe2\x80\x94but not for the admission of unconfronted testimony.  See <em>post</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That explanation is not supported by the cases.  In <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case, </em>the leading English case finding wrongful procurement, the witness\xe2\x80\x99s statements were admitted without regard to confrontation.  An agent of the defendant had attempted to bribe a witness, who later disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  The prosecutor contended that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cspirited, or withdrawn from us, by a gentleman that said he came to [the witness] from the prisoner, and desired him to be kind to the prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 How. St. Tr., at 851.  The court allowed the witness\xe2\x80\x99s prior statements before the coroner to be read, <em>id.</em>, at 852, although there was no reason to think the defendant would have been present at the prior examination.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasoning of the common-law authorities reinforces the conclusion that the wrongful-procurement rule did not depend on prior confrontation.  The judge in <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case,</em> after being told that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s agents or friends have, since the last sessions, made or conveyed away a young man that was a principal evidence against him,\xe2\x80\x9d declared that if this were proved, \xe2\x80\x9cit will no way conduce to Mr. Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 835\xe2\x80\x93836.  Similarly, a leading treatise\xe2\x80\x99s justification of the use of statements from coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquests when a witness was \xe2\x80\x9cdetained and kept back from appearing by the means and procurement\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant was that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cshall never be admitted to shelter himself by such evil Practices on the Witness, that being to give him Advantage of his own Wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  G. Gilbert, Law of Evidence 140 (1756).  But if the defendant could keep out unconfronted prior testimony of a wrongfully detained witness he <em>would </em>profit from \xe2\x80\x9csuch evil Practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While American courts understood the admissibility of statements made at prior proceedings (including coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquests like the one in <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>) to turn on prior opportunity for cross-examination as a general matter, see <em>Crawford, </em>541 U. S., at 47, n.\xc2\xa02, no such limit was applied or expressed in early wrongful-procurement cases.  In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Barber</em>, 1 Root 76 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1775), \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne White, who had testified before the justice and before the grand-jury against Barber, and minutes taken of his testimony, was sent away by one Bullock, a friend of Barber\xe2\x80\x99s, and by his instigation; so that he could not be had to testify before the petit-jury.  The court admitted witnesses to relate what White had before testified.\xe2\x80\x9d  Two leading evidentiary treatises and a Delaware case reporter cite that case for the proposition that grand jury statements were admitted on a wrongful-procurement theory.  See Phillipps, Treatise on Evidence, at 200, n.\xc2\xa0(a); T. Peake, Compendium of the Law of Evidence 91, n.\xc2\xa0(m) (American ed. 1824); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis</em>, 1 Del. Cas. 608, 609, n. 1 (Ct. Quarter Sess. 1818).  (Of course the standard practice since approximately the 17th century has been to conduct grand jury proceedings in secret, without confrontation, in part so that the defendant does not learn the State\xe2\x80\x99s case in advance.  S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman, &amp; M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice \xc2\xa75.2 (2d ed. 2005); see also 8 J. Wigmore Evidence \xc2\xa72360, pp. 728\xe2\x80\x93735 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961)).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Georgia Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s articulation of the forfeiture rule similarly suggests that it understood forfeiture to be a basis for admitting unconfronted testimony.  The court wrote that <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case </em>established that if a witness \xe2\x80\x9cwho had been examined by the Crown, and was then absent, was detained by the means or procurement of the prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthen the examination should be read\xe2\x80\x9d into evidence.  <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Ga. 402, 403 (1856).  Its rule for all cases in which the witness \xe2\x80\x9chad been examined by the Crown\xe2\x80\x9d carried no confrontation limit, and indeed, the court adopted the rule from <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em> which involved not Marian examinations carrying a confrontation requirement, but coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquests that lacked one.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The leading American case on forfeiture of the confrontation right by wrongful procurement was our 1879 decision in <em>Reynolds</em>.  That case does not set forth prior confrontation as a requirement for the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s application, and begins its historical analysis with a full description of the rule set forth in <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, which itself contained no indication that the admitted testimony must have been previously confronted.  It followed that description with a citation of <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>\xe2\x80\x94which, like <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>,<em> </em>applied wrongful procurement to coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquests, not confronted Marian examinations\xe2\x80\x94saying that the rule in those cases \xe2\x80\x9cseems to have been recognized as the law of England ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d 98 U. S., at 158.  The opinion\xe2\x80\x99s description of the forfeiture rule is likewise unconditioned by any requirement of prior confrontation:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution gives the accused the right to a trial at which he should be confronted with the witnesses against him; but if a witness is absent by his own wrongful procurement, he cannot complain if competent evidence is admitted to supply the place of that which he kept away. . . . [The Constitution] grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his privilege.  If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThere is no mention in this paragraph of a need for prior confrontation, even though if the Court believed such a limit applied, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctheir evidence is supplied\xe2\x80\x9d would more naturally have read \xe2\x80\x9ctheir previously confronted evidence is supplied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crawford</em> reaffirmed this understanding by citing <em>Reynolds </em>for a forfeiture exception to the confrontation right.  541 U. S., at 54.  And what <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Crawford </em>described as the law became a seeming holding of this Court in <em>Davis</em>, which, after finding an absent witness\xe2\x80\x99s unconfronted statements introduced at trial to have been testimonial, and after observing that \xe2\x80\x9cone who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation,\xe2\x80\x9d 547 U. S., at 833, remanded with the instruction that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Indiana courts may (if they are asked) determine  on remand whether . . . a claim of forfeiture is properly raised and, if so, whether it is meritorious,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id.</em> at 834.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the case law is sparse, in light of these decisions and the absence of even a single case <em>declining </em>to admit unconfronted statements of an absent witness on wrongful-procurement grounds when the defendant sought to prevent the witness from testifying, we are not persuaded to displace the understanding of our prior cases that wrongful procurement permits the admission of prior unconfronted testimony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the parsing of cases aside, the most obvious problem with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s theory that the forfeiture rule applied only to confronted testimony is that it amounts to self-immolation.  If it were true, it would destroy not only our case for a narrow forfeiture rule, but the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s case for a broader one as well.  Prior <em>confronted </em>statements by witnesses who are unavailable are admissible whether or not the defendant was responsible for their unavailability.  <em>Id.</em>, at 68.  If the forfeiture doctrine did not admit unconfronted prior testimony at common law, the conclusion must be, not that the forfeiture doctrine requires no specific intent in order to render unconfronted testimony available, but that unconfronted testimony is subject to no forfeiture doctrine at all.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having destroyed its own case, the dissent issues a thinly veiled invitation to overrule <em>Crawford</em> and adopt an approach not much different from the regime of <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a> (1980), under which the Court would create the exceptions that it thinks consistent with the policies underlying the confrontation guarantee, regardless of how that guarantee was historically understood.  The \xe2\x80\x9cbasic purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of forfeiture doctrine, it says, require that a defendant who wrongfully caused the absence of a witness be deprived of his confrontation rights, whether or not there was any such rule applicable at common law.  <em>Post</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If we were to reason from the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of the forfeiture doctrine, we are not at all sure we would come to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s favored result.  The common-law forfeiture rule was aimed at removing the otherwise powerful incentive for defendants to intimidate, bribe, and kill the witnesses against them\xe2\x80\x94in other words, it is grounded in \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability of courts to protect the integrity of their proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis, </em>547 U. S., at 834.  The boundaries of the doctrine seem to us intelligently fixed so as to avoid a principle repugnant to our constitutional system of trial by jury: that those murder defendants whom the judge considers guilty (after less than a full trial, mind you, and of course before the jury has pronounced guilt) should be deprived of fair-trial rights, lest they benefit from their judge-determined wrong.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since it is most certainly <em>not</em> the norm that trial rights can be \xe2\x80\x9cforfeited\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of a prior judicial determination of guilt, the dissent must go far afield to argue even by analogy for its forfeiture rule.  See<em> post, </em>at 5 (discussing common-law doctrine that prohibits the murderer from collecting insurance on the life of his victim, or an inheritance from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s estate); <em>post</em>, at 6 (noting that many criminal statutes punish a defendant regardless of his purpose).  These analogies support propositions of which we have no doubt: States may allocate property rights as they see fit, and a murderer can and should be punished, without regard to his purpose, after a fair trial.   But a legislature may not \xe2\x80\x9cpunish\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant for his evil acts by stripping him of the right to have his guilt in\na criminal proceeding determined <em>by a jury</em>, and on the\nbasis of evidence the Constitution deems reliable and\nadmissible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The larger problem with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument, however, is that the guarantee of confrontation is no guarantee at all if it is subject to whatever exceptions courts from time to time consider \xe2\x80\x9cfair.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is not the role of courts to extrapolate from the words of the Sixth Amendment to the values behind it, and then to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve (in the courts\xe2\x80\x99 views) those underlying values.  The Sixth Amendment seeks fairness indeed\xe2\x80\x94but seeks it through very specific means (one of which is confrontation) that were the trial rights of Englishmen.  It \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developed by the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crawford, supra</em>, at 54.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent closes by pointing out that a forfeiture rule which ignores <em>Crawford </em>would be particularly helpful to women in abusive relationships\xe2\x80\x94or at least particularly helpful in punishing their abusers.  Not as helpful as the dissent suggests, since only <em>testimonial </em>statements are excluded by the Confrontation Clause.  Statements to friends and neighbors about abuse and intimidation, and statements to physicians in the course of receiving treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay rules, which are free to adopt the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s version of forfeiture by wrongdoing.  In any event, we are puzzled by the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s decision to devote its peroration to domestic abuse cases.  Is the suggestion that we should have one Confrontation Clause (the one the Framers adopted and <em>Crawford </em>described) for all other crimes, but a special, improvised, Confrontation Clause for those crimes that are frequently directed against women?  Domestic violence is an intolerable offense that legislatures may choose to combat through many means\xe2\x80\x94from increasing criminal penalties to adding resources for investigation and prosecution to funding awareness and prevention campaigns. But for that serious crime, as for others, abridging the constitutional rights of criminal defendants is not in the State\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The domestic-violence context is, however, relevant for a separate reason.  Acts of domestic violence often are intended to dissuade a victim from resorting to outside help, and include conduct designed to prevent testimony to police officers or cooperation in criminal prosecutions.  Where such an abusive relationship culminates in murder, the evidence may support a finding that the crime expressed the intent to isolate the victim and to stop her from reporting abuse to the authorities or cooperating with a criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x94rendering her prior statements admissible under the forfeiture doctrine.  Earlier abuse, or threats of abuse, intended to dissuade the victim from resorting to outside help would be highly relevant to this inquiry, as would evidence of ongoing criminal proceedings at which the victim would have been expected to testify.  This is not, as the dissent charges, <em>post</em>, at 25, nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge-based intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis deleted.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state courts in this case did not consider the intent of the defendant because they found that irrelevant to application of the forfeiture doctrine.

See <em>post, </em>at 12 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.).  But that would not be contriving to keep the witness away.  The dissent further suggests that these authorities are irrelevant because \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant phrase\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em> itself is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98by <em>means or </em>procurement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant and means \xe2\x80\x9cmay, <em>or may not</em>, refer to an absence that the defendant desired, as compared to an absence that the defendant caused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (emphasis added).

S. 171</a> (1987), held that admission of the evidence did not violate the Confrontation Clause because it \xe2\x80\x9cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the test under <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a>, 66 (1980), the case that <em>Crawford </em>overruled.  In fact it did not violate the Confrontation Clause for the quite different reason that it was not (as an incriminating statement in furtherance of the conspiracy would probably never be) testimonial.  The co-conspirator hearsay rule does not pertain to a constitutional right and is in fact quite unusual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not say, of course, that a judge can never be allowed to inquire into guilt of the charged offense in order to make a preliminary evidentiary ruling.  That must sometimes be done under the forfeiture rule that we adopt\xe2\x80\x94when, for example, the defendant is on trial for murdering a witness in order to prevent his testimony.  But the exception to ordinary practice that we support is (1) needed to protect the integrity of court proceedings, (2) based upon longstanding precedent, and (3) much less expansive than the exception proposed by the dissent.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent also implies that we should not adhere to <em>Crawford </em>because the confrontation guarantee limits the evidence a State may introduce without limiting the evidence a defendant may introduce.  See <em>post, </em>at 9.  That is true.  Just as it is true that the State cannot decline to provide testimony harmful to its case or complain of the lack of a speedy trial.  The asymmetrical nature of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s criminal-trial guarantees is not an anomaly, but the intentional conferring of privileges designed to prevent criminal conviction of the innocent.

As the Court demonstrates, the confrontation right as understood at the Framing and ratification of the Sixth Amendment was subject to exception on equitable grounds for an absent witness\xe2\x80\x99s prior relevant, testimonial statement, when the defendant brought about the absence with intent to prevent testimony.  It was, and is, reasonable to place the risk of untruth in an unconfronted, out-of-court statement on a defendant who meant to preclude the testing that confrontation provides.  The importance of that intent in assessing the fairness of placing the risk on the defendant is most obvious when a defendant is prosecuted for the very act that causes the witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence, homicide being the extreme example.  If the victim\xe2\x80\x99s prior statement were admissible solely because the defendant kept the witness out of court by committing homicide, admissibility of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s statement to prove guilt would turn on finding the defendant guilty of the homicidal act causing the absence; evidence that the defendant killed would come in because the defendant probably killed.  The only thing saving admissibility and liability determinations from question begging would be (in a jury case) the distinct functions of judge and jury: judges would find by a preponderance of evidence that the defendant killed (and so would admit the testimonial statement), while the jury could so find only on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Equity demands something more than this near circularity before the right to confrontation is forfeited, and more is supplied by showing intent to prevent the witness from testifying.  Cf. <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U. S. 813</a>, 833 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is this rationale for the limit on the forfeiture exception rather than a dispositive example from the historical record that persuades me that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is the right one in this case.  The contrast between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s and Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s careful examinations of the historical record tells me that the early cases on the exception were not calibrated finely enough to answer the narrow question here.  The historical record as revealed by the exchange simply does not focus on what should be required for forfeiture when the crime charged occurred in an abusive relationship or was its culminating act; today\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of domestic abuse had no apparent significance at the time of the Framing, and there is no\nearly example of the forfeiture rule operating in that circumstance. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Examining the early cases and commentary, however, reveals two things that count in favor of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of forfeiture when the evidence shows domestic abuse.  The first is the substantial indication that the Sixth Amendment was meant to require some degree of intent to thwart the judicial process before thinking it reasonable to hold the confrontation right forfeited; otherwise the right would in practical terms boil down to a measure of reliable hearsay, a view rejected in <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004).  The second is the absence from the early material of any reason to doubt that the element of intention would normally be satisfied by the intent inferred on the part of the domestic abuser in the classic abusive relationship, which is meant to isolate the victim from outside help, including the aid of law enforcement and the judicial process.  If the evidence for admissibility shows a continuing relationship of this sort, it would make no sense to suggest that the oppressing defendant miraculously abandoned the dynamics of abuse the instant before he killed his victim, say in a fit of anger.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in Part II\xe2\x80\x93E thus fits the rationale that equity requires and the historical record supports.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962764">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n554 U.

Three weeks later, the defendant did kill her.  At his murder trial, the defendant testified that he had acted in self-defense.  To support that assertion, he described the victim as jealous, vindictive, aggressive, and violent.  To rebut the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim of self-defense and impeach his testimony, the State introduced into evidence the witness\xe2\x80\x99 earlier uncross-examined statements (as state hearsay law permits it to do) to help rebut the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim of self-defense.  It is important to underscore that this case is premised on the assumption, not challenged here, that the witness\xe2\x80\x99 statements are testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.  With that understanding, we ask whether the defendant, through his wrongdoing, has forfeited his Confrontation Clause right.  The Court concludes that he may not have forfeited that right.  In my view, however, he has.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the majority, I believe it important to recognize the relevant history and I start where the majority starts, with <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 6 How. St. Tr. 769 (H.\xe2\x80\x82L. 1666).  In that case, the judges of the House of Lords wrote that a coroner\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court \xe2\x80\x9cexaminations\xe2\x80\x9d of witnesses \xe2\x80\x9cmight be read\xe2\x80\x9d in court if \xe2\x80\x9cthe witnesses . . . were dead or unable to travel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 770.  Additionally, they agreed, an examination \xe2\x80\x9cmight be read\xe2\x80\x9d if the \xe2\x80\x9cwitness who had been examined by the coroner, and was then absent, <em>was detained by the means or procurement of the prisoner</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 770\xe2\x80\x93771 (emphasis added).  Later cases repeated this rule and followed it, admitting depositions where, <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ha[d] been evidence given of ill practice to take [the witness] out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 12 How.

See <em>Reynolds</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/98/145/index.html">98 U. S. 145</a>, 158 (1879).  For example, an 1819 South Carolina case held that a witness\xe2\x80\x99 prior formal examination could be admitted because \xe2\x80\x9cthe witness had been kept away by the contrivance of the opposite party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Drayton</em> v.<em> Wells</em>, 10 S.\xc2\xa0C. L. 409, 411.  An 1856 Georgia case, relying on <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, held that a similar \xe2\x80\x9cexamination should be read\xe2\x80\x9d if the witness \xe2\x80\x9cwas detained by means or procurement of the prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams </em>v.<em> State</em>, 19 Ga. 403.  And in 1878, this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cif a witness is absent by [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] . . . own wrongful procurement, he cannot complain\xe2\x80\x9d about the admission of the witness\xe2\x80\x99 prior testimonial statement.  <em>Reynolds, supra</em>, at 158.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Reynolds </em>stated that, \xe2\x80\x9cif [the defendant] voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cprivilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him,\xe2\x80\x9d in part because of <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case </em>and in part because the rule of forfeiture \xe2\x80\x9chas its foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong . . . a maxim based on the principles of common honesty.\xe2\x80\x9d  98 U. S., at 158\xe2\x80\x93159. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These sources make clear that \xe2\x80\x9cforfeiture by wrongdoing\xe2\x80\x9d satisfies <em>Crawford\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>requirement that the Confrontation Clause be \xe2\x80\x9cread as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cany exception\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cestablished at the time of the founding.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U. S., at 54.  The remaining question concerns the precise metes and bounds of the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception.  We ask how to apply that exception in the present case.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are several strong reasons for concluding that the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception applies here\xe2\x80\x94reasons rooted in common-law history, established principles of criminal law and evidence, and the need for a rule that can be applied without creating great practical difficulties and evidentiary anomalies.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First,</em> the language that courts have used in setting forth the exception is broad enough to cover the wrongdoing at issue in the present case (murder) and much else besides.  A witness whom a defendant murders is kept from testifying  \xe2\x80\x9cby the means . . . of the prisoner<em>\xe2\x80\x9d i.e</em>., the defendant,<em> Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 771;<em> </em>murder is indeed an \xe2\x80\x9cill practice,\xe2\x80\x9d that leads to the witness\xe2\x80\x99 absence, <em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 868;<em> </em>one can fairly call a murder a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrivance to keep the witness out of the way\xe2\x80\x9d, <em>Queen </em>v.<em> Scaife</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 242, 117 Eng. Rep., at 1273<em>;</em> murder, if not a \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent and indirect means\xe2\x80\x9d of keeping the witness from testifying, is a far worse, direct one, <em>Fenwick\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 594; and when a witness is \xe2\x80\x9cabsent\xe2\x80\x9d due to murder, the killer likely brought about that absence by his \xe2\x80\x9cown wrongful procurement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reynolds</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 158.  All of the relevant English and American cases use approximately similar language.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 G. Gilbert, Law of Evidence 214\xe2\x80\x93215 (1791) (examinations are \xe2\x80\x9cto be read on the Trial\xe2\x80\x9d where it can be proved that the witness is \xe2\x80\x9ckept back from appearing by the means and procurement of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d).  And I have found no case that uses language that would not bring a murder and a subsequent trial for murder within its scope.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second, </em>an examination of the forfeiture rule\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes and objectives indicates that the rule applies here.  At the time of the founding, a leading treatise writer described the forfeiture rule as designed to assure that the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cshall never be admitted to shelter himself by such evil Practices on the Witness, that being to give him Advantage of his own Wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 214\xe2\x80\x93215.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s own leading case explained the exception as finding its \xe2\x80\x9cfoundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reynolds</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 159.<em> </em>What more \xe2\x80\x9cevil practice,\xe2\x80\x9d what greater \xe2\x80\x9cwrong,\xe2\x80\x9d than to murder the witness?  And what greater evidentiary \xe2\x80\x9cadvantage\xe2\x80\x9d could one derive from that wrong than thereby to prevent the witness from testifying, <em>e.g</em>., preventing the witness from describing a history of physical abuse that is not consistent with the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he killed her in self-defense?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, related areas of the law motivated by similar equitable principles treat forfeiture or its equivalent similarly.  The common law, for example, prohibits a life insurance beneficiary who murders an insured from recovering under the policy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>New York Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Armstrong</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/117/591/index.html">117 U. S. 591</a>, 600 (1886) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a reproach to the jurisprudence of the country, if one could recover insurance money payable on the death of a party whose life he had feloniously taken\xe2\x80\x9d).<em> </em>And it forbids recovery when the beneficiary \xe2\x80\x9cfeloniously kills the insured, <em>irrespective of the purpose.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  National Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Hood\xe2\x80\x99s Adm\xe2\x80\x99r</em>, 264 Ky. 516, 518, 94 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 1022, 1023 (Ct. App. 1936) (emphasis added) (\xe2\x80\x9cno difference of opinion among the courts\xe2\x80\x9d on the matter).  Similarly, a beneficiary of a will who murders the testator cannot inherit under the will.  See 1 W. Page, Wills \xc2\xa717.19, pp. 999\xe2\x80\x931001 (2003).  And this is so \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the crime was committed for that very purpose or with some other felonious design.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Alstyne</em> v. <em>Tuffy</em>, 103 Misc. 455, 459, 169 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 173, 175 (1918); see also 1 Page, <em>supra, </em>\xc2\xa717.19, at 1002 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his common law doctrine applies alike whether the devisee is guilty of murder, or of manslaughter\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)); see generally H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 76\xe2\x80\x9394 (W. Eskridge &amp; P. Frickey eds. 1994) (discussing so-called \xe2\x80\x9cslayer\xe2\x80\x99s rules\xe2\x80\x9d); Wade, Acquisition of Property by Willfully Killing Another\xe2\x80\x94A Statutory Solution, 49 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 715, 716 (1936) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t must be recognized that \xe2\x80\xa6 the adoption of some means to prevent a slayer from acquiring property as the result of the death of a man whom he has killed is desirable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth</em>, under the circumstances presented by this case, there is no difficulty demonstrating the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  This is because the defendant here knew that murdering his ex-girlfriend would keep her from testifying; and that knowledge is sufficient to show the <em>intent </em>that law ordinarily demands.  As this Court put the matter more than a century ago: A \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98man who performs an act which it is known will produce a particular result is from our common experience presumed to have anticipated that result and to have intended it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Allen</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/492/index.html">164 U. S. 492</a>, 496 (1896); see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/593/index.html">515 U. S. 593</a>, 613 (1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he jury is entitled to presume that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts\xe2\x80\x9d); see also G. Williams, Criminal Law \xc2\xa718, p. 38 (2d ed. 1961) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one situation where a consequence is deemed to be intended though it is not desired.  This is where it is foreseen as substantially certain\xe2\x80\x9d); ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962) (a person acts \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cthe element involves a result of his conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9che is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result\xe2\x80\x9d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe word \xe2\x80\x98intent\xe2\x80\x99 is used throughout . . . to denote that the actor desires to cause consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With a few criminal law exceptions not here relevant, the law holds an individual responsible for consequences known likely to follow just as if that individual had intended to achieve them.  A defendant, in a criminal or a civil case, for example, cannot escape criminal or civil liability for murdering an airline passenger by claiming that his purpose in blowing up the airplane was to kill only a single passenger for her life insurance, not the others on the same flight. See 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa75.2(a), p. 341 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This principle applies here.  Suppose that a husband, H, knows that after he assaulted his wife, W, she gave statements to the police.  Based on the fact that W gave statements to the police, H also knows that it is possible he will be tried for assault.  If H then kills W, H cannot avoid responsibility for intentionally preventing W from testifying, not even if H says he killed W because he was angry with her and not to keep her away from the assault trial.  Of course, the trial here is not for assault; it is for murder. But I should think that this fact, because of the nature of the crime, would count as a stronger, not a weaker, reason for applying the forfeiture rule.  Nor should it matter that  H, at the time of the murder, may have <em>believed</em> an assault trial <em>more likely</em> to take place than a murder trial, for W\xe2\x80\x99s unavailability to testify at <em>any</em> future trial was a <em>certain</em> consequence of the murder.  And any reasonable person would have known it.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Falstaff Brewing Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/526/index.html">410 U. S. 526</a>, 570, n.\xe2\x80\x8222 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]erhaps the oldest rule of evidence\xe2\x80\x94that a man is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts\xe2\x80\x94is based on the common law\xe2\x80\x99s preference for objectively measurable data over subjective statements of opinion and intent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority tries to overcome this elementary legal logic by claiming that the \xe2\x80\x9cforfeiture rule\xe2\x80\x9d applies, not where the defendant <em>intends </em>to prevent the witness from testifying, but only where that is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>purpose, i.e., </em>that the rule applies only where the defendant acts from a particular <em>motive, </em>a <em>desire</em> to keep the witness from trial.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (asserting that the terms used to describe the scope of the forfeiture rule \xe2\x80\x9csuggest that the exception applied only when the defendant engaged in conduct <em>designed</em> to prevent the witness from testifying\xe2\x80\x9d and that a \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose-based definition . . . governed\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the law does not often turn matters of responsibility upon <em>motive, </em>rather than <em>intent.  </em>See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  And there\nis no reason to believe that application of the rule of for-\nfeiture constitutes an exception to this general legal\nprinciple.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, to turn application of the forfeiture rule upon proof of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>purpose </em>(rather than <em>intent</em>)<em>, </em>as the majority does,<em> </em>creates serious practical evidentiary problems.  Consider H who assaults W, knows she has complained to the police, and then murders her.  H <em>knows</em> that W will be unable to testify against him at any future trial.  But who knows whether H\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge played a major role, a middling role, a minor role, or no role at all, in H\xe2\x80\x99s decision to kill W?  Who knows precisely what passed through H\xe2\x80\x99s mind at the critical moment?  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State</em> v. <em>Romero</em>, 2007\xe2\x80\x93NMSC\xe2\x80\x93013, 156 P.\xc2\xa03d 694, 702\xe2\x80\x93703 (finding it doubtful that evidence associated with the murder would support a finding that the <em>purpose</em> of the murder was to keep the victim\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statements to police from the jury).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s insistence upon a showing of <em>purpose </em>or <em>motive</em> cannot be squared with the exception\xe2\x80\x99s basically ethical objective.  If H, by killing W, is able to keep W\xe2\x80\x99s testimony out of court, then he has successfully \xe2\x80\x9ctake[n] advantage of his own wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reynolds</em>, 98 U. S., at 159.  And he does so whether he killed her <em>for the purpose of </em>keeping her from testifying, with <em>certain knowledge</em> that she will not be able to testify<em>, </em>or with <em>a belief</em> that rises to a <em>reasonable level of probability</em>.  The inequity consists of his being able to <em>use </em>the killing to keep out of court her statements against him.  That inequity exists whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind is purposeful, intentional (<em>i.e</em>., with knowledge), or simply probabilistic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fifth,</em> the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach both creates evidentiary anomalies and aggravates existing evidentiary incongruities.  Contrast (a) the defendant who assaults his wife and subsequently threatens her with harm if she testifies, with (b) the defendant who assaults his wife and subsequently murders her in a fit of rage.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, the former (whose threats make clear that his purpose was to prevent his wife from testifying) cannot benefit from his wrong, but the latter (who has committed what is undoubtedly the greater wrong) can.  This is anomalous, particularly in this context where an equitable rule applies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now consider a trial of H for the murder of W at which H claims self-defense.  As the facts of this very case demonstrate, H may be allowed to testify at length and in damning detail about W\xe2\x80\x99s behavior\xe2\x80\x94what she said as well as what she did\xe2\x80\x94both before and during the crime.  See, <em>e.g</em>., Tr. 643\xe2\x80\x93645 (Apr. 1, 2003).  H may be able to introduce some of W\xe2\x80\x99s statements (as he remembers them) under hearsay exceptions for excited utterances or present sense impressions or to show states of mind (here the victim\xe2\x80\x99s statements were admitted through petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to show her state of mind).  W, who is dead, cannot reply.  This incongruity arises in part from the nature of hearsay and the application of ordinary hearsay rules.  But the majority would aggravate the incongruity by prohibiting admission of W\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements to the police (which contradict H\xe2\x80\x99s account), even when they too fall within a hearsay exception, simply because there is <em>no evidence that</em> <em>H was focused on his future trial</em> when he killed her.  There is no reason to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider also that California\xe2\x80\x99s hearsay rules authorize admission of the out-of-court statement of an unavailable declarant where the statement describes or explains the \xe2\x80\x9cinfliction or threat of physical injury upon the declarant,\xe2\x80\x9d if the \xe2\x80\x9cstatement\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cmade at or near the time of the infliction or threat of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Evid. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71370 (Supp. 2008).  Where a victim\xe2\x80\x99s statement is not \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps because she made it to a nurse, the statement could come into evidence under this rule.  But where the statement is made formally to a police officer, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule would keep it out.  Again this incongruity arises in part because of pre-existing confrontation-related rules.  See <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 830, n.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ormality is indeed essential to testimonial utterance\xe2\x80\x9d)<em>.</em>  But, again, the majority would aggravate the incongruity by prohibiting admission of W\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements to the police simply because there is <em>no evidence that</em> <em>H was focused on his future trial</em> when he killed her.  Again, there is no reason to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sixth, </em>to deny the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is not to deny defendants evidentiary safeguards.  It does, of course, in this particular area, deny defendants the right <em>always</em> to cross-examine.  But the hearsay rule has always contained exceptions that permit the admission of evidence where the need is significant and where alternative safeguards of reliability exist.  Those exceptions have evolved over time, see 2 K. Brown, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7326 (2006) (discussion the development of the modern hearsay rule); Fed. Rule Evid. 102 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hese rules shall be construed to secure\xe2\x80\x82.\xe2\x80\x82.\xe2\x80\x82.\xe2\x80\x82promotion of growth and development of the law of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d), often in a direction that permits admission of hearsay only where adequate alternative assurance of reliability exists, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Rule 807 (the \xe2\x80\x9cResidual Exception\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, for example, the presence in court of a witness who took the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s statement permits cross-examination of that witness as to just what the declarant said and as to the surrounding circumstances, while those circumstances themselves provide sufficient guarantees of accuracy to warrant admission under a State\xe2\x80\x99s hearsay exception.  See Cal. Evid. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71370.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, to apply the forfeiture exception here simply lowers a constitutional barrier to admission of earlier testimonial statements; it does not <em>require </em>their admission.  State hearsay rules remain in place; and those rules will determine when, whether, and how evidence of the kind at issue here will come into evidence.  A State, for example, may enact a forfeiture rule as one of its hearsay exceptions, while simultaneously reading into that rule requirements limiting its application.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, n.\xc2\xa02.  To lower the constitutional barrier to admission is to allow the States to do just that, <em>i.e.</em>, to apply their evidentiary rules with flexibility and to revise their rules as experience suggests would be advisable.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, which requires exclusion, would deprive the States of this freedom and flexibility.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority tries to find support for its view in 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century law of evidence.  But a review of the cases set forth in Part I, <em>supra</em>, makes clear that no case limits forfeiture to instances where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>purpose </em>or <em>motivation </em>is<em> </em>to keep the witness away.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  To the contrary, this Court stated in <em>Reynolds</em> that the \xe2\x80\x9cConstitution does not guarantee an accused person against the <em>legitimate </em>consequences of his own wrongful acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  98 U. S., at 158 (emphasis added).  The words \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate consequences\xe2\x80\x9d do <em>not </em>mean<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cdesired consequences\xe2\x80\x9d or refer to purpose or motive; in fact, the words \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate consequences\xe2\x80\x9d can encompass <em>imputed </em>consequences as well as <em>intended </em>consequences<em>.</em>  And this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement in <em>Reynolds </em>that the rule \xe2\x80\x9chas its foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that forfeiture applies where the defendant benefits from a witness\xe2\x80\x99 absence, regardless of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s specific purpose.  <em>Id.,</em> at 159.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than limit forfeiture to instances where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s act has absence of the witness as its <em>purpose</em>, the relevant cases suggest that the forfeiture rule would apply where the witness\xe2\x80\x99 absence was the <em>known</em> <em>consequence </em>of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intentional wrongful act.  <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case </em>and numerous others upon which the forfeiture rule is based say that a Marian deposition (<em>i.e.</em>, a deposition taken by a coroner or magistrate pursuant to the Marian bail and commitment statutes) may be read to the jury if the witness who was absent was detained \xe2\x80\x9cby means or procurement of the prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 6 How. St. Tr., at 771.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d focuses on what the defendant <em>did</em>,<em> </em>not his <em>motive for (or purpose in) doing it</em>.  In <em>Diaz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/223/442/index.html">223 U. S. 442</a> (1912)<em>, </em>which followed <em>Reynolds</em>, this Court used the word \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d (the witness was absent \xe2\x80\x9cby the wrongful act of\xe2\x80\x9d the accused), a word that suggests causation, not motive or purpose.  <em>Id.</em>, at 452; see <em>Eureka Lake &amp; Yuba Canal Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Yuba Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/410/index.html">116 U. S. 410</a>, 418 (1886).  And in <em>Motes</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/178/458/index.html">178 U. S. 458</a>, 473\xe2\x80\x93474 (1900)<em>, </em>the Court spoke of absence \xe2\x80\x9cwith the assent of\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant, a phrase perfectly consistent with an absence that is <em>a consequence of</em>, not <em>the purpose of</em>, what the assenting defendant hoped to accomplish.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the word \xe2\x80\x9cprocurement\xe2\x80\x9d implies purpose or motive is unpersuasive.  See Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9328.  Although a person may \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d a result purposefully, a person may also \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d a result by causing it, as the word \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d can, and at common law did, mean \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbring about,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffect,\xe2\x80\x9d all words that say nothing about motive or purpose.  2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); see also 2 C. Richardson, New Dictionary of the English Language 1514 (1839) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprocure\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o take care for; to take care or heed, \xe2\x80\xa6 that any thing be done; to urge or endeavor, to manage or contrive that it be done; to acquire; to obtain\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s similar argument about the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontrivance\xe2\x80\x9d fares no better.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6 (citing, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 J. Chitty, A Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 81 (1816) (hereinafter Chitty) (\xe2\x80\x9ckept away by the means and contrivance of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d)).  Even if a defendant had contrived, <em>i.e.</em>, devised or planned, to murder a victim, thereby keeping her away, it does not mean that he did so with the purpose of keeping her away in mind.<font b="1">  Regardless, the relevant phrase in <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case </em>is \xe2\x80\x9cby <em>means or </em>procurement of\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant. 6 How. St. Tr., at 771 (emphasis added).  And, as I have explained, an absence \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions may, or may not, refer to an absence that the defendant desired, as compared to an absence that the defendant caused.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole authority that expressly supports the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is an 1858 treatise stating that depositions were admissible if the witness \xe2\x80\x9chad been kept out of the way by the prisoner, or by some one on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, in order to prevent him from giving evidence against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  E. Powell, Practice of the Law of Evidence 166.  This treatise was written nearly 70 years after the founding; it does not explain the basis for this conclusion; and, above all, it concerns a <em>complete </em>exception to the <em>hearsay rule.  </em>Were there no such limitation, all a murder victim\xe2\x80\x99s hearsay statements, not simply the victim\xe2\x80\x99s testimonial statements,<em> </em>could be introduced into evidence.  Here we deal only with a constitutional bar to the admission of <em>testimonial</em> statements<em>.   </em>And an exception from the general constitutional bar does not automatically admit the evidence.  Rather, it leaves the State free to decide, via its own hearsay rules and hearsay exceptions, which such statements are sufficiently reliable to admit.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the absence of any evidence squarely requiring purpose rather than intent, what is the majority to say?  The majority first tries to draw support from the <em>absence </em>of any <em>murder </em>case in which the victim\xe2\x80\x99s Marian statement was read to the jury on the ground that the defendant had killed the victim.  See<em> ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310.  I know of no instance in which this Court has drawn a conclusion about the meaning of a common-law rule <em>solely </em>from the absence of cases showing the contrary\xe2\x80\x94at least not where there are other plausible explanations for that absence.  And there are such explanations here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most obvious reason why the majority cannot find an instance where a court applied the rule of forfeiture at a murder trial is that many (perhaps all) common-law courts thought the rule of forfeiture irrelevant in such cases.  In a murder case, the relevant witness, the murder victim, was dead; and historical legal authorities tell us that, when a witness was dead, the common law admitted a Marian statement.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Lord Morley\xe2\x80\x99s Case, supra</em>, at 770\xe2\x80\x9377 (Marian depositions \xe2\x80\x9cmight be read\xe2\x80\x9d if the witness was \xe2\x80\x9cdead or unable to travel\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>King</em> v. <em>Woodcock</em>, 1 Leach 500, 502, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353 (1789) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the deponent should die between the time of examination and the trial of the prisoner, [the Marian deposition] may be substituted in the room of that <em>viva voce</em> testimony which the deponent, if living, could alone have given, and is admitted of necessity as evidence of the fact\xe2\x80\x9d); J. Archbold, A Summary of the Law Relative to Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 85 (1822) (where a witness was \xe2\x80\x9cdead,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunable to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ckept away by the means or procurement of the prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d Marian depositions \xe2\x80\x9cmay be given in evidence against the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the Marian statements of a deceased witness were admissible simply by virtue of the witness\xe2\x80\x99 death, there would have been no need to argue for their admission pursuant to a forfeiture rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historical authorities also tell us that a Marian statement could not be admitted unless it was a <em>proper </em>Marian deposition, meaning that the statement was given in the presence of the defendant thereby providing an opportunity to cross-examine the witness.  And this was the case whether the witness\xe2\x80\x99 unavailability was due to death or the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans or procurement\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant.  See, <em>e.g., ibid.</em> (Where a witness was \xe2\x80\x9cdead,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunable to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ckept away by the means or procurement of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d depositions could be read but they <em>\xe2\x80\x9cmust have been taken in the presence of the prisoner, so that he might have had an opportunity of cross examining the witness\xe2\x80\x9d</em> (emphasis added)); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 605\xe2\x80\x93606 (6th ed. 1787) (hereinafter Hawkins); Chitty, 78\xe2\x80\x9380; 2 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71194\xe2\x80\x931195, pp. 1020\xe2\x80\x931022 (2d ed. 1913) (hereinafter Bishop); <em>Lord Fenwick\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 13 Haw., at 602.  Thus, in a murder trial, where the witness was dead, either the Marian statement was proper and it came into evidence <em>without</em> the forfeiture exception; or it was improper and the forfeiture exception <em>could not have helped it come in.</em>  Cf. <em>King</em> v. <em>Dingler</em>, 2 Leach 561, 563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 384 (1791) (a top barrister of the day argued successfully that \xe2\x80\x9cit is utterly impossible, unless the prisoner had been present [at the Marian deposition], that depositions thus taken can be read\xe2\x80\x9d).  No wonder then that the majority cannot find a murder case that refers directly to the forfeiture exception.  Common-law courts likely thought the forfeiture exception irrelevant in such a case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority highlights two common-law murder cases that demonstrate this point\xe2\x80\x94<em>King</em> v. <em>Woodcock</em> and <em>King</em> v. <em>Dingler</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  As the majority explains, in each of these two cases, the defendant stood accused of killing his wife.  In each case, the victim had given an account of the crime prior to her death.  And in each case, the court refused to admit the statements (statements that might have been admitted simply by virtue of the fact that the witness had died) on the ground that they were not properly taken Marian statements, <em>i.e.</em>, not made in the presence of the defendant.  Because admission pursuant to the forfeiture rule also would have required the statements to have been properly taken, there would have been no reason to argue for their admission on that basis.   Instead, in each case, the prosecution argued that the statement be admitted as a dying declaration.  In <em>Woodcock</em>, depending on the account, the court either instructed the jury to consider whether the statements were made \xe2\x80\x9cunder the apprehension of death,\xe2\x80\x9d or determined for itself that they were and admitted them into evidence.  1 Leach, at 504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 354; see 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown 356 (1803) (reprinted 2004).  In <em>Dingler</em>, because the Crown admitted that the statements were not made \xe2\x80\x9cunder apprehension of immediate death,\xe2\x80\x9d the statements were excluded.  2 Leach, at 563, 168 Eng. Rep., at 384.  The forfeiture rule thus had no place in <em>Woodcock</em> or <em>Dingler</em>, not because of the state of mind of the defendant when he committed his crime, but because the victim\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was not a properly taken Marian statement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The American murder cases to which the majority refers provide it no more support.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9 (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Woods</em>, 28 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 762, 763 (CC DC 1834); <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>State</em>, 17 Miss. 115, 120 (1847); <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>State</em>, 11 Ohio 424, 425\xe2\x80\x93426 (1842); <em>Nelson</em> v. <em>State</em>, 26 Tenn. 542, 543 (1847); <em>Smith</em> v. <em>State</em>, 28 Tenn. 9, 23 (1848)).  Like <em>Woodcock</em> and <em>Dingler</em>, these are dying declaration cases.  While it is true that none refers to the forfeiture exception, it is also true that none of these cases involved a previously given proper Marian deposition or its equivalent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are other explanations as well for the absence of authority to which the majority points.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind only arises as an issue in forfeiture cases where the witness has made prior statements against the defendant and where there is a possible motive for the killing other than to prevent the witness from testifying.  (Where that motive is certain, for example where the defendant knows the witness only because she has previously testified against him, the prior statements would be admitted under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s purpose rule and the question of intent would not come up.)  We can see from modern cases that this occurs almost exclusively in the domestic violence context, where a victim of the violence makes statements to the police and where it is not certain whether the defendant subsequently killed her to prevent her from testifying, to retaliate against her for making statements, or in the course of another abusive incident.  But 200 years ago, it might have been seen as futile for women to hale their abusers before a Marian magistrate where they would make such a statement.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State</em> v. <em>Rhodes</em>, 61 N.\xc2\xa0C. 453, 459 (1868) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not inflict upon society the greater evil of raising the curtain upon domestic privacy, to punish the lesser evil of trifling violence\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also recognize the possibility that there are too few old records available for us to draw firm conclusions.  Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing confusion about the very nature of the law of evidence at the end of the eighteenth century underscores how primitive and undertheorized the subject then was.\xe2\x80\x9d  See J. Langbein, The Origins of Adversary Criminal Trial 248 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, the first explanation\xe2\x80\x94that the forfeiture doctrine could not have helped admit an improperly taken Marian deposition\xe2\x80\x94provides a sufficient ground to conclude that the majority has found nothing in the common-law murder cases, domestic or foreign, that contradicts the traditional legal principles supporting application of the rule of forfeiture here.  See Williams, Criminal Law \xc2\xa718, at\xc2\xa039 (relying on sources at common law for the proposition that the accused \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily intends that which must be the consequence of the act\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa75.2(a), at 341 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe traditional view is that a person who acts . . . intends a result of his act . . . when he knows that that result is practically certain to follow from his conduct, whatever his desire may be as to that result\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority next points to a second line of common-law cases, cases in which a court admitted a murdered witness\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdying declaration.\xe2\x80\x9d  But those cases do not support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  A dying declaration can come into evidence when it is \xe2\x80\x9cmade in extremity\xe2\x80\x9d under a sense of impending death, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen every hope of this world is gone: when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Woodcock</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 502, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353; see <em>King</em> v. <em>Drummond</em>, 1 Leach 337, 338, 168 Eng. Rep. 271, 272 (1784) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mind, impressed with the awful idea of approaching dissolution, acts under a sanction equally powerful with that which it is presumed to feel by a solemn appeal to God upon an oath\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Hawkins 619, n.\xc2\xa010; <em>Mattox</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/156/237/index.html">156 U. S. 237</a>, 243\xe2\x80\x93244 (1895).  The majority notes that prosecutors did not attempt to obtain admission of dying declarations on forfeiture grounds before trying to meet these strict \xe2\x80\x9cdying declaratio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d requirements.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  This failure, it believes, supports its conclusion that admission pursuant to the forfeiture exception required a showing that the defendant killed the witness with the <em>purpose</em> of securing the absence of that witness at trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a simpler explanation, however, for the fact that parties did not argue forfeiture in \xe2\x80\x9cdying declaration\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  And it is the explanation I have already mentioned.   The forfeiture exception permitted admission only of a properly taken Marian deposition.  And where death was at issue, the forfeiture exception was irrelevant.  In other words, if the Marian deposition was proper, the rule of forfeiture was unnecessary; if the deposition was improper, the rule of forfeiture was powerless to help.  That is why we find lawyers in \xe2\x80\x9cdying  declaration\xe2\x80\x9d cases arguing that the dying declaration was either a proper Marian deposition (in which case it was admitted) or it was a \xe2\x80\x9cdying declaration\xe2\x80\x9d (in which case it was admitted), or both.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Dingler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562, 168 Eng. Rep., at 383\xe2\x80\x93384 (discussing the admission of statements either \xe2\x80\x9cas a deposition taken pursuant to the [Marian] statutes\xe2\x80\x9d or, in the alternative, \xe2\x80\x9cas the dying declaration of a party conscious of approaching dissolution\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>King </em>v. <em>Radbourne</em>, 1 Leach 457, 46\xe2\x80\x93461, 168 Eng. Rep. 330, 332 (1787) (same); <em>People</em> v. <em>Restell</em>, 3 Hill 289 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. 1842) (same); see also Chitty 79\xe2\x80\x9381.  Under these circumstances, there would have been little reason to add the word \xe2\x80\x9cforfeiture.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reason, we can find \xe2\x80\x9cdying declarations\xe2\x80\x9d admitted in murder cases where no proper Marian deposition existed, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>King</em> v. <em>Woodcock</em>, 1 Leach 500, 168 Eng. Rep. 352; 1 East, Pleas of the Crown, at 356, or in cases involving, say, wills or paternity disputes, where Marian statements were not at all at issue, see 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa71431, p. 277, n.\xe2\x80\x822 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974) (citing such cases from the 18th and 19th centuries).  Cf. Langbein, <em>supra</em>, at 245\xe2\x80\x93246, nn. 291, 292 (at common law, there existed both oath-based and cross-examination-based rationales for the hearsay rule, with the latter only becoming dominant around the turn of the 19th century (citing Gallanis, The Rise of Modern Evidence Law, 84 Iowa L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 499, 516\xe2\x80\x93550 (1999))). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that the majority fails to achieve its basic objective.  It cannot show that the common law insisted upon a showing that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose or motive in killing a victim was to prevent the victim from testifying.  At the least its authority is consistent with my own view, that the prosecution in such a case need show no more than intent (based on knowledge) to do so.  And the most the majority might show is that the common law was not clear on the point.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority makes three arguments in response.  First, it says that I am wrong about unconfronted statements at common law.  According to the majority, when courts found wrongful procurement, they admitted a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statements without regard to whether they were confronted.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9319.  That being so, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument goes, one must wonder why no one argued for admissibility under the forfeiture rule in, say, <em>Woodcock</em> or<em> Dingler.</em>  See <em>ante,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x9311.<em> </em>The reason, the majority concludes, is that the forfeiture rule would not have helped secure admission of the (unconfronted) prior statements in those cases, because the forfeiture rule applied only where the defendant <em>purposely </em>got rid of the witness.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7<em>.</em>  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s house of cards has no foundation; it is built on what is at most common-law silence on the subject.  The cases it cites tell us next to nothing about admission of unconfronted statements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fenwick\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, see <em>ante, </em>at 16 n.\xc2\xa03, for example, was a parliamentary attainder proceeding; Parliament voted to admit unconfronted statements but it is not clear what arguments for admission Parliament relied upon.  See generally 13 How. St. Tr. 537.  Hence it is not clear that Parliament admitted <em>unconfronted</em> statements pursuant to a forfeiture theory.  In fact, the forfeiture rule in a felony case was described in <em>Fenwick\xe2\x80\x99s Case </em>as applying where the witness \xe2\x80\x9chath given information against [the defendant] to a proper magistrate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 594 (remarks of Lovel), <em>i.e.</em>, a magistrate who normally would have had the defendant before him as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, see <em>ante,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, did admit an unconfronted statement, but it was a statement made before a <em>coroner.</em>  See 12 How. St. Tr., at 852.  Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s statements seem to have had special status that may sometimes have permitted the admission of prior unconfronted testimonial statements despite lack of cross-examination.  But, if so, that special status failed to survive the Atlantic voyage.  See <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U. S., at 47, n.\xc2\xa02 (early American authorities \xe2\x80\x9cflatly rejected any special status for coroner statements\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The American case upon which the majority primarily relies, <em>Rex</em> v. <em>Barber</em>, 1 Root 76 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1775), see <em>ante</em>, at 16, consists of three sentences that refer to \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne White, who had testified before the justice and before the grand-jury against Barber.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Root, at 76.  White was \xe2\x80\x9csent away\xe2\x80\x9d at Barber\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinstigation\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9ccourt admitted witnesses to relate what White had before testified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  I cannot tell from the case whether White\xe2\x80\x99s statement was made before a grand jury or was taken before a justice where cross-examination would have been possible.  At least some commentators seem to think the latter.  See W. Best, The Principles of the Law of Evidence 467, 473, n. (<em>e</em>) (American ed. 1883) (listing <em>Barber</em> as a case \xe2\x80\x9cof preliminary investigation before a magistrate\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9cevidence ha[d] been admitted, there having been a right of cross-examination\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 Bishop, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71194\xe2\x80\x931197, at 1020\xe2\x80\x931024 (explaining that where a witness had been \xe2\x80\x9ckept out of the way\xe2\x80\x9d by the defendant, his prior testimony is admissible \xe2\x80\x9cif the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness against him, not otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d and giving as a \xe2\x80\x9c[f]amiliar illustration\xe2\x80\x9d of this principle cases before a committing magistrate including <em>Barber</em>); J. Stephen, A Digest of the Law of Evidence 161, American Note, General (1902) (citing <em>Barber</em> for the proposition that evidence at a preliminary hearing was admissible \xe2\x80\x9cif the party against whom it is offered was present).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s final authority, <em>Williams</em> v. <em>State</em>, 19 Ga. 403 (1856), see <em>ante</em>, at 17, involved the admission of an \xe2\x80\x9cexamination\xe2\x80\x9d taken by \xe2\x80\x9cthe committing magistrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such examinations were ordinarily given in the presence of the defendant.  See R. Greene &amp; J. Lumpkin, Georgia Justice 99 (1835) (describing procedures relevant to a magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s examination of a witness in Georgia); see also M. M\xe2\x80\x99Kinney, The American Magistrate and Civil Officer 235 (1850) (testimony of the accuser and his witnesses taken by a magistrate \xe2\x80\x9cmust be done in the presence of the party accused, in order that he may have the advantage of cross-examining the witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, every Supreme Court case to apply the forfeiture rule has done so in the context of previously confronted testimony.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Reynolds</em>, 98 U. S., at 158 (admitting previously confronted statements pursuant to a forfeiture rule); <em>Diaz</em>, 223 U. S., at 449 (same); <em>Mattox</em>, 156 U. S., at 240 (same); <em>Motes</em>, 178 U. S., at 470\xe2\x80\x93471 (same). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, modern courts have changed the ancient common-law forfeiture rule\xe2\x80\x94in my view, for the better.  They now admit unconfronted prior testimonial statements pursuant to such a rule.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Carlson</em>, 547 F.\xc2\xa02d 1346, 1357\xe2\x80\x931360 (CA8 1976) (the earliest case to do so); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mastrangelo</em>, 693 F.\xc2\xa02d 269 (CA2 1982); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rouco</em>, 765 F.\xc2\xa02d 983 (CA11 1985); see also <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 834.  But, as the dates of these cases indicate, the admission of unconfronted statements under a forfeiture exception is a fairly recent evidentiary development.  The majority evidently finds this elephant of a change acceptable\xe2\x80\x94as do I.  Without it, there would be no meaningful modern-day forfeiture exception.  Why then does the majority strain so hard at what, comparatively speaking, is a gnat (and a nonexistent gnat at that)?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I have tried to show the weakness of the foundation upon which the majority erects its claim that the common law applied the forfeiture rule only where it was a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>purpose </em>or <em>motive </em>(not his <em>intent </em>based on knowledge)<em> </em>to keep the witness away.  The majority says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe most natural reading of the language used at common law\xe2\x80\x9d supports its view.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  As I have shown, that is not so.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  The majority next points to \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of common-law cases <em>admitting</em> prior statements on a forfeiture theory\xe2\x80\x9d where the defendant prevented, but did not <em>purposely </em>prevent, the witness from testifying.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  As I have pointed out, this absence proves nothing because (1) the relevant circumstances (there has been a prior testimonial statement, the witness is now unavailable due to defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions, and the defendant knows that the witness will not testify but that is not his purpose) are likely to arise almost exclusively when the defendant murders the witness, and (2) a forfeiture theory was ordinarily redundant or useless in such cases.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  The majority, describing its next argument as \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d points to \xe2\x80\x9cinnumerable cases\xe2\x80\x9d where courts did not admit \xe2\x80\x9cunconfronted inculpatory testimony by murder victims\xe2\x80\x9d against a defendant. <em> Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  The majority is referring to those dying declaration cases in which unconfronted statements were not admitted because the witness was not sufficiently aware of his impending death when he made them.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9.  But as I have explained, the forfeiture rule would have been unhelpful under these circumstances.  See <em>supra</em>, at 18.  Finally, the majority points to a \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent history\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States where questions about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind did not begin to arise until the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  I have explained why that history does not support its view.  See <em>supra</em>, at 22.  Having only begun to swallow the elephant in the late 1970\xe2\x80\x99s and early 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, it makes sense that courts would not have previously considered the gnat.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I have set forth what I believe is the better reading of the common-law cases, I recognize that different modern judges might read that handful of cases differently.  All the more reason then <em>not </em>to reach firm conclusions about the precise metes and bounds of a contemporary forfeiture exception by trying to guess the state of mind of 18th century lawyers when they decided <em>not </em>to make a particular argument, <em>i.e.</em>, forfeiture, in a reported case.  That is why, in Part II, <em>supra,</em> I have set forth other, more conclusive reasons in support of the way I would read the exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the majority objects to that aspect of the forfeiture rule that requires a judge to make a preliminary assessment of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s wrongful act in order to determine whether the relevant statements should be admitted.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23.  But <em>any</em> forfeiture rule requires a judge to determine as a preliminary matter that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own wrongdoing caused the witness to be absent.  Regardless, preliminary judicial determinations are not, as the majority puts it \xe2\x80\x9cakin . . . to \xe2\x80\x98dispensing with jury trial.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 11.  (quoting <em>Crawford,</em> 541 U. S., at 62).  We have previously said that courts may make preliminary findings of this kind.  For example, where a defendant is charged with conspiracy, the judge is permitted to make an initial finding that the conspiracy existed so as to determine whether a statement can be admitted under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.  See <em>Bourjaily</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/171/index.html">483 U. S. 171</a>, 175\xe2\x80\x93176 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe inquiry made by a court concerned with these matters is not whether the proponent of the evidence wins or loses his case on the merits, but whether the evidentiary Rules have been satisfied\xe2\x80\x9d).  And even the plurality is forced to admit that it is \xe2\x80\x9csometimes\xe2\x80\x9d necessary for \xe2\x80\x9cjudge . . . to inquire into guilt of the charged offense in order to make a preliminary evidentiary ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the plurality seems to believe that an ordinary intent requirement, rather than a purpose or motive requirement, would let in too much out-of-court testimonial evidence.  See <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  Ordinarily a murderer would know that his victim would not be able to testify at a murder trial.  Hence all of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s prior testimonial statements would come in at trial for use against a defendant.  To insist upon a showing of purpose rather than plain (knowledge-based) intent would limit the amount of unconfronted evidence that the jury might hear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument fails to account for the fact that overcoming a constitutional objection does not guarantee admissibility of the testimonial evidence at issue.  The States will still control admissibility through hearsay rules and exceptions.  And why not?  What important constitutional interest is served, say, where a prior testimonial statement of a victim of abuse is at issue, by a constitutional rule that lets that evidence in if the defendant killed a victim <em>purposely </em>to stop her from testifying, but keeps it out if the defendant killed her <em>knowing </em>she could no longer testify while acting out of anger or revenge?</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the majority appears to recognize the problem with its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, for it ends its opinion by creating a kind of presumption that will transform <em>purpose </em>into <em>knowledge-based intent</em>\xe2\x80\x94at least where domestic violence is at issue; and that is the area where the problem is most likely to arise.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter, concurring in part, says:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[The requisite] element of intention would normally be satisfied by the intent inferred on the part of the domestic abuser in the classic abusive relationship, which is meant to isolate the victim from outside help, including the aid of law enforcement and the judicial process.  If the evidence for admissibility shows a continuing relationship of this sort, it would make no sense to suggest that the oppressing defendant miraculously abandoned the dynamics of abuse the instant before he killed his victim, say in a fit of anger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 3.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis seems to say that a showing of domestic abuse is sufficient to call into play the protection of the forfeiture rule in a trial for murder of the domestic abuse victim.  Doing so when, in fact, the abuser may have had other matters in mind apart from preventing the witness from testifying, is in effect not to insist upon a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consequently, I agree with this formulation, though I would apply a simple intent requirement across the board. </p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule of forfeiture is implicated primarily where domestic abuse is at issue.  In such a case, a murder victim may have previously given a testimonial statement, say, to the police, about an abuser\xe2\x80\x99s attacks; and introduction of that statement may be at issue in a later trial for the abuser\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent murder of the victim.  This is not an uncommon occurrence.  Each year, domestic violence results in more than 1,500 deaths and more than 2 million injuries; it accounts for a substantial portion of all homicides; it typically involves a history of repeated violence; and it is difficult to prove in court because the victim is generally reluctant or unable to testify.  See Bureau of Justice Statistics, Homicide trends in the U. S., http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/tables/relationshiptab.htm (as visited June 23, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); Dept. of  Health  and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Costs of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in the United States 19 (2003); N. Websdale, Understanding Domestic Homicide 207 (1999); Lininger, Prosecuting Batterers after <em>Crawford</em>, 91 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 747, 751, 768\xe2\x80\x93769 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, threats, further violence, and ultimately murder, can stop victims from testifying.  See <em>id.,</em> at 769 (citing finding that batterers threaten retaliatory violence in as many as half of all cases, and 30 percent of batterers assault their victims again during the prosecution).  A <em>constitutional</em> evidentiary requirement that insists upon a showing of purpose (rather than simply intent or probabilistic knowledge) may permit the domestic partner who made the threats, caused the violence, or even murdered the victim to avoid conviction for earlier crimes by taking advantage of later ones.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Davis, </em>we recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d cases are \xe2\x80\x9cnotoriously susceptible to intimidation or coercion of the victim to ensure that she does not testify at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U. S., at 832\xe2\x80\x93833.  We noted the concern that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen this occurs, the Confrontation Clause gives the criminal a windfall.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 833.  And we replied to that concern by stating that \xe2\x80\x9cone who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  To the extent that it insists upon an additional showing of purpose, the Court breaks the promise implicit in those words and, in doing so, grants the defendant not fair treatment, but a windfall. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can find no history, no underlying purpose, no administrative consideration, and no constitutional principle that requires this result.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Insofar as Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s rule in effect presumes \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d based on no more than evidence of a history of domestic violence, I agree with it.  In all other respects, however, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
