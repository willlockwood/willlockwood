Ward, the Register of the Western Land District of Florida, and to Richard K. Call, receiver of public moneys in said district, commanding them to permit the persons praying for the mandamus to enter and purchase certain sections of land described in the writ under the provisions of the Act of Congress of 22 April, 1826, which gave rights of preemption in the purchase of land to certain settlers in the States of Alabama and Mississippi and the Territory of Florida.  From the superior court the case was removed by a writ of error to the Court of Appeals for the Territory of Florida, and on 21 January, 1831, the order of the superior court was affirmed by the court of appeals.  From this judgment the United States appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p>The Court ordered the appeal to be dismissed, the proceeding by mandamus being at common law, and therefore the cases should have been brought up by writs of error.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
