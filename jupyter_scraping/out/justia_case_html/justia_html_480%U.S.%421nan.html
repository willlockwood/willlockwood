Section 243(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253(h), requires the Attorney General to withhold deportation of an alien who demonstrates that his "life or freedom would be threatened" on account of one of the listed factors if he is deported.  In <em>INS v. Stevic,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html">467 U. S. 407</a></span> (1984), we held that, to qualify for this entitlement to withholding of deportation, an alien must demonstrate that "it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution" in the country to which he would be returned.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#429">467 U. S. 429</a></span>-430.  The Refugee Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 102, also established a second type of broader relief.  Section 208(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1158(a), authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country "because of persecution or a well founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."  \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42), 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p>In <em>Stevic,</em> we rejected an alien\'s contention that the \xc2\xa7 208(a) "well founded fear" standard governs applications for withholding of deportation under \xc2\xa7 243(h). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Similarly, today we reject the Government\'s contention that the \xc2\xa7 243(h) standard, which requires an alien to show that he is more likely than not to be subject to persecution, governs applications for asylum under \xc2\xa7 208(a).  Congress used different, broader language to define the term "refugee" as used in \xc2\xa7 208(a) than it used to describe the class of aliens who have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 480 U. S. 424</a></p><p> a right to withholding of deportation under \xc2\xa7 243(h).  The Act\'s establishment of a broad class of refugees who are eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum, and a narrower class of aliens who are given a statutory right not to be deported to the country where they are in danger, mirrors the provisions of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which provided the motivation for the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980.  In addition, the legislative history of the 1980 Act makes it perfectly clear that Congress did not intend the class of aliens who qualify as refugees to be coextensive with the class who qualify for \xc2\xa7 243(h) relief.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent is a 38-year-old Nicaraguan citizen who entered the United States in 1979 as a visitor.  After she remained in the United States longer than permitted, and failed to take advantage of the Immigration and Naturalization Service\'s (INS) offer of voluntary departure, the INS commenced deportation proceedings against her.  Respondent conceded that she was in the country illegally, but requested withholding of deportation pursuant to \xc2\xa7 243(h) and asylum as a refugee pursuant to \xc2\xa7 208(a).</p>\n<p>To support her request under \xc2\xa7 243(h), respondent attempted to show that, if she were returned to Nicaragua, her "life or freedom would be threatened" on account of her political views; to support her request under \xc2\xa7 208(a), she attempted to show that she had a "well founded fear of persecution" upon her return.  The evidence supporting both claims related primarily to the activities of respondent\'s brother, who had been tortured and imprisoned because of his political activities in Nicaragua.  Both respondent and her brother testified that they believed the Sandinistas knew that the two of them had fled Nicaragua together, and that, even though she had not been active politically herself, she would be interrogated about her brother\'s whereabouts and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 480 U. S. 425</a></p><p> activities.  Respondent also testified that, because of her brother\'s status, her own political opposition to the Sandinistas would be brought to that government\'s attention.  Based on these facts, respondent claimed that she would be tortured if forced to return.</p>\n<p>The Immigration Judge applied the same standard in evaluating respondent\'s claim for withholding of deportation under \xc2\xa7 243(h) as he did in evaluating her application for asylum under \xc2\xa7 208(a).  He found that she had not established "a clear probability of persecution," and therefore was not entitled to either form of relief.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a.  On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) agreed that respondent had</p>\n<p>"failed to establish that she would suffer persecution within the meaning of section 208(a) or 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 21a.</p>\n<p>In the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, respondent did not challenge the BIA\'s decision that she was not entitled to withholding of deportation under \xc2\xa7 243(h), but argued that she was eligible for consideration for asylum under \xc2\xa7 208(a), and contended that the Immigration Judge and BIA erred in applying the "more likely than not" standard of proof from \xc2\xa7 243(h) to her \xc2\xa7 208(a) asylum claim.  Instead, she asserted, they should have applied the "well founded fear" standard, which she considered to be more generous.  The court agreed.  Relying on both the text and the structure of the Act, the court held that the "well founded fear" standard which governs asylum proceedings is different, and in fact more generous, than the "clear probability" standard which governs withholding of deportation proceedings.  767 F.2d 1448, 1452-1453 (1985).  Agreeing with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the court interpreted the standard to require asylum applicants to present "<em>specific facts\' through objective evidence to prove either past persecution or `good reason\' to fear future persecution."  <em>Id.</em> at 1453 (citing <em>Carvajal-Munoz v. INS,</em> 743 F.2d 562, 574 (CA7 1984)). </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 480 U.

We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict on this important question. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  475 U.S. 1009 (1986). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 480 U. S. 427</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Refugee Act of 1980 established a new statutory procedure for granting asylum to refugees. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The 1980 Act added a new \xc2\xa7 208(a) to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, reading as follows:</p>\n<p>"The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien\'s status, to apply for asylum, and the alien may be granted asylum in the discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title."</p>\n<p>94 Stat. 105, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1158(a).</p>\n<p>Under this section, eligibility for asylum depends entirely on the Attorney General\'s determination that an alien is a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 480 U. S. 428</a></p><p> "refugee" as that term is defined in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42), which was also added to the Act in 1980.  That section provides:</p>\n<p>"The term  \'refugee\' means (A) any person who is outside any country of such person\'s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. . . ."</p>\n<p>94 Stat. 102, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101(a)(42).  Thus, the "persecution or well founded fear of persecution" standard governs the Attorney General\'s determination whether an alien is eligible for asylum. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to establishing a statutory asylum process, the 1980 Act amended the withholding of deportation provision, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 480 U. S. 429</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 243(h).  <em>See Stevic,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#421">467 U. S. 421</a></span>, n. 15.  Prior to 1968, the Attorney General had discretion whether to grant withholding of deportation to aliens under \xc2\xa7 243(h).  In 1968, however, the United States agreed to comply with the substantive provisions of Articles 2 through 34 of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  <em>See</em> 19 U.S.T. 6223, 6259-6276, T.I.A.S. No. 6577 (1968); <em>see generally Stevic, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#416">467 U. S. 416</a></span>-417.  Article 33.1 of the Convention, 189 U.N.T.S. 150, 176 (1954), <em>reprinted in</em> 19 U.S.T. 6259, 6276, which is the counterpart of \xc2\xa7 243(h) of our statute, imposed a mandatory duty on contracting States not to return an alien to a country where his "life or freedom would be threatened" on account of one of the enumerated reasons. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#441">480 U. S. 441</a></span>.  Thus, although \xc2\xa7 243(h) itself did not constrain the Attorney General\'s discretion after 1968, presumably he honored the dictates of the United Nations Convention. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In any event, the 1980 Act removed the Attorney General\'s discretion in \xc2\xa7 243(h) proceedings. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 480 U. S. 430</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Stevic,</em> we considered it significant that, in enacting the 1980 Act, Congress did not amend the standard of eligibility for relief under \xc2\xa7 243(h).  While the terms "refugee" and hence "well founded fear" were made an integral part of the \xc2\xa7 208(a) procedure, they continued to play no part in \xc2\xa7 243(h).  Thus we held that the prior consistent construction of \xc2\xa7 243(h) that required an applicant for withholding of deportation to demonstrate a "clear probability of persecution" upon deportation remained in force.  Of course, this reasoning, based in large part on the plain language of \xc2\xa7 243(h), is of no avail here, since \xc2\xa7 208(a) expressly provides that the "well founded fear" standard governs eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p>The Government argues, however, that even though the "well founded fear" standard is applicable, there is no difference between it and the "would be threatened" test of \xc2\xa7 243(h).  It asks us to hold that the only way an applicant can demonstrate a "well founded fear of persecution" is to prove a "clear probability of persecution."  The statutory language does not lend itself to this reading.</p>\n<p>To begin with, the language Congress used to describe the two standards conveys very different meanings.  The "would be threatened" language of \xc2\xa7 243(h) has no subjective component, but instead requires the alien to establish by objective evidence that it is more likely than not that he or she will be subject to persecution upon deportation. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  See <em>Stevic, supra.</em>  In contrast, the reference to "fear" in the \xc2\xa7 208(a) standard obviously makes the eligibility determination turn to some extent on the subjective mental state of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 480 U. S. 431</a></p><p> alien. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>"The linguistic difference between the words \'well founded fear\' and \'clear probability\' may be as striking as that between a subjective and an objective frame of reference. . .  We simply cannot conclude that the standards are identical."</p>\n<p><em>Guevara-Flores v. INS,</em> 786 F.2d 1242, 1250 (CA5 1986), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 86-388; <em>see also Carcamo-Flores v. INS,</em> 805 F.2d 60, 64 (CA2 1986); 767 F.2d at 1452 (case below).</p>\n<p>That the fear must be "well founded" does not alter the obvious focus on the individual\'s subjective beliefs, nor does it transform the standard into a "more likely than not" one.  One can certainly have a well founded fear of an event happening when there is less than a 50% chance of the occurrence taking place.  As one leading authority has pointed out:</p>\n<p>"Let us . . . presume that it is known that, in the applicant\'s country of origin, every tenth adult male person is either put to death or sent to some remote labor camp. . . .  In such a case, it would be only too apparent that anyone who has managed to escape from the country in question will have \'well founded fear of being persecuted\' upon his eventual return."</p>\n<p>1 A.

Wong Kim Bo,</em> 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)).  The contrast between the language used in the two standards, and the fact that Congress used a new standard to define the term "refugee," certainly indicate that Congress intended the two standards to differ.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The message conveyed by the plain language of the Act is confirmed by an examination of its history. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Three aspects of that history are particularly compelling:  The pre-1980 experience under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), the only prior statute dealing with asylum; the abundant evidence of an intent to conform the definition of "refugee" and our asylum law to the United Nations Protocol to which the United States has been bound </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 480 U. S. 433</a></p><p> since 1968, and the fact that Congress declined to enact the Senate version of the bill that would have made a refugee ineligible for asylum unless "his deportation or return would be prohibited by \xc2\xa7 243(h)."</p>\n<p><em>The Practice Under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7).</em></p>\n<p>The statutory definition of the term "refugee" contained in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42) applies to two asylum provisions within the Immigration and Nationality Act. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Section 207, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1157, governs the admission of refugees who seek admission from foreign countries.  Section 208, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1158, sets out the process by which refugees currently in the United States may be granted asylum.  Prior to the 1980 amendments, there was no statutory basis for granting asylum to aliens who applied from within the United States. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Asylum for aliens applying for admission from foreign countries had, however, been the subject of a previous statutory provision, and Congress\' intent with respect to the changes that it sought to create in that statute are instructive in discerning the meaning of the term "well founded fear."</p>\n<p>Section \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) of the pre-1980 statute authorized the Attorney General to permit "conditional entry" to a certain number of refugees fleeing from Communist-dominated areas or the Middle East "because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion."  79 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 480 U. S. 434</a></p><p> Stat. 913, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1153(a)(7) (1976 ed.).  The standard that was applied to aliens seeking admission pursuant to \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) was unquestionably more lenient than the "clear probability" standard applied in \xc2\xa7 243(h) proceedings.  <em>In Matter of Tan,</em> 12 I. &amp; N.Dec. 564, 569-570 (1967), for example, the BIA "found no support" for the argument that</p>\n<p>"an alien deportee is required to do no more than meet the standards applied under section 203(a)(7) of the Act when seeking relief under section 243(h)."</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <em>Matter of Adamska,</em> 12 I. &amp; N.Dec. 201, 202 (1967), the Board held that an alien\'s inability to satisfy \xc2\xa7 243(h) was not determinative of her eligibility under the "substantially broader" standards of \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7).  One of the differences the Board highlighted between the statutes was that \xc2\xa7 243(h) requires a showing that the applicant "would be" subject to persecution, while \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) only required a showing that the applicant was unwilling to return "because of <em>persecution or fear of persecution.</em>"  12 I. &amp; N., at 202 (emphasis in original).  In sum, it was repeatedly recognized that the standards were significantly different. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>At first glance, one might conclude that this wide practice under the old \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), which spoke of "fear of persecution," is not probative of the meaning of the term "well founded fear of persecution" which Congress adopted in 1980.  Analysis of the legislative history, however, demonstrates that Congress added the "well founded" language only because that was the language incorporated by the United Nations Protocol to which Congress sought to conform.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#436">480 U. S. 436</a></span>-437.  Congress was told that the extant asylum procedure </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 480 U. S. 435</a></p><p> for refugees outside of the United States was acceptable under the Protocol, except for the fact that it made various unacceptable geographic and political distinctions. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The legislative history indicates that Congress in no way wished to modify the standard that had been used under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7). [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 480 U. S. 436</a></p><p> Adoption of the INS\'s argument that the term "well founded fear" requires a showing of clear probability of persecution would clearly do violence to Congress\' intent that the standard for admission under \xc2\xa7 207 be no different than the one previously applied under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p><em>The United Nations Protocol.</em></p>\n<p>If one thing is clear from the legislative history of the new definition of "refugee," and indeed the entire 1980 Act, it is that one of Congress\' primary purposes was to bring United States refugee law into conformance with the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 19 U.S.T. 6223, T.I.A.S. No. 6577, to which the United States </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 480 U. S. 437</a></p><p> acceded in 1968. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Indeed, the definition of "refugee" that Congress adopted, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#428">480 U. S. 428</a></span>, is virtually identical to the one prescribed by Article 1(2) of the Convention which defines a "refugee" as an individual who,</p>\n<p>"owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it."</p>\n<p><em>Compare</em> 19 U.S.T. 6225 <em>with</em> 19 U.S.T. 6261.  Not only did Congress adopt the Protocol\'s standard in the statute, but there were also many statements indicating Congress\' intent that the new statutory definition of "refugee" be interpreted in conformance with the Protocol\'s definition.  The Conference Committee Report, for example, stated that the definition was accepted</p>\n<p>"with the understanding that it is based directly upon the language of the Protocol, and it is intended that the provision be construed consistent with the Protocol."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 96-590, p. 20 (1980); <em>see also</em> H.R.Rep. at 9.  It is thus appropriate to consider what the phrase "well founded fear" means with relation to the Protocol.</p>\n<p>The origin of the Protocol\'s definition of "refugee" is found in the 1946 Constitution of the International Refugee Organization (IRO).  <em>See</em> 62 Stat. 3037.  The IRO defined a "refugee" as a person who had a "valid objection" to returning to his country of nationality, and specified that "fear, based on reasonable grounds of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or political opinions . . . " constituted a valid objection.  <em>See</em> IRO Constitution, Annex 1, Pt. 1, \xc2\xa7 C1(a)(i).  The term was then incorporated in the United Nations Convention </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 480 U. S. 438</a></p><p> Relating to the Status of Refugees, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] 189 U.N.T.S. 150 (July 28, 1951).  The Committee that drafted the provision explained that</p>\n<p>"[t]he expression \'well founded fear of being the victim of persecution . . . \' means that a person has either been actually a victim of persecution or can show good reason why he fears persecution."</p>\n<p>U.N.Rep. at 39.  The 1967 Protocol incorporated the "well founded fear" test without modification.  The standard, as it has been consistently understood by those who drafted it as well as those drafting the documents that adopted it, certainly does not require an alien to show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted in order to be classified as a "refugee." [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>In interpreting the Protocol\'s definition of "refugee," we are further guided by the analysis set forth in the Office of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 480 U. S. 439</a></p><p> United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (Geneva, 1979). [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The Handbook explains that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n general, the applicant\'s fear should be considered well founded if he can establish, to a reasonable degree, that his continued stay in his country of origin has become intolerable to him for the reasons stated in the definition, or would for the same reasons be intolerable if he returned there."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at Ch. IIB(2)(a) \xc2\xa7 42; <em>see also id.</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 37-41.</p>\n<p>The High Commissioner\'s analysis of the United Nations\' standard is consistent with our own examination of the origins of the Protocol\'s definition, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] as well as the conclusions of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 480 U. S. 440</a></p><p> many scholars who have studied the matter. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  There is simply no room in the United Nations\' definition for concluding that, because an applicant only has a 10% chance of being shot, tortured, or otherwise persecuted, he or she has no "well founded fear" of the event\'s happening.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#431">480 U. S. 431</a></span>.  As we pointed out in <em>Stevic,</em> a moderate interpretation of the "well founded fear" standard would indicate</p>\n<p>"that, so long as an objective situation is established by the evidence, it need not be shown that the situation will probably result in persecution, but it is enough that persecution is a reasonable possibility."</p>\n<p>467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#424">467 U. S. 424</a></span>-425.</p>\n<p>In <em>Stevic,</em> we dealt with the issue of withholding of deportation, or <em>nonrefoulement,</em> under \xc2\xa7 243(h).  This provision corresponds to Article 33.1 of the Convention. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Significantly, though, Article 33.1 does not extend this right to everyone who meets the definition of "refugee."  Rather, it provides that</p>\n<p>"[n]o Contracting State shall expel or return (\'refouler\') a <em>refugee</em> in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers or territories <em>where his life or freedom would be threatened</em> on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership or a particular social group or political opinion."</p>\n<p>19 U.S.T. at 6276, 189 U.N.T.S. at 176 (emphasis added).  Thus, Article 33.1 requires that an applicant satisfy two burdens:  first, that he or she be a "refugee," <em>i.e.,</em> prove at least a "well-founded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 480 U. S. 441</a></p><p> fear of persecution;" second, that the "refugee" show that his or her life or freedom "would be threatened" if deported.  Section 243(h)\'s imposition of a "would be threatened" requirement is entirely consistent with the United States\' obligations under the Protocol.</p>\n<p>Section 208(a), by contrast, is a discretionary mechanism which gives the Attorney General the <em>authority</em> to grant the broader relief of asylum to refugees.  As such, it does not correspond to Article 33 of the Convention, but instead corresponds to Article 34.  <em>See Carvajal-Munoz,</em> 743 F.2d at 574, n. 15.  That Article provides that the contracting States "shall as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees. . . ."  Like \xc2\xa7 208(a), the provision is precatory; it does not require the implementing authority actually to grant asylum to all those who are eligible.  Also like \xc2\xa7 208(a), an alien must only show that he or she is a "refugee" to establish eligibility for relief.  No further showing that he or she "would be" persecuted is required.</p>\n<p>Thus, as made binding on the United States through the Protocol, Article 34 provides for a precatory, or discretionary, benefit for the entire class of persons who qualify as "refugees," whereas Article 33.1 provides an entitlement for the subcategory that "would be threatened" with persecution upon their return.  This precise distinction between the broad class of refugees and the subcategory entitled to \xc2\xa7 243(h) relief is plainly revealed in the 1980 Act.  <em>See Stevic,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#428">467 U. S. 428</a></span>, n. 22.</p>\n<p><em>Congress\' Rejection of S. 643.</em></p>\n<p>Both the House bill, H.R. 2816, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1979), and the Senate bill, S. 643, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1979), provided that an alien must be a a "refugee" within the meaning of the Act in order to be eligible for asylum.  The two bills differed, however, in that the House bill authorized the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to any refugee, whereas the Senate bill imposed the additional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 480 U. S. 442</a></p><p> requirement that a refugee could not obtain asylum unless "his deportation or return would be prohibited under section 243(h)." [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  S.Rep. at 26.  Although this restriction, if adopted, would have curtailed the Attorney General\'s discretion to grant asylum to refugees pursuant to \xc2\xa7 208(a), it would not have affected the standard used to determine whether an alien is a "refugee."  Thus, the inclusion of this prohibition in the Senate bill indicates that the Senate recognized that there is a difference between the "well founded fear" standard and the clear probability standard. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  The enactment of the House bill, rather than the Senate bill, in turn demonstrates that Congress eventually refused to restrict eligibility for asylum only to aliens meeting the stricter standard.</p>\n<p>"Few principles of statutory construction are more compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend <em>sub</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 480 U.

We reject both of these arguments:  the first ignores the structure of the Act; the second misconstrues the federal courts\' role in reviewing an agency\'s statutory construction.</p>\n<p>First, the INS repeatedly argues that the structure of the Act dictates a decision in its favor, since it is anomalous for \xc2\xa7 208(a), which affords greater benefits than \xc2\xa7 243(h), <em>see</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra,</em> to have a less stringent standard of eligibility.  This argument sorely fails, because it does not take into account the fact that an alien who satisfies the applicable standard under \xc2\xa7 208(a) does not have a <em>right</em> to remain in the United States; he or she is simply <em>eligible</em> for asylum, if the Attorney General, in his discretion, chooses to grant it.  An alien satisfying \xc2\xa7 243(h)\'s stricter standard, in contrast, is automatically entitled to withholding of deportation. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  <em>In Matter of Salim,</em> 18 I. &amp; N.Dec. 311 (1982), for example, the Board held that the alien was eligible for both asylum and withholding of deportation, but granted him the more limited remedy only, exercising its discretion to deny him asylum.  <em>See also Walai v. INS,</em> 552 F.Supp. 998 (SDNY 1982); <em>Matter</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 480 U. S. 444</a></p><p> <em>of Shirdel,</em> Interim Decision No. 2958 (BIA Feb. 21, 1984).  We do not consider it at all anomalous that, out of the entire class of "refugees," those who can show a clear probability of persecution are <em>entitled</em> to mandatory suspension of deportation and <em>eligible</em> for discretionary asylum, while those who can only show a well founded fear of persecution are not <em>entitled</em> to anything, but are <em>eligible</em> for the discretionary relief of asylum.</p>\n<p>There is no basis for the INS\'s assertion that the discretionary/mandatory distinction has no practical significance.  Decisions such as <em>Matter of Salim, supra,</em> and <em>Matter of Shirdel, supra,</em> clearly demonstrate the practical import of the distinction.  Moreover, the 1980 Act amended \xc2\xa7 243(h) for the very purpose of changing it from a discretionary to a mandatory provision.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#428">480 U. S. 428</a></span>-429.  Congress surely considered the discretionary/mandatory distinction important then, as it did with respect to the very definition of "refugee" involved here.  The House Report provides:</p>\n<p>"The Committee carefully considered arguments that the new definition might expand the numbers of refugees eligible to come to the United States and force substantially greater refugee admissions than the country could absorb.  However, merely because an individual or group comes within the definition will not guarantee resettlement in the United States."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. at 10.  This vesting of discretion in the Attorney General is quite typical in the immigration area, <em>see, e.g., INS v. Jong Ha Wang,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/139/case.html">450 U. S. 139</a></span> (1981).  If anything is anomalous, it is that the Government now asks us to restrict its discretion to a narrow class of aliens.  Congress has assigned to the Attorney General and his delegates the task of making these hard individualized decisions; although Congress could have crafted a narrower definition, it chose to authorize the Attorney </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 480 U. S. 445</a></p><p> General to determine which, if any, eligible refugees should be denied asylum.</p>\n<p>The INS\'s second principal argument in support of the proposition that the "well founded fear" and "clear probability" standard are equivalent is that the BIA so construes the two standards.  The INS argues that the BIA\'s construction of the Refugee Act of 1980 is entitled to substantial deference, even if we conclude that the Court of Appeals\' reading of the statutes is more in keeping with Congress\' intent. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  This argument is unpersuasive. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 480 U. S. 446</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The question whether Congress intended the two standards to be identical is a pure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide.  Employing traditional tools of statutory construction, we have concluded that Congress did not intend the two standards to be identical. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">Chevron</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 480 U.

S. 448</a></p><p> intent.  [Citing cases.]  If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law, and must be given effect."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html#843">467 U. S. 843</a></span>, n. 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The narrow legal question whether the two standards are the same is, of course, quite different from the question of interpretation that arises in each case in which the agency is required to apply either or both standards to a particular set of facts.  There is obviously some ambiguity in a term like "well founded fear" which can only be given concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication.  In that process of filling "<em>any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress,\'" the courts must respect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress has delegated the responsibility for administering the statutory program.  <em>See Chevron, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html#843">467 U.

Pub.L. No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359.  While nothing in that Act affects the statutory provisions related to asylum or withholding of deportation, Title II of the 1986 Act creates a mechanism by which certain aliens may obtain legalization of their status.  Section 201(a) of the 1986 Act establishes that, with certain exceptions, an alien who has resided continuously in the United States in an unlawful status since before January 1, 1982, is entitled to have his or her status adjusted to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence.  An alien who obtains this adjustment of status under the new Act is then eligible for a second adjustment to the status of permanent resident after a waiting period of 18 months.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 245A(a).  An alien who obtains permanent residence status through this route is not, however, eligible for all benefits usually available to permanent residents.  For example, aliens who obtain permanent residence through this program are not eligible for certain public welfare benefits for five years after the grant of the new status.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 245A(H).</p>\n<p>The record indicates that respondent may well be eligible for eventual adjustment of status if she makes a timely application after the Attorney General establishes the procedures for administering Title II.  It would therefore appear that respondent might become a permanent resident by invoking the new procedures even if she is unsuccessful in her pending request for asylum.  Nonetheless, the possibility of this relief does not render her request for asylum moot.  First, the legalization provisions of the 1986 Act are not self-executing, and the procedures for administering the new Act are not yet in place.  Even if the benefits were identical, therefore, there is no way of knowing at this time whether respondent will be able to satisfy whatever burden is placed upon her to demonstrate eligibility.  <em>Cf. INS v. Chadha,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#937">462 U. S. 937</a></span> (1983).  Second, respondent might be able to obtain permanent residence through the asylum procedure sooner than through the legalization program; if she satisfies certain conditions, she may become eligible for adjustment of status to that of permanent resident 12 months after a grant of asylum.  <em>See</em> 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 209.1, 209.2 (1986).  Under Title II of the new Act, by contrast, there is an 18-month waiting period.  In light of these factors, we are persuaded that the controversy is not moot.</p>\n<p>Nor do we believe that the new Act makes it appropriate to exercise our discretion to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  The question presented in this case will arise, and has arisen, in hosts of other asylum proceedings brought by aliens who arrived in the United States after January 1, 1982, or who are seeking entry as refugees from other countries.  The importance of the legal issue makes it appropriate for us to address the merits now.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Prior to the amendments, asylum for aliens who were within the United States had been governed by regulations promulgated by the INS, pursuant to the Attorney General\'s broad parole authority.  <em>See</em> n. 14, <em>infra.</em>  Asylum for applicants who were not within the United States was generally governed by the now-repealed \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71153(a)(7) (1976 ed.).  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#433">480 U.

First, as we have mentioned, there is no entitlement to asylum; it is only granted to eligible refugees pursuant to the Attorney General\'s discretion.  Once granted, however, asylum affords broader benefits.  As the BIA explained in the context of an applicant from Afghanistan who was granted \xc2\xa7 243(h) relief but was denied asylum:</p>\n<p>"Section 243(h) relief is \'country specific,\' and accordingly, the applicant here would be presently protected from deportation to Afghanistan pursuant to section 243(h).  But that section would not prevent his exclusion and deportation to Pakistan or any other hospitable country under section 237(a) if that country will accept him.  In contrast, asylum is a greater form of relief.  When granted asylum, the alien may be eligible for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident pursuant to section 209 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1169, after residing here one year, subject to numerical limitations and the applicable regulations."</p>\n<p><em>Matter of Salim,</em> 18 I. &amp; N.Dec. 311, 315 (1982).  <em>See also Matter of Lam,</em> 18 I. &amp; N.Dec. 15, 18 (BIA 1981).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Article 33.1 of the Convention provides:</p>\n<p>"No Contracting State shall expel or return (\'refouler\') a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."</p>\n<p>189 U.N.T.S. 150, 176 (1954), 19 U.S.T. 6259, 6278, T.I.A.S.

This standard was identical to the one that was set forth in the regulations for the treatment of applications for withholding of deportation.  <em>See</em> 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 242.17(c) (1980).</p>\n<p>The argument that Congress intended to adhere to the standard used in the informal parole proceedings cannot be squared with Congress\' use of an entirely different formulation of the standard for defining "refugee" -- one much closer to \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) than to \xc2\xa7 243(h) (the statute which was the focus of the standard developed in the 1980 regulations).  Moreover, to the extent that Congress was ambiguous as to which practice it sought to incorporate, it is far more reasonable to conclude that it sought to continue the practice under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), a statutory provision, than to adhere to the informal parole practices of the Attorney General, a matter in which Congress had no involvement.</p>\n<p>The Government relies on the following passage from the Senate Report to support its contention that Congress sought to incorporate the standard from the parole proceedings -- not from \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7):</p>\n<p>"[T]he bill establishes an asylum provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act for the first time by improving and clarifying the procedures for determining asylum claims filed by aliens who are physically present in the United States.

The bill that the Senate Committee was discussing indeed made no change in the standards to be applied to applications for asylum from aliens within the United States; the Senate version explicitly incorporated the same standard as used in \xc2\xa7 243(h).  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#441">480 U.

As the passage he quotes and the context plainly indicate, the House Report referred to "means of entry" -- an issue dealt with under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), not the asylum regulations.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. at 10.  The Committee\'s reference to the Attorney General\'s asylum procedures, seven pages later in the text, in a discussion labeled "Asylum," and not even dealing with the definition of "well founded fear," <em>see id.</em> at 17, certainly does nothing to support JUSTICE POWELL\'S conclusion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Although this evidence concerns application of the term "refugee" to \xc2\xa7 207, not \xc2\xa7 208, the term is defined in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42), and obviously can have only one meaning.  JUSTICE POWELL suggests that the definition of "well founded fear" be interpreted as incorporating the standard from the asylum regulations, rather than the standard from \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), because</p>\n<p>"[i]t is more natural to speak of \'preserving\' an interpretation that had governed the <em>same</em> form of relief than one that had applied to a <em>different</em> form of relief,"</p>\n<p><em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#462">480 U.

Since the definition in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42) applies to all asylum relief -- that corresponding to the old \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) as well as that corresponding to the old Attorney General regulations -- it is difficult to understand how JUSTICE POWELL reasons that it is likely that Congress preserved the "<em>same</em> form of relief" (emphasis added).  The question is:  the "same" as which?

First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.  Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\'s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute."</p>\n<p>"   The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress."</p>\n<p>"<em>Morton v.

If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.  Such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.  Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit, rather than explicit.  In such a case, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency."</p>\n<p>"We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department\'s construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, and the principle of deference to administrative interpretations"</p>\n<p>"has been consistently followed by this Court whenever decision as to the meaning or reach of a statute has involved reconciling conflicting policies, and a full understanding of the force of the statutory policy in the given situation has depended upon more than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency regulations. . . ."</p>\n<p>" . . .  If this choice represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency\'s care by the statute, we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned."</p>\n<p>"<em>United States v.

Once it determined, after its own examination of the legislation, that Congress did not actually have an intent regarding the applicability of the bubble concept to the permit program, the question before it was not whether in its view the concept is \'inappropriate\' in the general context of a program designed to improve air quality, but whether the Administrator\'s view that it is appropriate in the context of this particular program is a reasonable one.  Based on the examination of the legislation and its history which follows, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress did not have a specific intention on the applicability of the bubble concept in these cases, and conclude that the EPA\'s use of that concept here is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html#842">467 U.

An agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency\'s earlier interpretation is "entitled to considerably less deference" than a consistently held agency view.  <em>Watt v.

During the period between 1965, when \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) was enacted, and 1972, the BIA expressly recognized that \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7) and \xc2\xa7 243(h) prescribed different standards.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#433">480 U. S. 433</a></span>-434.  Moreover, although the BIA decided in 1973 that the two standards were not irreconcilably different, <em>see Matter of Dunar,</em> 14 I. &amp; N.Dec. 310 (1973), as of 1981, the INS was still instructing its officials to apply a "good reason" test to requests for asylum from aliens not within the United States.  <em>See</em> Dept. of Justice, INS Operating Instructions Regulations TM 101, \xc2\xa7 208.4, p. 766.9 (Nov. 11, 1981) (explaining that "well founded fear" is satisfied if applicant "can show good reason why he/she fears persecution").  In 1984, when this case was decided by the BIA, it adhered to the view that the INS now espouses -- complete identity of the standards.  In 1985, however, the BIA decided to reevaluate its position and issued a comprehensive opinion to explain its latest understanding of the "well founded fear" standard.  <em>Matter of Acosta,</em> Interim Decision No. 2986 (Mar. 1, 1985).</p>\n<p>In <em>Acosta,</em> the BIA noted a number of similarities between the two standards and concluded that, in practical application, they are "comparable" or "essentially comparable," and that the differences between them are not "meaningful," but the agency never stated that they are identical, equivalent, or interchangeable.  On the contrary, the <em>Acosta</em> opinion itself establishes that the two standards differ.  In describing the objective component of the asylum standard, the BIA concluded that the alien is not required to establish the likelihood of persecution to any "particular degree of certainty."  <em>Id.</em> at 22.  There must be a "real chance" that the alien will become a victim of persecution, <em>ibid.,</em> but it is not necessary to show "that persecution <em>is more likely than not\' to occur."  <em>Id.</em> at 25.  The <em>Acosta</em> opinion was written after we had decided in <em>Stevic</em> that the \xc2\xa7 243(h) standard\n</em></p>\n<p>"requires that an application be supported by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution,"</p>\n<p>467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#429">467 U. S. 429</a></span>-430.  The decision in <em>Acosta</em> and the long pattern of erratic treatment of this issue make it apparent that the BIA has not consistently agreed, and even today does not completely agree, with the INS\'s litigation position that the two standards are equivalent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T31" name="F31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>How "meaningful" the differences between the two standards may be is a question that cannot be fully decided in the abstract, but the fact that Congress has prescribed two different standards in the same Act certainly implies that it intended them to have significantly different meanings.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept the INS\'s argument that it is impossible to think about a "well founded fear" except in "more likely than not" terms.  The Board was able to do it for a long time under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), <em>see Matter of Tan,</em> 12 I. &amp; N.Dec. 564 (1967); <em>Matter of Adamska,</em> 12 1. &amp; N.Dec. 201 (1967), and has apparently had little trouble applying the two separate standards in compliance with the recent Courts of Appeals\' decisions.  <em>See, e.g., Matter of Sanchez and Escobar,</em> Interim Decision No. 2996 (Oct. 15, 1985).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T32" name="F32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL argues that the Court of Appeals should be reversed for a different reason -- that it misinterpreted the BIA\'s decision.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#465">480 U. S. 465</a></span>-468.  This issue was not raised in any of the parties\' briefs, and was neither "set forth" nor "fairly included" within the question presented in the petition for certiorari.  <em>See</em> this Court\'s Rule 20.1.  The question presented asked:</p>\n<p>"Whether an alien\'s burden of proving eligibility for asylum pursuant to Section 208 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. 1158 (a), is equivalent to his burden of proving eligibility for withholding of deportation pursuant to Section 243 (h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1253 (h)."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. (1).  This question cannot be read as challenging the Court of Appeals\' determination that the BIA in fact required respondent "to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution in order to be declared eligible for asylum."  767 F.2d at 1454.  We therefore decline to address the issue.  <em>See United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html">451 U.

Thus, I accept its "narrow" conclusion that</p>\n<p>"the Immigration Judge and the BIA were incorrect in holding that the [standards for withholding of deportation and granting asylum] are identical."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#448">480 U. S. 448</a></span>.  In accordance with this holding, the Court eschews any attempt to give substance to the term "well founded fear," and leaves that task to the "process of case-by-case adjudication" by the INS, the agency in charge of administering the immigration laws.  <em>Ibid.</em>  I write separately and briefly to emphasize my understanding that, in its opinion, the Court has directed the INS to the appropriate sources from which the agency should derive the meaning of the "well founded fear" standard, a meaning that will be refined in later adjudication.  This emphasis, I believe, is particularly needed where, as here, an agency\'s previous interpretation of the statutory term is so strikingly contrary to plain language and legislative history.</p>\n<p>Thus, as the Court observes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#430">480 U. S. 430</a></span>-431, the very language of the term "well founded fear" demands a particular type of analysis -- an examination of the subjective feelings of an applicant for asylum coupled with an inquiry into the objective nature of the articulated reasons for the fear.  Moreover, in describing how, in the 1980 Act, Congress was attempting to bring this country\'s refugee laws into conformity with the United Nations Protocol, the Court notes that the Act\'s definition of refugee, wherein the "well founded fear" term appears, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#427">480 U. S. 427</a></span>, tracks the language of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 480 U.

Such language has a rich history of interpretation in international law and scholarly commentaries.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#437">480 U. S. 437</a></span>-440, and nn. 20, 24.  While the INS need not ignore other sources of guidance, the above directions by the Court should be significant in the agency\'s formulation of the "well founded fear" standard.</p>\n<p>Finally, in my view, the well reasoned opinions of the Courts of Appeals, that almost uniformly have rejected the INS\'s misreading of statutory language and legislative history, provide an admirable example of the very "case-by-case adjudication" needed for the development of the standard.  Although the Court refers to a conflict among these courts, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#426">480 U. S. 426</a></span>, n. 2, with one exception, <em>see ibid.,</em> all the Courts of Appeals that have addressed this question have concluded that the standards for withholding of deportation and granting asylum are not the same.  Rather, differences in opinion have arisen as to the precise formulation of the "well founded fear" standard. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html">*</a></span>  Such differences can arise only when courts or agencies seriously grapple with the problems of developing a standard, whose form is at first given by the statutory language and the intimations of the legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 480 U. S. 452</a></p><p> history, but whose final contours are shaped by the application of the standard to the facts of specific cases.  The efforts of these courts stand in stark contrast to -- but, it is sad to say, alone cannot make up for -- the years of seemingly purposeful blindness by the INS, which only now begins its task of developing the standard entrusted to its care.</p>\n<p>* <em>See, e.g., Carcamo-Flores v. INS,</em> 805 F.2d 60, 68 (CA2 1986) ("What is relevant is the fear a reasonable person would have, keeping in mind the context of a reasonable person who is facing the possibility of persecution, perhaps including a loss of freedom or even, in some cases, the loss of life"); <em>Guevara-Flores v.

I concur in the judgment rather than join the Court\'s opinion, however, for two reasons.  First, despite having reached the above conclusion, the Court undertakes an exhaustive investigation of the legislative history of the Act.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">480 U. S. 432</span>-443.   It attempts to justify this inquiry by relying upon the doctrine that if the legislative history of an enactment reveals a "<em>clearly expressed legislative intention\' contrary to [the enactment\'s] language," the Court is required to "question the strong presumption that Congress expresses its intent through the language it chooses."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">480 U. S. 432</span>, n. 12.  Although it is true that the Court in recent times has expressed approval of this doctrine, that is to my mind an ill-advised deviation from the venerable principle that, if the language of a statute is clear, that language must be given effect -- at least in the absence of a patent absurdity.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/18/76/case.html">18 U.

The INS makes a number of specific arguments based upon the legislative history of the Act.  It would have sufficed, it seems to me, for the Court to determine whether these specific arguments establish a "clearly expressed legislative intent" that the two standards be equivalent.  I think it obvious that they do not, as apparently does the Court.  That being so, there is simply no need for the lengthy effort to ascertain the import of the entire legislative history.  And that effort is objectionable not only because it is gratuitous.  I am concerned that it will be interpreted to suggest that similarly exhaustive analyses are generally appropriate (or, worse yet, required) in cases where the language of the enactment at issue is clear.  I also fear that, in this case, the Court\'s conduct of that inquiry will be interpreted as a betrayal of its assurance that it does "not attempt to set forth a detailed description of how the well founded fear test should be applied," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#448">480 U.

Since the Court quite rightly concludes that the INS\'s interpretation is clearly inconsistent with the plain meaning of that phrase and the structure of the Act, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#431">480 U.

The Court\'s discussion is flatly inconsistent with this well established interpretation.  The Court first implies that courts may substitute their interpretation of a statute for that of an agency whenever, "[e]mploying traditional tools of statutory construction," they are able to reach a conclusion as to the proper interpretation of the statute.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#446">480 U.

Congress has provided two forms of relief for such people:  asylum, <em>see</em> Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \xc2\xa7 208(a), <em>as added by</em> 94 Stat. 105, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1158(a); and withholding of deportation, <em>see</em> 66 Stat. 212, \xc2\xa7 243(h), <em>as amended,</em> 94 Stat. 107, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253(h).  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has concluded that there is no practical distinction between the objective proofs an alien must submit to be eligible for these two forms of relief.  The Court rejects this conclusion.  Because I believe the BIA\'s interpretation of the statute is reasonable, I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion seems to assume that the BIA has adopted a rigorous mathematical approach to asylum cases, requiring aliens to demonstrate an objectively quantifiable risk of persecution in their homeland that is more than 50%.  The Court then argues that such a position is inconsistent with the language and history of the Act.  But this has never been the BIA\'s position.  Thus, it is useful to examine the BIA\'s approach in some detail before evaluating the Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 480 U. S. 456</a></p><p> rejection of the BIA\'s approach.  After all, the BIA is the tribunal with the primary responsibility for applying the Act, and the greatest experience in doing so.</p>\n<p>The BIA\'s interpretation of the statutory term "well founded fear" appears in <em>Matter of Acosta,</em> Interim Decision No. 2986 (Mar. 1, 1985). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Under the BIA\'s analysis, an immigration judge evaluating an asylum application should begin by determining the underlying historical facts.  The burden of persuasion rests on the applicant, who must establish the truth of these facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  <em>See id.</em> at 7 (citing, <em>inter alia,</em> 1A C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \xc2\xa7 5.10b, p. 5-121 (rev. ed. 1986)).</p>\n<p>Once the immigration judge has decided what historical facts the applicant has demonstrated, he then decides whether those facts meet the definition of "refugee" set forth in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101(a)(42)(A).  The major point of contention in this case concerns that section\'s requirement that the fear be "well founded." [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 480 U. S. 457</a></p><p> <em>Acosta,</em> the BIA adhered to the interpretation of that language it had developed in <em>Matter of Dunar,</em> 14 I. &amp; N.Dec. 310 (1973):</p>\n<p>""[T]he requirement that the fear be <em>well founded\' rules out an apprehension which is purely subjective. . . .  Some sort of showing must be made, and this can ordinarily be done only by objective evidence.  The claimant\'s own testimony as to the facts will sometimes be all that is available, <em>but the crucial question is whether the testimony, if accepted as true, makes out a realistic likelihood that he will be persecuted.</em>"" </em></p>\n<p><em>Acosta, supra,</em> at 18-19 (quoting <em>Dunar, supra,</em> at 319) (emphasis added by <em>Acosta</em> Board).  The <em>Acosta</em> Board went on to caution:</p>\n<p>"By use of such words [as \'realistic likelihood\'], we do not mean that \'a well founded fear of persecution\' requires an alien to establish to a particular degree of certainty, such as a \'probability,\' as opposed to a \'possibility,\' that he will become a victim of persecution.  Rather, as a practical matter, what we mean can best be described as follows:  the evidence must demonstrate that (1) the alien possesses a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome in others by means of punishment of some sort; (2) the persecutor is already aware, or could easily become aware, that the alien possesses this belief or characteristic; (3) the persecutor has the capability of punishing the alien; and (4) the persecutor has the inclination to punish the alien."</p>\n<p><em>Acosta, supra,</em> at 22.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <em>Acosta</em> opinion compared this "realistic likelihood" standard to the "clear probability" standard applied to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 480 U. S. 458</a></p><p> applications for withholding of deportation.  The BIA\'s comments are insightful:</p>\n<p>"One might conclude that \'a well founded fear of persecution,\' which requires a showing that persecution is likely to occur, refers to a standard that is different from \'a clear probability of persecution,\' which requires a showing that persecution is \'more likely than not\' to occur.  As a practical matter, however, the facts in asylum and withholding cases do not produce clear-cut instances in which such fine distinctions can be meaningfully made.  Our inquiry in these cases, after all, is not quantitative, <em>i.e.,</em> we do not examine a variety of statistics to discern to some theoretical degree the likelihood of persecution.  Rather our inquiry is qualitative:  we examine the alien\'s experiences and other external events to determine if they are of a kind that enable us to conclude the alien is likely to become the victim of persecution.  In this context, we find no meaningful distinction between a standard requiring a showing that persecution is likely to occur and a standard requiring a showing that persecution is more likely than not to occur. . . .  Accordingly, we conclude that the standards for asylum and withholding of deportation are not meaningfully different and, in practical application, converge."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 25.</p>\n<p>In sum, contrary to the Court\'s apparent conclusion, the BIA does not contend that both the "well founded fear" standard and the "clear probability" standard require proof of a 51% chance that the alien will suffer persecution if he is returned to his homeland.  The BIA plainly eschews analysis resting on mathematical probabilities.  Rather, the BIA has adopted a four-part test requiring proof of facts that demonstrate a realistic likelihood of persecution actually occurring.  The heart of the <em>Acosta</em> decision is the BIA\'s empirical conclusion, based on its experience in adjudicating asylum applications, that, if the facts establish such a basis for an alien\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 480 U. S. 459</a></p><p> fear, it rarely will make a difference whether the judge asks if persecution is "likely" to occur or "more likely than not" to occur.  If the alien can establish such a basis, he normally will be eligible for relief under either standard.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In Part II of its opinion, the Court examines the language of the Act.  Section 243(h) provides that the Attorney General shall grant withholding of deportation to any country where "such alien\'s life or freedom would be threatened."  8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253(h).  Section 208(a) provides that the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum "if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee."  \xc2\xa7 1158(a).  The crucial language of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act, <em>as added by</em> 94 Stat. 102, defines a refugee as a person who has "a well founded fear of persecution."  \xc2\xa7 1101(a)(42)(A).  In the Court\'s view, this language all but disposes of the case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#427">480 U. S. 427</a></span>-432.</p>\n<p>With respect to the issue presented by this case, I find the language far more ambiguous than the Court does.  Respondent contends that the BIA has fallen into error by equating the objective showings required under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 208(a) and 243(h).  The Court notes that the language of \xc2\xa7 208(a) differs from the language of \xc2\xa7 243(h) in that it contemplates a partially subjective inquiry.  From this premise, the Court moves with little explanation to the conclusion that the objective inquiries under the two sections necessarily are different.</p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, the Court gives short shrift to the words "well founded," that clearly require some objective basis for the alien\'s fear.  The critical question presented by this case is whether the objective basis required for a fear of persecution to be "well founded" differs in practice from the objective basis required for there to be a "clear probability" of persecution.  Because both standards necessarily contemplate some objective basis, I cannot agree with the Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 480 U. S. 460</a></p><p> implicit conclusion that the statute resolves this question on its face.  In my view, the character of evidence sufficient to meet these two standards is a question best answered by an entity familiar with the types of evidence and issues that arise in such cases.  Congress limited eligibility for asylum to those persons whom "the Attorney General determines" to be refugees.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 208(a), 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1158(a).  The Attorney General has delegated the responsibility for making these determinations to the BIA.  That Board has examined more of these cases than any court ever has or ever can.  It has made a considered judgment that the difference between the "well founded" and the "clear probability" standards is of no practical import:  that is, the evidence presented in asylum and withholding of deportation cases rarely, if ever, will meet one of these standards without meeting both.  This is just the type of expert judgment -- formed by the entity to whom Congress has committed the question -- to which we should defer.</p>\n<p>The Court ignores the practical realities recognized by the expert agency, and instead concentrates on semantic niceties.  It posits a hypothetical situation in which a government sought to execute every 10th adult male.  In its view, fear of such executions would be "well founded" even if persecution of a particular individual would not be "more likely than not" to occur.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#431">480 U. S. 431</a></span>.  But this hypothetical is irrelevant; it addresses a mathematically demanding interpretation of "well founded" that has no relation to the BIA\'s actual treatment of asylum applications.  Nor does it address the validity of the BIA\'s judgment that evidence presenting this distinction will be encountered infrequently, if ever.</p>\n<p>Common sense and human experience support the BIA\'s conclusion.  Governments rarely,persecute people by the numbers.  It is highly unlikely that the evidence presented at an asylum or withholding of deportation hearing will demonstrate the mathematically specific risk of persecution posited by the Court\'s hypothetical.  Taking account of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 480 U. S. 461</a></p><p> types of evidence normally available in asylum cases, the BIA has chosen to make a qualitative evaluation of "realistic likelihoods."  As I read the <em>Acosta</em> opinion, an individual who fled his country to avoid mass executions might be eligible for both withholding of deportation <em>and</em> asylum, whether or not he presented evidence of the numerical reach of the persecution.  <em>See Acosta,</em> Interim Decision No. 2986, at 18-25. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Nowhere does the Court consider whether the BIA\'s four-element interpretation of "well founded" is unreasonable.  Nor does the Court consider the BIA\'s view of the types of evidentiary presentations aliens generally make in asylum cases.</p>\n<p>In sum, the words Congress has chosen -- "well founded" fear -- are ambiguous.  They contemplate some objective basis without specifying a particular evidentiary threshold.  There is no reason to suppose this formulation is inconsistent with the analysis set forth in <em>Acosta.</em>  The BIA has concluded that a fear is not "well founded" unless the fear has an objective basis indicating that there is a "realistic likelihood" that persecution would occur.  Based on the text of the Act alone, I cannot conclude that this conclusion is unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court bolsters its interpretation of the language of the Act by reference to three parts of the legislative history.  A closer examination of these materials demonstrates that each of them is ambiguous.  Nothing the Court relies on provides a positive basis for arguing that there is a material difference between the two standards. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 480 U. S. 462</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>First, the Court cites legislative history indicating that Congress wished to preserve some existing standard when it placed the words "well founded fear" in the Act.  The Court concludes that the standard Congress intended to preserve was the BIA\'s practice under the old \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7), 79 Stat. 913 (1965).  That section authorized the Attorney General to grant conditional entry to aliens fleeing from Communist countries or the Middle East, so long as they established a "fear of persecution."  The Court argues that Congress chose the words "well founded fear" to "preserve" as an asylum standard the prior interpretation of the word "fear" in the standard for conditional entry.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the United States argues that Congress chose the words "well founded fear" to preserve the Attorney General\'s regulations governing applications for asylum by aliens in the United States. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  These regulations were substantially in accord with the BIA\'s view, namely that there is no significant difference between the "well founded fear" and "clear probability" standards.  <em>Compare</em> 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 108.3(a) and 236.3 (a)(2) (1980) (asylum) <em>with</em> 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 242.17(c) (1980) (withholding of deportation).  Common sense suggests that the United States has the better of this argument.  It is more natural to speak of "preserving" an interpretation that had governed the same form of relief than one that had applied to a different form of relief.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the legislative history makes it clear that Congress was referring to the regulations, rather than to \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7).  The Senate Report states that the bill</p>\n<p>"improv[es] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 480 U. S. 463</a></p><p> and clarif[ies] the procedures for determining asylum claims filed by aliens who are physically present in the United States.  The substantive standard is not changed."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 96-256, p. 9 (1979).  As the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#435">480 U. S. 435</a></span>, n. 17, this statement unquestionably refers to the informal procedures for aliens in the United States, not the statutory procedures under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Similarly, the House Report states that</p>\n<p>"the new definition does not create a new and expanded means of entry, but instead regularizes and <em>formalizes</em> the policies and practices that have been followed in recent years."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 96-608, p. 10 (1979) (emphasis added).  Congress hardly would have felt a need to "formalize" the statutory procedures under \xc2\xa7 203(a)(7).  Indeed, the House Report cites the Attorney General\'s regulations as the extant procedures to which it was referring.  H.R.Rep. at 17.</p>\n<p>In my view, the legislative history indicates that Congress\' choice of the words "well founded" fear as the standard of eligibility for asylum was intended to carry forward the practice of the Attorney General in adjudicating asylum applications.  The Attorney General had concluded that the standard for asylum was substantially identical to the standard for withholding of deportation.  His decision to interpret the language of \xc2\xa7 208 in the same way is entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Second, the Court relies on materials interpreting the United Nations Protocol.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#437">480 U. S. 437</a></span>-440.  For several reasons, I find these materials to be only marginally relevant.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 480 U. S. 464</a></p><p> Both the President and the Senate thought that the Protocol was perfectly consistent with our country\'s immigration laws.  <em>See INS v. Stevic,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html">467 U. S. 407</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html#417">467 U. S. 417</a></span> (1984) (citing legislative history).  We should be reluctant to assume that our country has been violating the Protocol during the 20 years since its adoption.  Moreover, as the Court recognizes, statements by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have no binding force, because "<em>the determination of refugee status under the . . . Protocol . . . is incumbent upon the Contracting State.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#439">480 U. S. 439</a></span>, n. 22 (quoting Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status 1(ii) (Geneva, 1979)).\n</em></p>\n<p>In any event, the materials discussed by the Court shed little or no light on the question presented by this case.  None of them states that the burden of proof for <em>nonrefoulement</em> under Article 33.1 of the United Nations Protocol of 1967 -- a remedy essentially identical to withholding of deportation under \xc2\xa7 243(h) of the Act -- is higher than the burden of proof for asylum under Article 34.  The only thing the materials tend to establish is that a mathematical approach to the likelihood of persecution in asylum cases is arguably inconsistent with the sense of the drafters of the Protocol.  The BIA has declined to adopt such an approach.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#457">480 U. S. 457</a></span>-459.  It is simply irrelevant that this approach might be inconsistent with the views of commentators on the Protocol.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, the Court places great weight on the changes in the Act made by the Conference Committee.  The Court notes that the Senate bill, S. 643, authorized the Attorney General to grant asylum if the applicant</p>\n<p>"is a refugee within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) and his deportation or return would be prohibited under section 243(h) of this Act."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 96-256, at 26.  The Court conjectures that this language</p>\n<p>"indicates that the Senate recognized that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 480 U. S. 465</a></p><p> there is a difference between the \'well founded fear\' standard and the clear probability standard.  The enactment of the House bill, rather than the Senate bill, in turn demonstrates that Congress eventually refused to restrict eligibility for asylum only to aliens meeting the stricter standard."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#442">480 U. S. 442</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Neither the premise of the Court nor its conclusion is justified.  The language of the Senate bill does not demonstrate that the Senate recognized a difference between the two standards.  The Senate just as easily could have included the language to ensure that the Attorney General held to his position that there was no difference between the standards.  Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the changes made by the Conference Committee reflected a considered rejection of this portion of the Senate\'s definition of refugee.  Rather, the Conference Committee Report demonstrates that the Conference thought both bills adopted the same general definition of refugee -- the U.N. definition.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 96-781, p. 19 (1980).  The differences the Conference saw between the bills related to treatment of refugees still in their homeland and to refugees who have been "firmly resettled" in another country.  <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p>In short, I see no reason to believe that the minor differences in wording between the Senate bill and the Act as passed reflect a rejection of the position that there is no significant difference between the two standards. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Thus, I place no weight on the Conference Committee\'s choice of the language of the House bill.</p>\n<p>Even if I agreed with the Court\'s conclusion that there is a significant difference between the standards for asylum and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 480 U. S. 466</a></p><p> withholding of deportation, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and uphold the decision of the BIA in this case. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]   A careful reading of the decisions of the BIA and the Immigration Judge demonstrates that the BIA applied the lower asylum standard to this case.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s claim for asylum rested solely on testimony that her brother had experienced difficulties with the authorities in Nicaragua.  The Immigration Judge rejected respondent\'s claim because he found "no evidence of any substance in the record other than her brother\'s claim to asylum."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a.  He further found:</p>\n<p>"None of the evidence indicates that the respondent would be persecuted for political beliefs, whatever they may be, or because she belongs to a particular social group.  She has not proven that she or any other members of her family, other than her brother, has [<em>sic</em>] been detained, interrogated, arrested and imprisoned, tortured and convicted and sentenced by the regime presently in power in Nicaragua."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The absence of such evidence was particularly probative because many of the other members of respondent\'s family -- her parents, two sisters, her brother\'s wife, and her brother\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 480 U. S. 467</a></p><p> two children -- were still in Nicaragua, and thus presumably subject to the persecution respondent feared.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the BIA affirmed.  It decided this case after the passage of the Act, but before its opinion in <em>Acosta.</em>  At that time, the BIA was confronted with a number of conflicting decisions by Courts of Appeals as to the correct standard for evaluating asylum applications.  The BIA noted three different formulations of the "well founded fear" standard:  the "clear probability" test, <em>see Rejaie v. INS,</em> 691 F.2d 139 (CA3 1982); the "good reason" test, <em>see Stevic v. Sava,</em> 678 F.2d 401 (CA2 1982), <em>rev\'d on other grounds, INS v. Stevic,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/407/case.html">467 U. S. 407</a></span> (1984); and the "realistic likelihood" test the BIA had adopted in <em>Matter of Dunar,</em> 14 I. &amp; N.Dec. 310 (1973).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#456">480 U. S. 456</a></span>-459 (discussing <em>Acosta</em>).  Reviewing the evidence respondent had submitted to the Immigration Judge, the BIA concluded that respondent could not obtain relief under any of the standards.  The BIA focused especially on the fact that respondent</p>\n<p>"has openly admitted that she herself has taken no actions against the Nicaraguan government.  She admits that she has never been politically active.  She testified that she never assisted her brother in any of his political activities.  Moreover, she admits that she has never been singled out for persecution by the present government."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Without examining either the factual or legal basis for the BIA\'s decision, the court granted the petition, reversed the BIA\'s decision, and remanded the application to the BIA for further consideration.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 480 U. S. 468</a></p><p> 767 F.2d 1448 (1985).  The sole basis articulated for this action was a conclusion that the BIA had applied the wrong legal standard.  The Court of Appeals repeated its position that the standards for asylum and withholding of deportation are different.  According to that court, an asylum applicant must</p>\n<p>"present \'specific facts\' through objective evidence to prove either past persecution or \'<em>good reason</em>\' to fear future persecution."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1453 (quoting <em>Carvajal-Munoz v. INS,</em> 743 F.2d 562, 574 (CA7 1984)) (emphasis added).  It then noted that the BIA had reached a different conclusion in <em>Acosta,</em> and stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Board appears to feel that it is exempt from the holding of <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> . . . and not constrained by circuit court opinions. . . .  [T]he Board applied its own construction of the applicant\'s burden of proof in an asylum case to the claims of both Cardoza-Fonseca and [her copetitioner].  It held that they were required to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution in order to be declared eligible for asylum."</p>\n<p>767 F.2d at 1454 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>This statement is simply inconsistent with the BIA\'s opinion.  As I have explained, the BIA acknowledged the conflicting decisions of the various Courts of Appeals, and explicitly tested the application under three different standards.  The least burdensome of these -- the "good reason" standard -- is identical to the court\'s statement quoted <em>supra,</em> this page.  The Court of Appeals completely ignored the words in which the BIA framed its decision.  It failed to examine the factual findings on which the decision rested.  At least in this case, it appears that the Court of Appeals, and not the BIA, has misunderstood the proper relation between courts and agencies.  That court properly could have considered whether substantial evidence supported the BIA\'s conclusion that respondent failed to demonstrate a "good reason" to fear persecution, but it should not have assumed that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 480 U. S. 469</a></p><p> the BIA tested respondent\'s application by a higher standard than the BIA\'s own opinion reflects.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my view, the Court misconstrues the Act and misreads its legislative history.  Moreover, neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals has identified an error in the decision of the BIA in this case.  Neither court has examined the factual findings on which the decision rested, or the legal standard the BIA applied to these facts.  I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that the BIA\'s interpretation of the "well founded fear" standard has been "erratic."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#446">480 U. S. 446</a></span>-447, n. 30.  An examination of the relevant BIA decisions leads to a contrary conclusion.  The BIA first addressed the standard in <em>Matter of Dunar,</em> 14 I. &amp; N.Dec. 310 (1973).  In that case, the BIA considered the meaning of the term "well founded fear" in the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 U.S.T. 6223, 6225, T.I.A.S. No. 6577 (1968).  When Congress inserted this language in the asylum provisions of the Act in 1980, the BIA interpreted the language to mean exactly the same thing as the language in the Protocol.  <em>Matter of Acosta,</em> Interim Decision No. 2986 (Mar. 1, 1985).  Thus, the BIA\'s position has never changed.  The Court bases its characterization of the BIA\'s record on decisions applying the more lenient "fear" standard.  If anything about these statutes is clear, it is that a "well founded fear" is something more than a "fear."  It is unfair to characterize the BIA\'s decisions as "erratic" when the agency was, in fact, interpreting two different standards.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The BIA has interpreted the statutory definition to require proof of four elements:  (i) the alien must have a "fear" of "persecution;" (ii) the fear must be "well founded;" (iii) the persecution must be "on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion;" and (iv) the alien must be unable or unwilling to return to his homeland because of persecution or his well founded fear of persecution.  <em>See id.</em> at 11.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, the applicant would have to meet all four elements of the well founded fear standards.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#457">480 U. S. 457</a></span> (quoting <em>Acosta,</em> Interim Decision No. 2986, at 22).  Although these requirements restrict grants of relief in some cases, none of them rests on the mathematical considerations that the Court suggests govern current BIA practice.  Moreover, the Court\'s exegesis of the "plain meaning" of the phrase "well founded" in no way suggests that the BIA\'s four-part test is a misinterpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Those regulations constituted this country\'s informal attempt to comply with the exhortation of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees to "facilitate the assimilation and naturalization," Art. 34, Jan. 31, 1967, [1968] 19 U.S.T. 6269, 6276, T.I.A.S. No. 6577, of persons who have a "well founded fear of being persecuted," Art. 1(A)(2), <em>id.</em> at 6261.  All parties agree that the Convention\'s language was the ultimate source of the language Congress placed in the Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the Senate Report has no probative force because the Conference Committee adopted the House language, rather than the Senate language.  But the changes in language made by the Conference Committee do not help the Court\'s position.  As I explain <em>infra,</em> this page, the House Report indicates that the House bill also was intended to adopt the standards set forth in the regulations.  Moreover, there is no suggestion in the Conference Report that this change in language affected the substantive standard.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#464">480 U. S. 464</a></span>-465.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>This interpretation is supported by evidence that the House bill, like the Senate bill, was intended to preserve the Attorney General\'s regulations treating the two standards as substantially identical.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#463">480 U. S. 463</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court contends that this question is not before us.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#448">480 U. S. 448</a></span>, n. 31.  I find this suggestion quite strange.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service asked the Court to determine</p>\n<p>"[w]hether an alien\'s burden of proving eligibility for asylum . . . is equivalent to his burden of proving eligibility for withholding of deportation."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. (1).  The question whether the two standards are equivalent "fairly includes," under this Court\'s Rule 21.1(a), the problem of defining the appropriate standard for asylum.  And that question can only be answered on the facts of this case.  The Court does not sit to answer hypothetical questions of statutory construction.  Normally we resolve such questions only by examining the facts of the case before us.  In this case, the Court affirms the Court of Appeals\' decision that the BIA required an intolerably high burden of proof in this case.  Yet, like the Court of Appeals, the Court examines neither the facts of the case before us nor the legal standard the BIA applied.  In my view, Rule 21 does not contemplate this result.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>In terms of the four-element <em>Acosta</em> test for well founded fear, respondent\'s claim would have failed both the first and the second elements.  Respondent failed to show either that she "possesses a belief or characteristic the persecutor seeks to overcome" or that "the persecutor is already aware, or could easily become aware, that [she] possesses this belief or characteristic."  <em>Acosta,</em> Interim Decision No. 2986, at 22.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
