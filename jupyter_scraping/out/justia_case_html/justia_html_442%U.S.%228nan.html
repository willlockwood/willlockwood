Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span> (1971), held that a "cause of action for damages" arises under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 442 U. S. 230</a></p><p> the Constitution when Fourth Amendment rights are violated.  The issue presented for decision in this case is whether a cause of action and a damages remedy can also be implied directly under the Constitution when the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, en banc, concluded that "no civil action for damages" can be thus implied.  571 F.2d 793, 801 (1978).  We granted certiorari, 439 U.S. 925 (1978), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the time this case commenced, respondent Otto E. Passman was a United States Congressman from the Fifth Congressional District of Louisiana. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On February 1, 1974, Passman hired petitioner Shirley Davis as a deputy administrative assistant. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Passman subsequently terminated her employment, effective July 31, 1974, writing Davis that, although she was "able, energetic and a very hard worker," he had concluded "that it was essential that the understudy to my Administrative Assistant be a man." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  App. 6. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 442 U. S. 231</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Davis brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, alleging that Passman\'s conduct discriminated against her "on the basis of sex in violation of the United States Constitution and the Fifth Amendment thereto."  <em>Id.</em> at 4.  Davis sought damages in the form of backpay.  <em>Id.</em> at 5. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Jurisdiction for her suit was founded on 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331(a), which provides in pertinent part that federal</p>\n<p>"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000 . . . and arises under the Constitution . . . of the United States. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="232">Page 442 U. S. 232</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Passman moved to dismiss Davis\' action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 12(b)(6), arguing, <em>inter alia,</em> that "the law affords no private right of action" for her claim. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  App. 8.  The District Court accepted this argument, ruling that Davis had "no private right of action."  <em>Id.</em> at 9. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.  544 F.2d 865 (1977).  The panel concluded that a cause of action for damages arose directly under the Fifth Amendment; that, taking as true the allegations in Davis\' complaint, Passman\'s conduct violated the Fifth Amendment; and that Passman\'s conduct was not shielded by the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 1. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed the decision of the panel.  The en banc court did not reach the merits, nor did it discuss the application of the Speech or Debate Clause.  The court instead held that "no right of action may be implied from the Due Process Clause of the fifth amendment."  571 F.2d at 801.  The court reached this conclusion on the basis of the criteria that had been set out in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span> (1975), for determining whether a private cause of action should be implied from a federal statute. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Noting that Congress had failed to create a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="233">Page 442 U. S. 233</a></p><p> damages remedy for those in Davis\' position, the court also concluded that "the proposed damage remedy is not constitutionally compelled," so that it was not necessary to "countermand the clearly discernible will of Congress" and create such a remedy.  571 F.2d at 800.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> federal agents had allegedly arrested and searched Bivens without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="234">Page 442 U. S. 234</a></p><p> probable cause, thereby subjecting him to great humiliation, embarrassment, and mental suffering.  <em>Bivens</em> held that the Fourth Amendment guarantee against "unreasonable searches and seizures" was a constitutional right which Bivens could enforce through a private cause of action, and that a damages remedy was an appropriate form of redress.  Last Term, <em>Butz v. Economou,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html">438 U. S. 478</a></span> (1978), reaffirmed this holding, stating that</p>\n<p>"the decision in <em>Bivens</em> established that a citizen suffering a compensable injury to a constitutionally protected interest could invoke the general federal question jurisdiction of the district courts to obtain an award of monetary damages against the responsible federal official."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#504">438 U. S. 504</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Today we hold that <em>Bivens</em> and <em>Butz</em> require reversal of the holding of the en banc Court of Appeals.  Our inquiry proceeds in three stages.  We hold first that, pretermitting the question whether respondent\'s conduct is shielded by the Speech or Debate Clause, petitioner asserts a constitutionally protected right; second, that petitioner has stated a cause of action which asserts this right; and third, that relief in damages constitutes an appropriate form of remedy.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . ."  In numerous decisions, this Court</p>\n<p>"has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the Federal Government to deny equal protection of the laws.  <em>E.g., Hampton v.

The equal protection component of the Due Process Clause thus confers on petitioner a federal constitutional right [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] to be free from gender discrimination which cannot meet these requirements. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 442 U. S. 236</a></p><p> We inquire next whether petitioner has a cause of action to assert this right.</p>\n<p><em>B \n</em></p>\n<p>It is clear that the District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331(a) to consider petitioner\'s claim.  <em>Bell v. Hood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/case.html">327 U. S. 678</a></span> (1946).  It is equally clear, and the en banc Court of Appeals so held, that the Fifth Amendment confers on petitioner a constitutional right to be free from illegal discrimination. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Yet the Court of Appeals concluded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 442 U. S. 237</a></p><p> that petitioner could not enforce this right because she lacked a cause of action.  The meaning of this missing "cause of action," however, is far from apparent.</p>\n<p>Almost half a century ago, Mr. Justice Cardozo recognized that a "<em>cause of action\' may mean one thing for one purpose and something different for another."  <em>United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/62/case.html">288 U. S. 62</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/62/case.html#67">288 U. S. 67</a></span>-68 (1933). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The phrase apparently became a legal term of art when the New York Code of Procedure of 1848 abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity and simply required a plaintiff to include in his complaint "[a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of action" [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  1848 N.Y. Laws, ch. 379, \xc2\xa7 120(2).  By the first third of the 20th century, however, the phrase had become so encrusted with doctrinal complexity that the authors of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure eschewed it altogether, requiring only that a complaint contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."  Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 8(a).  <em>See Original Ballet Russe, Ltd. v. Ballet Theatre, Inc.,</em> 133 F.2d 187, 189 (CA2 1943).  Nevertheless, courts and commentators have continued to use the phrase "cause of action" in the traditional sense established by the Codes to refer roughly to the alleged invasion of "recognized legal rights" upon which a litigant bases his claim for relief. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 442 U. S. 238</a></em></p><p><em> <em>Larson v.

S. 693</a></span> (1949).\n</em></p>\n<p>This is not the meaning of the "cause of action" which the Court of Appeals below refused to imply from the Fifth Amendment, however, for the court acknowledged that petitioner had alleged an invasion of her constitutional right to be free from illegal discrimination. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Instead, the Court of Appeals appropriated the meaning of the phrase "cause of action" used in the many cases in which this Court has parsed congressional enactments to determine whether the rights and obligations so created could be judicially enforced by a particular "class of litigants."  <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U.

If a litigant is an appropriate party to invoke the power of the courts, it is said that he has a "cause of action" under the statute, and that this cause of action is a necessary element of his "claim."  So understood, the question whether a litigant has a "cause of action" is analytically distinct and prior to the question of what relief, if any, a litigant may be entitled to receive.  The concept of a "cause of action" is employed specifically to determine who may judicially enforce the statutory rights or obligations. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 442 U. S. 240</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is in this sense that the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner lacked a cause of action.  The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion through the application of the criteria set out in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span> (1975), for ascertaining whether a private cause of action may be implied from "a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 442 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The Court of Appeals used these criteria to determine that those in petitioner\'s position should not be able to enforce the Fifth Amendment\'s Due Process Clause, and that petitioner therefore had no cause of action under the Amendment.  This was error, for the question of who may enforce a statutory right is fundamentally different from the question of who may enforce a right that is protected by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Statutory rights and obligations are established by Congress, and it is entirely appropriate for Congress, in creating these rights and obligations, to determine in addition who may enforce them and in what manner.  For example, statutory rights and obligations are often embedded in complex regulatory schemes, so that, if they are not enforced through private causes of action, they may nevertheless be enforced through alternative mechanisms, such as criminal prosecutions, <em>see Cort v. Ash, supra,</em> or other public causes of actions.  <em>See Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour, supra; National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Assn. of Railroad Passengers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/453/case.html">414 U.

In each case, however, the question is the nature of the legislative intent informing a specific statute, and <em>Cort</em> set out the criteria through which this intent could be discerned.</p>\n<p>The Constitution, on the other hand, does not "partake of the prolixity of a legal code."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v.

It speaks instead with a majestic simplicity.  One of "its important objects," <em>ibid.,</em> is the designation of rights.  And in "its great outlines," <em>ibid.,</em> the judiciary is clearly discernible as the primary means through which these rights may be enforced.  As James Madison stated when he presented the Bill of Rights to the Congress:</p>\n<p>"If [these rights] are incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 442 U. S. 242</a></p><p> will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights."</p>\n<p>1 Annals of Cong. 439 (1789).</p>\n<p>At least in the absence of "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of [an] issue to a coordinate political department," <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#217">369 U.

And, unless such rights are to become merely precatory, the class of those litigants who allege that their own constitutional rights have been violated, and who at the same time have no effective means other than the judiciary to enforce these rights, must be able to invoke the existing jurisdiction of the courts for the protection of their justiciable constitutional rights. "The very essence of civil liberty," wrote Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v.

Indeed, this Court has already settled that a cause of action may be implied directly under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in favor of those who seek to enforce this constitutional right.

Litigation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has given federal courts great experience evaluating claims for backpay due to illegal sex discrimination.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g). Moreover, since respondent is no longer a Congressman, <em>see</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra,</em> equitable relief in the form of reinstatement would be unavailing.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, there is in this case "no <em>explicit</em> congressional declaration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 442 U. S. 247</a></p><p> that persons" in petitioner\'s position injured by unconstitutional federal employment discrimination "may not recover money damages from" those responsible for the injury.  <em>Bivens, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#397">403 U. S. 397</a></span>.  (Emphasis supplied.)  The Court of Appeals apparently interpreted \xc2\xa7 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 86 Stat. 111, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-16, as an explicit congressional prohibition against judicial remedies for those in petitioner\'s position.  When \xc2\xa7 717 was added to Title VII to protect federal employees from discrimination, it failed to extend this protection to congressional employees such as petitioner who are not in the competitive service. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-16(a).  There is no evidence, however, that Congress meant \xc2\xa7 717 to foreclose alternative remedies available to those not covered by the statute.  Such silence is far from "the clearly discernible will of Congress" perceived by the Court of Appeals.  571 F.2d at 800.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that \xc2\xa7 717 permits judicial relief to be made available only to those who are protected by the statute is patently inconsistent with <em>Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/88/case.html">426 U. S. 88</a></span> (1976), which held that equitable relief was available in a challenge to the constitutionality of Civil Service Commission regulations excluding aliens from federal employment.  That \xc2\xa7 717 does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of alienage [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] did not prevent <em>Hampton</em> from authorizing relief.  In a similar manner, we do not now interpret \xc2\xa7 717 to foreclose the judicial remedies of those expressly unprotected by the statute.  On the contrary, \xc2\xa7 717 leaves undisturbed whatever remedies petitioner might otherwise possess. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 442 U. S. 248</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals appeared concerned that, if a damages remedy were made available to petitioner, the danger existed "of deluging federal courts with claims. . . ."  571 F.2d at 800.  We do not perceive the potential for such a deluge.  By virtue of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, a damages remedy is already available to redress injuries such as petitioner\'s when they occur under color of state law.  Moreover, a plaintiff seeking a damages remedy under the Constitution must first demonstrate that his constitutional rights have been violated.  We do not hold that every tort by a federal official may be redressed in damages.  <em>See Wheeldin v. Wheeler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/647/case.html">373 U. S. 647</a></span> (1963).  And, of course, were Congress to create equally effective alternative remedies, the need for damages relief might be obviated.  <em>See Bivens,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#397">403 U. S. 397</a></span>.  But perhaps the most fundamental answer to the concerns expressed by the Court of Appeals is that provided by Mr. Justice Harlan concurring in <em>Bivens:</em></p>\n<p>"Judicial resources, I am well aware, are increasingly scarce these days.  Nonetheless, when we automatically close the courthouse door solely on this basis, we implicitly express a value judgment on the comparative importance of classes of legally protected interests.  And current limitations upon the effective functioning of the courts arising from budgetary inadequacies should not be permitted to stand in the way of the recognition of otherwise sound constitutional principles."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#411">403 U. S. 411</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that in this case, as in <em>Bivens,</em> if petitioner is able to prevail on the merits, she should be able to redress her injury in damages, a "remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#397">403 U.

Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one?  <em>See, e.g., National Railroad Passenger Corp. v.

While we acknowledge the gravity of respondent\'s concerns, we hold that judicial review of congressional employment decisions is constitutionally limited only by the reach of the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 1.  The Clause provides that Senators and Representatives, "for any Speech or Debate in either House, . . . shall not be questioned in any other Place."  It protects Congressmen for conduct necessary to perform their duties "within the <em>sphere of legitimate legislative activity.\'"  <em>Eastland v.

Since the Speech or Debate Clause speaks so directly to the separation of powers concerns raised by respondent, we conclude that, if respondent is not shielded by the Clause, the question whether his dismissal of petitioner violated her Fifth Amendment rights would, as we stated in <em>Powell v. McCormack,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/486/case.html">395 U.

In the absence of such a decision, we also intimate no view on this question.  We note, however, that the Clause shields federal legislators with absolute immunity "not only from the consequences of litigation\'s results, but also from the burden of defending themselves."  <em>Dombrowski v.

Defenses based upon the Clause should thus ordinarily be given priority, since federal legislators should be exempted from litigation if their conduct is in fact protected by the Clause.  We nevertheless decline to remand this case to the en banc Court of Appeals before we have decided whether petitioner\'s complaint states a cause of action, and whether a damages remedy is an appropriate form of relief.  These questions are otherwise properly before us, and may be resolved without imposing on respondent additional litigative burdens.  Refusal to decide them at this time may actually increase these burdens.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The restraints of the Fifth Amendment reach far enough to embrace the official actions of a Congressman in hiring and dismissing his employees.

A plaintiff may have a cause of action even though he be entitled to no relief at all, as, for example, when a plaintiff sues for declaratory or injunctive relief although his case does not fulfill the "preconditions" for such equitable remedies.  <em>See Trainor v.

And under the criteria we have set out, petitioner clearly has standing to bring this suit.  If the allegations of her complaint are taken to be true, she has shown that she "personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct G the defendant."  <em>Gladstone, Realtors v.

Congress could, of course, make <em>Bivens</em>-type remedies available to its staff employees -- and to other congressional employees -- but it has not done so.  On the contrary, Congress has historically treated its employees differently from the arrangements for other Government employees.  Historically, staffs of Members have been considered so intimately a part of the policymaking and political process that they are not subject to being selected, compensated, or tenured as others who serve the Government.  The vulnerability of employment on congressional staffs derives not only from the hazards of elections but also from the imperative need for loyalty, confidentiality, and political compatibility -- not simply to a political party, an institution, or an administration, but to the individual Member.</p>\n<p>A Member of Congress has a right to expect that every person on his or her staff will give total loyalty to the political positions of the Member, total confidentiality, and total support.  This may, on occasion, lead a Member to employ a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 442 U. S. 250</a></p><p> particular person on a racial, ethnic, religious, or gender basis thought to be acceptable to the constituency represented, even though. in other branches of Government -- or in the private sector -- such selection factors might be prohibited.  This might lead a Member to decide that a particular staff position should be filled by a Catholic or a Presbyterian or a Mormon, a Mexican-American or an Oriental-American -- or a woman rather than a man.  Presidents consciously select -- and dispense with -- their appointees on this basis, and have done so since the beginning of the Republic.  The very commission of a Presidential appointee defines the tenure as "during the pleasure of the President."</p>\n<p>Although Congress altered the ancient "spoils system" as to the Executive Branch and prescribed standards for some limited segments of the Judicial Branch, it has allowed its own Members, Presidents, and Judges to select their personal staffs without limit or restraint -- in practical effect, their tenure is "during the pleasure" of the Member.</p>\n<p>At this level of Government -- staff assistants of Members -- long-accepted concepts of separation of powers dictate, for me, that, until Congress legislates otherwise as to employment standards for its own staffs, judicial power in this area is circumscribed.  The Court today encroaches on that barrier.  <em>Cf. Sinking-Fund Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/700/case.html">99 U. S. 700</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/700/case.html#718">99 U. S. 718</a></span> (1879).</p>\n<p>In relation to his or her constituents, and in the performance of constitutionally defined functions, each Member of the House or Senate occupies a position in the Legislative Branch comparable to that of the President in the Executive Branch; and for the limited purposes of selecting personal staffs, their authority should be uninhibited except as Congress itself, or the Constitution, expressly provides otherwise.</p>\n<p>The intimation that, if Passman were still a Member of the House, a federal court could command him, on pain of contempt, to reemploy Davis represents an astonishing break with concepts of separate, coequal branches; I would categorically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 442 U. S. 251</a></p><p> reject the notion that courts have any such power in relation to the Congress.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Few questions concerning a plaintiff\'s complaint are more basic than whether it states a cause of action.  The present case, however, involves a preliminary question that may be completely dispositive, for, as the Court recognizes,</p>\n<p>"the [Speech or Debate] Clause shields federal legislators with absolute immunity \'not only from the consequences of litigation\'s results, but also from the burden of defending themselves.\'  <em>Dombrowski v. Eastland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/387/82/case.html">387 U. S. 82</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/387/82/case.html#85">387 U.

Accordingly, it seems clear to me that the first question to be addressed in this litigation is the Speech or Debate Clause claim -- a claim that is far from frivolous.</p>\n<p>I would vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with directions to decide the Speech or Debate Clause issue. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>* This issue was fully briefed and argued before the en banc Court of Appeals.  The court\'s opinion gives no indication of why the court did not decide it.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Although I join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, I write separately to emphasize that no prior decision of this Court justifies today\'s intrusion upon the legitimate powers of Members of Congress. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 442 U. S. 252</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s analysis starts with the general proposition that "the judiciary is clearly discernible as the primary means through which [constitutional] rights may be enforced," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#241">442 U. S. 241</a></span>.  It leaps from this generalization, unexceptionable itself, to the conclusion that individuals who have suffered an injury to a constitutionally protected interest, and who lack an "effective" alternative, "<em>must</em> be able to invoke the existing jurisdiction of the courts for the protection of their justiciable constitutional rights."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#242">442 U. S. 242</a></span> (emphasis supplied).  Apart from the dubious logic of this reasoning, I know of no precedent of this Court that supports such an absolute statement of the federal judiciary\'s obligation to entertain private suits that Congress has not authorized.  On the contrary, I have thought it clear that federal courts must exercise a principled discretion when called upon to infer a private cause of action directly from the language of the Constitution.  In the present case, for reasons well summarized by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, principles of comity and separation of powers should require a federal court to stay its hand.</p>\n<p>To be sure, it has been clear -- at least since <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span> (1971) -- that, in appropriate circumstances, private causes of action may be inferred from provisions of the Constitution. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  But the exercise of this responsibility involves discretion, and a weighing of relevant concerns.  As Mr. Justice Harlan observed in addressing this very point, a court should</p>\n<p>"take into account [a range of policy considerations] at least as broad as the range of those a legislature would consider with respect to an express statutory authorization of a traditional remedy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#407">403 U. S. 407</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 442 U. S. 253</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Among those policies that a court certainly should consider in deciding whether to imply a constitutional right of action is that of comity toward an equal and coordinate branch of government. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  As Mr. Chief Justice Waite observed over a century ago:</p>\n<p>"One branch of government cannot encroach on the domain of another without danger.  The safety of our institutions depends in no small degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule."</p>\n<p><em>Sinking-Fund Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/700/case.html">99 U. S. 700</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/700/case.html#718">99 U. S. 718</a></span> (1879).  Even where the authority of one branch over a matter is not exclusive, so that a federal court properly may accept jurisdiction over the dispute, we have recognized that the principle of separation of powers continues to have force as a matter of policy.  For example, in <em>United States v. Nixon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html">418 U. S. 683</a></span> (1974), we held, on the one hand, that the question whether the President had a claim of privilege as to conversations with his advisers was an issue to be resolved by the judiciary, and, on the other hand, that separation of powers considerations required the recognition of a qualified privilege. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 442 U. S. 254</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Whether or not the employment decisions of a Member of Congress fall within the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, a question the Court does net reach today, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] it is clear that these decisions are bound up with the conduct of his duties.  As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#249">442 U. S. 249</a></span>, a Congressman necessarily relies heavily on his personal staff in discharging the duties of his office.  Because of the nature of his office, he must rely to an extraordinary extent on the loyalty and compatibility of everyone who works for him.  <em>Cf. Elrod v. Burns,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html">427 U. S. 347</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#377">427 U. S. 377</a></span>-388 (1976) (POWELL, J., dissenting).  A Congressman simply cannot perform his constitutional duties effectively, or serve his constituents properly, unless he is supported by a staff in which he has total confidence.</p>\n<p>The foregoing would seem self-evident even if Congress had not indicated an intention to reserve to its Members the right to select, employ, promote, and discharge staff personnel without judicial interference.  But Congress unmistakably has made clear its view on this subject.  It took pains to exempt itself from the coverage of Title VII.  Unless the Court is abandoning or modifying <em>sub silentio</em> our holding in <em>Brown v. GSA,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/820/case.html">425 U. S. 820</a></span> (1976), that Title VII, as amended, "provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/820/case.html#835">425 U. S. 835</a></span>, the exemption from this statute for congressional employees should bar all judicial relief.</p>\n<p>In sum, the decision of the Court today is not an exercise of principled discretion.  It avoids our obligation to take into </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 442 U. S. 255</a></p><p> account the range of policy and constitutional considerations that we would expect a legislature to ponder in determining whether a particular remedy should be enacted.  It fails to weigh the legitimate interests of Members of Congress.  Indeed, the decision simply ignores the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.  In my view, the serious intrusion upon the authority of Members of Congress to choose and control their own personal staffs cannot be justified. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>A court necessarily has wider latitude in interpreting the Constitution than it does in construing a statute, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#407">17 U. S. 407</a></span> (1819).  Moreover, the federal courts have a far greater responsibility under the Constitution for the protection of those rights derived directly from it, than for the definition and enforcement of rights created solely by Congress.  <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#407">403 U. S. 407</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>It is settled that, where discretion exists, a variety of factors rooted in the Constitution may lead a federal court to refuse to entertain an otherwise properly presented constitutional claim.  <em>See, e.g., Trainor v. Hernandez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/434/case.html">431 U. S. 434</a></span> (1977); <em>Juidice v.

Traditionally, the issue has arisen in the context of a federal court\'s exercise of its equity powers with respect to the States.  Concerns of comity similar to those that govern our dealings with the States also come into play when we are asked to interfere with the functioning of Congress.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that, because the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution embodies a separation of powers principle, the Constitution affords no further protection to the prerogatives of Members of Congress.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#246">442 U. S. 246</a></span>.  This assertion not only marks a striking departure from precedent, but also constitutes a <em>non sequitur.</em>  Our constitutional structure of government rests on a variety of checks and balances; the existence of one such check does not negate all others.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>It is quite doubtful whether the Court should not consider respondent\'s Speech or Debate Clause claim as a threshold issue.  The purpose of that Clause, when it applies, includes the protection of Members of Congress from the harassment of litigation.  Since the Court chooses not to consider this claim, and addresses only the cause of action issue, I limit my dissent accordingly.  In doing so, I imply no view as to the merits of the Speech or Debate Clause issue or to the propriety of not addressing the claim before all other issues.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The justification the Court relies upon is the duty of federal courts to vindicate constitutional rights -- a duty no one disputes.  But it never has been thought that this duty required a blind exercise of judicial power without regard to other interests or constitutional principles.  Indeed, it would not be surprising for Congress to consider today\'s action unwarranted and to exercise its authority to reassert the proper balance between the legislative and judicial branches.  If the reaction took the form of limiting the jurisdiction of federal courts, the effect conceivably could be to frustrate the vindication of rights properly protected by the Court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
