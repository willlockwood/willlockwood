"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 10 U. S. 283</a></p><p></p>\n<p>LIVINGSTON, J.</p>\n<p>In this case, when here before, I dissented from the opinion of the Court because I did not think that the condemnation of a French court at Guadaloupe of a vessel and cargo lying in the port of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 10 U. S. 284</a></p><p> another nation had changed the property; but this ground, which was the only one taken by two of the judges in this case and by three in that of <em>Himely v. Rose,</em> and was principally and almost solely relied on at bar, was overruled by a majority of the Court, as will appear by examining those two cases, which were decided the same day.  I am not, therefore, in determining this cause as it now comes up at liberty to proceed upon it, and such must have been the opinion of Judge Chase on the trial of it, who was one of the court who had proceeded on that principle.</p>\n<p>Considering it, then, as settled that the French tribunal had jurisdiction of property seized under a municipal regulation within the territorial jurisdiction of the government of St. Domingo, it only remains for me to say whether it will make any difference if, as now appears to have been the case, the vessel were taken on the high seas, or more than two leagues from the coast.  If the <em>res</em> can be proceeded against when not in the possession or under the control of the court, I am not able to perceive how it can be material whether the capture were made within or beyond the jurisdictional limits of France or in the exercise of a belligerent or municipal right.  By a seizure on the high seas, she interfered with the jurisdiction of no other nation, the authority of each being there concurrent.  It would seem also that if jurisdiction be at all permitted where the thing is elsewhere, the court exercising it must necessarily decide, and that ultimately, or subject only to the review of a superior tribunal of its own state, whether, in the particular case, she had jurisdiction if any objection be made to it.  And although it be now stated as a reason why we should examine whether a jurisdiction was rightfully exercised over the <em>Sea Flower</em> that she was captured more than two leagues at sea, who can say that this very allegation, if it had been essential, may not have been urged before the French court, and the fact decided in the negative?  And if so, why should not its decision be as conclusive on this as on any other point?  The judge must have had a right to dispose of every question which was made on behalf of the owner of the property, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 10 U. S. 285</a></p><p> whether it related to his own jurisdiction or arose out of the law of nations, or out of the French decrees, or in any other way, and even if the reasons of his judgment should not appear satisfactory, it would be no reason for a foreign court to review his proceedings or not to consider his sentence as conclusive on the property.</p>\n<p>Believing, therefore, that this property was changed by its condemnation at Guadaloupe, the original owner can have no right to pursue it in the hands of any vendee under that sentence, and the judgment below must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>The other judges (except THE CHIEF JUSTICE) concurred.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL observed, that he had supposed that the former opinion delivered in these cases upon this point had been concurred in by four judges.  But in this he was mistaken.</p>\n<p>The opinion was concurred in by one judge.  He was still of opinion that the construction then given was correct.</p>\n<p>He understood the expression "<em>en sortant"</em> in the <em>arrete</em> as confining the case of vessels coming out, to vessels taken in the act of coming out.  If it included vessels captured on the return voyage, he should concur in the opinion now delivered.</p>\n<p>However, the principle of that case <em>(Rose v. Himely)</em> is now overruled.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
