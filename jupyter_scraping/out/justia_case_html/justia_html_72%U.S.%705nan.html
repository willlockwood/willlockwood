He then filed an information in the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois, for a mandamus.  He set forth the above quoted fourth section of the Act of June 21, 1852, empowering the city council to levy a specific tax of one percent to pay the interest on its funded debt, and that this tax had not been levied.  That by an Act of June 30, 1857, the city council was authorized to levy 1st, a tax of one percent for general and contingent expenses; 2d, five mills for school purposes; 3d, one percent to pay interest on public debt; 4th, an unlimited tax for market halls &amp;c., and other public improvements.  That none of the taxes to which the plaintiff, as a bond creditor, has a right had been levied and applied to his principal or interest after a period named, long past.  And he prayed the court to issue a mandamus commanding the city council and their successors in office, at their next regular term, to levy a special tax upon the taxable property of the city of one percent to pay the principal, and one percent to pay the interest and costs of the judgments,</p>\n<p>"and to pay the same out of the proceeds, and to continue to levy a like amount for each succeeding year until said judgments, interests, and costs are wholly paid."</p>\n<p>The city made a return that in 1865 they levied a tax of one percent to pay interest on public debt, and that it had been applied to a proper and lawful purpose.</p>\n<p>They set up in bar of the plaintiff\'s right that they only powers to tax which they had were by the Acts of June 30, 1857, already mentioned, and an act of February, 1865, amendatory of the act of 1852.  Sections of these last two acts relating to taxation, and stating for what purposes taxes might be laid were set forth.  In the act of 1857 were these:</p>\n<p>"<em>Section 1.</em>  The city council shall have power, by ordinance, to levy and collect annual taxes not exceeding one percent on the dollar on the assessed value of all real and personal estate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="707">Page 72 U.

It added that the councils intended, in good faith towards the city and its creditors (the relator included), to levy all the taxes which it had a right by law to levy.  But that the General Assembly having, by the acts aforesaid, placed a limit upon the power of taxation, the councils were wholly unable to raise money for the payment of the judgments excepting by means of proper ordinances passed under and in pursuance of section one of the Act of January </p><p><a class="page-number" name="708">Page 72 U.

The court sustained the demurrer; and the respondents electing to stand by the return, it was ordered that a peremptory mandamus should issue.  The respondents now brought the case before this Court for review.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court, having first stated the case.</p>\n<p>Most of the legal principles which are involved in this case, and which must govern its determination, have been settled in other cases decided at this term.</p>\n<p>Was there any error in the rulings of the circuit court?</p>\n<p>The fourth section of the act of 1852 declares that the city council, if they believe the public good and the best interests of the city require it, may levy and collect an annual tax of not exceeding one percent, and that the amount thus collected shall be kept separate; and that annually, on the 1st of January, it shall be paid over <em>pro rata</em> upon the funded debt of the city, that may be presented by the holders, and that this section shall continue in force until the principal and interest of the indebtedness is fully paid.</p>\n<p>This power has not been exercised by the city authorities, and they have made no other provision for liquidating the debts due to the relator.  They have no other means of payment, in possession or prospect. Under such circumstances, the discretion thus given cannot, consistently with the rules of law, be resolved in the negative.</p>\n<p>The rights of the creditor and the ends of justice demand that it should be exercised in favor of affirmative action, and the law requires it. In such cases, the power is in the nature of a trust for his benefit, and it was the plain duty of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 72 U. S. 709</a></p><p> court below to give him the remedy for which he asked by awarding a peremptory writ to compel the imposition of the tax, as was done.</p>\n<p>These principles were fully considered in <em>Supervisors of Rock Island County v. state Bank,</em> of this term, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and it is sufficient to refer to that case for a fuller exposition of our views upon the subject.</p>\n<p>This section of the act of 1852 is not repealed by either the act of 1857 or the act of 1865.  There is no express repeal, and we think there is none by implication.  The latter is not favored in the law.  Repeal by implication, when the prior and the later act can consistently stand together, is never admitted. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Here there is no irreconcilable conflict, if indeed there be any.  This point seems not to be relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p>It is conceded that this act was in force when the bonds in question were issued.  If so, it was beyond the power of the legislature to repeal it, so far as it concerns the bonds in question, unless some other adequate remedy were substituted in its place. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The third section of the act of 1857 and the twelfth section of the act of 1865 each authorizes the collection of one percent, to be applied to the payment of the interest upon the city debt.  The latter reenacts the former.  The efficacy of this provision is not denied.  The order of the circuit court with respect to this tax was correct.</p>\n<p>The return of the respondents showed no sufficient reason why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue, as was ordered.  The demurrer of the relator was properly sustained.</p>\n<p>It is insisted that the city owes a large amount of other debts, and that if these taxes are collected the other creditors will be entitled to share in the distribution of the proceeds.</p>\n<p>It is not competent for the respondents to make this objection.  When any other creditor complains in a proper proceeding, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 72 U. S. 710</a></p><p> and asks that the funds be marshaled, it will be time enough to consider the subject.</p>\n<p>The counsel for the plaintiffs in error has called our attention, with emphasis and eloquence, to the diminished resources of the city, and the disproportionate magnitude of its debt.  Much as personally we may regret such a state of things, we can give no weight to considerations of this character, when placed in the scale as a counterpoise to the contract, the law, the legal rights of the creditor, and our duty to enforce them.  Such securities occupy the same ground in this Court as all others which are brought before us.  When clothed with legal validity, it is our purpose to sustain them and to give to their holders the benefit of all the remedies to which the law entitles them.  When invalid, we have not hesitated and shall not hesitate to say so.  But we cannot recognize a distinction, unknown to the law, between this and any other class of obligations we may be called upon to enforce.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the circuit court is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/435/case.html">71 U.
