TAYLOR et al.<br/>No. 72-6979. </p><p> Supreme Court of the United States </p></b><p><b> October 15, 1973</b> </p><p> On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nevada. </p><p> The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.</p><p> Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. </p><p> Petitioner was a public school teacher in Nevada. He had taught in the Clark County School District for seven years, and in his present position at one of the district\'s junior high schools for five years. He was notified in March 1971 that his contract would not be renewed for the following school year. The dismissal was upheld by a professional review committee after a hearing, and by by board. In affirming their actions, the Navada Supreme Court relied on the charge of \'unprofessional conduct,\' which was supported solely by certain allegations concerning petitioner\'s views on the State\'s compulsory attendance laws. </p><p> The petitioner does not believe in compulsory attendance laws, and he did not bend his views in the hearing before the committee. He had been quoted as saying that schools are bad for children. But he never aired those views in his classroom, and he was never charged with encouraging his students to be truant. </p><p> We have held that teachers may not \'constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools in which they work.\' Pickering v. Board of Education, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#568">391 U.S. 563, 568</a>, 20 L.ed.2d 811 (1968). There we found that the school board\'s dismissal of a teacher for publishing a letter critical of the board\'s allocation of funds and its handling of a bond issue, was constitutionally impermissible. See also Keyishian v. Board of Regents, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/589/case.html">385 U.S. 589</a> (1967); Shelton v.
