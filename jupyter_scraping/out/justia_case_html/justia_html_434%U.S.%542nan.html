JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 430 U.S. 929 (1977), to decide whether a trial judge (or designated United States Magistrate) who suspends a sentence of commitment and places a youth offender on probation pursuant to \xc2\xa7 5010(a) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act (YCA), 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5005 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed.), may impose a fine, or require restitution, or both, as conditions of probation. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Each of the five petitioners pleaded guilty in a separate proceeding before a United States Magistrate to an offense for which penalties of fine or imprisonment or both are provided.

Crim.Action No. N-750828 (June 25, 1976).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion, No. 76-1905 (Dec. 9, 1976), judgt. order reported at 549 F.2d 799, relying on its earlier decision in <em>United States v. Oliver,</em> 546 F.2d 1096 (1976), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 75632, which had held that imposition of a fine as a condition of probation was consistent with the YCA.  In addition, the per curiam in the instant case stated:  "For the reasons expressed in Oliver, we believe that a requirement of restitution is also consistent."  App. 2.  We agree that, when placing a youth offender on probation under \xc2\xa7 5010(a), the sentencing judge may require restitution, and, when the otherwise applicable penalty provision permits, impose a fine as a condition of probation, and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The YCA is primarily an outgrowth of recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States, <em>see Dorszynski v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html">418 U.

Congress found that, between the ages of 16 and 22,</p>\n<p>"special factors operated to produce habitual criminals.  [Moreover,] then-existing methods of treating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 434 U.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Both the Borstal System and the YCA incorporate three features thought essential to the operation of a successful rehabilitative treatment program:  flexibility in choosing among a variety of treatment settings and programs tailored to individual needs; [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] separation of youth offenders from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 434 U. S. 546</a></p><p> hardened criminals; [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and careful and flexible control of the duration of commitment and of supervised release. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The YCA established the framework for creation of a treatment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 434 U. S. 547</a></p><p> program incorporating these features, and, as an alternative to existing sentencing options, authorized a sentence of commitment to the Attorney General for treatment under the Act.  <em>Dorszynski, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#437">418 U. S. 437</a></span>-440.</p>\n<p>The Act contains four provisions regarding sentencing.  Section 5010(a) provides that "[i]f the court is of the opinion that the youth offender does not need commitment," imposition or execution of sentence might be suspended and the youth offender placed on probation.  Sections 5010(b) and (c) provide that, if the youth is to be committed, the court might "in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law," sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision. Section 5010(d) provides that "[i]f the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c)," the court may sentence the youth offender "under any other applicable penalty provision." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 434 U. S. 548</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A particularly valuable benefit for the offender sentenced under the YCA is the prospect of obtaining a certificate setting aside his conviction.  A certificate automatically issues when a youth committed to the custody of the Attorney General under \xc2\xa7 5010(b) or \xc2\xa7 5010(c) is unconditionally released prior to expiration of the maximum sentence imposed.  18 U.S.C. 5021(a) (1976 ed.).  In 1961, the YCA was amended to extend the benefit of a certificate to youths sentenced to probation under \xc2\xa7 5010(a) when the court unconditionally discharges the youth prior to expiration of the sentence of probation imposed.  Act of Oct. 3, 1961, Pub.L. No. 87-336, 75 Stat. 750 (codified at 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5021(b) (1976 ed.)).</p>\n<p>Petitioners make two arguments in support of their submission that sentencing judges choosing the option under \xc2\xa7 5010(a) of suspending sentence and placing the youth offender on probation may not impose a fine as a condition of probation. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  First, they argue that the sentencing provisions of the YCA are alternatives to other sentencing provisions, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 434 U. S. 549</a></p><p> therefore a substitute for the penalties provided in the statute for violation of which the youth offender was convicted; since \xc2\xa7 5010(a) does not explicitly authorize the imposition of fines, sentencing judges have no authority to impose them when sentencing under that provision.  Second, they argue that fines are necessarily punitive, and their imposition therefore inconsistent with the rehabilitative goals of the YCA.  Neither of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The language of \xc2\xa7 5010(a) neither grants nor withholds the authority to impose fines or orders of restitution.  Another provision of the YCA, however, \xc2\xa7 5023(a), incorporates by reference the authority conferred under the general probation statute to permit such exactions.  Section 5023(a) provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in [the Act] shall limit or affect the power of any court to suspend the imposition or execution of any sentence and place a youth offender on probation or be construed in any wise to amend, repeal, or affect the provisions of chapter 231 [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3651-3656] of this title . . . relative to probation."</p>\n<p>Chapter 231 is the general probation statute and 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3651 (1976 ed.) expressly provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p>"While on probation and among the conditions thereof, the defendant -- "</p>\n<p>"May be required to pay a fine in one or several sums; and"</p>\n<p>"May be required to make restitution or reparation to aggrieved parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had. . . . [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 434 U. S. 550</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners argue, however, that the sentencing provisions contained in \xc2\xa7 5010 are separate and distinct from each other and from any other penalty provision.  Recognizing that \xc2\xa7 5023(a) makes \xc2\xa7 3651 applicable to a \xc2\xa7 5010(a) sentence, they now concede [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] that restitution is a permissible condition of a probationary sentence under \xc2\xa7 5010(a), because \xc2\xa7 3651 directly authorizes restitution without resort to any other penalty provision.  On the other hand, a fine may be imposed under \xc2\xa7 351 only if the penalty provision of the offense under which the youth is convicted so provides. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Thus, a fine is not permissible in conjunction with a \xc2\xa7 510(a) sentence because it requires resort to the offense penalty provision. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 434 U. S. 551</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners\' arguments are refuted by the legislative history of the Act.  The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 5023(a) clearly reveals that Congress intended thereby to preserve to sentencing judges their powers under the general probation statute when sentencing youth offenders to probation under \xc2\xa7 5010(a).  The House Report accompanying S. 2609, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. (1949), the bill which was enacted as the YCA, makes that clear in stating:</p>\n<p>"Under [the bill\'s] provisions, if the court finds that a youth offender does not need treatment, it may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the youth offender on probation.  Thus, the power of the court to grant probation <em>is left undisturbed</em> by the bill."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  H.R.Rep. No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1950).  The same view was expressed during the House hearings on H.R. 2140, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), a bill whose youth corrections provisions were nearly identical to those of S. 2609 introduced in 1949.  Judge Phillips, Chairman of the Subcommittee responsible for drafting model youth correction legislation to be sponsored by the Judicial Conference, emphasized that "[i]t leaves [the probation system] absolutely undisturbed," [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] for the intent of the Judicial Conference in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 434 U. S. 552</a></p><p> sponsoring the bill was to retain the existing options with respect to probation and adult punishment, while simply adding a new option of commitment for treatment.  <em>See</em> 1943 House Hearings 34-37.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5010(b) and 5010(c) buttresses this understanding of the purpose of \xc2\xa7 5023(a).  Those subsections provide that commitment to the custody of the Attorney General is "in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law."  The words "of imprisonment" did not appear in the original bill recommended by the Judicial Conference in 1943. H.R. 2140, <em>supra,</em> tit. III, \xc2\xa7 1(a), reprinted in 1943 House Hearings 3.  Addition of the words "of imprisonment" was recommended in a letter from Attorney General Biddle to the House Subcommittee.  That letter, in which, according to the letter, members of the Judicial Conference concurred and which was read into the record at the Subcommittee hearings, explained the reason for adding the words "of imprisonment" as follows:</p>\n<p>"Sentence of the youth offender to the custody of the Authority should be a permissible alternative to a penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law <em>but not to a penalty of a fine.</em>  It should, moreover, be possible for the court both to impose a fine and to sentence the offender to the custody of the Authority, where the law provides both fine and imprisonment as the penalties that may be imposed."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Letter from Francis Biddle to Francis E. Walter (June 7, 1943), reprinted in 1943 House Hearings 110-111.  When introduced, S. 2609, <em>supra,</em> which was enacted into law, contained the words "of imprisonment" recommended by Attorney General Biddle.  This history of subsection (b) demonstrates that Congress added the words "of imprisonment" in order to preserve the preexisting authority of judges to impose a fine in conjunction with commitment when the applicable penalty provision provided for a penalty of fine and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 434 U. S. 553</a></p><p> imprisonment.  The fact that Congress contemplated that a sentence under subsections (b) and (c) would permit resort to the otherwise applicable penalty provision as authority for imposition of a fine, militates in favor of the same construction with respect to subsection (a).  There is no reason to believe that Congress directed that the subsections should be treated differently in that respect. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>We conclude that Congress\' purpose in adopting \xc2\xa7 5023(a), was to assure that a sentence under \xc2\xa7 510(a) would not displace the authority conferred by \xc2\xa7 3651 to impose fines and orders of restitution as conditions of probation.</p>\n<p>With respect to petitioners\' second argument, that fines are punitive and their imposition therefore inconsistent with the rehabilitative goals of the YCA, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] it is sufficient answer that Congress expressed its judgment to the contrary in preserving the authority of sentencing judges to impose them as a condition of probation.  Moreover, we are not persuaded that fines should necessarily be regarded as other than rehabilitative when imposed as a condition of probation.  There is much force in the observation of the District Court:</p>\n<p>"[A] fine could be consistent . . . with the rehabilitative intent of the Act.  By employing this alternative [a fine </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 434 U. S. 554</a></p><p> and probation], the sentencing judge could assure that the youthful offender would not receive the harsh treatment of incarceration, while assuring that the offender accepts responsibility for his transgression.  The net result of such treatment would be an increased respect for the law and would, in many cases, stimulate the young person to mature into a good law-abiding citizen."</p>\n<p>App. 337.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Courts of Appeals have reached conflicting conclusions concerning whether a fine is a permissible condition of a \xc2\xa7 5010(a) sentence.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, <em>United States v. Bowens,</em> 514 F.2d 440 (1975); <em>United States v. Mollet,</em> 510 F.2d 625 (1975), in disagreement with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the instant case, has held that imposition of a fine is improper.  The Ninth Circuit, <em>United States v. Hayes,</em> 474 F.2d 965 (1973), and the Fifth Circuit, <em>Cramer v. Wise,</em> 501 F.2d 959 (1974), have held that a fine is not permissible in conjunction with a \xc2\xa7 5010(b) sentence.  With respect to orders of restitution, however, the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the question, the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Hix,</em> 545 F.2d 1247 (1976), and the Third Circuit in <em>United States v. Buechler,</em> 557 F.2d 1002 (1977), agree with the Court of Appeals in this case that an order of restitution properly may be imposed in conjunction with a sentence under \xc2\xa7 5010(a).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Rice, a young adult, was sentenced under \xc2\xa7 5010(a) pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4216 (1976 ed.), which permits sentencing of young adult offenders under the YCA in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> S.Rep.

Mr. Bennett said:</p>\n<p>"From the hundreds of cases of this type which have come across my desk, I have formed the conclusion that, in the task of correcting the offender, the crucial element is that of time.  Attitudes, habits, interests, standards cannot be changed overnight.  Training in work habits and skills requires time.  Once the individual has received the maximum benefit from the institutional program, however, it is just as important that his release to the community be effected promptly.  In the case of each person confined, there comes a period when he has his best prospects of making good in the community.  His release should occur at this time.  If he is released earlier, he will not be ready for the task of establishing himself; if later, he may have become bitter, unsure of himself, or jittery like the athlete who is overtrained."</p>\n<p>"Rarely does a day go by in one of our institutions for younger offenders without a youth being received whose sentence is either far too long or far too short, if the institution is to carry out its objective of correctional treatment."</p>\n<p>Correctional System For Youth Offenders:  Hearings on S. 1114 and S. 2609 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 27 (1949).</p>\n<p>Congress provided the Bureau with the flexibility sought by providing in \xc2\xa7 5017 for flexible commitment periods responsive to individual needs and progress.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 5010 provides in full:</p>\n<p>"(a) If the court is of the opinion that the youth offender does not need commitment, it may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the youth offender on probation."</p>\n<p>"(b) If the court shall find that a convicted person is a youth offender, and the offense is punishable by imprisonment under applicable provisions of law other than this subsection, the court may, in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law, sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision pursuant to this chapter until discharged by the Commission as provided in section 5017(c) of this chapter; or"</p>\n<p>"(c) If the court shall find that the youth offender may not be able to derive maximum benefit from treatment by the Commission prior to the expiration of six years from the date of conviction it may, in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law, sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision pursuant to this chapter for any further period that may be authorized by law for the offense or offenses of which he stands convicted or until discharged by the Commission as provided in section 5017(d) of this chapter."</p>\n<p>"(d) If the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c), then the court may sentence the youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision."</p>\n<p>"(e) If the court desires additional information as to whether a youth offender will derive benefit from treatment under subsections (b) or (c) it may order that he be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for observation and study at an appropriate classification center or agency.

In their brief, petitioners argued that restitution is <em>not</em> a permissible condition of probation, however, because</p>\n<p>"[i]t is . . . a real concern that sentencing courts may use restitution as a vehicle to accomplish that which is not permitted by the statute.  Further, since the Federal Youth Corrections Act is an exclusive sentencing statute, any sentence beyond the limits of the Act is improper."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  During oral argument, petitioners expressly abandoned this argument, conceding that restitution is a permissible condition of probation because it is directly authorized by \xc2\xa7 3651.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  If that argument is based on a perceived distinction between the treatment needs of the two "classes" of youth offenders, it is without support in the history of the Act, and conflicts with the Act\'s emphasis on flexibility and individualization of treatment.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  If the premise of the argument is that those sentenced to commitment merit a fine as punishment, while those sentenced to probation do not, it conflicts with the basic purpose of the Act to accord youth offenders rehabilitative treatment rather than retributive punishment.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See ibid.</em> and accompanying text.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
