RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">HARDT <em>v</em>. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE CO.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x93448.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 26, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 24, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">After medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she filed for long-term disability benefits under her employer\xe2\x80\x99s long-term disability plan.  Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt sued respondent Reliance, her employer\xe2\x80\x99s disability insurance carrier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits claim.  The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, finding that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical information, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.  Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that it found \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the record that she was totally disabled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its approach.  The court therefore remanded to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act on Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s application, or else the court would enter judgment in Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt benefits.  Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), a fee-shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee and costs \xe2\x80\xa6 to either party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Granting the motion, the District Court applied the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s framework governing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee requests in ERISA cases, concluding, <em>inter alia,</em> that Hardt had attained the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d status.  The Fourth Circuit vacated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that she qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d under the rule set forth in <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</em> v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/598/index.html">532 U. S. 598</a>, 604, that a fee claimant is a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d only if he has obtained an \xe2\x80\x9cenforceable judgmen[t] on the merits\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt-ordered consent decre[e].\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  The court reasoned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment on the merits.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0A fee claimant need not be a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d to be eligible for an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees award under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).  Interpreting the section to require a party to attain that status is contrary to \xc2\xa71132(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s plain text.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d do not appear in the provision.  Nor does anything else in \xc2\xa71132(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text purport to limit the availability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cto either</em> party.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  That language contrasts sharply with \xc2\xa71132(g)(2), which governs the availability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer contributions to a multiemployer plan.  In such cases, only plaintiffs who obtain \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment in favor of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d may seek attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  \xc2\xa71132(g)(2)(D).  The contrast between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in ERISA cases.  Because Congress failed to include in \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) an express \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision adding that term of art to the statute more closely resembles \xe2\x80\x9cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing] one.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pasquantino</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/349/index.html">544 U. S. 349</a>, 359.

S. 680</a>, 694.  The bedrock principle known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of reference: Each litigant pays his own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.  <em>E.g., id., </em>at 683\xe2\x80\x93686.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d precedents do not govern here because that term of art does not appear in \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).  Instead, the Court interprets \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees based on other criteria.  <em>Ruckelshaus,</em> which considered a statute authorizing a fees award if the court \xe2\x80\x9cdetermines that such an award is appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(f), is the principal case in that category.  Applying that decision\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive approach to 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), the Court first looks to \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of the section,\xe2\x80\x9d 463 U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cin its discretion \xe2\x80\xa6 to either party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ruckelshaus</em> also lays down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discretion.  Because here, as in the statute in <em>Ruckelshaus</em>, Congress failed to indicate clearly that it \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and intuitive notions of fairness,\xe2\x80\x9d 463 U. S., at 686, a fees claimant must show \xe2\x80\x9csome degree of success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d before a court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), see <em>id.</em>, at 694.  Hardt has satisfied that standard.  Though she failed to win summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that it was inclined to rule in her favor.  She also obtained the remand order, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, reversed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought.  Accordingly, the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award Hardt attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">336 Fed.

Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with carpal tunnel syndrome.  Because surgeries on both her wrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working in January 2003.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability benefits from Dan River\xe2\x80\x99s Group Long-Term Disability Insurance Program Plan (Plan).  Dan River administers the Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a claimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and underwrites any benefits awarded.  Reliance provisionally approved Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s claim, telling her that final approval hinged on her performance in a functional capacities evaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal tunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in October 2003.  The evaluator summarized Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s medical history, observed her resulting physical limitations, and ultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount of sedentary work.  Based on this finding, Reliance concluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the meaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability benefits.  Hardt filed an administrative appeal.  Reliance reversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally disabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore entitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt began experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves, including tingling, pain, and numbness.  One of her physicians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condition that increased her pain and decreased her physical capabilities over the ensuing months.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Administration for disability benefits under the Social Security Act.  Her application included questionnaires completed by two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms and stated the doctors\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Hardt could not return to full gainful employment because of her neuropathy and other ailments.  In February 2005, the Social Security Administration granted Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s application and awarded her disability benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About two months later, Reliance told Hardt that her Plan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month period.  Reliance explained that under the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms, only individuals who are \xe2\x80\x9ctotally disabled from all occupations\xe2\x80\x9d were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that, based on its review of Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s records, Hardt was not \xe2\x80\x9ctotally disabled\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by the Plan.  Reliance also demanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset the disability benefits she had received from the Social Security Administration.  (The Plan contains a provision coordinating benefits with Social Security payments.)  Hardt paid Reliance the offset.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hardt then filed another administrative appeal.  She gave Reliance all of her medical records, the questionnaires she had submitted to the Social Security Administration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her physicians.  Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this material with another functional capacities evaluation.  When Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation, it did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuropathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt had been diagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December 2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January 2006.  The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid because Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were \xe2\x80\x9csubmaximal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 37a.  One evaluator recorded that Hardt \xe2\x80\x9crefused multiple tests \xe2\x80\xa6 for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation, Reliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation counselor to help it resolve Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s administrative appeal.  The physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he reviewed some, but not all, of Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s medical records.  Based on that review, the physician produced a report in which he opined that Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s health was expected to improve.  His report, however, did not mention Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s pain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s attending physicians had completed as part of her application for Social Security benefits.  The vocational rehabilitation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study (based on Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s health in 2003) that identified eight employment opportunities suitable for Hardt.  After reviewing the physician\xe2\x80\x99s report, the labor market study, and the results of the 2003 functional capacities evaluation, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s benefits was correct.  It advised Hardt of this decision in March 2006.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt sued Reliance in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  She alleged that Reliance violated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long-term disability benefits.  See \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court first rejected Reliance\xe2\x80\x99s request for summary judgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that \xe2\x80\x9cReliance\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny benefits was based on incomplete information.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a.  Most prominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations to which Hardt had submitted had \xe2\x80\x9cassessed the impact of neuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In addition, the reviewing physician\xe2\x80\x99s report \xe2\x80\x9cwas itself incomplete\xe2\x80\x9d; the basis for the physician\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmedical conclusions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and the physician had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to cite any medical evidence to support his conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 43a, or \xe2\x80\x9cto address the treating physicians\xe2\x80\x99 contradictory medical findings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 44a.  The court also found that Reliance had \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly rejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 45a, and had \xe2\x80\x9cfurther ignored the substantial amount of pain medication Ms. Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s treating physicians had prescribed to her,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 46a.  Accordingly, the court thought it \xe2\x80\x9cclear that Reliance\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny Ms. Hardt long-term disability benefits was not based on substantial evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 47a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court then denied Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment, which contended that Reliance\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law.  In so doing, however, the court found \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the record that \xe2\x80\x9cMs. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to her neuropathy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 48a.  Although it was \xe2\x80\x9cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s favor,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be unwise to take this step without first giving Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, a remand to Reliance was warranted because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case presents one of those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed to comply with the ERISA guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cMs. Hardt did not get the kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, the court instructed \xe2\x80\x9cReliance to act on Ms. Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s application by adequately considering all the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d within 30 days; \xe2\x80\x9c[o]therwise,\xe2\x80\x9d it warned, \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment will be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reliance did as instructed.  After conducting that\nreview, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term disability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hardt then moved for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).  The District Court assessed her motion under the three-step framework that governed fee requests in ERISA cases under Circuit precedent.  At step one of that framework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prevailing party.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15a\xe2\x80\x9316a (quoting <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc.</em>, 115 F.\xc2\xa03d 1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</em> v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/598/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/598/index.html">532 U. S. 598</a>, 603 (2001)).  If the fee claimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds to step two and \xe2\x80\x9cdetermin[es] whether an award of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees is appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d by examining \xe2\x80\x9cfive factors.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.  Finally, if those five factors suggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court \xe2\x80\x9cmust review the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and costs requested and limit them to a reasonable amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 17a (citing <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Eckerhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/424/index.html">461 U. S. 424</a>, 433 (1983)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that framework, the District Court granted Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  It first concluded that Hardt was a prevailing party because the court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order \xe2\x80\x9csanctioned a material change in the legal relationship of the parties by ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to which [Hardt] was entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 22a.

As in all such cases, we begin by analyzing the statutory language, \xe2\x80\x9cassum[ing] that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gross</em> v. <em>FBL Financial Services, Inc.</em>, 557 U.

In such cases, only plaintiffs who obtain \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment in favor of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d may seek attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  \xc2\xa71132(g)(2)(D).  The contrast between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in ERISA cases.  Because Congress failed to include in \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) an express \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d limit on the availability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting statute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely resembles \xe2\x80\x9cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing] one.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pasquantino</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/349/index.html">544 U.

We therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d to be eligible for an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees award under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider the circumstances under which a court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees pursuant to \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cOur basic point of reference\xe2\x80\x9d when considering the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees<em> </em>is the bedrock principle known as the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98American Rule\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d: Each litigant pays his own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.  <em>Ruckelshaus</em>, 463 U.

Statutory changes to this rule take various forms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees only to a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Others permit a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially prevailing\xe2\x80\x9d party\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] or a \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d litigant\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] to obtain fees.  Still others authorize district courts to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees where \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] or simply vest district courts with \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d to award fees.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule, we have most often considered statutes containing an express \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Texas State Teachers Assn.</em> v. <em>Garland Independent School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/782/index.html">489 U. S. 782</a>, 792\xe2\x80\x93793 (1989); <em>Farrar</em> v. <em>Hobby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/103/index.html">506 U.

S. 74</a>, 82\xe2\x80\x9386 (2007).  Our \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d precedents, however, do not govern the availability of fees awards under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), because this provision does not limit the availability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939; see also <em>Gross</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts \xe2\x80\x9cconducting statutory interpretation \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Federal Express Corp.</em> v. <em>Holowecki</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/389/index.html">552 U.

There, the Court interpreted \xc2\xa7307(f) of the Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever it determines that such an award is appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(f).  We began by noting that because nothing in \xc2\xa7307(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text \xe2\x80\x9cclear[ly] show[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S., at 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating success to be eligible for a fees award under that section, <em>id.</em>, at 686.  We then concluded that by using the less stringent \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever \xe2\x80\xa6 appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d standard instead of the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d standard, Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards from prevailing parties to <em>partially prevailing </em>parties\xe2\x80\x94parties achieving <em>some success</em>, even if not major success.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.</em>, at 688.  We thus held \xe2\x80\x9cthat, absent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not \xe2\x80\x98appropriate\xe2\x80\x99 for a federal court to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa7307(f).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 694.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the interpretive approach we employed in <em>Ruckelshaus </em>to \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), we first look to \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of the section,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at  682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cin its discretion \xe2\x80\xa6 to either party,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).  Statutes vesting judges with such broad discretion are well known in the law, particularly in the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees context.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> n. 7, <em>supra;</em> see also <em>Perdue</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally well known, however, is the fact that a \xe2\x80\x9cjudge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion is not unlimited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with Circuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to guide its discretion in deciding whether to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).  See <em>supra</em>, at 6, and n.\xc2\xa01.  Because these five factors bear no obvious relation to \xc2\xa71132(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they are not required for channeling a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion when awarding fees under this section.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, <em>Ruckelshaus</em> lays down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising the discretion that \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) grants.  As in the statute at issue in <em>Ruckelshaus</em>, Congress failed to indicate clearly in \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) that it \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and intuitive notions of fairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U. S., at 686.  Accordingly, a fees claimant must show \xe2\x80\x9csome degree of success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d before a court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 694.  A claimant does not satisfy that requirement by achieving \xe2\x80\x9ctrivial success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpurely procedural victor[y],\xe2\x80\x9d but does satisfy it if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation some success on the merits without conducting a \xe2\x80\x9clengthy inquir[y] into the question whether a particular party\xe2\x80\x99s success was \xe2\x80\x98substantial\xe2\x80\x99 or occurred on a \xe2\x80\x98central issue.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 688, n.\xc2\xa09.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should govern fee requests under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1), see Brief for Respondent 13\xe2\x80\x9331, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.  Specifically, Reliance contends that a court order remanding an ERISA claim for further consideration can never constitute \xe2\x80\x9csome success on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d even if such a remand results in an award of benefits.  See <em>id.,</em> at 34\xe2\x80\x9350.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reliance\xe2\x80\x99s argument misses the point, given the facts of this case.  Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan administrator has failed to comply with the ERISA guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ms. Hardt did not get the kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable law.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71133(2), 29 CFR \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931(h) (2009).  Although Hardt failed to win summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless found \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling evidence that Ms. Hardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,\xe2\x80\x9d and stated that it was \xe2\x80\x9cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s favor\xe2\x80\x9d on her benefits claim, but declined to do so before \xe2\x80\x9cfirst giving Reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its\xe2\x80\x9d statutorily mandated \xe2\x80\x9cfull and fair review\xe2\x80\x9d of that claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71133(2).  Hardt thus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance \xe2\x80\x9cto act on Ms. Hardt\xe2\x80\x99s application by adequately considering all the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d within 30 days; \xe2\x80\x9c[o]therwise, judgment will be issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review, and consistent with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal, Reliance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits she sought.  App. 120a\xe2\x80\x93123a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more than \xe2\x80\x9ctrivial success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpurely procedural victory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, she has achieved \xe2\x80\x9csome success on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d and the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award Hardt attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in this case.  Because these conclusions resolve this case, we need not decide today whether a remand order, without more, constitutes \xe2\x80\x9csome success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient to make a party eligible for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71132(g)(1).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0These factors are: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98(1) the degree of opposing parties\xe2\x80\x99 culpability or bad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 positions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting <em>Quesinberry</em> v. <em>Life Ins.

S. 680</a> (1983), should be given any special weight in the interpretation of this\xe2\x80\x94or any other\xe2\x80\x94different statutory provision.  The outcome in that closely divided case turned, to a significant extent, on a judgment about how to read the legislative history of the provision in question.  Compare <em>id.,</em> at 686\xe2\x80\x93693, with <em>id.,</em> at 703\xe2\x80\x93706 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  I agree with the Court in this case that 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(g)(1) does not impose a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d requirement; I agree, further, that the District Court acted well within its discretion in awarding attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to this petitioner.  But I would examine the text, structure, and history of any other federal statute authorizing an award of fees before concluding that Congress intended the same approach under that statute as under this one.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
