During the transfer, Madigan assaulted Blake, punching him several times in the face.  Blake reported the incident to a corrections officer, who referred the matter to the Maryland prison system\xe2\x80\x99s Internal Investigative Unit (IIU).  The IIU, which has authority under state law to investigate employee misconduct, issued a report condemning Madigan\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  Blake subsequently sued both guards under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging excessive force and failure to take protective action.  A jury found Madigan liable.  But Ross raised (as an affirmative defense) the exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), which demands that an inmate exhaust \xe2\x80\x9csuch administrative remedies as are available\xe2\x80\x9d before bringing suit to challenge prison conditions.  \xc2\xa71997e(a).  Ross argued that Blake had filed suit without first following the prison\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed procedures for obtaining an administrative remedy, while Blake argued that the IIU investigation was a substitute for those procedures.  The District Court sided with Ross and dismissed the suit.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d can excuse a failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements\xe2\x80\x94particularly where the inmate reasonably, even though mistakenly, believed he had sufficiently exhausted his remedies.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">1. The Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s unwritten \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception is inconsistent with the text and history of the PLRA.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a) The PLRA speaks in unambiguous terms, providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o action shall be brought\xe2\x80\x9d absent exhaustion of available administrative remedies.  \xc2\xa71997e(a).  Aside from one significant qualifier\xe2\x80\x94that administrative remedies must indeed be \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the text suggests no limits on an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to exhaust.  That mandatory language means a court may not excuse a failure to exhaust, even to take \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d into account.  When it comes to statutory exhaustion provisions, courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them to.  So mandatory exhaustion statutes like the PLRA establish mandatory exhaustion regimes, foreclosing judicial discretion.  See, <i>e.g., McNeil</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 106\n.  Time and again, this Court has rejected every attempt to deviate from the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s textual mandate.  See <i>Booth </i>v. <i>Churner</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 731\n; <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Nussle</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516\n; <i>Woodford</i> v. <i>Ngo</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n.  All those precedents rebut the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d excuse for non-exhaustion.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) The PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s history further underscores the mandatory nature of its exhaustion regime.  The PLRA replaced a largely discretionary exhaustion scheme, see <i>Nussle,</i> 534 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 523, removing the conditions that administrative remedies be \xe2\x80\x9cplain, speedy, and effective,\xe2\x80\x9d that they satisfy federal minimum standards, and that exhaustion be \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate and in the interests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 exception, if applied broadly, would resurrect that discretionary regime, in which a court could look to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust.  And if the exception were confined to cases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the meaning of a prison\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedures, it would reintroduce the requirement that the remedial process be \xe2\x80\x9cplain.\xe2\x80\x9d  When Congress amends legislation, courts must \xe2\x80\x9cpresume it intends [the change] to have real and substantial effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stone</i> v. <i>INS</i>,\n\n514 U. S. 386\n.  But the Court of Appeals acted as though no amendment had taken place.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the prison\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consideration below.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a) Blake\xe2\x80\x99s suit may yet be viable.  The PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion.  Under \xc2\xa71997e(a), an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to exhaust hinges on the \xe2\x80\x9cavailab[ility]\xe2\x80\x9d of administrative remedies.  A prisoner is thus required to exhaust only those grievance procedures that are \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of use\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain \xe2\x80\x9csome relief for the action complained of.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Booth</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 738.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">As relevant here, there are three kinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy, although officially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain relief.  First, an administrative procedure is unavailable when it operates as a simple dead end\xe2\x80\x94with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates.  Next, an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, some mechanism exists to provide relief, but no ordinary prisoner can navigate it.  And finally, a grievance process is rendered unavailable when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of it through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) The facts of this case raise questions about whether, given these principles, Blake had an \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d administrative remedy to exhaust.  Ross\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion defense rests on Blake\xe2\x80\x99s failure to seek relief through Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP) process, which begins with a grievance to the warden.  That process is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in the State\xe2\x80\x99s prisons.  But Maryland separately maintains the IIU to look into charges of prison staff misconduct, and the IIU did just that here.  Blake urged in the courts below that once the IIU commences such an inquiry, a prisoner cannot obtain relief through the ARP process.  And in this Court, the parties have lodged additional materials relating to the interaction between the IIU and the ARP.  Both sides\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, although scattershot and in need of further review, lend some support to Blake\xe2\x80\x99s account.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Blake\xe2\x80\x99s filings include many administrative dispositions indicating that Maryland wardens routinely dismiss ARP grievances as procedurally improper when parallel IIU investigations are pending.  In addition, Blake has submitted briefs of the Maryland attorney general specifically recognizing that administrative practice.  And Ross\xe2\x80\x99s own submissions offer some confirmation of Blake\xe2\x80\x99s view: Ross does not identify a single case in which a warden considered the merits of an ARP grievance while an IIU inquiry was underway.  On remand, the Fourth Circuit should perform a thorough review of such materials, and then address whether the remedies Blake did not exhaust were \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d under the legal principles set out here.

The court below adopted an unwritten \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception to that provision, permitting some prisoners to pursue litigation even when they have failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.  Today, we reject that freewheeling approach to exhaustion as inconsistent with the PLRA.  But we also underscore that statute\xe2\x80\x99s built-in exception to the exhaustion requirement: A prisoner need not exhaust remedies if they are not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The briefs and other submissions filed in this case suggest the possibility that the aggrieved inmate lacked an available administrative remedy.  That issue remains open for consideration on remand, in light of the principles stated below.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent Shaidon Blake is an inmate in a Maryland prison.  On June 21, 2007, two guards\xe2\x80\x94James Madigan and petitioner Michael Ross\xe2\x80\x94undertook to move him from his regular cell to the facility\xe2\x80\x99s segregation unit.  According to Blake\xe2\x80\x99s version of the facts, Ross handcuffed him and held him by the arm as they left the cell; Madigan followed close behind.  Near the top of a flight of stairs, Madigan shoved Blake in the back.  Ross told Madigan he had Blake under control, and the three continued walking.  At the bottom of the stairs, Madigan pushed Blake again and then punched him four times in the face, driving his head into the wall.  After a brief pause, Madigan hit Blake one last time.  Ross kept hold of Blake throughout the assault.  And when the blows subsided, Ross helped Madigan pin Blake to the ground until additional officersarrived.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Later that day, Blake reported the assault to a senior corrections officer.  That officer thought Madigan at fault, and so referred the incident to the Maryland prison system\xe2\x80\x99s Internal Investigative Unit (IIU).  Under state law, the IIU has authority to investigate allegations of employee misconduct, including the use of \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Codeof Md. Regs., tit. 12, \xc2\xa711.01.05(A)(3) (2006).  After conducting a year-long inquiry into the beating, the IIU issued a final report condemning Madigan\xe2\x80\x99s actions, while making no findings with respect to Ross.  See App. 191\xe2\x80\x93195.  Madigan resigned to avoid being fired.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Blake subsequently sued both guards under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that Madigan had used unjustifiable force and that Ross had failed to take protective action.  The claim against Madigan went to a jury, which awarded Blake a judgment of $50,000.  But unlike Madigan, Ross raised the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement as an affirmative defense, contending that Blake had brought suit without first following the prison\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed procedures for obtaining an administrative remedy.  As set out in Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Inmate Handbook, that process\xe2\x80\x94called, not very fancifully, the Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP)\xe2\x80\x94begins with a formal grievance to the prison\xe2\x80\x99s warden; it may also involve appeals to the Commissioner of Correction and then the Inmate Grievance Office (IGO).  See Maryland Div. of Correction, Inmate Handbook 30\xe2\x80\x9331 (2007).  Blake acknowledged that he had not sought a remedy through the ARP\xe2\x80\x94because, he thought, the IIU investigation served as a substitute for that otherwise standard process.  The District Court rejected that explanation and dismissed the suit, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe commencement of an internal investigation does not relieve prisoners from the [PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s] exhaustion requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Blake</i> v. <i>Maynard</i>, No. 8:09\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x932367 (D Md., Nov. 14, 2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 2012 WL 5568940, *5.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed in a divided decision.  Stating that the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexhaustion requirement is not absolute,\xe2\x80\x9d the court adopted an extra-textual exception originally formulated by the Second Circuit.  787 F.\xc2\xa03d 693, 698 (2015).  Repeated the Court of Appeals: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here are certain \xe2\x80\x98special circumstances\xe2\x80\x99 in which, though administrative remedies may have been available[,] the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements may nevertheless have been justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Giano </i>v.<i> Goord</i>, 380 F.\xc2\xa03d 670, 676 (CA2 2004)).  In particular, that was true when a prisoner \xe2\x80\x9creasonably\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even though mistakenly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbelieved that he had sufficiently exhausted his remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  787 F.\xc2\xa03d, at<i> </i>695.  And Blake, the court concluded, fit within that exception because he reasonably thought that \xe2\x80\x9cthe IIU\xe2\x80\x99s investigation removed his complaint from the typical ARP process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 700.  Judge Agee dissented, stating that the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory exhaustion requirement is not \xe2\x80\x9camenable\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udge-made exceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 703.  This Court granted certiorari.  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dispute here concerns whether the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement, \xc2\xa71997e(a), bars Blake\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  Statutory text and history alike foreclose the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception to that mandate.  But Blake\xe2\x80\x99s suit may yet be viable.  Under the PLRA, a prisoner need exhaust only \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d administrative remedies.  And Blake\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the prison\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consideration below.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Statutory interpretation, as we always say, begins with the text, see, <i>e.g., Hardt</i> v. <i>Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 242,\n251 (2010)\n\xe2\x80\x94but here following that approach at once distances us from the Court of Appeals.  As Blake acknowledges, that court made no attempt to ground its analysis in the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s language.  See 787 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 697\xe2\x80\x93698; Brief for Respondent 47\xe2\x80\x9348, n.\xc2\xa020 (labeling the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule an \xe2\x80\x9cextra-textual exception to the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that failure makes a difference, because the statute speaks in unambiguous terms opposite to what the Fourth Circuit said.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 1997e(a) provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have often observed, that language is \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d: An inmate \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d bring \xe2\x80\x9cno action\xe2\x80\x9d (or said more conversationally, may not bring any action) absent exhaustion of available administrative remedies.  <i>Woodford </i>v. <i>Ngo</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81,\n85 (2006)\n; accord, <i>Jones </i>v. <i>Bock</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 199,\n211 (2007)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA\xe2\x80\x9d).  As later discussed, that edict contains one significant qualifier: the remedies must indeed be \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to the prisoner.  See <i>infra</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  But aside from that exception, the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s text suggests no limits on an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to exhaust\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of any \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And that mandatory language means a court may not excuse a failure to exhaust, even to take such circumstances into account.  See <i>Miller</i> v. <i>French</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327,\n337 (2000)\n (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he mandatory \xe2\x80\x98shall\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d).  No doubt, judge-made exhaustion doctrines, even if flatly stated at first, remain amenable to judge-made exceptions.  See <i>McKart</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185,\n193 (1969)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is, like most judicial doctrines, subject to numerous exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d).  But a statutory exhaustion provision stands on a different footing.  There, Congress sets the rules\xe2\x80\x94and courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them to.  For that reason, mandatory exhaustion statutes like the PLRA establish mandatory exhaustion regimes, foreclosing judicial discretion.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>McNeil</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 106,\n111,\n113 (1993)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not free to rewrite the statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d when Congress has strictly \xe2\x80\x9cbar[red] claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies\xe2\x80\x9d).  Time and again, this Court has taken such statutes at face value\xe2\x80\x94refusing to add unwritten limits onto their rigorous textual requirements.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>id.,</i> at 111; <i>Shalala</i> v. <i>Illinois Council on Long Term Care</i>, <i>Inc</i>.,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9314 (2000); see also 2 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \xc2\xa715.3, p. 1241 (5th ed. 2010) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have taken just that approach in construing the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion provision\xe2\x80\x94rejecting every attempt to deviate (as the Fourth Circuit did here) from its textual mandate.  In <i>Booth </i>v. <i>Churner</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 731 (2001)\n, for example, the prisoner argued that exhaustion was not necessary because he wanted a type of relief that the administrative process did not provide.  But \xc2\xa71997e(a), we replied, made no distinctions based on the particular \xe2\x80\x9cforms of relief sought and offered,\xe2\x80\x9d and that legislative judgment must control: We would not read \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where Congress has provided otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 741, n.\xc2\xa06.  The next year, in <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Nussle</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516,\n520 (2002)\n, the Court rejected a proposal to carve out excessive-force claims (like Blake\xe2\x80\x99s) from the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion regime, viewing that approach too as inconsistent with the uncompromising statutory text.  And most recently, in <i>Woodford</i>, we turned aside a requested exception for constitutional claims.  548 U. S., at 91, n.\xc2\xa02.  Our explanation was familiar: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are interpreting and applying\xe2\x80\x9d not a judge-made doctrine but a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore must honor Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice.  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  All those precedents rebut the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 adoption of a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d excuse for non-exhaustion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So too, the history of the PLRA underscores the mandatory nature of its exhaustion regime.  Section \xc2\xa71997e(a)\xe2\x80\x99s precursor, enacted in the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), \xc2\xa77,\n\n94Stat.\n352 (1980), was a \xe2\x80\x9cweak exhaustion provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Woodford</i>, 548 U. S., at 84.  Under CRIPA, a court would require exhaustion only if a State provided \xe2\x80\x9cplain, speedy, and effective\xe2\x80\x9d remedies meeting federal minimum standards\xe2\x80\x94and even then, only if the court believed exhaustion \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate and in the interests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77(a),\n\n94Stat.\n352.  That statutory scheme made exhaustion \xe2\x80\x9cin large part discretionary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nussle</i>, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 523.  And for that reason (among others), CRIPA proved inadequate to stem the then-rising tide of prisoner litigation.  In enacting the PLRA, Congress thus substituted an \xe2\x80\x9cinvigorated\xe2\x80\x9d exhaustion provision.  <i>Woodford</i>, 548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 84.  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]iffer[ing] markedly from its predecessor,\xe2\x80\x9d the new \xc2\xa71997e(a) removed the conditions that administrative remedies be \xe2\x80\x9cplain, speedy, and effective\xe2\x80\x9d and that they satisfy minimum standards.  <i>Nussle</i>, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 524.  Still more, the PLRA prevented a court from deciding that exhaustion would be unjust or inappropriate in a given case.  As described earlier, see <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, all inmates must now exhaust all available remedies: \xe2\x80\x9cExhaustion is no longer left to the discretion of the district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Woodford</i>, 548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s history (just like its text) thus refutes a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception to its rule of exhaustion.  That approach, if applied broadly, would resurrect CRIPA\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, in which a court could look to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust available remedies.  But as we have observed, such wide-ranging discretion \xe2\x80\x9cis now a thing of the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Booth</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 739.  And the conflict with the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s history (as again with its text) becomes scarcely less stark if the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s exception is confined, as the court may have intended, to cases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the meaning of a prison\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedures.  Understood that way, the exception reintroduces CRIPA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the remedial process be \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, not subject to any reasonable misunderstanding or disagreement.  \xc2\xa77(a),\n\n94Stat.\n352.  When Congress amends legislation, courts must \xe2\x80\x9cpresume it intends [the change] to have real and substantial effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stone</i> v. <i>INS</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386,\n397 (1995)\n.  The Court of Appeals instead acted as though the amendment\xe2\x80\x94from a largely permissive to a mandatory exhaustion regime\xe2\x80\x94had not taken place.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Yet our rejection of the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception does not end this case\xe2\x80\x94because the PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion.  Under \xc2\xa71997e(a), the exhaustion requirement hinges on the \xe2\x80\x9cavailab[ility]\xe2\x80\x9d of administrative remedies: An inmate, that is, must exhaust available remedies, but need not exhaust unavailable ones.  And that limitation on an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s duty to exhaust\xe2\x80\x94although significantly different from the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d test or the old CRIPA standard\xe2\x80\x94has real content.  As we explained in <i>Booth</i>, the ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 and that which \xe2\x80\x98is accessible or may be obtained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U. S., at 737\xe2\x80\x93738 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 150 (1993)); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 142 (2d ed. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9csuitable or ready for use\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 Oxford English Dictionary 812 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being made use of, at one\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, within one\xe2\x80\x99s reach\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 135 (6th ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cuseable\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cpresent or ready for immediate use\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, an inmate is required to exhaust those, but only those, grievance procedures that are \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of use\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain \xe2\x80\x9csome relief for the action complained of.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Booth</i>,<i> </i>532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 738.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To state that standard, of course, is just to begin; courts in this and other cases must apply it to the real-world workings of prison grievance systems.  Building on our own and lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions, we note as relevant here three kinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy, although officially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain relief.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\xe2\x80\x9329 (Solicitor General as <i>amicus curiae</i> acknowledging these three kinds of unavailability).  Given prisons\xe2\x80\x99 own incentives to maintain functioning remedial processes, we expect that these circumstances will not often arise.  See <i>Woodford</i>, 548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 102.<i> </i>But when one (or more) does, an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s duty to exhaust \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d remedies does not come into play.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, as <i>Booth </i>made clear, an administrative procedure is unavailable when (despite what regulations or guidance materials may promise) it operates as a simple dead end\xe2\x80\x94with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates.  See 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 736, 738.  Suppose, for example, that a prison handbook directs inmates to submit their grievances to a particular administrative office\xe2\x80\x94but in practice that office disclaims the capacity to consider those petitions.  The procedure is not then \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of use\xe2\x80\x9d for the pertinent purpose.  In <i>Booth</i>\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9c[S]ome redress for a wrong is presupposed by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirement\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d remedy; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief,\xe2\x80\x9d the inmate has \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to exhaust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 736, and n.\xc2\xa04.  So too if administrative officials have apparent authority, but decline ever to exercise it.  Once again: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he modifier \xe2\x80\x98available\xe2\x80\x99 requires the possibility of some relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 738.  When the facts on the ground demonstrate that no such potential exists, the inmate has no obligation to exhaust the remedy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Next, an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use.  In this situation, some mechanism exists to provide relief, but no ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate it.  As the Solicitor General put the point: When rules are \xe2\x80\x9cso confusing that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no reasonable prisoner can use them,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re no longer available.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.  That is a significantly higher bar than CRIPA established or the Fourth Circuit suggested: The procedures need not be sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d as to preclude any reasonable mistake or debate with respect to their meaning.  See \xc2\xa77(a),\n\n94Stat.\n352; 787 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 698\xe2\x80\x93699; <i>supra,</i> at 3, 6\xe2\x80\x938.  When an administrative process is susceptible of multiple reasonable interpretations, Congress has determined that the inmate should err on the side of exhaustion.  But when a remedy is, in Judge Carnes\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing, essentially \xe2\x80\x9cunknowable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so that no ordinary prisoner can make sense of what it demands\xe2\x80\x94then it is also unavailable.  See <i>Goebert</i> v. <i>Lee County</i>, 510 F. 3d 1312, 1323 (CA11 2007); <i>Turner </i>v.<i> Burnside</i>, 541 F.\xc2\xa03d 1077, 1084 (CA11 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cRemedies that rational inmates cannot be expected to use are not capable of accomplishing their purposes andso are not available\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, exhaustion is not required.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And finally, the same is true when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.  In <i>Woodford</i>, we recognized that officials might devise procedural systems (including the blind alleys and quagmires just discussed) in order to \xe2\x80\x9ctrip[] up all but the most skillful prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 102.  And appellate courts have addressed a variety of instances in which officials misled or threatened individual inmates so as to prevent their use of otherwise proper procedures.  As all those courts have recognized, such interference with an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of relief renders the administrative process unavailable.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  And then, once again, \xc2\xa71997e(a) poses no bar.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The facts of this case raise questions about whether, given these principles, Blake had an \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d administrative remedy to exhaust.  As explained earlier, Ross\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion defense rests on Blake\xe2\x80\x99s failure to seek relief through Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s ARP process, which begins with a grievance to the warden and may continue with appeals to the Commissioner of Correction and the IGO.  See <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933; Inmate Handbook, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  That process is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in the State\xe2\x80\x99s prisons: The Inmate Handbook provides that prisoners may use the ARP for \xe2\x80\x9call types\xe2\x80\x9d of grievances (subject to four exceptions not relevant here), including those relating to the use of force.  <i>Id.,</i> at 30; see App. 312.  But recall that Maryland separately maintains the IIU to look into charges of staff misconduct in prisons, and the IIU did just that here.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  Blake urged in the courts below that once the IIU commences such an inquiry, a prisoner <i>cannot</i> obtain relief through the standard ARP process\xe2\x80\x94whatever the Handbook may say to the contrary.  See 787 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 697; App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 2012 WL 5568940, at *5.  And in this Court, that issue has taken on new life.  Both Blake and Ross (as represented by the Maryland attorney general) have lodged additional materials relating to the interaction between the IIU and the ARP.  And <i>both</i> sides\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, although scattershot and in need of further review, lend some support to Blake\xe2\x80\x99s account\xe2\x80\x94while also revealing Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process to have, at least at first blush, some bewildering features.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>Blake\xe2\x80\x99s filings include many administrative dispositions (gleaned from the records of other prisoner suits) indicating that Maryland wardens routinely dismiss ARP grievances as procedurally improper when parallel IIU investigations are pending.  One warden, for example, wrote in response to a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint: \xe2\x80\x9cYour Request for Administrative Remedy has been received and is hereby dismissed.  This issue has been assigned to the Division of Correction\xe2\x80\x99s Internal Investigative Unit (Case #07\xe2\x80\x9335\xe2\x80\x93010621I/C), and will no longer be addressed through this process.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>Lodging of Respondent 1; see also, <i>e.g., id</i>., at 18 (\xe2\x80\x9cAdmin. Dismiss Final: This is being investigated outside of the ARP process by I.I.U.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, Blake has submitted briefs of the Maryland attorney general (again, drawn from former prisoner suits) specifically recognizing that administrative practice.  As the attorney general stated in one case: \xe2\x80\x9cWilkerson filed an ARP request,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9chis complaint already was being investigated by the [IIU], superceding an ARP investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324; see also, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 5 (Bacon\xe2\x80\x99s grievance \xe2\x80\x9cwas dismissed because the issue had been assigned to [the] IIU and would no longer be addressed through the ARP process\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And Ross\xe2\x80\x99s own submissions offer some confirmation of Blake\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Ross does not identify a single case in which a warden considered the merits of an ARP grievance while an IIU inquiry was underway.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6 (Maryland attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office conceding that it had found none).  To the contrary, his lodging contains still further evidence that wardens consistently dismiss such complaints as misdirected.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Lodging of Petitioner 15 (District Court noting that \xe2\x80\x9cGladhill was advised that no further action would be taken through the ARP process because the matter had been referred to the [IIU]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, Ross\xe2\x80\x99 materials suggest that some wardens use a rubber stamp specially devised for that purpose; the inmate, that is, receives a reply stamped with the legend: \xe2\x80\x9cDismissed for procedural reasons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  This issue is being investigated by IIU case number: ____.  No further action shall be taken within the ARP process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at  25, 32, 38; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Maryland attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office conceding the stamp\xe2\x80\x99s existence and use).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Complicating the picture, however, are several cases in which an inmate refused to take a warden\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d for an answer, resubmitted his grievance up the chain to the IGO, and there received a ruling on the merits, without any discussion of the ARP/IIU issue.  We confess to finding these few cases perplexing in relation to normal appellate procedure.  See <i>id</i>., at 3\xe2\x80\x9310, 13\xe2\x80\x9315, 18\xe2\x80\x9320 (multiple Justices expressing confusion about Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s procedures).  If the IGO thinks the wardens wrong to dismiss complaints because of pending IIU investigations, why does it not say so and stop the practice?  Conversely, if the IGO thinks the wardens right, how can it then issue merits decisions?  And if that really is Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s procedure\xe2\x80\x94that when an IIU investigation is underway, the warden (and Commissioner of Correction) cannot consider a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, but the IGO can\xe2\x80\x94why does the Inmate Handbook not spell this out?  Are there, instead, other materials provided to prisoners that communicate how this seemingly unusual process works and how to navigate it so as to get a claim heard?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of all these lodgings and the questions they raise about Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process, we remand this case for further consideration of whether Blake had \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d remedies to exhaust.  The materials we have seen are not conclusive; they may not represent the complete universe of relevant documents, and few have been analyzed in the courts below.  On remand, in addition to considering any other arguments still alive in this case, the court must perform a thorough review of such materials, and then address the legal issues we have highlighted concerning the availability of administrative remedies.  First, did Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s standard grievance procedures potentially offer relief to Blake or, alternatively, did the IIU investigation into his assault foreclose that possibility?  Second, even if the former, were those procedures knowable by an ordinary prisoner in Blake\xe2\x80\x99s situation, or was the system so confusing that no such inmate could make use of it?  And finally, is there persuasive evidence that Maryland officials thwarted the effective invocation of the administrative process through threats, game-playing, or misrepresentations, either on a system-wide basis or in the individual case?  If the court accepts Blake\xe2\x80\x99s probable arguments on one or more of these scores, then itshould find (consistent this time with the PLRA) that his suit may proceed even though he did not file an ARP complaint.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Courts may not engraft an unwritten \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception onto the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement.  The only limit to \xc2\xa71997e(a)\xe2\x80\x99s mandate is the one baked into its text: An inmate need exhaust only such administrative remedies as are \xe2\x80\x9cavailable.\xe2\x80\x9d  On remand, the court below must consider how that modifying term affects Blake\xe2\x80\x99s case\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the remedies he failed to exhaust were \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d under the principles set out here.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We note that our adherence to the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s text runs both ways: The same principle applies regardless of whether it benefits the inmate or the prison.

I would let the Court of Appeals decide on remand whether to supplement the record, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(e), or take notice of Blake\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3581579">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 15\xe2\x80\x93339</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">MICHAEL ROSS, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> SHAIDON BLAKE</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 6, 2016]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Breyer, concurring in part.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I join the opinion of the Court, with the exception that I described in <i>Woodford</i> v. <i>Ngo</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81 (2006)\n.
