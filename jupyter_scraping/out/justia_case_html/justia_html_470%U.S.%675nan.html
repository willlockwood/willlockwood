Respondent Savage was driving the truck, and respondent Sharpe was driving the Pontiac.  After following the two vehicles for about 20 miles, the agent decided to make an "investigative stop," and radioed the South Carolina State Highway Patrol for assistance.  An officer responded, and he and the DEA agent continued to follow the two vehicles.  When they attempted to stop the vehicles, the Pontiac pulled over to the side of the road, but the truck continued on, pursued by the state officer.  After identifying himself and obtaining identification from Sharpe, the DEA agent attempted to radio the State Highway Patrol officer.  The DEA agent was unable to contact the state officer to see if he had stopped the truck, so he radioed the local police for help.  In the meantime, the state officer had stopped the truck, questioned Savage, and told him that he would be held until the DEA agent arrived.  The agent, who had left the local police with the Pontiac, arrived at the scene approximately 15 minutes after the truck had been stopped.  After confirming his suspicion that the truck was overloaded and upon smelling marihuana, the agent opened the rear of the camper without Savage\'s permission and observed a number of burlap-wrapped bales resembling bales of marihuana that the agent had seen in previous investigations.  The agent then placed Savage under arrest and, returning to the Pontiac, also arrested Sharpe.  Chemical tests later showed that the bales contained marihuana.  Respondents were charged with federal drug offenses, and, after the District Court denied their motion to suppress the contraband, were convicted.

S. 677</a></p><p> detained for a period of 20 minutes, when the detention is necessary for law enforcement officers to conduct a limited investigation of the suspected criminal activity.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>On the morning of June 9, 1978, Agent Cooke of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was on patrol in an unmarked vehicle on a coastal road near Sunset Beach, North Carolina, an area under surveillance for suspected drug trafficking.  At approximately 6:30 a. m., Cooke noticed a blue pickup truck with an attached camper shell traveling on the highway in tandem with a blue Pontiac Bonneville.  Respondent Savage was driving the pickup, and respondent Sharpe was driving the Pontiac.  The Pontiac also carried a passenger, Davis, the charges against whom were later dropped.  Observing that the truck was riding low in the rear and that the camper did not bounce or sway appreciably when the truck drove over bumps or around curves, Agent Cooke concluded that it was heavily loaded.  A quilted material covered the rear and side windows of the camper.</p>\n<p>Cooke\'s suspicions were sufficiently aroused to follow the two vehicles for approximately 20 miles as they proceeded south into South Carolina.  He then decided to make an "investigative stop," and radioed the State Highway Patrol for assistance.  Officer Thrasher, driving a marked patrol car, responded to the call.  Almost immediately after Thrasher caught up with the procession, the Pontiac and the pickup turned off the highway and onto a campground road. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Cooke and Thrasher followed the two vehicles as the latter drove along the road at 55 to 60 miles an hour, exceeding the speed limit of 35 miles an hour.  The road eventually looped back to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 470 U. S. 678</a></p><p> the highway, onto which Savage and Sharpe turned and continued to drive south.</p>\n<p>At this point, all four vehicles were in the middle lane of the three right-hand lanes of the highway.  Agent Cooke asked Officer Thrasher to signal both vehicles to stop.  Thrasher pulled alongside the Pontiac, which was in the lead, turned on his flashing light, and motioned for the driver of the Pontiac to stop.  As Sharpe moved the Pontiac into the right lane, the pickup truck cut between the Pontiac and Thrasher\'s patrol car, nearly hitting the patrol car, and continued down the highway.  Thrasher pursued the truck, while Cooke pulled up behind the Pontiac.</p>\n<p>Cooke approached the Pontiac and identified himself.  He requested identification, and Sharpe produced a Georgia driver\'s license bearing the name of Raymond J. Pavlovich.  Cooke then attempted to radio Thrasher to determine whether he had been successful in stopping the pickup truck, but he was unable to make contact for several minutes, apparently because Thrasher was not in his patrol car.  Cooke radioed the local police for assistance, and two officers from the Myrtle Beach Police Department arrived about 10 minutes later.  Asking the two officers to "maintain the situation," Cooke left to join Thrasher.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Thrasher had stopped the pickup truck about one-half mile down the road.  After stopping the truck, Thrasher had approached it with his revolver drawn, ordered the driver, Savage, to get out and assume a "spread-eagled" position against the side of the truck, and patted him down.  Thrasher then holstered his gun and asked Savage for his driver\'s license and the truck\'s vehicle registration.  Savage produced his own Florida driver\'s license and a bill of sale for the truck bearing the name of Pavlovich.  In response to questions from Thrasher concerning the ownership of the truck, Savage said that the truck belonged to a friend, and that he was taking it to have its shock absorbers repaired.  When Thrasher told Savage that he would be held </p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 470 U. S. 679</a></p><p> until the arrival of Cooke, whom Thrasher identified as a DEA agent, Savage became nervous, said that he wanted to leave, and requested the return of his driver\'s license.  Thrasher replied that Savage was not free to leave at that time.</p>\n<p>Agent Cooke arrived at the scene approximately 15 minutes after the truck had been stopped.  Thrasher handed Cooke Savage\'s license and the bill of sale for the truck; Cooke noted that the bill of sale bore the same name as Sharpe\'s license.  Cooke identified himself to Savage as a DEA agent and said that he thought the truck was loaded with marihuana.  Cooke twice sought permission to search the camper, but Savage declined to give it, explaining that he was not the owner of the truck.  Cooke then stepped on the rear of the truck and, observing that it did not sink any lower, confirmed his suspicion that it was probably overloaded.  He put his nose against the rear window, which was covered from the inside, and reported that he could smell marihuana.  Without seeking Savage\'s permission, Cooke removed the keys from the ignition, opened the rear of the camper, and observed a large number of burlap-wrapped bales resembling bales of marihuana that Cooke had seen in previous investigations.  Agent Cooke then placed Savage under arrest and left him with Thrasher.</p>\n<p>Cooke returned to the Pontiac and arrested Sharpe and Davis.  Approximately 30 to 40 minutes had elapsed between the time Cooke stopped the Pontiac and the time he returned to arrest Sharpe and Davis.  Cooke assembled the various parties and vehicles and led them to the Myrtle Beach police station.  That evening, DEA agents took the truck to the Federal Building in Charleston, South Carolina.  Several days later, Cooke supervised the unloading of the truck, which contained 43 bales weighing a total of 2,629 pounds.  Acting without a search warrant, Cooke had eight randomly selected bales opened and sampled.  Chemical tests showed that the samples were marihuana. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 470 U. S. 680</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Sharpe and Savage were charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2.  The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina denied respondents\' motion to suppress the contraband, and respondents were convicted.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the convictions.  <em>Sharpe v. United States,</em> 660 F.2d 967 (1981).  The majority assumed that Cooke</p>\n<p>"had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that Sharpe and Savage were engaged in marijuana trafficking when he and Thrasher stopped the Pontiac and the truck."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 970.  But the court held the investigative stops unlawful because they "failed to meet the requirement of brevity" thought to govern detentions on less than probable cause.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Basing its decision solely on the duration of the respondents\' detentions, the majority concluded that</p>\n<p>"the length of the detentions effectively transformed them into <em>de facto</em> arrests without bases in probable cause, unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The majority then determined that the samples of marihuana should have been suppressed as the fruit of respondents\' unlawful seizures.  <em>Id.</em> at 971.  As an alternative basis for its decision, the majority held that the warrantless search of the bales taken from the pickup violated <em>Robbins v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/420/case.html">453 U. S. 420</a></span> (1981).   Judge Russell dissented as to both grounds of the majority\'s decision.</p>\n<p>The Government petitioned for certiorari, asking this Court to review both of the alternative grounds held by the Court of Appeals to justify suppression.  We granted the petition, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of the intervening decision in <em>United States v. Ross,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/798/case.html">456 U. S. 798</a></span> (1982).   <em>United States v.

S. 681</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On remand, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals again reversed the convictions.  712 F.2d 65 (1983).  The majority concluded that, in the light of <em>Ross,</em> it was required to "disavow" its alternative holding disapproving the warrantless search of the marihuana bales.  But, "[f]inding that <em>Ross</em> does not adversely affect our primary holding" that the detentions of the two defendants constituted illegal seizures, the court readopted the prior opinion as modified.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The majority declined</p>\n<p>"to reexamine our principal holding or to reargue the same issues that were addressed in detail in the original majority and dissenting opinions,"</p>\n<p>reasoning that its action complied with this Court\'s mandate.  The panel assumed that "[h]ad [this] Court felt that a reversal was in order, it could and would have said so."  <em>Id.</em> at 65, n.  1.   Judge Russell again dissented.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 467 U.S. 1250 (1984), and we reverse. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="682">Page 470 U.

Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html">392 U. S. 1</a></span> (1968), we adopted a dual inquiry for evaluating the reasonableness of an investigative stop.

S. 20</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As to the first part of this inquiry, the Court of Appeals assumed that the police had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that Sharpe and Savage were engaged in marihuana trafficking, given the setting and all the circumstances when the police attempted to stop the Pontiac and the pickup.  660 F.2d at 970.  That assumption is abundantly supported by the record. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As to the second part of the inquiry, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="683">Page 470 U. S. 683</a></p><p> however, the court concluded that the 30- to 40-minute detention of Sharpe and the 20-minute detention of Savage "failed to meet the [Fourth Amendment\'s] requirement of brevity."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>It is not necessary for us to decide whether the length of Sharpe\'s detention was unreasonable, because that detention bears no causal relation to Agent Cooke\'s discovery of the marihuana.  The marihuana was in Savage\'s pickup, not in Sharpe\'s Pontiac; the contraband introduced at respondents\' trial cannot logically be considered the "fruit" of Sharpe\'s detention.  The only issue in this case, then, is whether it was reasonable under the circumstances facing Agent Cooke and Officer Thrasher to detain Savage, whose vehicle contained the challenged evidence, for approximately 20 minutes.  We conclude that the detention of Savage clearly meets the Fourth Amendment\'s standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals did not question the reasonableness of Officer Thrasher\'s or Agent Cooke\'s conduct during their detention of Savage.  Rather, the court concluded that the length of the detention alone transformed it from a <em>Terry</em> stop into a <em>de facto</em> arrest.  Counsel for respondents, as <em>amicus curiae,</em> assert that conclusion as their principal argument before this Court, relying particularly upon our decisions in <em>Dunaway v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html">442 U. S. 200</a></span> (1979); <em>Florida v. Royer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html">460 U. S. 491</a></span> (1983); and <em>United States v. Place,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html">462 U. S. 696</a></span> (1983).  That reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p>In <em>Dunaway,</em> the police picked up a murder suspect from a neighbor\'s home and brought him to the police station, where, after being interrogated for an hour, he confessed.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 470 U. S. 684</a></p><p> The State conceded that the police lacked probable cause when they picked up the suspect, but sought to justify the warrantless detention and interrogation as an investigative stop.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that the defendant\'s detention was "in important respects indistinguishable from a traditional arrest." 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html#212">442 U. S. 212</a></span>.  <em>Dunaway</em> is simply inapposite here:   the Court was not concerned with the length of the defendant\'s detention, but with events occurring during the detention.   [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Royer,</em> government agents stopped the defendant in an airport, seized his luggage, and took him to a small room used for questioning, where a search of the luggage revealed narcotics.  The Court held that the defendant\'s detention constituted an arrest.  <em>See</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#503">460 U. S. 503</a></span> (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#509">460 U. S. 509</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring); <em>ibid.</em> (BRENNAN, J., concurring in result).  As in <em>Dunaway,</em> though, the focus was primarily on facts other than the duration of the defendant\'s detention -- particularly the fact that the police confined the defendant in a small airport room for questioning.</p>\n<p>The plurality in <em>Royer</em> did note that "an investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop."  460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U.

The Court followed a similar approach in <em>Place.</em>  In that case, law enforcement agents stopped the defendant after his arrival in an airport and seized his luggage for 90 minutes to take it to a narcotics detection dog for a "sniff test."

The question is not simply whether some other alternative was available, but whether the police acted unreasonably in failing to recognize or to pursue it.</p>\n<p>We readily conclude that, given the circumstances facing him, Agent Cooke pursued his investigation in a diligent and reasonable manner.  During most of Savage\'s 20-minute detention, Cooke was attempting to contact Thrasher and enlisting the help of the local police who remained with Sharpe while Cooke left to pursue Officer Thrasher and the pickup.  Once Cooke reached Officer Thrasher and Savage, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] he proceeded expeditiously:   within the space of a few minutes, he examined Savage\'s driver\'s license and the truck\'s bill of sale, requested (and was denied) permission to search the truck, stepped on the rear bumper and noted that the truck did not move, confirming his suspicion that it was probably overloaded.  He then detected the odor of marihuana.</p>\n<p>Clearly this case does not involve any delay unnecessary to the legitimate investigation of the law enforcement officers.  Respondents presented no evidence that the officers were dilatory in their investigation.  The delay in this case was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 470 U. S. 688</a></p><p> attributable almost entirely to the evasive actions of Savage, who sought to elude the police as Sharpe moved his Pontiac to the side of the road. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Except for Savage\'s maneuvers, only a short and certainly permissible pre-arrest detention would likely have taken place.  The somewhat longer detention was simply the result of a "graduate[d] .  .  .  respons[e] to the demands of [the] particular situation," <em>Place, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html#709">462 U.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Officer Thrasher testified that the respondents\' vehicles turned off the highway "[a]bout one minute" after he joined the procession.  4 Record 141.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari on June 18, 1984.  On August 27, counsel for respondents notified the Court that respondents had become fugitives.  On October 1, we directed counsel for respondents to file a brief as <em>amicus curiae</em> in support of affirmance of the Court of Appeals\' judgment.  Because our reversal of the Court of Appeals\' judgment may lead to the reinstatement of respondents\' convictions, respondents\' fugitive status does not render this case moot.  <em>See United States v.

This theory is not supported by our precedents, and indeed would be a break with a recent decision.  The line of authority upon which the dissent relies concerns the situation in which a fugitive defendant is the party seeking review here.  In those very different cases, dismissal of the petition or appeal is based on the equitable principle that a fugitive from justice is "disentitled" to call upon this Court for a review of his conviction.  <em>See United States v.

Savage\'s pickup truck appeared to be heavily loaded, and the windows of the camper were covered with a quilted bed-sheet material, rather than curtains.  Finally, both vehicles took evasive actions and started speeding as soon as Officer Thrasher began following them in his marked car.  <em>See</em> n. 1, <em>supra.</em>  Perhaps none of these facts, standing alone, would give rise to a reasonable suspicion; but taken together as appraised by an experienced law enforcement officer, they provided clear justification to stop the vehicles and pursue a limited investigation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The pertinent facts relied on by the Court in <em>Dunaway</em> were that (1) the defendant was taken from a private dwelling; (2) he was transported unwillingly to the police station; and (3) he there was subjected to custodial interrogation resulting in a confession.  <em>See</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html#212">442 U.

Thrasher could not be certain that he was aware of all of the facts that had aroused Cooke\'s suspicions; and, as a highway patrolman, he lacked Cooke\'s training and experience in dealing with narcotics investigations.  In this situation, it cannot realistically be said that Thrasher, a state patrolman called in to assist a federal agent in making a stop, acted unreasonably because he did not release Savage based solely on his own limited investigation of the situation and without the consent of Agent Cooke.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if it could be inferred that Savage was not attempting to elude the police when he drove his car <em>between</em> Thrasher\'s patrol car and Sharpe\'s Pontiac -- in the process nearly hitting the patrol car, <em>see</em> App. 17, 37 -- such an assumption would not alter our analysis or our conclusion.  The significance of Savage\'s actions is that, whether innocent or purposeful, they made it necessary for Thrasher and Cooke to split up, placed Thrasher and Cooke out of contact with each other, and required Cooke to enlist the assistance of local police before he could join Thrasher and Savage.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring.</p>\n<p>In view of respondents\' fugitive status, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#681">470 U.

Two justifications supported this "major development in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence."  <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/106/case.html">434 U.

First, a legitimate <em>Terry</em> stop -- brief and narrowly circumscribed -- was said to involve a "wholly different kind of intrusion upon individual freedom" than a traditional arrest.  <em>Terry,</em> 392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html#26">392 U.

Second, under some circumstances, the government\'s interest in preventing imminent criminal activity could be substantial enough to outweigh the still-serious privacy interests implicated by a limited <em>Terry</em> stop.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html#27">392 U. S. 27</a></span>.  Thus, when the intrusion on the individual is minimal, and when law enforcement interests outweigh the privacy interests infringed in a <em>Terry</em> encounter, a stop based on objectively reasonable and articulable suspicions, rather than upon probable cause, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 470 U.

Second, the application of this balancing test led the Court to approve this narrowly defined less intrusive seizure on grounds less rigorous than probable cause. . . ."</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Place,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html">462 U. S. 696</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html#703">462 U.

Even a stop that lasts no longer than necessary to complete the investigation for which the stop was made may amount to an illegal arrest if the stop is more than "minimally intrusive."  The stop must first be found not unduly intrusive before any balancing of the government\'s interest against the individual\'s becomes appropriate.  <em>See also Michigan v.

As long as the police are acting diligently to complete their investigation, it is difficult to maintain that law enforcement goals would better be served by releasing an individual af ter a brief stop than by continuing to detain him for as long as necessary to discover whether probable cause can be established.  But while the preservation of order is important to any society, the</p>\n<p>"needs of law enforcement stand in constant tension with the Constitution\'s protections of the individual against certain exercises of official power.  It is precisely the predictability of these pressures that counsels a resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards."</p>\n<p><em>Almeida-Sanchez v.

Regardless how efficient it may be for law enforcement officials to engage in prolonged questioning to investigate a crime, or how reasonable in light of law enforcement objectives it may be to detain a suspect until various inquiries can be made and answered, a seizure that in duration, scope, or means goes beyond the bounds of <em>Terry</em> cannot be reconciled with the Fourth Amendment in the absence of probable cause.  <em>See Dunaway, supra.</em>  Legitimate law enforcement interests that do not rise to the level of probable cause simply cannot turn an overly intrusive seizure into a constitutionally permissible one. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 470 U.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  <em>Terry</em> "stops" are justified, in part, because they are <em>stops,</em> rather than prolonged seizures.

A <em>Terry</em> stop valid in its inception may become unduly intrusive on personal liberty and privacy simply by lasting too long.  That remains true even if valid law enforcement objectives account for the length of the seizure.</p>\n<p>The requirement that <em>Terry</em> stops be brief no matter what the needs of law enforcement in the particular case is buttressed by several sound pragmatic considerations.  First, if the police know they must structure their <em>Terry</em> encounters so as to confirm or dispel the officer\'s reasonable suspicion in a brief time, police practices will adapt to minimize the intrusions worked by these encounters.  <em>Cf. United States v. Place, supra,</em> (to assure brevity of <em>Terry</em> airport stops, narcotic detection dogs must, under some circumstances, be kept in same airport to which suspect is arriving).  Firm adherence to the requirement that stops be brief forces law enforcement officials to take into account from the start the serious and constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests implicated in <em>Terry</em> stops, and to alter official conduct accordingly. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, a <em>per se</em> ban on stops that are not brief yields the sort of objective standards mandated by our Fourth Amendment precedents, standards that would avoid placing courts in the awkward position of second-guessing police as to what constitutes reasonable police practice. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  We have recognized that the methods employed in a <em>Terry</em> stop</p>\n<p>"should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer\'s suspicion in a short period of time."</p>\n<p><em>Florida v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="694">Page 470 U.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Yet in the absence of a <em>per se</em> requirement that stops be brief, defining what means are "least intrusive" is a virtually unmanageable and unbounded task.  Whether the police have acted with due diligence is a function not just of how quickly they completed their investigation, but of an almost limitless set of alternative ways in which the investigation <em>might</em> have been completed.  For example, in this case, the Court posits that the officers acted with due diligence, but they might have acted with more diligence had Cooke summoned two, rather than one, highway patrolman to assist him, or had Cooke, who had the requisite "training and experience," stopped the pickup truck -- the vehicle thought to be carrying the marihuana.  <em>See generally post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#712">470 U. S. 712</a></span>-716 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  And if due diligence takes as fixed the amount of resources a community is willing to devote to law enforcement, officials in one community may act with due diligence in holding an individual at an airport for 35 minutes while waiting for the sole narcotics detection dog they possess, while officials who have several dogs readily available may be dilatory in prolonging an airport stop to even 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Constitutional rights should not vary in this manner.  Yet, in the absence of a brevity standard that is independent of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 470 U. S. 695</a></p><p> the actions or needs of the police, that variance is one of two inescapable results.  The other is that the Court will have to take seriously its requirement that the police act with due diligence, which will require the Court to inject itself into such issues as whether this or that alternative investigative method ought to have been employed. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  <em>Cf. United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/case.html">428 U.

S. 565</a></span> (1976) (One purpose of the warrant requirement "is to prevent hindsight from coloring the evaluation of the reasonableness of a search or seizure").  The better and judicially more manageable rule would be a <em>per se</em> requirement that Terry stops be brief, for that rule would avoid the Court\'s measuring police conduct according to a virtually standardless yardstick.</p>\n<p>Finally, dissolving the brevity requirement into the general standard that the seizure simply be reasonable will "inevitably produce friction and resentment [among the police], for there are bound to be inconsistent and confusing decisions."  Schwartz, Stop and Frisk, 58 J.Crim.L.C. &amp; P. S. 433, 449 (1967).  The police themselves may have done nothing unreasonable in holding a motorist for one hour while waiting for a registration computer to come back on line, but surely such a prolonged detention would be unlawful.  Indeed, in my view, as soon as a patrolman called in and learned that the computer was down, the suspect would have to be released.  That is so not because waiting for information in this circumstance is unreasonable, but simply because the stop must be brief if it is to be constitutional on less than probable cause.  A "balancing" test suggests that a stop is invalid only if officials have crossed over some line they </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 470 U. S. 696</a></p><p> should have avoided; the finding that such a "balance" has been struck improperly casts a certain moral opprobrium on official conduct.  A brevity requirement makes clear that the Constitution imposes certain limitations on police powers no matter how reasonably those powers have been exercised.  "[H]air-splitting distinctions that currently plague our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence" serve nobody\'s interest, <em>New York v. Quarles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html">467 U.

Maintaining the clarity of <em>Terry\'s</em> brevity requirement will instead breed respect for the law among both police and citizens.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, fidelity to the rationales that justify <em>Terry</em> stops requires that the intrusiveness of the stop be measured independently of law enforcement needs.  A stop must first be found not unduly intrusive, particularly in its length, before it is proper to consider whether law enforcement aims warrant limited investigation.</p>\n<p>We have had little occasion to specify the length to which a stop can be extended before it can no longer be justified on less than probable cause.  <em>But see United States v. Place,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html">462 U. S. 696</a></span> (1983) (90-minute seizure too long).  In <em>Terry</em> and <em>Adams v.

Those stops upheld in these cases all lasted no more than a few minutes before probable cause was established. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has "decline[d] to adopt any outside time limitation for a permissible <em>Terry</em> stop."  <em>Place, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html#709">462 U. S. 709</a></span>.  While a <em>Terry</em> stop must be brief no matter what the needs of the authorities, I agree that <em>Terry\'s</em> brevity requirement is not to be judged by a stopwatch, but rather by the facts of particular stops.  At the same time, the time it takes to "briefly stop [the] person, ask questions, or check identification," <em>United States v. Hensley, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/221/case.html#229">469 U. S. 229</a></span>, and, if warranted, to conduct a brief pat-down for weapons, <em>see Terry,</em> is typically just a few minutes.  In my view, anything beyond this short period is presumptively a <em>de facto</em> arrest.  That presumption can be overcome by showing that a lengthier detention was not unduly <em>intrusive</em> for some reason; as in this case, for example, the suspects, rather than the police, may have prolonged the stop. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  It cannot, however, be overcome simply by showing that police needs required a more intrusive stop.  For that reason, I regard the American Law Institute\'s suggested maximum of 20 minutes [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] as too long;</p>\n<p>"any suggestion that the <em>Terry</em> reasonable suspicion standard justifies anything but the briefest of detentions or the most limited of searches finds no support in the <em>Terry</em> line of cases."</p>\n<p><em>Royer, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#510">460 U.

S. 698</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Difficult questions will no doubt be presented when, during these few minutes, an officer learns enough to increase his suspicions, but not enough to establish probable cause.  But whatever the proper resolution of this problem, the very least that ought to be true of <em>Terry\'s</em> brevity requirement is that, if the initial encounter provides no greater grounds for suspicion than existed before the stop, the individual must be free to leave after the few minutes permitted for the initial encounter.  Such a clear rule would provide officials with necessary and desirable certainty, and would adequately protect the important liberty and privacy interests upon which <em>Terry</em> stops infringe.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In light of these principles, I cannot join the Court\'s opinion.  The Court offers a hodgepodge of reasons to explain why the 20-minute stop at issue here was permissible.  At points we are told that the stop was no longer than "necessary" and that the police acted "diligently" in pursuing their investigation, all of which seems to suggest that, as long as a stop is no longer than necessary to the "legitimate investigation of the law enforcement officers," the stop is perfectly lawful.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#677">470 U. S. 677</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#685">470 U. S. 685</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#686">470 U. S. 686</a></span>.  As I have just argued, such reasoning puts the horse before the cart by failing to focus on the critical threshold question of the intrusiveness of the stop, particularly its length.  With respect to that question, the Court seems in one breath to chastise the Court of Appeals for concluding that the length of a detention alone can transform a <em>Terry</em> stop into a <em>de facto</em> arrest, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#680">470 U. S. 680</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#682">470 U. S. 682</a></span>-683, while in another breath the Court acknowledges that, "if an investigative stop continues indefinitely, at some point it can no longer be justified as an investigative stop."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#685">470 U. S. 685</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, it is unnecessary to try to sort all of this out, for another rationale offered by the Court adequately disposes of this case.  As the Court recognizes:</p>\n<p>"The delay in this case was attributable almost entirely to the evasive actions of Savage, who sought to elude the police as Sharpe </p><p><a class="page-number" name="699">Page 470 U. S. 699</a></p><p> moved his Pontiac to the side of the road.  Except for Savage\'s maneuvers, only a short and certainly permissible prearrest detention would likely have taken place."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#687">470 U. S. 687</a></span>-688.  With that holding I agree. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Had Savage pulled over when signalled to, as did Sharpe, Savage and Sharpe both would have been subjected to only a permissibly brief <em>Terry</em> stop before the odor of the marihuana would have given the officers probable cause to arrest. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Once Cooke caught back up with Savage, only a few minutes passed before Cooke smelled the marihuana.  During these few brief minutes, Savage was subjected to no more than the identification request and minimal questioning, designed to confirm or dispel the reasonable suspicion causing the stop, that is legitimate under <em>Terry.</em>  While a 20-minute stop would, under most circumstances, be longer than the limited intrusion entailed by the brief stop that <em>Terry</em> allows, I believe such a stop is permissible when a suspect\'s own actions are the primary cause for prolonging an encounter </p><p><a class="page-number" name="700">Page 470 U. S. 700</a></p><p> beyond the bounds to which <em>Terry\'s</em> brevity requirement ordinarily limits such stops.  Nothing more is necessary to decide this case, and any further suggestions in the Court\'s opinion I find unwarranted, confusing, and potentially corrosive of the principles upon which <em>Terry</em> is grounded.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>I also cannot join the Court\'s opinion because it reaches out to decide a wholly distinct issue not presented and not capable of being treated fairly without further development of a factual record.  The Court of Appeals assumed, without deciding, that an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity existed to justify these stops.  The District Court, after listening to the officers explain the basis on which they purported to make the stop, and after testimony taking up 450 pages of transcript, found the legality of the initial stop to present "a real close question."  App. 45.  This question was not presented in the certiorari petition, and not a single word is devoted to it in the briefs.  Yet in what can only be construed as a thinly disguised attempt to decide the question, the Court, from its position atop the judicial system, concludes that the Court of Appeals\' assumption <em>arguendo</em> that the stop was legal is "abundantly" supported by the record, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#682">470 U. S. 682</a></span> -- an abundance not evident to the District Court.  <em>Cf. Anderson v. Bessemer City, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/564/case.html">470 U. S. 564</a></span> (district court credibility determinations entitled to strongest deference).</p>\n<p>Of course, the proper approach to this issue is illustrated by <em>United States v. Place,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html#700">462 U. S. 700</a></span>, n. 1, where, as here, the Court of Appeals had assumed the existence of reasonable suspicion and certiorari had not been granted on the question; the Court correctly concluded that it had "no occasion to address the issue here."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Consistency, however, hardly has been a hallmark of the current Court\'s Fourth Amendment campaigns.</p>\n<p>Moreover, aside from the fact that the reasonable suspicion issue was not presented, briefed, or argued by the parties, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="701">Page 470 U. S. 701</a></p><p> the Court\'s handling of this issue reveals the defects of engaging in an airy factual inquiry unaided by full lower court review.   First, the Court ignores relevant evidence relied on by the District Court when the latter concluded that, although the question was "real close," the initial stop was lawful; for example, the Court does not refer to evidence before the District Court regarding how common it would have been for a pickup truck like that driven by Savage to be found in this area.  <em>See</em> Defendant\'s Exhibit 10.  Perhaps a stop of a particular type of truck would be reasonable in some areas and not in others, which is why evidence was submitted on the number of such trucks in this area; but in its haste to validate the actions here, the Court seems to suggest that pickup trucks with camper shells are always, anywhere items engendering reasonable suspicion.  Second, the Court makes ill-considered inferences to concoct those few facts upon which it does rely to uphold the initial stop.  The Court first asserts that both drivers "started speeding as soon as Officer Thrasher began following them in his marked car," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#683">470 U. S. 683</a></span>, n. 3, and then suggests that respondents sped because they noticed Thrasher and were seeking to evade him.  Thrasher, however, had joined the caravan at least one minute before respondents began speeding.  4 Record 140-141.  In addition, respondents did not speed until they left the highway, at which point they continued at their highway speed of 55 to 60 miles an hour through a 3-mile campground road for which the posted limit was 35 miles an hour.  Any implication that respondents sped because they noticed Thrasher or to "evade" the officers is unsupported by common sense or by the record.  Sharpe and Savage hardly could have expected to "evade" the police on a 3-mile closed loop through a campground, and, if the Court\'s speculation that they noticed Thrasher\'s car is correct, one certainly doubts they would have intentionally attracted attention to themselves by beginning to speed.  Finally, the District Court\'s view on the reasonable suspicion issue may well have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="702">Page 470 U. S. 702</a></p><p> been colored by the fact that "several" other of these essentially profile stops were made that morning, including stops of four or five four-wheel drive vehicles, and yet no other drug arrests were made.  <em>Id.</em> at 127-128.  If, after two days and 450 pages of testimony, the District Court concluded that the reasonableness and articulability of the officers\' suspicion presented a "close question," and if the Court today has less factual information before it and must rely on questionable inferences to elicit even those few facts upon which it does rely, one would hope the Court would act with greater restraint than to speculate whether the "assumption" of reasonable suspicion is "abundantly" supported by the record.  But any such hope would evidently be merely idle fancy with respect to a Court so anxious to address an unpresented issue that it blithely hurdles over the jurisdictional and jurisprudential principles that ought to stand in its way.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my view, the record demonstrates that the lengthy stop at issue in this case would have been permissibly brief but for the respondents\' efforts to evade law enforcement officials.  Accordingly, I agree with the Court\'s judgment.  But because there is no way to fathom the extent to which the majority\'s holding rests on this basis, and because the majority acts with unseemly haste to decide other issues not presented, I join only its judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The following special law enforcement needs have been found sufficient to justify a minimally intrusive stop based on reasonable suspicion:   protective weapons searches, <em>Terry, Adams v.

I assume <em>Royer\'s</em> holding remains the law on this point, and that the Court\'s mere quotation out of context of <em>Cady,</em> unsupported by any argument or reasoned discussion, is not meant to overrule <em>Royer.</em>  Legal reasoning hardly consists of finding isolated sentences in wholly different contexts and using them to overrule <em>sub silentio</em> prior holdings.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>It is clear from the Court\'s distaste for the task of "second-guessing" the police, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#686">470 U.

He was ordered out of his pickup truck at gunpoint, spread-eagled and frisked, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="703">Page 470 U.

Although Savage repeatedly asked to be released, Thrasher held him for almost 15 minutes until DEA Agent Luther Cooke, the officer who had stopped Sharpe back up the road, could arrive and sniff the vehicle\'s windows to determine whether he could smell the suspected marihuana.  As Thrasher later conceded, Savage "was under custodial arrest" the entire time.  4 Record 165.</p>\n<p>The Court today concludes that these lengthy detentions constituted reasonable investigative stops within the meaning of <em>Terry v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html">392 U. S. 1</a></span> (1968).  It explains that, although the length of an investigative stop made without probable cause may at some point become so excessive as to violate the Fourth Amendment, the primary inquiry must nevertheless be whether the investigating officers acted "diligently" in pursuing a stop that was no longer than "necessary" to the "legitimate investigation of the law enforcement officers."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#687">470 U.

Applying this analysis to the instant case, the Court concludes that the lengthy detentions of Sharpe and Savage were reasonable because the delay was the fault of Savage, whom the Court contends "sought to elude the police" by speeding away when signaled to stop; had Savage not taken these "evasive actions," Agent Cooke could have questioned Sharpe and Savage together and "only a short and certainly permissible pre-arrest detention would likely have taken place."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#688">470 U.

I have previously expressed my views on the permissible scope and duration of <em>Terry</em> stops, and need not recount those views in detail today.  <em>See, e.g., United States v.

S. 509</a></span> (1983) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in result).  I write at some length, however, because I believe the Court\'s opinion illustrates several disturbing trends in our disposition of cases involving the rights of citizens who have been accused of crime.  First, the Court increasingly tends to reach out and decide issues that are not before it.  If the facts in this case are as the Court recounts them, for example, the propriety of these lengthy detentions would not appear to be governed by the <em>Terry</em> line of cases at all, and the Court\'s opinion is therefore little more than 13 pages of ill-considered dicta.  Second, the Court of late shows increasing eagerness to make purely factual findings in the first instance where convenient to support its desired result.  For example, the Court\'s conclusion in this case that Savage "sought to elude the police" is a <em>de novo</em> factual determination resting on a record that is ambiguous at best.  Finally, the Court in criminal cases increasingly has evaded the plain requirements of our precedents where they would stand in the way of a judgment for the government.  For a <em>Terry</em> stop to be upheld, for example, the government must show at a minimum that the "least intrusive means reasonably available" were used in carrying out the stop.  <em>Florida v. Royer, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U. S. 500</a></span> (opinion of WHITE, J.). [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  The Government has made no such showing here, and the Court\'s bald assertion that "[c]learly this case does not involve any delay unnecessary" to "legitimate" law enforcement, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#687">470 U. S. 687</a></span>, is completely undermined by the record before us.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court portrays the circumstances leading up to these detentions with a studied flourish.   Before Sharpe and Savage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="705">Page 470 U. S. 705</a></p><p> were stopped, we are told, they "took evasive actions and started speeding as soon as Officer Thrasher began following them in his marked car."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#683">470 U. S. 683</a></span>, n. 3.  When the two were signaled to stop, Savage\'s</p>\n<p>"pickup truck cut between the Pontiac and Thrasher\'s patrol car, nearly hitting the patrol car, and continued down the highway."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#678">470 U. S. 678</a></span>.  Savage, in other words, "sought to elude the police as Sharpe moved his Pontiac to the side of the road."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#688">470 U. S. 688</a></span>.  As a result of Savage\'s "evasive actions" and "maneuvers," Thrasher had to chase after him and leave Agent Cooke with Sharpe, thereby laying the groundwork for the challenged delay.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>If the facts are as the Court relates them, it is not readily apparent why the Court insists on using this case as a vehicle for expanding the outer bounds of <em>Terry</em> investigative stops.  I had thought it rather well established that, where police officers reasonably suspect that an individual may be engaged in criminal activity, and the individual deliberately takes flight when the officers attempt to stop and question him, the officers generally no longer have mere reasonable suspicion, but probable cause to arrest.  <em>See, e.g., Peters v. New York,</em> decided together with <em>Sibron v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/40/case.html">392 U.

[<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, flight <em>alone</em> cannot give rise to probable cause; it must be coupled with preexisting reasonable and articulable suspicion.  <em>See</em> 1 W.

[<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  And the act of flight must reasonably appear to be in response to the presence of the authorities. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Here, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="707">Page 470 U. S. 707</a></p><p> however, the Court accepts the questionable premise that the officers already had reasonable suspicion when they decided to stop the vehicles, [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>] and it boldly concludes that Sharpe and Savage "started speeding" at Thrasher\'s approach, that Savage "sought to elude the police" when Thrasher attempted the stop, and that Savage took "evasive actions."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#683">470 U.

S. 688</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Thus, if the facts were as the Court describes them, I would be inclined to view this as a probable cause detention, and the reasonableness of these stops under <em>Terry</em> would not appear to be before us.  The Court\'s failure even to consider this question of probable cause is baffling, but ultimately in keeping with its recent practice in <em>Terry</em> cases of reaching out far beyond what is required to resolve the cases at hand so as more immediately to impose its views without the bother of abiding by the necessarily gradual pace of case-by-case decisionmaking.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Place,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/case.html#711">462 U.

(BRENNAN, J., concurring in result).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion is flawed in another critical respect:   its discussion of Savage\'s purported attempt "to elude the police" amounts to nothing more than a <em>de novo</em> factual finding made on a record that is, at best, hopelessly ambiguous.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals ever found that Savage\'s actions constituted evasion or flight.  If we are nevertheless to engage in <em>de novo</em> factfinding, I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="708">Page 470 U. S. 708</a></p><p> submit the Court has taken insufficient account of several factors.</p>\n<p>First, Savage\'s actions in continuing to drive down the highway could well have been entirely consistent with those of any driver who sees the police hail someone in front of him over to the side of the road.  Sharpe\'s Pontiac was at least several car lengths in front of Savage\'s pickup truck; Thrasher thought there was a separation of "a car length or two," while Cooke testified that the distance was anywhere from between 30-50 and 100-150 feet.  3 Record 65; 4 <em>id.</em> at 139.  Approaching in the far-left lane, Thrasher pulled even with Sharpe\'s lead vehicle, "turned the blue light on," "blew the siren," and "motioned for <em>him</em> to pull over."  <em>Id.</em> at 145 (emphasis added).  Savage moved into the right lane so as to avoid hitting Thrasher, who was slowing along with Sharpe, and continued on his way.  Neither Cooke nor Thrasher ever testified that Savage "sought to elude" them, and there is nothing here that is necessarily inconsistent with the actions of any motorist who happens to be behind a vehicle that is being pulled over to the side of the road.</p>\n<p>This view of the record is strongly reinforced by Thrasher\'s inability on the stand to give a responsive answer to the question:  "Would you say the pickup truck was attempting to allude [<em>sic</em>] you or just passed you by thinking you had stopped the car?"  3 <em>id.</em> at 84.  Thrasher replied with the nonanswer that "[w]ell, I was across . . . partially in two lanes, and he got by me in the other lane," <em>ibid.</em> -- an observation that could be made about any motorist driving by a stop-in-progress.</p>\n<p>Finally, the "[f]ail[ure] to stop [a] motor vehicle when signaled by [a] law enforcement vehicle" is an independent traffic violation in South Carolina. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  Thrasher testified that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 470 U. S. 709</a></p><p> Savage was guilty of a number of traffic violations, and, when asked to specify what these violations were, he enumerated that (1) Savage had been speeding through the campground, and (2) the pickup truck had improper license tags.  <em>Id.</em> at 94-95, 99.  If Savage in fact had been signaled to stop his truck and had taken "evasive actions" and "sought to elude the police," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#688">470 U. S. 688</a></span>, I find it curious that Thrasher did not include these actions in his litany of Savage\'s traffic offenses.</p>\n<p>None of these factors, singularly or together, shows beyond a doubt that Savage proceeded innocently past the stop of Sharpe.  But given that it is the Government\'s burden to prove facts justifying the duration of the investigative detention, <em>Florida v. Royer, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U. S. 500</a></span> (opinion of WHITE, J.), and given that the courts below never found that Savage "sought to elude" the authorities, [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>] the Court\'s conclusion to the contrary is extremely disturbing.  I do not believe that citizens should be deemed to have forfeited important Fourth Amendment safeguards on the basis of a cold record as ambiguous as the one before us.  Today\'s opinion unfortunately is representative of a growing number of instances in which the Court is willing to make <em>de novo</em> factual findings in criminal cases where convenient to support its decisions. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  Even if the Court had the time and inclination to engage in the "conscientious </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 470 U. S. 710</a></p><p> and detailed examination of the record" required in fairly making purely factual judgments of this sort, <em>United States v. Hasting,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/499/case.html">461 U.

S. 517</a></span> (1983) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), such exercises of our authority would nevertheless be improper.  The Court\'s institutional role in this context should be focused on resolving "important questions of federal law" and on "ensuring clarity and uniformity of legal doctrine," <em>United States v. Young, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/1/case.html#34">470 U. S. 34</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), rather than on serving as the prosecution\'s factfinder of last resort. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="711">Page 470 U. S. 711</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Because it has not been shown that Savage "sought to elude" the police, I agree with the Court that the constitutional propriety of these detentions is governed by <em>Terry</em> and its progeny.  These precedents lead inexorably to the conclusion that the investigative actions at issue here violated the Fourth Amendment.  As the Fourth Circuit emphasized, the lengthy detentions of Sharpe and Savage did not accord with <em>Terry\'s</em> threshold brevity requirement.  660 F.2d 967, 970 (1981). [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>] But even if the length of these detentions did not <em>alone</em> compel affirmance of the Fourth Circuit\'s judgment, the Court today has evaded a further requirement of our <em>Terry</em> precedents:   that</p>\n<p>"the investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="712">Page 470 U. S. 712</a></p><p> verify or dispel the officer\'s suspicion in a short period of time,"</p>\n<p>and that the Government bears the burden of demonstrating that it was objectively infeasible to investigate "in a more expeditious way."  <em>Florida v. Royer,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U.

[<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  The record before us demonstrates that, for at least four reasons, the Government has not carried this burden.</p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  Assuming that Savage did not break away from the officers by taking "evasive actions" to "elude" them -- in which instance this is not a <em>Terry</em> case at all -- the Government has not demonstrated why two trained law enforcement officers driving in separate vehicles, both equipped with flashing lights, [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>] could not have carried out a stop of a Pontiac and a pickup truck in such a manner as to ensure that both vehicles would be stopped together.  Reasonable methods for bringing about the proximate stop of two vehicles readily come to mind; such methods would have been particularly important if, as the Court assumes, both officers knew that only Cooke was capable of carrying out the investigation.</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  If the officers believed that the suspected marihuana was in Savage\'s pickup truck, and if only Cooke was capable of investigating for the presence of marihuana, I am at a loss why Cooke did not follow the truck and leave Thrasher with the Pontiac, rather than vice versa. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="713">Page 470 U. S. 713</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Third.</em>  The Government has offered no plausible explanation why Thrasher, a trained South Carolina highway patrolman, could not have carried out the limited <em>Terry</em> investigation of Savage and the pickup truck.  Here again, however, the Court makes a bold <em>de novo</em> factual finding to the contrary:</p>\n<p>"It was appropriate for Officer Thrasher to hold Savage for the brief period pending Cooke\'s arrival.  Thrasher could not be certain that he was aware of all of the facts that had aroused Cooke\'s suspicions; and, as a highway patrolman, he lacked Cooke\'s training and experience in dealing with narcotics investigations."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#687">470 U. S. 687</a></span>, n. 5.  The record wholly undermines the Court\'s conclusion.  Far from being unaware of what was going on, Thrasher had conversed with Cooke by radio while they were following the vehicles and had fully discussed the various factors that might justify an investigative stop. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  Cooke sought out Thrasher\'s "professional opinion" on the situation, and it was Thrasher who ultimately made the determination that they properly could stop the vehicles. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  Thrasher\'s "professional opinion" was that, based on what Cooke had told him and his own observations, the truck "might be loaded" with marihuana. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  Once he had stopped Savage, Thrasher </p><p><a class="page-number" name="714">Page 470 U. S. 714</a></p><p> not only "held" him, but carried out his own investigation of the situation.  He pointed out that the truck had been riding low and asked Savage what was inside.  He inspected the exterior and even jumped up on the bumper to test how loaded down the camper might be.  3 Record 87; 4 <em>id.</em> at 150.  Moreover, although Cooke certainly had more drug enforcement experience than Thrasher, there is no reason why Thrasher could not have conducted the simple sniffing investigation that Cooke later did:   Thrasher, like all South Carolina highway patrolmen, had received basic narcotics detection training and knew exactly what marihuana smells like.  3 <em>id.</em> at 86. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]  He did not even attempt to smell the windows of the camper shell for two reasons:  first, that was not his assigned "job"; and second, "[m]y sinuses were stopped up that morning."  4 <em>id.</em> at 164, 178; <em>see also</em> 3 <em>id.</em> at 101. [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]  Thrasher\'s sinuses apparently cleared up several hours later, however, because once the pickup was at the police station, he decided, "[j]ust as a matter of curiosity," to "get right up on the window" of the vehicle, and reported decisively that "I smelled some marijuana up around the windows."  <em>Ibid.</em>  I would have thought that, before the Court chose to uphold a lengthy detention of a citizen without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="715">Page 470 U. S. 715</a></p><p> probable cause based on the "reasonable" ignorance of the detaining officer, it would have taken the time to get its facts straight. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Finally.</em>  The record strongly suggests that the delay may have been attributable in large measure to the poor investigative coordination and botched communications on the part of the DEA.  Drug enforcement agents were swarming throughout the immediate area on the morning that Savage and Sharpe were detained, conducting numerous roadblocks and "profile stops" of campers and recreational vehicles similar to Savage\'s.  <em>See</em> <l=|470 675fn3="" 9|="" u.s.="">n. 9, <em>supra.</em>  Even accepting the Court\'s dubious premise that a highway patrolman is somehow incapable of carrying out a simple investigative stop, it is clear that Cooke had followed Sharpe and Savage for over 30 minutes and, knowing that a multiple-vehicle stop was in the offing, should have obtained assistance from other DEA agents.  This was, in fact, precisely what he attempted to do.  He repeatedly tried to contact the area DEA headquarters, but complained over his police radio that "I can\'t raise anybody else right now."  Defendant\'s Ex.  1, p. 3 (police </l=|470></p><p><a class="page-number" name="716">Page 470 U. S. 716</a></p><p> band transcription).  He asked the local police dispatcher to telephone the DEA office to "ask them if anybody there has any contact with me on my DEA frequency."  <em>Id.</em> at 4.  The dispatcher reported that the line was busy; local police units had to be sent out to headquarters "to tell these people to get off the telephone."  <em>Id.</em> at 6.  Once the units arrived, it was learned that "[t]here\'s no one there.  They\'re all down at the Mar Vista Motel."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Additional units had to be sent to the motel to "get those people out of the sack."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Agents apparently were eventually located at the motel and at Don\'s Pancake House, <em>ibid.,</em> for by the time that Cooke returned to the Pontiac to complete the arrests, there were several other DEA agents waiting to assist him, 4 Record 171-172.  In the meantime, of course, Cooke had had to request Thrasher as a local backup.</p>\n<p>Far from demonstrating that these investigative stops were carried out in the most "expeditious way" using all "reasonably available" investigative methods, <em>Florida v. Royer,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U.

S. 505</a></span> (opinion of WHITE, J.), the record in this case therefore strongly suggests custodial detentions more accurately characterized as resulting from hopelessly bungled communications and from Thrasher\'s unwillingness to tread on Cooke\'s investigative turf.  I do not mean to suggest that Cooke and Thrasher bore the entire blame for these delays; it was not Cooke\'s fault that his DEA backups apparently were sleeping or eating breakfast, rather than monitoring their radios for his calls, and Thrasher might well have felt that it was not his place to carry out an investigation he apparently was fully capable of conducting.  But constitutional rights should not so easily be balanced away simply because the individual officers may have subjectively been acting in good faith, especially where an objective evaluation of the facts suggests an unnecessarily intrusive exercise of police power.

Absent a rigorously enforced brevity requirement, the <em>Terry</em> rationale "would threaten to swallow the general rule that Fourth Amendment seizures are <em>reasonable\' only if based on probable cause."  <em>Dunaway v.

As JUSTICE MARSHALL cogently discusses today, the brevity requirement also serves to compel law enforcement agencies to "structure their <em>Terry</em> encounters" by employing the resources and methods necessary to "minimize the intrusions worked by these encounters."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#693">470 U.

Similarly, <em>Royer\'s</em> requirement that the prosecution demonstrate that the <em>Terry</em> stop was carried out in the most "expeditious way" using all "reasonably available" investigative methods, 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U.

S. 505</a></span> (opinion of WHITE, J.), operates to ensure that law enforcement agencies commit the manpower, training, and resources necessary to guarantee that investigative detentions are carried out in the least intrusive manner possible.  Some may protest that such requirements impede unduly on law enforcement, but surely these are reasonable tradeoffs for the authority to </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="719">Page 470 U. S. 719</a></em></p><p><em> seize and detain citizens on less than probable cause.  And while it may be tempting to relax these requirements when a defendant is believed to be guilty, the standards we prescribe for the guilty define the authority of the police in detaining the innocent as well.  <em>Cf. Brinegar v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/160/case.html#181">338 U. S. 181</a></span> (Jackson, J., dissenting) ("[A] search against Brinegar\'s car must be regarded as a search of the car of Everyman").\n</em></p>\n<p>In this connection, I am particularly disturbed by the Court\'s suggestion that it might be constitutionally reasonable for a highway patrolman to hold a motorist on <em>Terry</em> suspicion pending the arrival of an officer with more "training and experience."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#687">470 U. S. 687</a></span>, n. 5.  The Court is of course correct in emphasizing that Cooke was much more expert at drug detection than Thrasher.  I can imagine a great many roadside stop situations in which it might make good police sense for the detaining officer to hold the motorist indefinitely without probable cause so that the officer could have an expert interrogator drive out from the city to conduct the "brief" questioning authorized by <em>Terry,</em> or so that his more experienced sergeant could be summoned to render a second opinion, or so that a trained narcotics dog owned by the adjacent county could be driven out to sniff around the windows.  I can also imagine circumstances where, given the limited number of patrol cars in a community, an officer might prefer to handcuff a person stopped for investigative questioning to a lamppost while the officer responded to an emergency call.  All of these actions might be preferable from a law enforcement standpoint.  The Framers did not enact the Fourth Amendment to further the investigative powers of the authorities, however, but to curtail them:  <em>Terry\'s</em> exception to the probable cause safeguard must not be expanded to the point where the constitutionality of a citizen\'s detention turns only on whether the individual officers were coping as best they could given inadequate training, marginal resources, negligent supervision, or botched communications.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="720">Page 470 U.

The Court of Appeals merely assumed that the reasonable suspicion finding was proper for the sake of analysis, 660 F.2d 967, 970 (CA4 1981), and the question was not presented for our consideration.  The District Court considered the issue "a real close question," emphasized its "great reluctance" on the merits, and found that the Government had barely established reasonable suspicion "by the greater weight of the evidence," but that it had not shown sufficient suspicion beyond a reasonable doubt.  5 Record 152-155, 190.</p>\n<p>The Court has taken insufficient account of several factors.  First, these detentions were little more than "profile stops" similar to numerous stops of campers and recreational vehicles carried out by the DEA in the general area on the day in question; none of these other questionable profile stops turned up any evidence of wrongdoing.  4 <em>id.</em> at 126-127, 190.  <em>See also</em> 3 <em>id.</em> at 70-71 (DEA "set up roadblocks in that particular area and did stop a number of vehicles with roadblocks").  Second, there is nothing in the record to support the Court\'s assertion that Sharpe and Savage "started speeding as soon as Officer Thrasher began following them in his marked car."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#683">470 U.

To the extent the Court suggests that they were attempting to speed away at Thrasher\'s approach, this factual finding is inconsistent with Thrasher\'s concession that Sharpe and Savage stopped at every stop sign and traffic light they encountered -- lawful conduct that hardly comports with notions of a high-speed attempt to elude the authorities.  4 Record 142-143.  Finally, it appears strongly that the reason these profile stops were made when they were was not because Cooke\'s "reasonable" suspicions had hardened, but because he was about to run out of gas.  <em>See</em> Defendant\'s Ex.  1, pp.  4-5 (Cooke\'s discussion with Thrasher over police radio) ("We\'re going to have to do it pretty quick or I\'ll have to go 10-7 for gas. . . .  You want to just try to run them into there?  I\'d like to take the Pontiac in there with it, I don\'t have anything to go on on it other than just normal suspicion.  I\'d like to at least I.D.  the driver and passenger in that").

In addition, the Court\'s reasoning flies directly in the face of the Fourth Amendment, which requires the authorities to ground their conduct on what is known at the time of their actions, rather than on what might subsequently turn up.  <em>See, e.g., Henry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/98/case.html">361 U.

First, the Court asserts that judges "should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing" of police conduct.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#686">470 U. S. 686</a></span>.  There is nothing "unrealistic" about requiring police officers to pursue the "least intrusive means reasonably available" when detaining citizens on less than probable cause, <em>Florida v. Royer,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html#500">460 U. S. 500</a></span> (opinion of WHITE, J.), and it is the duty of courts in every Fourth Amendment case to determine whether police conduct satisfied constitutional standards.  Moreover, the public will understandably be perplexed why the Court ignores the record and refuses to engage in "second-guessing" where police conduct is challenged while it simultaneously engages in second-guessing of a defendant\'s conduct where necessary to ensure a verdict for the Government.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Court attempts to slip into a footnote the astonishing assertion that, <em>even if its textual discussion of Savage\'s actions is completely untrue,</em> this "would not alter our analysis or our conclusion."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#688">470 U.

The Court contends that, "<em>whether innocent</em> or purposeful," Savage\'s conduct "made . . . necessary" the length of these detentions.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  If the authorities did not reasonably carry out the stops, however, and if Savage\'s continued driving was "innocent" conduct, <em>ibid.,</em> it is logically and constitutionally intolerable to hold that Savage waived important Fourth Amendment rights because the events were his "innocent" fault.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/21" name="F3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf.

[<a href="#F4/1" name="T4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]  Their status raises a procedural question that is of more significance than the merits of the somewhat fact-bound questions that the Government\'s petition for certiorari presented. [<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  The procedural question is important, because escapes by persons engaged in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="722">Page 470 U. S. 722</a></p><p> the lucrative business of smuggling narcotics are apparently not uncommon, [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>] and because the fugitive status of the litigants may have an impact on this Court\'s disposition of the case.</p>\n<p>If a defendant escapes and remains at large while his appeal is pending, the appeal will normally be dismissed. [<a href="#F4/4" name="T4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>]  Over a century ago, in <em>Smith v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/97/case.html">94 U. S. 97</a></span> (1876), the Court explained the rationale for this type of disposition:</p>\n<p>"It is clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminal case in error unless the convicted party, suing out the writ, is where he can be made to respond to any judgment we may render.  In this case, it is admitted that the plaintiff in error has escaped, and is not within the control of the court below, either actually by being in custody or constructively by being out on bail.  If we affirm the judgment, he is not likely to appear to submit to his sentence.  If we reverse it and order a new trial, he will appear or not, as he may consider most for his interest.  Under such circumstances, we are not inclined to hear and decide what may prove to be only a moot case. [<a href="#F4/5" name="T4/5">Footnote 4/5</a>]"</p>\n<p>Almost a century later, in <em>Estelle v. Dorrough,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/534/case.html">420 U. S. 534</a></span> (1975) (per curiam), we further noted that</p>\n<p>"[d]isposition by dismissal of pending appeals of escaped prisoners is a longstanding and established principle of American law,"</p>\n<p>and that "[t]his Court itself has long followed the practice of declining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="723">Page 470 U. S. 723</a></p><p> to review the convictions of escaped criminal defendants." [<a href="#F4/6" name="T4/6">Footnote 4/6</a>]  In the case now before the Court, the respondents did not become fugitives until after they had prevailed in the Court of Appeals and until after the Government had sought review in this Court. [<a href="#F4/7" name="T4/7">Footnote 4/7</a>]  The timing of the escape, however, plainly does not affect this Court\'s power to base its disposition of the case on the fact that respondents have fled.  Nor, in my opinion, at least in a case in which there is no dispute about the fugitives\' guilt, should there be any difference in the ultimate disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p>The record establishes that the respondents were apprehended while engaged in a serious and flagrant violation of law.  Their appeal to the Court of Appeals was based on a claim that the evidence of their guilt was obtained in an unlawful search; such a claim, even if meritorious, establishes neither a lack of culpability nor any fundamental unfairness in the trial process. [<a href="#F4/8" name="T4/8">Footnote 4/8</a>]  It is therefore entirely appropriate to conclude that, as fugitives, these litigants should not be accorded standing to advance their claim on appeal. [<a href="#F4/9" name="T4/9">Footnote 4/9</a>]</p>\n<p>As would have been true if they had escaped while their appeal was pending before the Court of Appeals, neither of these litigants "is where he can be made to respond to any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="724">Page 470 U. S. 724</a></p><p> judgment we may render." [<a href="#F4/10" name="T4/10">Footnote 4/10</a>]  In my judgment, the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that respondents\' appeal to it was meritorious should make no difference in the ultimate outcome.  Every application of the <em>Smith</em> rule necessarily assumes that an appeal may be meritorious.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals\' ruling in respondents\' favor does not preclude the possibility that this Court will disagree.  In short, for the purpose of deciding whether the Smith rule applies, I believe the merits of the appeal should be entirely disregarded. [<a href="#F4/11" name="T4/11">Footnote 4/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court states, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#681">470 U. S. 681</a></span>, n. 2, that, because a</p>\n<p>"reversal of the Court of Appeals\' judgment may lead to the reinstatement of respondents\' convictions, respondents\' fugitive status does not render this case moot."</p>\n<p>I agree that the case is not technically moot. [<a href="#F4/12" name="T4/12">Footnote 4/12</a>]  An escape, however, may compromise the adversary character of the litigation.  The lawyer for the escapee presumably will have lost contact with his client; his desire to vindicate a faithless client may be less than zealous; and, as noted, the Court cannot have its normal control over one of the parties to the case before it.  The risk that the adversary process will not function effectively counsels against deciding the merits of a case of this kind. [<a href="#F4/13" name="T4/13">Footnote 4/13</a>]</p>\n<p>The correct disposition of this case, I believe, is to treat it as though the respondents\' escape had mooted the appeal.  If we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and if we direct that the appeal from the judgment of the District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="725">Page 470 U. S. 725</a></p><p> Court be dismissed, the consequences would be the same as if the escape had occurred in advance of the Court of Appeals\' decision.  Moreover, by vacating that court\'s judgment, the Government\'s interest in eliminating the precedent that it has challenged in its certiorari petition would be vindicated. [<a href="#F4/14" name="T4/14">Footnote 4/14</a>]  Finally, such a disposition would make it unnecessary for this Court to decide the constitutional question that is presented. [<a href="#F4/15" name="T4/15">Footnote 4/15</a>]  That, for me, is a matter of paramount importance. [<a href="#F4/16" name="T4/16">Footnote 4/16</a>]</p>\n<p>There is one adverse consequence of the disposition I propose.  It would deprive the Court of the opportunity to write </p><p><a class="page-number" name="726">Page 470 U. S. 726</a></p><p> an opinion in a Fourth Amendment case.  The summary disposition of this case would not serve the interest of providing additional guidance to the law enforcement community.  But regarding that interest as paramount would support the wholesale adoption of a practice of rendering advisory opinions at the request of the Executive -- a practice the Court abjured at the beginning of our history. [<a href="#F4/17" name="T4/17">Footnote 4/17</a>]  We have, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="727">Page 470 U. S. 727</a></p><p> instead, opted for a policy of judicial restraint -- of studiously avoiding the unnecessary adjudication of constitutional questions.  The correct implementation of that policy, I submit, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="728">Page 470 U. S. 728</a></p><p> requires that we predicate the disposition of this case on the respondents\' fugitive status.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government\'s petition for the grant of a writ of certiorari was filed on September 27, 1983; it was granted on June 18, 1984.  On May 11, 1984, respondent Sharpe\'s counsel wrote a letter to the Court.  It stated that,</p>\n<p>"as of this date, Mr.  Sharpe is in fugitive status as to charges in the Northern District of Georgia and the State of North Carolina."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Letter of Mark J. Kadish to Alexander Stevas, Clerk of the United States Supreme Court (May 11, 1984).

Moreover, it would have been inappropriate for this Court to vacate the judgment of the Florida court because we have no supervisory power over state courts.  Once again, however, the Court has thus overlooked the "important differences between cases that come to us from state tribunals and those that arise in the federal system."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/1/case.html#7">469 U.

In making that point, Justice Stewart implicitly assumed that the doctrine of <em>Smith v. United States, supra,</em> would apply to a case in which the fugitive was the respondent as well as to one in which the fugitive was the petitioner.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/17" name="F4/17">Footnote 4/17</a>]</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/2/409/case.html">Hayburn\'s Case,</a></span></em> 2 Dall. 409 (1792).  Following that decision, this Court made clear, after a series of letters, its constitutional practice of not rendering advisory opinions.  The correspondences began on July 18, 1793, when Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State, wrote the following letter to Chief Justice John Jay and Associate Justices:</p>\n<p>"GENTLEMEN:"</p>\n<p>"The war which has taken place among the powers of Europe produces frequent transactions within our ports and limits, on which questions arise of considerable difficulty, and of greater importance to the peace of the United States.   Their questions depend for their solution on the construction of our treaties, on the laws of nature and nations, and on the laws of the land, and are often presented under circumstances <em>which do not give a cognisance of them to the tribunals of the country.</em>  Yet their decision is so little analogous to the ordinary functions of the executive as to occasion much embarrassment and difficulty to them.  The President therefore would be much relieved if he found himself free to refer questions of this description to the opinions of the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, whose knowledge of the subject would secure us against errors dangerous to the peace of the United States, and their authority insure the respect of all parties.  He has therefore asked the attendance of such of the judges as could be collected in time for the occasion, to know, in the first place, their opinion, whether the public may, with propriety, be availed of their <em>advice on these questions?</em>  And if they may, to present, for their advice, the abstract questions which have already occurred, or may soon occur, from which they will themselves strike out such as any circumstances might, in their opinion, forbid them to pronounce on.  I have the honour to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect, gentlemen,"</p>\n<p>"Your most obedient and humble servant,"</p>\n<p>"THOS. JEFFERSON"</p>\n<p>3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 486-487 (H.  Johnston ed. 1891) (emphasis in original).  Attached with the letter, on behalf of President Washington, were 29 questions.  <em>See</em> 33 Writings of George Washington 15-19 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940).  Two days later, Chief Justice Jay and the Associate Justices penned the following to President Washington:</p>\n<p>"SIR:"</p>\n<p>"We have taken into consideration the letter written to us, by your direction, on the 18th inst., by the Secretary of State.  The question, \'whether the public may, with propriety, be availed of the advice of the judges on the questions alluded to,\' appears to us to be of much difficulty as well as importance.  As it affects the judicial department, we feel a reluctance to decide it without the advice and participation of our absent brethren."</p>\n<p>"The occasion which induced our being convened is doubtless urgent; of the degree of that urgency we cannot judge, and consequently cannot propose that the answer to this question be postponed until the sitting of the Supreme Court.  We are not only disposed, but desirous, to promote the welfare of our country in every way that may consist with our official duties.  We are pleased, sir, with every opportunity of manifesting our respect for you, and are solicitous to do whatever may be in our power to render your administration as easy and agreeable to yourself as it is to our country.  If circumstances should forbid further delay, we will immediately resume the consideration of the question, and decide it."</p>\n<p>"We have the honour to be, with perfect respect, your most obedient and most humble servants."</p>\n<p>3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 487-488 (Johnston ed.  1891).  President Washington promptly returned a reply:</p>\n<p>"Gentlemen:  The circumstances, which had induced me to ask your counsel on certain legal questions interesting to the public exist now as they did then, but I by no means press a decision whereon you wish the advice and participation of your absent brethen.  Whenever, therefore, their presence shall enable you to give it with more satisfaction to yourselves, I shall accept it with pleasure.  With sentiments of high respect, I am, &amp;c."</p>\n<p>33 Writings of George Washington 28 (J. Fitzpatrick ed.1940).  Finally, Chief Justice Jay and the Associate Justices returned their response:</p>\n<p>"SIR:"</p>\n<p>"We have considered the previous question stated in a letter written by your direction to us by the Secretary of State on the 18th of last month [regarding] the lines of separation drawn by the Constitution between the three departments of the government.  These being in certain respects checks upon each other, and our being judges of a court of the last resort, are considerations which afford strong arguments against the propriety of our extrajudicially deciding the questions alluded to, especially as the power given by the Constitution to the President, of calling on the heads of departments for opinions, seems to have been <em>purposely</em> as well as expressly united to the <em>executive</em> departments."</p>\n<p>"We exceedingly regret every event that may cause embarrassment to your administration, but we derive consolation from the reflection that your judgment will discern what is right, and that your usual prudence, decision, and firmness will surmount every obstacle to the preservation of the rights, peace, and dignity of the United States."</p>\n<p>"We have the honour to be, with perfect respect, sir, your most obedient and most humble servants."</p>\n<p>3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 488-489 (Johnston ed. 1891) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
