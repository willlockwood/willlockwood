JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>John M. Russell, Inc., was the owner of an apartment house in New York.  On August 13, 1940, a foreclosure suit by a third mortgagee was filed.  On August 17, 1940, the state court appointed respondent receiver of the rents and profits of the apartment house.  On August 31, 1940, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against John M. Russell, Inc., of which petitioner was subsequently appointed as trustee.  Respondent collected the rents from the premises from the time of his appointment in August, 1940, to and including August, 1941.  While that foreclosure suit was pending, mechanics liens, subordinate to the third mortgage, were foreclosed, a sale was had, and the property purchased by Apartment Investing Corporation.  That was in February, 1941.  Judgment in the mortgage foreclosure suit was entered in June, 1941, and on August 13, 1941, before the sale was held, the judgment was paid and satisfied by Apartment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 318 U. S. 517</a></p><p> Investing Corporation.  Thereafter, respondent presented his accounts to the state court for settlement.  Petitioner applied to the bankruptcy court for an order directing respondent to file his account in that court.  While that motion was pending, the motion in the state court came on for a hearing.  Petitioner appeared and filed his objections to respondent\'s accounts.  His objections were overruled, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the accounts approved, and respondent discharged by the state court.  Thereafter, the bankruptcy court denied petitioner\'s motion.  43 F.Supp. 128.  The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided vote.  130 F.2d 369.  We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari because of the importance of the problem in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act.  317 U.S. 621.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) and \xc2\xa7 69d make it obligatory on the respondent as a nonbankruptcy receiver to account to the bankruptcy court.  These provisions of the Bankruptcy Act are new.  They were added in 1938 by the Chandler Act. 52 Stat. 840, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 11(a)(21), \xc2\xa7 109d.  Sec. 2(a)(21) gives to the bankruptcy court the power in straight bankruptcy proceedings to require "receivers or trustees appointed in proceedings not under this Act" within four months of bankruptcy (1) "to deliver the property in their possession or under their control to the receiver or trustee appointed under this Act," and (2) "to account to the court for the disposition by them of the property" of the bankrupt. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Sec. 69d makes a "receiver or trustee, not appointed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 318 U. S. 518</a></p><p> under this Act, of any of the property" of the bankrupt "accountable" to the bankruptcy court for "any action taken by him subsequent to the filing of such bankruptcy petition." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  These sections are in part declaratory of the law as it existed prior to the Chandler Act.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) plainly includes the case where a lien against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 318 U. S. 519</a></p><p> the debtor\'s property was acquired by some legal or equitable proceeding within four months of bankruptcy.  Prior to 1938, such liens did not survive bankruptcy (<em>Straton v. New,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/318/case.html">283 U. S. 318</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/318/case.html#322">283 U. S. 322</a></span>), and bankruptcy superseded the proceedings out of which they arose.  Remington, Bankruptcy (4th ed.) \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2067-2071.  But the accountability of the nonbankruptcy receiver or trustee presented some difficulties prior to the Chandler Act.  When bankruptcy superseded the prior proceedings, all disbursements subsequent thereto were, of course, subject to the exclusive control of the bankruptcy court.  <em>In re Diamond\'s Estate,</em> 259 F. 70; <em>Moore v. Scott,</em> 55 F.2d 863; <em>Lion Bonding &amp; Surety Co. v. Karatz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/640/case.html">262 U. S. 640</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/640/case.html#642">262 U. S. 642</a></span>; <em>Gross v. Irving Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/342/case.html">289 U. S. 342</a></span>.  While such disbursements were generally subject to the summary power of the bankruptcy court (<em>Taylor v. Sternberg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/470/case.html">293 U. S. 470</a></span>), an accounting for disbursements made prior to bankruptcy required a plenary suit.  <em>Loveless v. Southern Grocer Co.,</em> 159 F. 415; 1 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th ed.) pp. 320-321.  <em>And see Galbraith v. Vallely,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/46/case.html">256 U. S. 46</a></span>; <em>In re Jack Stolkin, Inc.,</em> 42 F.2d 829.  Sec. 2(a)(21), by substituting a summary proceeding, was designed to eliminate the delay and cost of a plenary suit, and to provide a more effective control over prior disbursements.  <em>See</em> H.Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 20; Weinstein, The Bankruptcy Law of 1938, pp. 16-17.</p>\n<p>Does \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) go further, and apply to a case where a receiver is appointed within four months of bankruptcy as an incident to enforcement of a mortgage lien whose validity is not challenged?  Prior to the Chandler Act, such proceedings were not superseded by bankruptcy.  They survived bankruptcy, the interest of the estate in them being protected by the intervention of the bankruptcy trustee.  <em>Straton v. New, supra,</em> pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/318/case.html#326">283 U. S. 326</a></span>-327, and cases cited.  Under the earlier Act, it made no difference whether such a proceeding was instituted prior to or within the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 318 U. S. 520</a></p><p> four-months period.  Where the lien survived bankruptcy, prior proceedings to enforce it would not be enjoined by the bankruptcy court.  1 Collier, <em>op. cit.,</em> pp. 306-309; <em>Straton v. New, supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/318/case.html#326">283 U. S. 326</a></span>, note 6.  Sec. 2(a)(21), read literally, would call for a different result, in that foreclosure receivers would have to turn over to the bankruptcy court all the property in their possession or under their control, and account to it.  In this case, since the receiver was only a receiver for rents and profits, it would mean that the foreclosure would go on apace in the state court, while the funds collected by the receiver would be turned over to the bankruptcy court for administration.  The argument advanced in support of that view is that, with such power, the bankruptcy court could better protect the interests of the estate in the foreclosure proceeding.</p>\n<p>But we do not think that that was part of the purpose of \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21).  As we have stated, the main purpose of \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) was to give the bankruptcy court control over disbursements made in nonbankruptcy proceedings prior to the filing of the petition.  The House Judiciary Committee, in its report, stated:</p>\n<p>"There is no logical reason why the bankruptcy court could not supervise these expenditures, since all of the previous proceedings are nullified by the petition in bankruptcy followed by an adjudication.  The principle is the same as that involved in section 60d of the act, where it is provided that fees paid to the attorney for the debtor prior to bankruptcy and in contemplation thereof are subject to review by the bankruptcy court."</p>\n<p>H.Rep. No. 1409, <em>supra,</em> p. 20.  That is as plain an indication as could be made that \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) was designed to define the powers of the bankruptcy court only where bankruptcy superseded the prior proceedings. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The language of \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) squares with that express </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 318 U. S. 521</a></p><p> declaration.  When Congress wrote the four-months proviso into \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21), it was not writing on a clean slate.  The presence of that proviso suggests the type of problem with which Congress was dealing.  <em>Straton v. New, supra,</em> indicates the importance of that period in a determination of what liens did not survive bankruptcy and when bankruptcy proceedings superseded prior proceedings.  The 1938 Act, like its predecessor, makes the four-month period part of the critical test for determining what liens do not survive bankruptcy.  One example is to be found in \xc2\xa7 67(a)(1), which provides that liens "obtained by attachment, judgment, levy, or other legal or equitable process or proceedings within four months" of bankruptcy are null and void on certain conditions.  That section illustrates the relevancy of the four-month period to this type of problem.  If \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) is read to extend the power of the bankruptcy court to the present situation, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the four-month period will have acquired a new significance in bankruptcy law.  We cannot help but think that, if Congress had set out to make such a major change, some clear and unambiguous indication of that purpose would appear.  But we can find none.  Moreover, such an interpretation would lead in many cases to a division of authority between state and federal courts.  Thus, in this case, the state court would remain in charge of the foreclosure; the bankruptcy court would have exclusive control over the receiver\'s receipts.  An interpretation which leads to a division of authority so fraught with conflict will not be readily implied. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 318 U. S. 522</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is argued, however, that the provision in \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) concerning proceedings under chapters X and XII indicates a purpose to include the type of receiver we have here.  It seems clear that such a foreclosure receiver is included within \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) where proceedings under Ch. X have supervened.  But the fact that a foreclosure receiver is included for one purpose does not necessarily mean that he is included for another.  Plans of reorganization under Ch. X may (\xc2\xa7 216) and commonly do affect the rights of mortgagees.  Hence, \xc2\xa7 148 provides that an order approving a petition under Ch. X operates to stay a pending mortgage foreclosure or other proceeding to enforce a lien against the debtor\'s property. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And \xc2\xa7 256 and \xc2\xa7 257 provide that the trustee (or debtor) acquires all rights in, and the right to immediate possession of, the property of the debtor under the control of a receiver or trustee appointed in a prior proceeding in any federal or state court.  That is to say, a Ch. X proceeding supersedes a pending mortgage foreclosure.  We thus find \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) performing the same function when applied to Ch. X proceedings [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] as it does when applied to ordinary bankruptcy.  We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in reading the word "receivers" distributively.  Such a construction fits the statutory scheme as a whole.  The other interpretation results in a distortion which the language of \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21) makes unnecessary and which its history does not warrant.</p>\n<p>Little need be said about \xc2\xa7 69d.  It must be read in connection with \xc2\xa7 2(a)(21).  The legislative history suggests that it too was designed to apply only where bankruptcy superseded the prior proceedings.  H.Rep.
