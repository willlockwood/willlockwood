A. Winchester his property, real and personal, in trust for his creditors; that Winchester accepted the trust, qualified as assignee, took actual possession of the property assigned, proceeded in due form to execute the trust, and has ever since been such assignee; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 138 U.

S. 400</a></p><p> debts by legal process, and that the whole arrangement was a trick upon the part of Young to continue in the control of the goods, through Winchester, who was only his clerk, and to so manage his business that he could pay out of the proceeds of the trust property and out of the new goods procured by him in the name of Winchester such creditors as he chose to pay, and to delay and defraud others, including the defendants.</p>\n<p>The answer avers that the alleged deed of assignment was fraudulent and void under the statutes of the Territory of Montana in force in 1883, when the deed was made.  Those statutes provided:</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 165.

JUSTICE HARLAN, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The contention of the plaintiffs in error is that by the statutes of the Territory of Montana above quoted, the alleged assignment by Young to Winchester was conclusively fraudulent as to them for the want of the immediate delivery, followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the goods assigned; that their right to so treat the assignment, although such right was specially set up and claimed, was denied, and that, consequently, they were denied a right arising under an authority exercised under the United States.  Whether the state court so interpreted the territorial statute as to deny such right to the plaintiffs in error we need not inquire, for it proceeded in part upon another and distinct ground, not involving any federal question and sufficient in itself to maintain the judgment, without reference to that question.  That ground is that there was evidence tending to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 138 U. S. 402</a></p><p> show that the defendants acquiesced it and assented to all that was done, and waived any irregularity in the mode in which the assignee conducted the business, and that the question whether the defendants so acquiesced and assented with knowledge of all the facts, and thereby waived their right to treat the assignment as fraudulent, was properly submitted to the jury.  The state court evidently intended to hold that even if the assignment was originally fraudulent as against the creditors by reason of Young\'s remaining in the store as clerk for Winchester and assisting the latter in carrying on the business, it was competent for the plaintiffs in error to waive the fraud and treat the assignment as valid for all the purposes specified in it.  That view does not involve a federal question.  Whether sound or not we do not inquire.  It is broad enough in itself to support the final judgment without reference to the federal question, and for that reason the judgment must be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Beaupre v. Noyes.</em>  Error to the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.  No. 159 argued and submitted with No. 160, January 23, 1891.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.  This case is a writ of error to review the judgment of the supreme court of the state affirming the order of the court of original jurisdiction refusing a new trial in the above action.  This writ was sued out upon the theory that the denial of a new trial might be regarded as a final judgment of the state court within the meaning of the act of Congress.  But clearly this Court has no jurisdiction to review such an order.  The writ of error in case 159 must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
