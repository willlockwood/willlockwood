S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77422(a).  Such claim must be filed within three years of the filing of a tax return or two years of the tax\xe2\x80\x99s payment, whichever is later, see \xc2\xa76511(a).  In contrast, the Tucker Act allows claims to be brought against the Government within six years of the challenged conduct.  Respondent coal companies paid taxes on coal exports under a portion of the Code later invalidated under the Export Clause of the Constitution.  They filed timely administrative claims and recovered refunds of their 1997\xe2\x80\x931999 taxes, but sought a refund of their 1994\xe2\x80\x931996 taxes in the Court of Federal Claims without complying with the Code\xe2\x80\x99s refund procedures.  Nevertheless, the court allowed them to proceed directly under the Export Clause and the Tucker Act.  Affirming in relevant part, the Federal Circuit ruled that the companies could pursue their Export Clause claim despite their failure to file timely administrative refund claims.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The plain language of 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77422(a) and 6511 requires a taxpayer seeking a refund for a tax assessed in violation of the Export Clause, just as for any other unlawfully assessed tax, to file a timely administrative refund claim before bringing suit against the Government.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because the companies did not file a refund claim with the IRS for the 1994\xe2\x80\x931996 taxes, they may, under \xc2\xa77422(a), bring \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o suit\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cany court\xe2\x80\x9d to recover \xe2\x80\x9cany internal revenue tax\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cany sum\xe2\x80\x9d alleged to have been wrongfully collected \xe2\x80\x9cin any manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, \xc2\xa76511\xe2\x80\x99s time limits for filing administrative refund claims\xe2\x80\x94set forth in an \xe2\x80\x9cunusually emphatic form,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brockamp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/347/index.html">519 U.

Contrary to the companies\xe2\x80\x99 claim that these statutes are ambiguous, the provisions clearly state that taxpayers must comply with the Code\xe2\x80\x99s refund scheme before bringing suit, including the filing of a timely administrative claim.  Indeed, this question was all but decided in <em>United States</em> v. <em>A. S. Kreider Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/313/443/index.html">313 U. S. 443</a>, where the Court held that the limitations period in the Revenue Act then in effect, not the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s longer period, applied to tax refund actions.  As was the case there, the current Code\xe2\x80\x99s refund scheme would have \xe2\x80\x9cno meaning whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 448, if taxpayers failing to comply with it were nonetheless allowed to bring suit subject only to the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s longer time bar.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The companies nonetheless assert that their claims are exempt from the Code provisions\xe2\x80\x99 broad sweep because the claims derive from the Export Clause.  The principles that a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional claim can become time-barred just as any other claim can,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Block</em> v. <em>North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/273/index.html">461 U. S. 273</a>, 292, and that Congress has the authority to require administrative exhaustion before allowing a suit against the Government, even for a constitutional violation, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ruckelshaus</em> v. <em>Monsanto Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/index.html">467 U. S. 986</a>, 1018, are fully applicable to unconstitutional taxation claims.  The companies\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to distinguish Export Clause claims on the ground that the Clause is not simply a limitation on taxing authority but a prohibition carving particular economic activity out of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power is without substance and totally manipulable.  There is no basis for treating taxes collected in violation of that Clause differently from taxes challenged on other grounds.  Because the companies acknowledge that their claims are subject to the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar, the question is not whether their refund claim can be limited, but rather which limitation applies.  Their argument that, despite explicit and expansive statutory language, the Code\xe2\x80\x99s refund scheme does not apply to their case as a matter of statutory interpretation is unavailing.  They claim that Congress could not have intended it to apply a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally dubious\xe2\x80\x9d refund scheme to taxes assessed in violation of the Export Clause, but the statutory language emphatically covers the facts of this case.  In any event, there is no constitutional problem.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s detailed scheme is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto advise the appropriate officials of the demands or claims intended to be asserted, so as to insure an orderly administration of the revenue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/269/index.html">283 U. S. 269</a>, 272, to provide that refund claims are made promptly, and to allow the IRS to avoid unnecessary litigation by correcting conceded errors.  Even when a tax\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality is challenged, taxing authorities have an \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly strong interest in financial stability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McKesson Corp.</em> v. <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/18/index.html">496 U. S. 18</a>, 37, that they may pursue through provisions of the sort at issue.  There is no reason why invoking the Export Clause would deprive Congress of the power to protect this interest.  The companies\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the Code procedures are excessively burdensome is belied by their own invocation of those procedures for taxes paid within the Code\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period, which resulted in full refunds with interest.

Under those procedures, a taxpayer must file an administrative claim with the Internal Revenue Service before filing suit against the Government.  Such a claim must be filed within three years of the filing of a return or two years of payment of the tax, whichever is later.  The Tucker Act, in contrast, is more forgiving, allowing claims to be brought against the United States within six years of the challenged conduct.  The question in this case is whether a taxpayer suing for a refund of taxes collected in violation of the Export Clause of the Constitution may proceed under the Tucker Act, when his suit does not meet the time limits for refund actions in the Internal Revenue Code.  The answer is no.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A taxpayer seeking a refund of taxes erroneously or unlawfully assessed or collected may bring an action against the Government either in United States district court or in the United States Court of Federal Claims.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(1); <em>EC Term of Years Trust</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 550 U. S. ___, ___, and n.\xc2\xa02 (2007) (slip op., at 2, and n.\xc2\xa02).  The Internal Revenue Code specifies that before doing so, the taxpayer must comply with the tax refund scheme established in the Code.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dalm</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/596/index.html">494 U. S. 596</a>, 609\xe2\x80\x93610 (1990).  That scheme provides that a claim for a refund must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service before suit can be brought, and establishes strict timeframes for filing such a claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In particular, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77422(a) specifies:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the [IRS].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Code further establishes a time limit for filing such a refund claim with the IRS: To receive a \xe2\x80\x9crefund of an overpayment of any tax imposed by this title in respect of which tax the taxpayer is required to file a return,\xe2\x80\x9d a refund claim must be filed no later than \xe2\x80\x9c3 years from the time the return was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76511(a).  And \xc2\xa76511(b)(1) mandates that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o credit or refund shall be allowed or made\xe2\x80\x9d if a claim is not filed within the time limits set forth in \xc2\xa76511(a).  \xe2\x80\x9cRead together, the import of these sections is clear: unless a claim for refund of a tax has been filed within the time limits imposed by \xc2\xa76511(a), a suit for refund \xe2\x80\xa6 may not be maintained in any court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dalm</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 602.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1978, Congress levied a tax \xe2\x80\x9con coal from mines located in the United States sold by the producer,\xe2\x80\x9d 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74121(a)(1), and specifically applied this tax to coal exports, see \xc2\xa74221(a) (1994 ed.) (excepting from the general ban on taxing exports those taxes imposed under, <em>inter alia</em>, \xc2\xa74121).  In 1998, a group of companies challenged the tax in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, contending that it violated the Export Clause of the Constitution.  That Clause provides that \xe2\x80\x9cNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl.\xc2\xa05.  The District Court agreed and held the tax unconstitutional.  <em>Ranger Fuel Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 33 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 466, 469 (1998).  The Government did not appeal, and the IRS acquiesced in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  See IRS Notice 2000\xe2\x80\x9328, 2000\xe2\x80\x931 Cum. Bull. 1116, 1116\xe2\x80\x931117 (IRS Notice).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The respondents here, three coal companies, had all paid taxes on coal exports under \xc2\xa74121(a) \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ince as early as 1978.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a.  After \xc2\xa74121(a) was held unconstitutional as applied to coal exports, the companies filed timely administrative claims in accordance with the refund scheme outlined above, seeking a refund of coal taxes they had paid in 1997, 1998, and 1999.  The IRS refunded those taxes, with interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies also filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking a refund of $1,065,936 in taxes paid between 1994 and 1996.  They did not file any claim for those taxes with the IRS; any such claim would of course have been denied, given the  limits set forth in \xc2\xa76511.  See IRS Notice, at 1117 (\xe2\x80\x9cClaims [for a refund of taxes paid under \xc2\xa74121] must be filed within the period prescribed by \xc2\xa76511\xe2\x80\x9d).  Notwithstanding the failure of the companies to file timely administrative refund claims, the Court of Federal Claims allowed the companies to pursue their suit directly under the Export Clause.  Jurisdiction rested on the Tucker Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71491(a)(1), and the companies limited their claim to taxes paid within that statute\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year limitations period, \xc2\xa72501 (2000 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In allowing the companies to proceed outside the confines of the Internal Revenue Code refund procedures, the court relied on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <em>Cyprus Amax Coal Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 205 F.\xc2\xa03d 1369 (2000).  <em>Andalex Resources, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 54 Fed. Cl. 563, 564 (2002).  The Court of Federal Claims did not, however, allow the companies to recover interest on the taxes paid under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72411.  That provision requires the Government to pay interest \xe2\x80\x9cfor any overpayment in respect of any internal-revenue tax,\xe2\x80\x9d but the court held that the statute applied only to refund claims brought under the Code, not to claims brought directly under the Export Clause.  54 Fed. Cl., at 566.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  It first refused to revisit its holding in <em>Cyprus Amax</em>, and therefore upheld the ruling that the companies could pursue their claim under the Export Clause, despite having failed to file timely administrative refund claims.  473 F.\xc2\xa03d 1373, 1374\xe2\x80\x931375 (CA Fed. 2007).  The Court of Appeals reversed the Court of Federal Claims interest holding, however, finding that the Government was required to pay the companies interest on the 1994\xe2\x80\x931996 amounts under \xc2\xa72411.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1376.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. __ (2007), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The outcome here is clear given the language of the pertinent statutory provisions.  Title 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77422(a) states that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[n]o suit</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be maintained in <em>any court</em> for the recovery of <em>any internal revenue tax </em>alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of <em>any penalty</em> claimed to have been collected without authority, or of <em>any sum</em> alleged to have been excessive or <em>in any manner </em>wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund \xe2\x80\xa6 has been duly filed with\xe2\x80\x9d the IRS.  (Emphasis added.)  Here the companies did not file a refund claim with the IRS for the 1994\xe2\x80\x931996 taxes, and therefore may bring \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o suit\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cany court\xe2\x80\x9d to recover \xe2\x80\x9cany internal revenue tax\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cany sum\xe2\x80\x9d alleged to have been wrongfully collected \xe2\x80\x9cin any manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Five \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d in one sentence and it begins to seem that Congress meant the statute to have expansive reach.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the time limits for filing administrative refund claims in \xc2\xa76511\xe2\x80\x94set forth in an \xe2\x80\x9cunusually emphatic form,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brockamp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/347/index.html">519 U. S. 347</a>, 350 (1997)\xe2\x80\x94apply to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> tax imposed by this title,\xe2\x80\x9d 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76511(a) (emphasis added).  The statute further provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o credit or refund shall be allowed or made after the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed in subsection (a) \xe2\x80\xa6 unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76511(b)(1).  Again, this language on its face plainly covers the companies\xe2\x80\x99 claim for a \xe2\x80\x9crefund\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ctax[es] imposed by\xe2\x80\x9d Title 26, specifically 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74121.  The companies argue that these statutory provisions are ambiguous, Brief for Respondents 43\xe2\x80\x9345, but we cannot imagine what language could more clearly state that taxpayers seeking refunds of unlawfully assessed taxes must comply with the Code\xe2\x80\x99s refund scheme before bringing suit, including the requirement to file a timely administrative claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, we all but decided the question presented over six decades ago in <em>United States</em> v. <em>A. S. Kreider Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/313/443/index.html">313 U. S. 443</a> (1941).  Section 1113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, like the refund claim provision in \xc2\xa77422(a) of the current Code, prescribed that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,\xe2\x80\x9d and established a time limit for bringing suit once the claim-filing requirement had been met.  44 Stat. 116.  Like the companies here, A.\xc2\xa0S. Kreider had failed to file a tax-refund action within that limitations period.  See 313 U. S., at 446.  And, like the companies here, A.\xc2\xa0S. Kreider argued that it was instead subject only to the longer 6-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act.  <em>Id.</em>, at 447.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We rejected the claim, holding that the Tucker Act limitations period \xe2\x80\x9cwas intended merely to place an outside limit on the period within which all suits must be initiated\xe2\x80\x9d under that Act, and that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress left it open to provide less liberally for particular actions which, because of special considerations, required different treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We held that the limitations period in \xc2\xa71113(a) was \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely that type of provision,\xe2\x80\x9d finding that Congress created a shorter statute of limitations for tax claims because \xe2\x80\x9csuits against the United States for the recovery of taxes impeded effective administration of the revenue laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If such suits were allowed to be brought subject only to the 6-year limitations period in the Tucker Act, we explained, \xc2\xa71113(a) would have \xe2\x80\x9cno meaning whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 448.  So too here.  The refund scheme in the current Code would have \xe2\x80\x9cno meaning whatever\xe2\x80\x9d if taxpayers failing to comply with it were nonetheless allowed to bring suit subject only to the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s longer time bar.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies gamely argue for a different result here because the coal tax at issue was assessed in violation of the Export Clause of the Constitution.  They spend much of their brief arguing that the Export Clause itself creates a cause of action against the Government, which can be brought directly under the Tucker Act.  See Brief for Respondents 8\xe2\x80\x9325.  We need not decide this question here, because it does not matter.  If the companies\xe2\x80\x99 claims are subject to the Code provisions, those claims are barred whatever the source of the cause of action.  We there-\nfore turn to the companies\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that their claims\nare somehow exempt from the broad sweep of the Code provisions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies do not argue for such an exemption simply because their claims are based on a constitutional violation.  As they acknowledge, <em>id</em>., at 34, a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional claim can become time-barred just as any other claim can,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Block</em> v. <em>North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/273/index.html">461 U. S. 273</a>, 292 (1983).  Further, Congress has the authority to require administrative exhaustion before allowing a suit against the Government, even for a constitutional violation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ruckelshaus</em> v. <em>Monsanto Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/index.html">467 U. S. 986</a>, 1018 (1984); <em>Christian</em> v. <em>New York State Dept. of Labor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/614/index.html">414 U.

S. 752</a>, 766\xe2\x80\x93767 (1947).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles are fully applicable to claims of unconstitutional taxation, a point highlighted by what we have said in other cases about the Anti-Injunction Act.  That statute commands that (absent certain exceptions) \xe2\x80\x9cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a).  The \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions of this Court make it unmistakably clear that the constitutional nature of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s claim \xe2\x80\xa6 is of no consequence\xe2\x80\x9d to whether the prohibition against tax injunctions applies.  <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cAmericans United\xe2\x80\x9d Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/index.html">416 U. S. 752</a>, 759 (1974).  This is so even though the Anti-Injunction Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions impose upon the wronged taxpayer requirements at least as onerous as those mandated by the refund scheme\xe2\x80\x94the taxpayer must succumb to an unconstitutional tax, and seek recourse only after it has been unlawfully exacted.  We see no reason why compliance with straightforward administrative requirements and reasonable time limits to seek a refund once a tax has been paid should lead to a different result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies assert that Export Clause claims in particular must be treated differently from constitutional claims in general.  This is so, they argue, because the Clause is not simply a limitation on the taxing authority but a prohibition that \xe2\x80\x9ccarves one particular economic activity completely out of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 11.  That distinction is without substance and totally manipulable: If the pertinent authority is regarded as the power to tax exports, the Clause is indeed a complete prohibition on congressional power.  But if the pertinent authority is instead viewed as the \xe2\x80\x9cPower To lay and collect Taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01, then the Clause is properly regarded as a limitation on that power.  We do not question the importance of the Export Clause to the success of the enterprise in Philadelphia in 1787, see Brief for Respondents 11\xe2\x80\x9313, but we see no basis for treating taxes collected in violation of its terms differently from taxes challenged on other grounds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the companies more or less give up the game when they acknowledge that their claims are subject to the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.  See <em>id</em>., at 34.  The question is thus not whether the companies\xe2\x80\x99 refund claim under the Export Clause can be limited, but rather which limitation applies.  The companies are therefore left to argue that, despite the explicit and expansive statutory language described above, the refund scheme in Title 26 does not apply to their case as a matter of statutory interpretation.  We find this ambitious argument unavailing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies seek to support it by characterizing the refund scheme set out in the Code as \xe2\x80\x9cpro-government and revenue-protective,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally dubious\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to Export Clause cases.  <em>Id</em>., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  Given this potential constitutional infirmity, the companies argue, Congress could not have intended the refund scheme to apply to taxes assessed in violation of the Export Clause.  See <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 341 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  We disagree.  To begin with, any argument that Congress did not mean to require those in the companies\xe2\x80\x99 position to comply with the tax refund scheme runs into a powerful impediment, for \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xe2\x80\x98strong presumption\xe2\x80\x99 that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent is rebutted only in \xe2\x80\x98rare and exceptional circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ardestani</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/index.html">502 U. S. 129</a>, 135 (1991) (quoting <em>Rubin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/424/index.html">449 U. S. 424</a>, 430 (1981)).  As we have already explained, the language of the relevant statutes emphatically covers the facts of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, we see no constitutional problem at all.  Congress has indeed established a detailed refund scheme that subjects complaining taxpayers to various requirements before they can bring suit.  This scheme is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto advise the appropriate officials of the demands or claims intended to be asserted, so as to insure an orderly administration of the revenue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/269/index.html">283 U. S. 269</a>, 272 (1931), to provide that refund claims are made promptly, and to allow the IRS to avoid unnecessary litigation by correcting conceded errors.  Even when the constitutionality of a tax is challenged, taxing authorities do in fact have an \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly strong interest in financial stability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McKesson Corp.</em> v. <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/18/index.html">496 U. S. 18</a>, 37 (1990), an interest they may pursue through provisions of the sort at issue here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not see why invocation of the Export Clause would deprive Congress of the power to protect this \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly strong interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress may not impose a tax in violation of the Export Clause (or any other constitutional provision, for that matter).  But it is certainly within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to assure that allegations of taxes unlawfully assessed\xe2\x80\x94whether the asserted illegality is based upon the Export Clause or any other provision of law\xe2\x80\x94are processed in an orderly and timely manner, and that costly litigation is avoided when possible.  The companies\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the Code procedures are themselves excessively burdensome is belied by the companies\xe2\x80\x99 own invocation of those procedures for taxes paid within the Code\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period, which resulted in full refunds with interest.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a fallback argument, the companies maintain that even if the refund scheme applies to Export Clause cases generally, it does not \xe2\x80\x9capply to taxes that are, on their face, unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 39.  They rely for this proposition on <em>Enochs</em> v. <em>Williams Packing &amp; Nav. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/1/index.html">370 U. S. 1</a> (1962), a case dealing with the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a).  Despite that Act\xe2\x80\x99s broad and mandatory language, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cif it is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail, \xe2\x80\xa6 the attempted collection may be enjoined if equity jurisdiction otherwise exists.  In such a situation the exaction is merely in \xe2\x80\x98the guise of a tax.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  370 U. S., at 7 (quoting <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Standard Nut Margarine Co. of Fla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/284/498/index.html">284 U. S. 498</a>, 509 (1932)).  See also <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>Simon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/index.html">416 U. S. 725</a>, 745\xe2\x80\x93746 (1974) (reaffirming the \xe2\x80\x9cunder no circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d rule of <em>Williams Packing</em>).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the force of <em>Williams Packing</em>, the companies argue that the refund scheme should similarly be read as inapplicable to situations in which there are \xe2\x80\x9cno circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d under which the tax imposed could be held valid under the Export Clause.  The trouble with this is that \xc2\xa77422, the primary statute governing the refund process, is written much more broadly than \xc2\xa77421(a), the statute at issue in <em>Williams Packing</em>.  Section \xc2\xa77422(a) states that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o suit \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any <em>internal revenue tax</em> alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected \xe2\x80\xa6 until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the\xe2\x80\x9d IRS.  (Emphasis added.)  This language generally tracks that of the Anti-Injunction Act, which also applies to suits \xe2\x80\x9crestraining the assessment or collection of any <em>tax</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77421(a) (emphasis added).  But \xc2\xa77422(a) goes on to apply its prohibition against suit absent a proper refund claim to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any sum</em> alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Even if we agreed that a facially unconstitutional tax for purposes of the tax refund scheme is \xe2\x80\x9cmerely in \xe2\x80\x98the guise of a tax,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Williams Packing</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 7 (quoting <em>Standard Nut Margarine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 509), and therefore not a \xe2\x80\x9ctax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77422(a), it would nevertheless clearly fall into the broader category of \xe2\x80\x9cany sum \xe2\x80\xa6 in any manner wrongfully collected,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if we were to accept the companies\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the \xe2\x80\x9cunder no circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d limitation on the Anti-Injunction Act applies to the refund scheme, they still would not prevail.  We made clear in <em>Williams Packing</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of whether the Government has a chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined on the basis of the information available to it at the time of suit.  Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained.\xe2\x80\x9d  370 U. S., at 7.  A tax injunction suit, of course, is brought at the time the Government attempts to assess a tax on the taxpayer.  Thus, if we applied the <em>Williams Packing</em> \xe2\x80\x9cunder no circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d rule to the refund scheme, we would judge the Government\xe2\x80\x99s chances of success as of the time the tax was assessed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the companies seek refunds for taxes paid between 1994 and 1996.  At that time, the scope of the Export Clause was sufficiently debatable that we granted certiorari in 1996, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U. S. 843</a>, and again in 1998, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>United States Shoe Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/360/index.html">523 U. S. 360</a>, to clear it up.  What is more, the District Court that struck down the application of \xc2\xa74121(a) to coal exports partially relied on these cases in arriving at its decision, <em>Ranger Fuel Corp.</em>, 33 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d, at 469, and the IRS cited, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>International Business Machines</em>, <em>supra</em>, in its acquiescence notice, see IRS Notice, at 1116.  Indeed, we would think that if the unconstitutionality of the coal export tax were so obvious that the Government had no chance of prevailing, someone paying the tax\xe2\x80\x94such as these companies\xe2\x80\x94would have successfully challenged it earlier than 20 years after its enactment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore hold that the plain language of 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77422(a) and 6511 requires a taxpayer seeking a refund for a tax assessed in violation of the Export Clause, just as for any other unlawfully assessed tax, to file a timely administrative refund claim before bringing suit against the Government.  Because we find that the Court of Appeals erred in allowing the companies to bring suit seeking a refund for the 1994\xe2\x80\x931996 taxes, we do not reach the question whether the Court of Appeals also erred in awarding the companies interest on those amounts under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72411.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
