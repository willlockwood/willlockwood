C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  His presentence investigation report concluded that he was eligible for a sentencing enhancement as a \xe2\x80\x9ccareer offender\xe2\x80\x9d under United States Sentencing Guideline \xc2\xa74B1.1(a) because his offense qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  The District Court sentenced petitioner as a career offender, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Petitioner then filed a postconviction motion to vacate his sentence, arguing that his offense was not a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court denied the motion, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Petitioner next filed a petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court.  While his petition was pending, this Court held that the identically worded residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(b), was unconstitutionally vague, <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  The Court vacated and remanded petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case in light of <i>Johnson</i>.  On remand, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed again, distinguishing the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutionally vague residual clause from the residual clause in the Sentencing Guidelines. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Federal Sentencing Guidelines, including \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, are not subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from \xe2\x80\x9ctaking away someone\xe2\x80\x99s life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  Under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, laws that fix the permissible sentences for criminal offenses must specify the range of available sentences with \xe2\x80\x9csufficient clarity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Batchelder</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114\n.  In <i>Johnson</i>, this Court held that the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause fixed\xe2\x80\x94in an impermissibly vague way\xe2\x80\x94a higher range of sentences for certain defendants.  But the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences.  They merely guide the exercise of a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in choosing an appropriate sentence within the statutory range.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The limited scope of the void-for-vagueness doctrine in this context is rooted in the history of federal sentencing.  Congress has long permitted district courts \xe2\x80\x9cwide discretion to decide whether the offender should be incarcerated and for how long.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mistretta</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361\n.  Yet this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cnever doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220\n, nor suggested that a defendant can successfully challenge as vague a sentencing statute conferring discretion to select an appropriate sentence from within a statutory range, even when that discretion is unfettered, see <i>Batchelder</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 123, 126.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 departed from this regime by establishing several factors to guide district courts in exercising their sentencing discretion.  It also created the United States Sentencing Commission and charged it with establishing the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  Because the Guidelines have been rendered \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively advisory\xe2\x80\x9d by this Court, <i>Booker</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 245, they guide district courts in exercising their discretion, but do not constrain that discretion.  Accordingly, they are not amenable to vagueness challenges: If a system of unfettered discretion is not unconstitutionally vague, then it is difficult to see how the present system of guided discretion could be.  Neither do they implicate the twin concerns underlying vagueness doctrine\xe2\x80\x94providing notice and preventing arbitrary enforcement.  The applicable statutory range, which establishes the permissible bounds of the court\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing discretion, provides all the notice that is required.  Similarly, the Guidelines do not invite arbitrary enforcement within the meaning of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law, because they do not permit the sentencing court to prohibit behavior or to prescribe the sentencing ranges available.  Rather, they advise sentencing courts how to exercise their discretion within the bounds established by Congress.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The holding in this case does not render the advisory Guidelines immune from constitutional scrutiny, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Peugh</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, or render \xe2\x80\x9csentencing procedure[s]\xe2\x80\x9d entirely \xe2\x80\x9cimmune from scrutiny under the due process clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Williams</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n337 U.\xc2\xa0S. 241\n, n.\xc2\xa018.  This Court holds only that the Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a challenge under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Nor does this holding cast doubt on the validity of the other factors that sentencing courts must consider in exercising their sentencing discretion.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), (5)\xe2\x80\x93(7).  A contrary holding, however, would cast serious doubt on those other factors because many of them appear at least as unclear as \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  This Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the individualized sentencing required by those other factors is distinguishable from that required by the Guidelines.  It is far from obvious that \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness more than the other factors do, and neither the Guidelines nor the other factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all, which the Government concedes is constitutional.

He has ably discharged his responsibilities.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This Court has held that the Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from \xe2\x80\x9ctaking away someone\xe2\x80\x99s life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (citing <i>Kolender</i> v. <i>Lawson</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352\n\xe2\x80\x93358 (1983)).  Applying this standard, the Court has invalidated two kinds of criminal laws as \xe2\x80\x9cvoid for vagueness\xe2\x80\x9d: laws that <i>define</i> criminal offenses and laws that <i>fix</i> <i>the permissible sentences</i> for criminal offenses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the former, the Court has explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 357.  For the latter, the Court has explained that \xe2\x80\x9cstatutes fixing sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Batchelder</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114,\n123 (1979)\n), must specify the range of available sentences with \xe2\x80\x9csufficient clarity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 123; see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,\n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483 (1948)\n; cf. <i>Giaccio</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>,\n\n382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399 (1966)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Johnson</i>, we applied the vagueness rule to a statute fixing permissible sentences.  The ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, where applicable, required sentencing courts to increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prison term from a statutory maximum of 10 years to a minimum of 15 years.  That requirement thus fixed\xe2\x80\x94in an impermissibly vague way\xe2\x80\x94a higher range of sentences for certain defendants.  See <i>Alleyne</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (describing the legally prescribed range of available sentences as the penalty fixed to a crime).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the ACCA, however, the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences.  To the contrary, they merely guide the exercise of a court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in choosing an appropriate sentence within<i> </i>the statutory range.  Accordingly, the Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause.  The residual clause in \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)(2) therefore is not void for vagueness.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The limited scope of the void-for-vagueness doctrine in this context is rooted in the history of federal sentencing.  Instead of enacting specific sentences for particular fed-eral crimes, Congress historically permitted district courts \xe2\x80\x9cwide discretion to decide whether the offender should be incarcerated and for how long.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mistretta</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361,\n363 (1989)\n.  For most crimes, Congress set forth a range of sentences, and sentencing courts had \xe2\x80\x9calmost unfettered discretion\xe2\x80\x9d to select the actual length of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the customarily wide range\xe2\x80\x9d Congress had enacted.  <i>Id.</i>, at 364; see also, <i>e.g., Apprendi</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466\n\xe2\x80\x93482 (2000);<i> Williams</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n337 U.\xc2\xa0S. 241\n\xe2\x80\x93248 (1949).  That discretion allowed district courts to craft individualized sentences, taking into account the facts of the crime and the history of the defendant.  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]erious disparities in sentences .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. were common.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mistretta</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 365.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Yet in the long history of discretionary sentencing, this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cnever doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220,\n233 (2005)\n; see also, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Apprendi</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 481 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in imposing a judgment <i>within the range</i> prescribed by statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Giaccio</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 405, n.\xc2\xa08 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e intend to cast no doubt whatever on the constitutionality of the settled practice of many States to leave to juries finding defendants guilty of a crime the power to fix punishment within legally prescribed limits\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More specifically, our cases have never suggested that a defendant can successfully challenge as vague a sentencing statute conferring discretion to select an appropriate sentence from within a statutory range, even when that discretion is unfettered.  In fact, our reasoning in <i>Batchelder</i> suggests the opposite.  This Court considered in that case the constitutionality of two overlapping criminal provisions that authorized different maximum penalties for the same conduct.  442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  The Court held that the sentencing provisions were not void for vagueness because they specified the \xe2\x80\x9cpenalties available\xe2\x80\x9d and defined the \xe2\x80\x9cpunishment authorized\xe2\x80\x9d upon conviction for each crime.  <i>Id.</i>, at 123.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the statutes create[d] uncertainty as to which crime may be charged and therefore what penalties may be imposed, they d[id] so <i>to no greater extent than would a single statute authorizing various alternative punishments</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  By specifying \xe2\x80\x9cthe <i>range</i> of penalties that prosecutors and judges may seek and impose,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cfulfilled its duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 126 (citing <i>Evans</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 483; emphasis added).  Indeed, no party to this case suggests that a system of purely discretionary sentencing could be subject to a vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 departed from this regime by establishing several factors to guide district courts in exercising their traditional sentencing discretion.\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553<i>. </i> Congress in the same Act created the United States Sentencing Commission and charged it with establishing guidelines to be used for sentencing.  <i>Mis-tretta</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 367.  The result of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s work is the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which are one of the sentencing factors that the Act requires courts to consider.  \xc2\xa73553(a)(4).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Guidelines were initially binding on district courts, <i>Booker</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 233, but this Court in <i>Booker</i> rendered them \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively advisory,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 245.  Although the Guidelines remain \xe2\x80\x9cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\xe2\x80\x9d for sentencing, a sentencing court may no longer rely exclusively on the Guidelines range; rather, the court \xe2\x80\x9cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\xe2\x80\x9d and the other statutory factors.  <i>Gall</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 38,\n49,\n50 (2007)\n.  The Guidelines thus continue to guide district courts in exercising their discretion by serving as \xe2\x80\x9cthe framework for sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Peugh</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11), but they \xe2\x80\x9cdo not constrain th[at] discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because they merely guide the district courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion, the Guidelines are not amenable to a vagueness challenge.  As discussed above, the system of purely discretionary sentencing that predated the Guidelines was constitutionally permissible.  If a system of unfettered discretion is not unconstitutionally vague, then it is difficult to see how the present system of guided discretion could be.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The advisory Guidelines also do not implicate the twin concerns underlying vagueness doctrine\xe2\x80\x94providing notice and preventing arbitrary enforcement.  As to notice, even perfectly clear Guidelines could not provide notice to a person who seeks to regulate his conduct so as to avoid particular penalties within the statutory range.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Grayned</i> v. <i>City of Rockford</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104,\n108 (1972)\n.  That is because even if a person behaves so as to avoid an enhanced sentence under the career-offender guideline, the sentencing court retains discretion to impose the enhanced sentence.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Pepper</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476,\n501 (2011)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur post-<i>Booker</i> decisions make clear that a district court may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we held in <i>Irizarry </i>v. <i>United States</i>,<i> </i>\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 708 (2008)\n, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he due process concerns that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines no longer\xe2\x80\x9d apply.  <i>Id.</i>, at 714; see <i>id.</i>, at 713 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny expectation subject to due process protection .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that a criminal defendant would receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable Guidelines range did not survive our decision in [<i>Booker</i>], which invalidated the mandatory features of the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d).  All of the notice required is provided by the applicable statutory range, which establishes the permissible bounds of the court\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The advisory Guidelines also do not implicate the vagueness doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s concern with arbitrary enforcement.  Laws that \xe2\x80\x9cregulate persons or entities,\xe2\x80\x9d we have explained, must be sufficiently clear \xe2\x80\x9cthat those enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>FCC</i> v. <i>Fox Television Stations, Inc.</i>,\n\n567 U.\xc2\xa0S. 239,\n253 (2012)\n; see also <i>Grayned</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 108\xe2\x80\x93109 (\xe2\x80\x9cA vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters\xe2\x80\x9d to judges \xe2\x80\x9cfor resolution on an <i>ad\xc2\xa0hoc</i> and subjective basis\xe2\x80\x9d).  An unconstitutionally vague law invites arbitrary enforcement in this sense if it \xe2\x80\x9cleaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Giaccio</i>, 382 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 402\xe2\x80\x93403, or permits them to prescribe the sentences or sentencing range available, cf. <i>Alleyne</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legally prescribed range <i>is</i> the penalty affixed to the crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Guidelines, however, do not regulate the public by prohibiting any conduct or by \xe2\x80\x9cestablishing minimum and maximum penalties for [any] crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mistretta</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 396 (Sentencing Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cdo not bind or regulate the primary conduct of the public\xe2\x80\x9d)<i>.</i>  Rather, the Guidelines advise sentencing courts how to exercise their discretion within the bounds established by Congress.  In this case, for example, the District Court did not \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d the career-offender Guideline against petitioner.  It enforced\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on possession of a firearm by a felon\xe2\x80\x94which prohibited petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94and \xc2\xa7924(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s mandate of a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94which fixed the permissible range of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  The court relied on the career-offender Guideline merely for advice in exercising its discretion to choose a sentence within those statutory limits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence suggests that judges interpreting a vague sentencing Guideline might rely on \xe2\x80\x9cstatistical analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgut instinct,\xe2\x80\x9d or the judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cown feelings\xe2\x80\x9d to decide whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction is a crime of violence.  <i>Post</i>, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A judge granted unfettered discretion could use those same approaches in determining a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  Indeed, the concurrence notes that federal judges before the Guidelines considered their own \xe2\x80\x9cview[s] of proper sentencing policy,\xe2\x80\x9d among other considerations.  <i>Post,</i> at 11.  Yet we have never suggested that unfettered discretion can be void for vagueness.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, we hold that the advisory Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause and that \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is not void for vagueness.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our holding today does not render the advisory Guidelines immune from constitutional scrutiny.  This Court held in <i>Peugh</i>, for example, that a \xe2\x80\x9cretrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable to a defendant\xe2\x80\x9d violates the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause.  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  But the void-for-vagueness and <i>ex post facto</i> inquiries are \xe2\x80\x9canalytically distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 19) (distinguishing an <i>ex post facto</i> inquiry from a\n \nSixth Amendment inquiry).  Our <i>ex post facto</i> cases \xe2\x80\x9chave focused on whether a change in law creates a \xe2\x80\x98significant risk\xe2\x80\x99 of a higher sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  A retroactive change in the Guidelines creates such a risk because \xe2\x80\x9csentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d which establish \xe2\x80\x9cthe framework for sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 11).  In contrast, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires a different inquiry.  The question is whether a law regulating private conduct by fixing permissible sentences provides notice and avoids arbitrary enforcement by clearly specifying the range of penalties available.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttal that both doctrines are concerned with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fundamental justice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for United States 7, ignores the contours of our precedents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court has also recognized \xe2\x80\x9cin the <i>\n \nEighth Amendment</i> context\xe2\x80\x9d that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a vague sentencing factor in a capital case, even indirectly, \xe2\x80\x9ccan taint the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 43 (citing <i>Espinosa</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1079,\n1082 (1992)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>);<i> </i>emphasis added).

Our decision in <i>Espinosa </i>is thus inapposite, as it<i> </i>did not involve advisory Sentencing Guidelines or the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, our holding today also does not render \xe2\x80\x9csentencing procedure[s]\xe2\x80\x9d entirely \xe2\x80\x9cimmune from scrutiny under the due process clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i>, 337 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 252, n.\xc2\xa018; see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Townsend</i> v. <i>Burke</i>,\n\n334 U.\xc2\xa0S. 736,\n741 (1948)\n (holding that due process is violated when a court relies on \xe2\x80\x9cextensively and materially false\xe2\x80\x9d evidence to impose a sentence on an uncounseled defendant).  We hold only that the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, including \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, are not subject to a challenge under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to directing sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines, see \xc2\xa73553(a)(4)(A), Congress has directed them to consider a number of other factors in exercising their sentencing discretion, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), (5)\xe2\x80\x93(7).  The Government concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican judges have long made th[e] sorts of judgments\xe2\x80\x9d called for by the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors \xe2\x80\x9cin indeterminate-sentencing schemes, and this Court has never understood such discretionary determinations to raise vagueness concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 42.  Because the \xc2\xa73553 factors\xe2\x80\x94like the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94do not mandate any specific sentences, but rather guide the exercise of a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion within the applicable statutory range, our holding today casts no doubt on their validity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Holding that the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause, however, would cast serious doubt on their validity.  Many of these other factors appear at least as unclear as \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  For example, courts must assess \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for the sentence imposed\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve certain goals\xe2\x80\x94such as<i> </i>to \xe2\x80\x9creflect the seriousness of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpromote respect for the law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprovide just punishment for the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the most effective manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).  If petitioner were correct that \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause were subject to a vagueness challenge, we would be hard pressed to find these factors sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government tries to have it both ways, arguing that the individualized sentencing required by the other \xc2\xa73553(a) factors is different in kind from that required by the Guidelines.  \xe2\x80\x9cAn inscrutably vague advisory guideline,\xe2\x80\x9d it contends, \xe2\x80\x9cinjects arbitrariness into the sentencing process that is not found in the exercise of unguided discretion in a traditional sentencing system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for United States 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But it is far from obvious that the residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness any more than the statutory command that sentencing courts impose a sentence tailored, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cto promote respect for the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(A).  And neither the Guidelines nor the other \xc2\xa73553 factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all, which the Government concedes is constitutional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government also suggests that the Guidelines are not like the other \xc2\xa73553(a) factors \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they require a court to decide whether the facts of the case satisfy a legal standard in order to derive a specific numerical range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 22.  But that does not distinguish the other sentencing factors, which require courts to do the same thing.  Section 3553(a) states that district courts \xe2\x80\x9cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)].\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, the Guidelines generally offer more concrete advice in imposing a particular sentence and make it easier to review whether a court has abused its substantial discretion.  There is no sound reason to conclude that the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94but not \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s other sentencing factors\xe2\x80\x94are amenable to vagueness review.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because the advisory Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a due process vagueness challenge, \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is not void for vagueness.

The Guidelines establish a framework \xe2\x80\x9cunder which a set of inputs specific to a given case (the particular characteristics of the offense and offender) yiel[d] a predetermined output (a range of months within which the defendant [can] be sentenced).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).

A district court that incorrectly calculates the Guidelines range commits reversible procedural error, see <i>Gall</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51; a district court that imposes a sentence within the correct Guidelines range, by contrast, may be afforded a presumption that the sentence it has imposed is reasonable, see <i>Rita</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 347.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The importance of the Guidelines in this process, as we explained last Term, makes them \xe2\x80\x9cnot only the starting point for most federal sentencing proceedings but also the lodestar.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  In most cases, it is the range set by the Guidelines, not the minimum or maximum term of imprisonment set by statute, that specifies the number of years a defendant will spend in prison.  District courts impose a sentence within the Guidelines (or below the Guidelines based on a Government motion) over 80% of the time.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see 2015 Annual Report and 2015 Sourcebook of Federal Sen-tencing Statistics (20th ed.) (Figure G), online at http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/annual-reports-and-sourcebooks/2015/FigureG.pdf (as last visited Feb. 27, 2017).  And when Guidelines ranges change\xe2\x80\x94because the Guidelines themselves change, or because the court is informed of an error it made in applying them\xe2\x80\x94sentences change, too.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  See <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the Guidelines are, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in a real sense[,] the basis for the sentence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d imposed by the district court.  <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It follows from the central role that the Guidelines play at sentencing that they should be susceptible to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, an inscrutably vague Guideline implicates both of the concerns animating the prohibition on vagueness.  First, a district court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on such a Guideline deprives an ordinary person of \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the consequences of his actions.  See <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  A defendant is entitled to understand the legal rules that will determine his sentence.  But a vague Guideline is by definition impossible to understand.  Take the career-offender Guideline at issue here.  We explained in <i>Johnson</i> that the identically worded provision in the ACCA created \xe2\x80\x9cpervasive disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d among courts imposing sentences as to \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d that they were required to conduct.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The result was a law that was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98nearly impossible to apply consistently.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122,\n133 (2009)\n (Alito, J., concurring in judgment)).  An ordinary person cannot be expected to understand the consequences that such a shapeless provision will have on his sentence.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, and more importantly, a district court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a vague Guideline creates a serious risk of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> </i>See<i> Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  As set out above, although the Guidelines do not bind a district court as a <i>formal</i> matter, as a <i>functional</i> matter they \xe2\x80\x9canchor both the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion and the appellate review process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  It introduces an unacceptable degree of arbitrariness into sentencing proceedings to begin by applying a rule that is so vague that efforts to interpret it boil down to \xe2\x80\x9cguesswork and intuition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  One judge may conduct a statistical analysis to decide that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction is not a crime of violence.  Another may rely on gut instinct to conclude that it is.  Still a third may \xe2\x80\x9cthrow [our] opinions into the air in frustration, and give free rein to [her] own feelings\xe2\x80\x9d in making the decision.  <i>Derby</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1047,\n1049 (2011)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Importantly, that decision is the end of the ballgame for a criminal defendant.  Although he may ask the judge to vary downward from the Guidelines range, he must take the range as the starting point for his request.  He may ask for a month here or a month there, but he is negotiating from a baseline he cannot control or predict.  The result is a sentencing proceeding hopelessly skewed from the outset by \xe2\x80\x9cunpredictability and arbitrariness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  The Due Process Clause does not tolerate such a proceeding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider, by way of example, a hypothetical version of Beckles\xe2\x80\x99 own sentencing proceeding in which the commentary played no clarifying role.  Beckles was convicted of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), and sentenced to 360 months in prison.  That sentence sat at the bottom end of the applicable Guidelines range, factoring in the career-offender Guideline: 360 months to life.  But had the career-offender Guideline <i>not</i> applied to Beckles, the Guidelines range calculated by the District Court would have been significantly lower: 262 to 327 months.  See <i>Beckles </i>v. <i>United States</i>, Civ. No. 10\xe2\x80\x9323517 (SD Fla., Mar. 4, 2013), App. 129\xe2\x80\x93130.  Absent that Guideline, Beckles would have been sentenced to between 33 and 98 fewer months in prison.  The District Court admitted as much, explaining that had the Guideline not applied, she \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have imprisoned Beckles to 360 months\xe2\x80\x9d in prison.  <i>Id.</i>, at 149 (emphasis deleted).  Years of Beckles\xe2\x80\x99 life thus turned solely on whether the career-offender Guideline applied.  There is no meaningful way in which the Guideline exerted less effect on Beckles\xe2\x80\x99 sentence than did the statute setting his minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment; indeed, it was the Guidelines, not just the statute, that \xe2\x80\x9cfix[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d Beckles\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csentenc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d in every meaningful way.  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Nothing of substance, in other words, distinguishes the Guidelines from the kind of laws we held susceptible to vagueness challenges in <i>Johnson</i>; both law and Guideline alike operate to extend the time a person spends in prison.  The Due Process Clause should apply equally to each.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority brushes past this logic in its decision to shield the Guidelines from vagueness challenges.  In doing so, it casts our sentencing jurisprudence into doubt and upends the law of nearly every Court of Appeals to have considered this question.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  None of its explanations justify its novel and sweeping conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority first reasons that the Guidelines are not susceptible to vagueness challenges because they \xe2\x80\x9cdo not fix the permissible range of sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 5, but merely \xe2\x80\x9cguide district courts in exercising their discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 8.  But we have not embraced such formalism before, and the majority provides no coherent justification for its decision to do so here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, we have refused before to apply exactly the formalistic distinction that the majority now embraces.  In <i>Espinosa</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1079,\n1081 (1992)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), we held that a state\xe2\x80\x99s capital aggravating factor that was drafted in a manner \xe2\x80\x9cso vague as to leave the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor\xe2\x80\x9d violated the\n \nEighth Amendment.  The factor was unconstitutional, we explained, notwithstanding the fact that only the jury, not the judge, was instructed on the factor; that the judge, not the jury, made the final decision to sentence the defendant to death; and that the judge, in doing so, was not required to defer to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis kind of indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9ccreates the same potential for arbitrariness as the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1082.  In doing so, we effectively rejected just the argument the majority now embraces: that advisory guidelines lack the kind of binding legal effect that subject them to constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If there were any doubt that advisory sentencing guidelines are subject to constitutional limits, we dispelled it in <i>Peugh</i>, where we held that the Guidelines are amenable to challenges under the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause.  See 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  There, the Government argued that the \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the Guidelines rendered them immune from such claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).  But we rejected such an argument.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe federal system,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cadopts procedural measures intended to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable empirical evidence indicate[s] that the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Guidelines have the intended effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313).  We declined the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to limit our <i>ex post facto</i> jurisprudence to rules that, as a formal matter, \xe2\x80\x9cincrease[d] the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).  And we explained that a rule may exert \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98binding legal effect\xe2\x80\x99 through .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. procedural rules and standards for appellate review that, in combination, encourag[e] district courts to sentence within the guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 16).  It was not true, we concluded, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>; instead, the Guidelines were just fencelike enough\xe2\x80\x94just lawlike enough\xe2\x80\x94that they cannot be shielded from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same principle should dictate the same result in this case.  How can the Guidelines carry sufficient legal weight to warrant scrutiny under the\n \nEighth Amendment and the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause, but not enough to warrant scrutiny under the Due Process Clause?  Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hurlburt</i>, 835 F. 3d 715, 724 (CA7 2016) (en banc) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe see no principled way to distinguish <i>Peugh</i> on doctrinal grounds\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority offers no convincing answer.  It asserts that the Due Process Clause \xe2\x80\x9crequires a different inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d than these provisions do.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  But it does not explain why it views this as relevant to the constitutional status of the Guidelines.  A court considering a challenge to a criminal statute under the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause will apply a different legal standard than will a court considering a vagueness challenge to the same statute; that does not make the statute more or less susceptible to constitutional challenge in one context than the other.  Our opinion in <i>Peugh</i> is particularly difficult for the majority to escape, given that the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause, like the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against vagueness, is rooted in concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cfair warning\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fundamental fairness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  569 U. S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13).  The majority musters no persuasive explanation for why those concerns would have less force in this context than in that one.  That is because none exists.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority next posits that because courts have long sentenced defendants under purely discretionary regimes, there can be no vagueness concern with any system that, like the Guidelines regime, sets guideposts on the exercise of discretion.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But this argument fundamentally misunderstands the problem caused by a court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a vague sentencing guideline.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">True enough, for many years, federal courts relied on \xe2\x80\x9ca system of indeterminate sentencing\xe2\x80\x9d in criminal cases.  <i>Mistretta</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 363; see also K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9\xe2\x80\x9314 (1998).  Under such a scheme, a sentencing judge considers the full range of relevant aggravating and mitigating facts and circumstances, as well as his view of proper sentencing policy, and then imposes a sentence in light of those considerations.  See <i>Koon</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81,\n113 (1996)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the majority notes, no party here \xe2\x80\x9csuggests that a system of purely discretionary sentencing could be subject to a vagueness challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 7.  The majority reasons that the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94which limit the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion from what he otherwise would have enjoyed\xe2\x80\x94must therefore also be immune from vagueness attacks.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the majority misapprehends the nature of the constitutional infirmity that occurs when a sentencing judge relies on an inscrutably vague guideline.  A defendant who is sentenced under a purely discretionary regime does not face the prospect of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d by the sentencing judge, <i>Kolender</i>, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358; rather, he faces a fact- and context-sensitive determination informed by the exercise of reasoned judgment.  A defendant sentenced pursuant to an impossibly vague Guideline, by contrast, is put in an untenable position.  The \xe2\x80\x9clodestone\xe2\x80\x9d of his sentence\xe2\x80\x94the baseline against which the district court will assess his characteristics and his conduct\xe2\x80\x94is set by a rule that is impossible to understand.  Such a proceeding is the antithesis of due process.  See <i>Giaccio</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>,\n\n382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399,\n403 (1966)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cImplicit in [due process] is the premise that the law must be one that carries an understandable meaning with legal standards that courts must enforce\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is not reliance on discretion that makes a sentencing regime vague; it is reliance on an impenetrable rule as a baseline for the exercise of that discretion.  Reliance on a rule of this kind, whether set out in a statute or in a Guideline, does not comport with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordinary notions of fair play.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 4).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority ends by speculating that permitting vagueness attacks on the Guidelines would call into question the validity of many Guidelines, and even the factors that Congress has instructed courts to consider in imposing sentences.  See <i>ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In doing so, the major-ity once more resuscitates arguments we have already considered and dismissed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Johnson</i> confronted and rejected a version of this argument.  There, the Government contended that \xe2\x80\x9cdozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98grave risk,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable risk,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d terms that\xe2\x80\x94in its view\xe2\x80\x94were indistinguishable from the residual clause at issue in that case.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  We rejected the argument, explaining that such rules \xe2\x80\x9ccall[ed] for the application of a qualitative standard such as \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk\xe2\x80\x99 to real-world conduct; \xe2\x80\x98the law is full of instances where a man\xe2\x80\x99s fate depends on his estimating rightly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. some matter of degree.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Nash</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n229 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373,\n377 (1913)\n).  What rendered the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause unconstitutionally vague, we explained, was not that it required \xe2\x80\x9cgauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages <i>on a particular occasion</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d but that it required the application of an ambiguous standard \xe2\x80\x9cto an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Holding the residual clause unconstitutionally vague, in other words, cast no doubt on the dozens of laws elsewhere in the U. S. Code requiring the application of general standards to particular conduct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same is true here.  The sentencing factors described by the majority bear no similarity to the categorical risk analysis that the Court held unconstitutionally vague in <i>Johnson</i>, nor to any other statutes it has previously found vague.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 instruction to district courts to consider, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(1), bears little resemblance to statutes requiring subjective determinations as to whether conduct is \xe2\x80\x9cannoying\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Coates</i> v. <i>Cincinnati</i>,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611\n\xe2\x80\x93616 (1971); <i>United States</i> v. <i>L.

In that instance, a litigant might use the word vague in a general sense\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, imprecise or unclear\xe2\x80\x94in trying to establish that the sentencing decision was flawed.  That something is vague as a general matter, however, does not necessarily mean that it is vague within the well-established legal meaning of that term.  And it seems most unlikely that the definitional structure used to explain vagueness in the context of fair warning to a transgressor, or of preventing arbitrary enforcement, is, by automatic transference, applicable to the subject of sentencing where judicial discretion is involved as distinct from a statutory command.  See <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The existing principles for defining vagueness cannot be transported uncritically to the realm of judicial discretion in sentencing.
