CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>No error has been assigned by the railroad company upon this record, for the reason that the rulings to which the company took exceptions are all sustained by our decisions in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/84/294/case.html">Barnes v. Railroad Companies,</a></span></em> 17 Wall. 294, and <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/323/case.html">Stockdale v. Insurance Companies,</a></span></em> 20 Wall. 323.</p>\n<p>We think that the circuit court was right in holding that the only penalty to which the company was liable for default under sec. 122 of the Internal Revenue Act of June 30, 1864, 13 Stat. 284, as amended July 13, 1866, 14 <em>id.</em> 138, was that of $1,000 specially provided for in that section.  The penalty of five percent and interest at the rate of one percent per month, apply only to cases of default in the payment of duties upon incomes imposed by sec. 119 as amended.  13 <em>id.</em> 283; 14 <em>id.</em> 480.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed, the costs incident to each writ to be paid by the party suing it out.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
