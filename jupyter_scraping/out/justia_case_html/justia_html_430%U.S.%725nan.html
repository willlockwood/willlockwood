JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question for decision is how unearned premium reserves for accident and health (A&amp;H) insurance policies should be allocated between a primary insurer and a reinsurer for federal tax purposes.  We granted certiorari in these three cases to resolve a conflict between the Circuits and the Court of Claims.  425 U.S. 990 (1976).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>An insurance company is considered a life insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code if its life insurance reserves constitute more than 50% of its total reserves, IRC of 1954, \xc2\xa7 801(a), 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 801(a), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and qualifying companies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="728">Page 430 U. S. 728</a></p><p> are accorded preferential tax treatment. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  A company close to the 50% line will ordinarily achieve substantial tax savings if it can increase its life insurance reserves or decrease nonlife reserves so as to come within the statutory definition.</p>\n<p>The taxpayers here are insurance companies that assumed both life insurance risks and A&amp;H -- nonlife -- risks.  The dispute in these cases is over the computation for tax purposes of nonlife reserves.  The taxpayers contend that, by virtue of certain reinsurance agreements -- or treaties, to use the term commonly accepted in the insurance industry -- they have maintained nonlife reserves below the 50% level.  The Government argues that the reinsurance agreements do not have that effect, that the taxpayers fail to meet the 50% test, and that, accordingly, they do not qualify for preferential treatment. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="729">Page 430 U. S. 729</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Specifically, the dispute is over the unearned premium reserve, the basic insurance reserve in the casualty insurance business and an important component of "total reserves," as that term is defined in \xc2\xa7 801(c). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  A&amp;H policies of the type involved here generally are written for a two- or three-year term.  Since policyholders typically pay the full premium in advance, the premium is wholly "unearned" when the primary insurer initially receives it.  <em>See</em> Rev.Rul. 61-167, 1961-2 Cum.Bull. 130, 132.  The insurer\'s corresponding liability can be discharged in one of several ways:  granting future protection by promising to pay future claims; reinsuring the risk with a solvent insurer; or returning a <em>pro rata</em> portion of the premium in the event of cancellation.  Each method of discharging the liability may cost money.  The insurer thus establishes on the liability side of its accounts a reserve, as a device to help assure that the company will have the assets necessary to meet its future responsibilities.  <em>See</em> O. Dickerson, Health Insurance 604-605 (3d ed. 1968) (hereinafter Dickerson).  Standard accounting practice in the casualty field, made mandatory by all state regulatory authorities, calls </p><p><a class="page-number" name="730">Page 430 U. S. 730</a></p><p> for reserves equal to the gross unearned portion of the premium. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  A simplified example may be useful:  a policyholder takes out a three-year A&amp;H policy for a premium, paid in advance, of $360.  At first, the total $360 is unearned, and the insurer\'s books record an unearned premium reserve in the full amount of $360.  At the end of the first month, one thirty-sixth of the term has elapsed, and $10 of the premium has become "earned." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The unearned premium reserve may be reduced to $350.  Another $10 reduction is permitted at the end of the second month, and so on.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The reinsurance treaties at issue here assumed two basic forms. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Under the first form, Treaty I, the taxpayer served as reinsurer, and the "other party" was the primary insurer or "ceding company," in that it ceded part or all of its risk to the taxpayer.  Under the second form, Treaty II, the taxpayer served as the primary insurer and ceded a portion of the business to the "other party," that party being the reinsurer.  Both types of treaties provided that the other party </p><p><a class="page-number" name="731">Page 430 U. S. 731</a></p><p> would hold the premium dollars derived from A&amp;H business until such time as the premiums were earned -- that is, attributable to the insurance protection provided during the portion of the policy term that already had elapsed.  The other party also set up on its books the corresponding unearned premium reserve, relieving the taxpayer of that requirement.  In each case, the taxpayer and the other party reported their affairs annually in this fashion to both the Internal Revenue Service and the appropriate state insurance departments.  These annual statements were accepted by the state authorities without criticism.  Despite this acceptance, the Government argues here that the unearned premium reserves must be allocated or attributed for tax purposes from the other parties, as identified above, to the taxpayers, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] thereby disqualifying each of the taxpayers from preferential treatment.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>No. 75-1221, <em>United States v. Consumer Life Ins. Co.</em>  In 1957, Southern Discount Corp. was operating a successful consumer finance business.  Its borrowers, as a means of assuring payment of their obligations in the event of death or disability, typically purchased term life insurance and term A&amp;H insurance at the time they obtained their loans.  This insurance -- commonly known as credit life and credit A&amp;H -- is usually coextensive in term and coverage with the term and amount of the loan.  The premiums are generally paid in full </p><p><a class="page-number" name="732">Page 430 U. S. 732</a></p><p> at the commencement of coverage, the loan term ordinarily running for two or three years.  Prohibited from operating in Georgia as an insurer itself, Southern served as a sales agent for American Bankers Life Insurance Co., receiving in return a sizable commission for its services.</p>\n<p>With a view to participating as an underwriter and not simply as agent in this profitable credit insurance business, Southern formed Consumer Life Insurance Co., the taxpayer here, as a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Arizona, the State with the lowest capital requirements for insurance companies.  Although Consumer Life\'s low capital precluded it from serving as a primary insurer under Georgia law, it was nonetheless permitted to reinsure the business of companies admitted in Georgia.</p>\n<p>Consumer Life therefore negotiated the first of two reinsurance treaties with American Bankers.  Under Treaty I, Consumer Life served as reinsurer and American Bankers as the primary insurer or ceding company.  Consumer Life assumed 100% of the risks on credit life and credit A&amp;H business originating with Southern, agreeing to reimburse American Bankers for all losses as they were incurred.  In return, Consumer Life was paid a premium equivalent to 87 1/2% of the premiums received by American Bankers. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  But the mode of payment differed as between life and A&amp;H policies.  With respect to life insurance policies, American Bankers each month remitted to the reinsurer -- Consumer Life -- the stated percentage of all life insurance premiums collected during the prior month.  With respect to A&amp;H coverage, however, American Bankers each month remitted the stated percentage of the A&amp;H premiums earned during the prior month, the remainder to be paid on a <em>pro rata</em> basis over the balance of the coverage period.</p>\n<p>Again an example might prove helpful.  Assume that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="733">Page 430 U. S. 733</a></p><p> policyholder buys from American Bankers on January 1 a three-year credit life policy and a three-year credit A&amp;H policy, paying on that date a $360 premium for each policy.  On February 1, under Treaty I, American Bankers would be obligated to pay Consumer Life 87 1/2% of $360 for reinsurance of life risks.  This represents the total life reinsurance premium; there would be no further payments for life reinsurance.  But for A&amp;H reinsurance, American Bankers would remit on February 1 only the stated percentage of $10, since only $10 would have been earned during the prior month.  It would remit the same amount on March 1 for A&amp;H coverage provided during February, and so on for a total of 36 months.</p>\n<p>Treaty I permitted either party to terminate the agreement upon 30 days\' notice.  But termination was to be prospective; reinsurance coverage would continue on the same terms until the policy expiration date for all policies already executed.  This is known as a "runoff provision."</p>\n<p>Because it held the unearned A&amp;H premium dollars, and also under an express provision in Treaty I, American Bankers set up an unearned premium reserve equivalent to the full value of the premiums.  Meantime, Consumer Life, holding no unearned premium dollars, established on its books no unearned premium reserve for A&amp;H business. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Annual statements filed with the state regulatory authorities in Arizona and Georgia reflected this treatment of reserves, and the statements were accepted without challenge or disapproval.</p>\n<p>By 1962, Consumer Life had accumulated sufficient surplus to qualify under Georgia law as a primary insurer.  Treaty I was terminated, and Southern began placing its credit insurance business directly with Consumer Life.  The parties then negotiated Treaty II, under which American Bankers served as reinsurer of the A&amp;H policies issued by Consumer </p><p><a class="page-number" name="734">Page 430 U. S. 734</a></p><p> Life. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Ultimately, Consumer Life retained the lion\'s share of the risk, but Treaty II was set up in such a way that American Bankers held the premium dollars until they were earned.  This required rather complicated contractual provisions, since Consumer Life, as primary insurer, did receive the A&amp;H premium dollars initially.</p>\n<p>Roughly described, Treaty II provided as follows:  Consumer Life paid over the A&amp;H premiums when they were received.  American Bankers immediately returned 50% of this sum as a ceding commission meant to cover Consumer Life\'s initial expenses.  Then, at the end of each quarter, American Bankers paid to Consumer Life "experience refunds" based on claims experience.  If there were no claims, American Bankers would refund 47% of the total earned premiums.  If there were claims (and naturally there always were), Consumer Life received 47% less the sums paid to meet claims.  It is apparent that American Bankers would never retain more than 3% of the total earned premiums for the quarter.  Only if claims exceeded 47% would this 3% be encroached, but, even in that event, Treaty II permitted American Bankers to recoup its losses by reducing the experience refund in later quarters.  Actual claims experience never approached the 47% level.</p>\n<p>Again, since American Bankers held the unearned premiums, it set up the unearned premium reserve on its books.  Consumer Life, which initially had set up such a reserve at the time it received the premiums, took credit against them for the reserve held by American Bankers.  Annual statements filed by both companies consistently reflected this treatment of reserves under Treaty II, and at no time did state authorities take exception. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="735">Page 430 U. S. 735</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The taxable years 1958 through 1960, and 1962 through 1964, are at issue here.  For each of those years, Consumer Life computed its \xc2\xa7 801 ratio based on the reserves shown on its books and accepted by the state authorities.  According to those figures, Consumer Life qualified for tax purposes as a life insurance company.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined, however, that the A&amp;H reserves held by American Bankers should be attributed to Consumer Life, thereby disqualifying the latter from favorable treatment.  Consumer Life paid the deficiency assessed by the Commissioner and brought suit for a refund.  The Court of Claims, disagreeing with its trial judge, held for the taxpayer.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>No. 75-1260, <em>First Railroad &amp; Banking Company of Georgia v. United States.</em>  The relevant taxable entity in this case is First of Georgia Life Insurance Co., a subsidiary of the petitioner First Railroad &amp; Banking Co. of Georgia.  Georgia Life was party to a Treaty II type agreement, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] reinsuring its A&amp;H policies with an insurance company, another subsidiary of First Railroad. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  On the basis of the reserves carried on its books and approved by state authorities, Georgia Life qualified </p><p><a class="page-number" name="736">Page 430 U. S. 736</a></p><p> as a life insurance company for the years at issue here, 1961-1964.  Consequently First Railroad excluded Georgia Life\'s income from its consolidated return, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1504(b)(2) of the Code.  The Commissioner determined that Georgia Life did not qualify for life insurance company status or exclusion from the consolidated return, and so assessed a deficiency.  First Railroad paid and sued for a refund.  It prevailed in the District Court, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, relying heavily on <em>Economy Finance Corp. v. United States,</em> 501 F.2d 466 (CA7 1974), <em>cert. denied,</em> 420 U.S. 947, <em>rehearing denied,</em> 421 U.S. 922 (1975), <em>motion for leave to file second petition for rehearing pending,</em> No. 74-701.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>No. 75-1285, <em>United States v. Penn Security Life Ins. Co.</em>  Penn Security Life Insurance Co., a Missouri corporation, is, like Consumer Life, a subsidiary of a finance company.  Under three separate Treaty I type agreements, it reinsured the life and A&amp;H policies of three unrelated insurers during the years in question, 1963-1965.  The other companies reported the unearned premium reserves, and the Missouri authorities approved this treatment.  Because one of the three treaties did not contain a runoff provision like that present in <em>Consumer Life,</em> the Government conceded that the reserves held by that particular ceding company should not be attributed to the taxpayer.  But the other two treaties were similar in all relevant respects to Treaty I in <em>Consumer Life.</em>  After paying the deficiencies assessed by the Commissioner, Penn Security sued for a refund in the Court of Claims.  Both the trial judge and the full Court of Claims ruled for the taxpayer.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Government commences its argument by suggesting that these reinsurance agreements were sham transactions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="737">Page 430 U. S. 737</a></p><p> without economic substance, and therefore should not be recognized for tax purposes.  <em>See, e.g., Gregory v. Helvering,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/465/case.html">293 U. S. 465</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/470/case.html">293 U.

We do not think this is an accurate characterization.</p>\n<p>Both taxpayers who were parties to Treaty I agreements entered into them only after arm\'s-length negotiation with unrelated companies.  The ceding companies gave up a large portion of premiums, but, in return, they had recourse against the taxpayers for 100% of claims.  The ceding companies were not just doing the taxpayers a favor by holding premiums until earned.  This delayed payment permitted the ceding companies to invest the dollars, and, under the treaties, they kept all resulting investment income.  Nor were they mere "paymasters," as the Government contends, for indemnity reinsurance of this type does not relieve the ceding company of its responsibility to policyholders.  Had the taxpayers become insolvent, the insurer still would have been obligated to meet claims. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Treaty II also served most of the basic business purposes commonly claimed for reinsurance treaties.  <em>See</em> W. Hammond, Insurance Accounting Fire &amp; Casualty 86 (2d ed.1965); Dickerson 563 564.  It reduced the heavy burden on the taxpayer\'s surplus caused by the practice of computing casualty reserves on the basis of gross unearned premiums even though the insurer may have paid out substantial sums in commissions and expenses at the commencement of coverage.  By reducing this drain on surplus, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="738">Page 430 U. S. 738</a></p><p> taxpayer was able to expand its business, resulting in a broader statistical base that permitted more accurate loss predictions. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Through Treaty II, each taxpayer associated itself with a reinsurance company more experienced in the field.  Moreover, under Treaty II, the taxpayers were shielded against a period of catastrophic losses.  Even though the reinsurer would eventually recapture any such deep losses, it would be of substantial benefit to the ceding company to spread those payments out over a period of months or years.  Both courts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="739">Page 430 U.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Tax considerations well may have had a good deal to do with the specific terms of the treaties, but even a "major motive" to reduce taxes will not vitiate an otherwise substantial transaction.  <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Whether or not these were sham transactions, however, the Government would attribute the contested unearned premium reserves to the taxpayers, because it finds in \xc2\xa7 801(c)(2) a rule that "insurance reserves follow the insurance risk."  Brief for United States 34.  This assertion, which forms the heart of the Government\'s case, is based on the following reasoning.  Section 801 provides a convenient test for determining whether a company qualifies for favorable tax treatment as a life insurance company, a test determined wholly by the ratio of life reserves to total reserves.  Reserves, under accepted accounting and actuarial standards, represent liabilities.  Although often carelessly referred to as "reserve funds," or as being available to meet policyholder claims, reserves are not assets; they are entered on the liability side of the balance sheet.  Under standard practice, they are mathematically equivalent to the gross unearned premium dollars already </p><p><a class="page-number" name="740">Page 430 U. S. 740</a></p><p> paid in, but conceptually the reserve a liability -- is distinct from the cash asset.  This much of the argument is indisputably sound.</p>\n<p>The Government continues:  since a reserve is a liability, it is simply an advance indicator of the final liability for the payment of claims.  The company that finally will be responsible for paying claims -- the one that bears the ultimate risk -- should therefore be the one considered as having the reserves.  In each of these cases, the Government argues, it was the taxpayer that assumed the ultimate risk.  The other companies were merely paymasters holding on to the premium dollars until earned in return for a negligible percentage of the gross premiums.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We may assume for present purposes that the taxpayers did take on all substantial risks under the treaties. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  And, in the broadest sense, reserves are, of course, set up because of future risks.  <em>Cf. Helvering v. Le Gierse,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/531/case.html">312 U. S. 531</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/531/case.html#539">312 U. S. 539</a></span> (1941).  The question before us, however, is not whether the Government\'s position is sustainable as a matter of abstract logic. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Rather it is whether Congress intended a "reserves follow the risk" rule to govern determinations under \xc2\xa7 801. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 430 U. S. 741</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is no suggestion in the plain language of the section that this is the case.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F1" name="T1">1 and <l=|430 a="" u<="">| </l=|430></a><a href="#F1" name="T1">1 and <l=|430 a="" u<="">S. 725fn4|&gt;4, <em>supra.</em>  If anything, the language is a substantial obstacle to accepting the Government\'s position.  The word "risk" does not occur.  Moreover, in \xc2\xa7 801(c)(2), Congress used the phrase "unearned premiums," rather than "unearned premium reserve."  The Government argues that, taken in context, "unearned premiums" must be regarded as referring to reserves -- to the liability account for unearned premium reserves, and not the asset represented by the premium dollars.  We agree that the reference is to reserves, but still the use of the truncated phrase suggests that Congress intended a mechanical application of the concept.  In other words, this phrase suggests that, in Congress\' view, unearned premium reserves always would be found in the same place as the unearned premiums themselves.  If so, reserves would follow mechanically the premium dollars, as taxpayers contend, and would not necessarily follow the risk. \xef\xbf\xbd </l=|430></a><a href="#F1" name="T1">1 and <l=|430 a="" u<="">S. 742\xef\xbf\xbd</l=|430></a></p><a href="#F1" name="T1">\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The rather sparse legislative history furnishes no better support for the Government\'s position.  Under the early Revenue Acts, all insurance companies were taxed on the same basis as other corporations.  Both investment income and premium or underwriting income were included in gross income, although there was a special deduction for additions to reserves.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Revenue Act of 1918, \xc2\xa7 234(a)(10), 40 Stat. 1079.</p>\n</a><p><a href="#F1" name="T1">By 1921, Congress became persuaded that this treatment did not accurately reflect the nature of the life insurance enterprise, since life insurance is often a form of savings for policyholders, similar in some respects to a bank deposit.  <em>See</em> Hearings on H.R. 8245 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 83 (1921) (testimony of Dr. T. S. Adams, Tax Adviser to Treasury Department).  Under this view, premium receipts "were not true income [to the life insurance company], but were analogous to permanent capital investment."  <em>Helvering v. Oregon Mutual Life Ins. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"></span></a><a href="/cases/federal/us/311/267/case.html">311 U. S. 267</a>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/311/267/case.html#269">311 U. S. 269</a></span> (1940).  The 1921 Act therefore provided, for the first time, that life insurance companies would be taxed on investment income alone, and not on premium receipts.  Revenue Act of 1921, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 242-245, 42 Stat. 261.  The same rationale did not apply to other forms of insurance, and Congress continued to tax insurance companies other than life on both underwriting and investment income.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 246-247.</p>\n<p>The 1921 Act was thus built on the assumption that important differences between life and nonlife insurance called for markedly different tax treatment.  Strict adherence to this policy rationale would dictate that any company insuring both types of risks be required to segregate its life and nonlife business so that appropriate tax rules could be applied to each.  Congress considered this possibility, but chose instead </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 430 U. S. 743</a></p><p> a more convenient rule of thumb, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] the 50% reserve ratio test. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The Treasury official primarily responsible for the 1921 Act explained:</p>\n<p>"Some companies mix with their life business accident and health insurance.  It is not practicable for all companies to disassociate those businesses, so that we have assumed that, if this accident and health business was more than 50 per cent of their business, as measured by their reserves, it could not be treated as a life insurance company.  On the other hand, if their accident and health insurance were incidental, and represented less than 50 percent of their business, we treated them as a life insurance company."</p>\n<p>1921 Hearings, <em>supra</em> at 85 (testimony of Dr. T. S. Adams).  This passage constitutes the only significant reference to the test in the 1921 deliberations.</p>\n<p>In succeeding years, controversy developed over the preferential treatment enjoyed by life insurance companies.  There were claims that they were not carrying their fair share of the tax burden.  There were charges that stock companies were favored over mutuals, or vice versa.  There was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 430 U. S. 744</a></p><p> a nagging question over just how to compute a proper deduction for additions to reserves.  Congress tried a host of different formulas to ameliorate these problems.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 34, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-7 (1959); S.Rep. No. 291, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 3-11 (1959); <em>Alinco Life Ins. Co. v. United States,</em> 178 Ct.Cl. 813, 831-837, 373 F.2d 336, 345-349 (1967).  But throughout these years the 50% test was not significantly changed. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1959, Congress passed legislation that finally established a permanent tax structure for life insurance companies.  Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 112.  For the first time since 1921, not only investment income, but also a portion of underwriting income, was made subject to taxation. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  But even as Congress was rewriting the substantive provisions for taxing life insurance companies, it did not, despite occasional calls for change, [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] make any relevant alterations in \xc2\xa7 801.  Moreover, the few references to that provision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="745">Page 430 U. S. 745</a></p><p> in the committee reports shed little light on the issue presented here. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  They contain no explicit or implicit support for a rule that reserves follow the risk.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>More important than anything that appears in hearings, reports, or debates is a provision added in 1959, \xc2\xa7 820, concerning modified coinsurance contracts between life insurance companies. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  This section, although designed to deal with a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 430 U. S. 746</a></p><p> problem different from the one presented here, is simply unintelligible if Congress thought that \xc2\xa7 801 embodied an unvarying rule that reserves follow the risk.</p>\n<p>A conventional coinsurance contract is a particular form of indemnity reinsurance. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  The reinsurer agrees to reimburse the ceding company for a stated portion of obligations arising out of the covered policies.  In return, the reinsurer receives a similar portion of all premiums received by the insurer, less a ceding commission to cover the insurer\'s overhead.  The reinsurer sets up the appropriate reserve for its proportion of the obligation and, as is customary, the ceding company takes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 430 U. S. 747</a></p><p> credit against its reserves for the portion of the risks reinsured.  A modified coinsurance contract is a further variation in this esoteric area of insurance.  As explained before the Senate Finance Committee, a modified form of coinsurance developed because some major reinsurers were not licensed to do business in New York, and New York did not permit a ceding company to take credit against its reserves for business reinsured with unlicensed companies.  Hearings on H.R. 4245 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 608 (1959) (statement of Henry F. Rood).  Denial of credit places the ceding company in an undesirable position.  It has depleted its assets by paying to the reinsurer the latter\'s portion of premiums, but its liability account for reserves remains unchanged.  Few companies would accept the resulting drain on surplus, and unlicensed reinsurers wishing to retain New York business began offering a modified form of coinsurance contract. Obligations would be shared as before, but the ceding company, which must in any event maintain 10% of the reserves, would be permitted to retain and invest the assets backing the reserves.  As consideration for this right of retention, modified coinsurance contracts require the ceding company to pay to the reinsurer, under a complicated formula, the investment income on the reinsurer\'s portion of the investments backing the reserve.  <em>See id.</em> at 609; E. Wightman, Life Insurance Statements and Accounts 150-151 (1952); D. McGill, Life Insurance 43540 (rev. ed.1967).</p>\n<p>The 1959 legislation, as it passed the House, contained no special treatment for these modified contracts.  The income involved therefore would have been taxed twice, once as investment income to the ceding company and then as underwriting income to the reinsurer. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The Senate thought this double taxation inequitable, and therefore added \xc2\xa7 820, to which the House agreed.  That section provides that, for tax </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 430 U. S. 748</a></p><p> purposes, modified coinsurance contracts shall be treated the same as conventional coinsurance contracts if the contracting parties consent to such treatment.  For consenting companies, Congress not only provided that gross investment income shall be treated as if it were received directly (in appropriate share) by the reinsurer, \xc2\xa7 820(c)(1), but also expressly declared that the reserves "shall be treated as a part of the reserves of the reinsurer and not of the reinsured."  \xc2\xa7 820(c)(3).</p>\n<p>Under a modified coinsurance contract, the reinsurer bears the risk on its share of the obligations.  Thus, if \xc2\xa7 801 mandates that reserves follow the risk, the reinsurer could not escape being considered as holding its share of the reserve.  Section 820(c)(3), providing for attribution of the reserves to the reinsurer, would be an elaborate redundancy.  And although \xc2\xa7 820(a)(2) specifics that attribution under \xc2\xa7 820 is optional, requiring the consent of the parties, the parties would, in fact, have no option at all.  Plainly, \xc2\xa7 820 is incompatible with a view that \xc2\xa7 801 embodies a rule that reserves follow the risk. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="749">Page 430 U. S. 749</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Commissioner himself, interpreting \xc2\xa7 801 in light of \xc2\xa7 820, has implicitly acknowledged that reserves do not follow the risk.  Rev.Rul. 70-508, 1970-2 Cum.Bull. 136.  Advice was requested by the parties to a modified coinsurance contract who had not elected the special treatment available under \xc2\xa7 820.  The ceding company had carried the life insurance reserves on its books, although the reinsurer bore the ultimate risk.  The ceding company wanted to know whether it could count those reserves in its ratio for purposes of \xc2\xa7 801.  Relying on \xc2\xa7 801(b) and the Treasury Regulations implementing it, the Commissioner ruled that it could.  A "reserves follow the risk" rule would have dictated precisely the opposite result.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 820 affords an unmistakable indication that \xc2\xa7 801 does not impose the "reserves follow the risk" rule.  Instead, Congress intended to rely on customary accounting and actuarial practices, leaving, as \xc2\xa7 820 makes evident, broad discretion to the parties to a reinsurance agreement to negotiate their own terms.  This does not open the door to widespread abuse.</p>\n<p>"Congress was aware of the extensive, continuing supervision of the insurance industry by the states.

In presenting the 1959 legislation to the full House, members of the committee that drafted the bill were careful to underscore the continuing primacy of state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="750">Page 430 U. S. 750</a></p><p> regulation, with specific reference to the question of reserves. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  In two of the cases before us, the courts below expressly found that the reserves were held in accordance with accepted actuarial and accounting standards, [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] while the third court did not address the issue.  In all three, it was found that no state insurance department required any change in the way the taxpayers computed and reported their reserves. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  Since the taxpayers neither held the unearned premium dollars nor set up the corresponding unearned premium reserves, and since that treatment was in accord with customary practice as policed by the state regulatory authorities, we hold that \xc2\xa7 801(c)(2) does not permit attribution to the taxpayers of the reserves held by the other parties to the reinsurance treaties. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Government argues that even if attribution of reserves is not required under \xc2\xa7 801(c)(2), attribution is required </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 430 U.

While these treaties were in effect, each company was examined twice, Consumer Life in 1959 and 1963 and American Bankers in 1960 and 1963.  The Court of Claims found that the reinsurance treaties were examined in detail, and that the provisions for maintenance of reserves were approved in the course of all four examinations.  207 Ct.Cl. at 647, 524 F.2d at 1172.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Some of the details differ from Treaty II in <em>Consumer Life,</em> but the differences are not important for present purposes.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government does not seek to base attribution of reserves on this relationship.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Treaty I type reinsurance is therefore different from the relation of agent and insurer found in <em>Superior Life Ins. Co. v. United States,</em> 462 F.2d 945 (CA4 1972) (credit A&amp;H premiums were held by the finance company until earned, and only then paid to the insurance company; the court held that, under state law, the finance company was a mere agent, and the insurance company would be treated as holding the unearned premium reserve).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Surplus drain may be illustrated by the following example:  a company issues a one-year A&amp;H policy for a premium of $120, paying its agent a $60 commission at the time of issuance.  The state insurance department will require the company to set up a reserve on the liability side of its balance sheet equivalent to the gross unearned premium -- $120 at the beginning of coverage.  But after paying the commission, the company shows a cash asset of only $60.  The $60 difference results in a $60 decrease in surplus.</p>\n<p>As each month elapses, $10 -- one-twelfth of the annual premium -- becomes "earned," and is therefore released from the reserve.  A company whose business is level, writing new policies only as an equivalent number of old policies expire, will therefore experience no surplus drain, assuming that claims experience is within the expected range; the <em>pro rata</em> release from reserves as premiums become earned will match the burden imposed by new policies.  But companies whose business is expanding, and especially new companies, will have a continuing surplus-drain problem.  <em>See generally</em> Dickerson 606; <em>Utah Home Fire Inc. Co. v. Commissioner,</em> 64 F.2d at 764; n. 20, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>Reinsurance can provide amelioration.  Assume the company in the example above reinsures half its business under a treaty with simpler provisions than Treaty I or Treaty II.  This treaty calls for the reinsurer to establish a reserve equal to 50% of the gross unearned premium in return for immediate payment of 50% of the primary insurer\'s net premium income.  The primary company then takes credit against its reserve for the business ceded; its reserve is reduced from $120 to $60.  At the same time, it remits half its net income, $30, retaining a cash asset of $30.  Each policy written on this basis therefore drains surplus only by $30, the difference between the $60 reserve and the $30 asset.  Under the treaty, the company can issue twice as many policies as before for the same total depletion in surplus.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Consumer Life,</em> No. 75-1221, Pet. for Cert. 97a-98a, 100a, 105a (Findings of Fact Nos. 18, 19, 25, 37); <em>First Railroad,</em> No. 75-1260, Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a (District Court finding of fact accepted by the Court of Appeals, 514 F.2d at 677).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government also relies on an asserted analogy to <em>Commissioner v.

And if any risk that may be called substantial is sufficient to permit the parties to escape the attribution for which the Government argues, then surely a Government victory here would be short-lived.  <em>Cf. Commissioner v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/563/case.html">380 U.

The premium charged the policyholder consists of two parts, an expense portion, or "loading," to cover commissions, administrative expenses, and profit, and a claims portion.  Only the latter, the net premium or "morbidity" element, represents the company\'s estimate of what it must now take in and invest to meet its responsibilities as claims arise; that is, only the latter represents the company\'s risk.  The expense portion is relatively fixed.  Nearly all of it is paid out, for commissions and administrative expenses connected with issuing the policy, at the time the premiums are received.  Since these expenses already have been paid, the only future liabilities for which a reserve strictly is needed are claims.  Nevertheless, state insurance departments uniformly require that A&amp;H reserves be set up equivalent to the gross unearned premium.  A&amp;H reserves thus stand on a different footing from life insurance reserves, which are typically computed on the basis of mortality tables and assumed rates of interest.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 801(b).  Life reserves contain no loading element.</p>\n<p>Although gross unearned premium reserves may not strictly comport with a logic of risk, from the viewpoint of insurance regulators this approach yields advantages in simplicity of computation.  Establishing the larger reserve also tends to assure conservative operation and the availability of means to pay refunds in the event of cancellation.  <em>See generally</em> Mayerson, Ensuring the Solvency of Property and Liability Insurance Companies, in Insurance, Government and Social Policy 146, 171-172 (S. Kimball &amp; H. Denenberg eds.1969); Dickerson 604 606; <em>Utah Home Fire Ins. Co. v.

United States,</em> 501 F.2d 466 (CA7 1974), relied too heavily on its reading of that policy in finding that unearned premium reserves should be attributed from the ceding company to the reinsurer in a Treaty I type agreement.  <em>See Penn Security,</em> 207 Ct.Cl. at 608, 524 F.2d at 1162.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 242 of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 261, provided:</p>\n<p>"That when used in this title the term \'life insurance company\' means an insurance company engaged in the business of issuing life insurance and annuity contracts (including contracts of combined life, health, and accident insurance), the reserve funds of which held for the fulfillment of such contracts comprise more than 50 per centum of its total reserve funds."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1942, Congress did add a definition of "total reserves," specifying the same three elements that appear in the definition today.

But we do not think this after-the-fact testimony from single officials should outweigh the formal, official approval rendered under the names of the commissioners after opportunity for full review.

Those cases held that certain reserves mandated by state insurance authorities were not reserves "required by law" within the meaning of the early Revenue Acts, because they were not technical insurance reserves.  In those cases, however, the question was not whether the taxpayers qualified for preferential tax treatment.  Rather, the question was whether the taxpayers would be allowed a deduction for additions to various reserves, and the skeletal provisions of the earlier Acts necessitated a restrictive view.  <em>See McCoach, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/585/case.html#589">244 U.

Moreover, those early cases generally have little bearing on questions that arise under the more recent enactments.  The definition of "life insurance reserves" that now appears in \xc2\xa7 801(b), and which originated with the 1942 Revenue Act, substantially replaced the problematic concept of technical reserves developed in <em>McCoach.</em> <em>See United States v.

They are long-term risks that increase over the period of coverage and that will ultimately require the payment of a claim.  Companies that assume life insurance risks therefore must accumulate substantial reserve funds to meet future claims; these reserve funds are invested, and a large portion of the investment income is then added to the funds already accumulated.  In recognition of the special </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 430 U. S. 754</a></p><p> characteristics of life insurance risks, Congress has allowed a substantial portion of life insurance company income to escape taxation. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Other types of insurance, such as the accident and health (A&amp;H) coverage provided by the taxpayers in these cases, do not involve the assumption of long-term risks that inevitably will require the payment of benefits at some point in the relatively distant future.  Consequently, Congress has provided for taxation of such nonlife insurance companies in much the same manner as any other corporation.  <em>See</em> Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 831, 832, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 831, 832.  Many companies mix nonlife insurance business with their life insurance business, and Congress has decided to tax such "mixed" enterprises according to whether the majority of the company\'s business is life or nonlife:</p>\n<p>"[I]f this accident and health business was more than 50 per cent of their business, as measured by their reserves, it could not be treated as a life insurance company.  On the other hand, if their accident and health insurance were incidental and represented less than 50 per cent of their business, we treated them as a life insurance company."</p>\n<p>Hearings on H.R. 8245 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 85 (1921) (testimony of Dr. T. S. Adams, Tax Adviser to the Treasury Department), also quoted <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#743">430 U.

S. 755</a></p><p> In order to measure the proportion of life insurance business done by an insurance company, Congress used the fraction of total insurance reserves consisting of life insurance reserves, as defined by \xc2\xa7 801.  The purpose of this reserve ratio test is, of course, to determine whether a majority of an insurance company\'s business is life insurance. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>More than 50% of the business of the taxpayer insurance companies for the taxable years in question here was nonlife, rather than life, insurance business as measured by the reserves accumulated to cover all life and nonlife risks assumed by the taxpayers. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The taxpayers sought to obtain preferential treatment as life insurance companies under \xc2\xa7 801 by arranging with other companies to hold the necessary reserves for the taxpayers.  I agree with the majority that these arrangements had economic substance in that the companies holding the reserves performed two additional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="756">Page 430 U. S. 756</a></p><p> functions for the taxpayers:  a clearinghouse function, collecting premiums and paying out claims, and a financing function, lending the difference between the reserves established for the policy and the premiums, less selling expenses, received from the policyholder.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#737">430 U.

But I cannot agree that these arrangements enable the taxpayers to qualify for tax savings Congress intended to give only to insurance companies whose predominant business is the assumption of insurance risks.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority holds that the taxpayers may obtain these tax savings despite the predominantly nonlife character of their insurance business,</p>\n<p>"[s]ince the taxpayers neither held the unearned [A&amp;H] premium dollars nor set up the corresponding unearned premium reserves, and since that treatment was in accord with customary practice as policed by the state regulatory authorities. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#750">430 U. S. 750</a></span>.  This rule would permit an A&amp;H insurance company to qualify for preferential treatment as a life insurance company by selling a few life policies and then arranging, by means similar to those employed here, for a third party to hold the A&amp;H premiums and the corresponding reserves.  Under the majority\'s rule, these reserves held by the third party to cover risks assumed by the A&amp;H company would not be attributed to that company; its total reserves for purposes of \xc2\xa7 801 would consist almost entirely of whatever life insurance reserves it held; and the company would satisfy the reserve ratio test. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="757">Page 430 U. S. 757</a></p><p> cannot believe that Congress intended to allow an insurance company to shelter its nonlife insurance income from taxation merely by assuming an incidental amount of life insurance risks and engaging another company to hold its reserves through arrangements with the requisite economic substance and state regulatory approval to satisfy the standard announced by the majority today.</p>\n<p>The language of \xc2\xa7 801 and its accompanying regulations does not require such a result.  Section 801(a) provides that any insurance company may qualify as a life insurance company "if <em>its</em> life insurance reserves . . . comprise more than 50 percent of <em>its</em> total reserves . . ." (emphasis added); \xc2\xa7 801(c)(2) includes "unearned premiums" in the definition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="758">Page 430 U. S. 758</a></p><p> of "total reserves" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 801(a).  It is clear that, as required by Treasury Regulations, unearned premium reserves were set up to "cover the cost of carrying the [A&amp;H] insurance risk for the period for which the premiums have been paid in advance," Treas.Reg. \xc2\xa7 1.801-3(e) (1972), and that these reserves "have been actually held during the taxable year[s]" at issue here.  \xc2\xa7 1.801-5(a)(3) (1960).  The question is whether the A&amp;H reserves set up to cover risks assumed by each taxpayer are considered to be "its" reserves even though they are in the physical possession and under the nominal control of another company.</p>\n<p>The Regulations explicitly answer this question in the affirmative for life insurance reserves:</p>\n<p>"[Life insurance] <em>reserves held by the company with respect to the net value of risks reinsured in other solvent companies . . . shall be deducted from the company\'s life insurance reserves.</em>  For example, if an ordinary life policy with a reserve of $100 is reinsured in another solvent company on a yearly renewable term basis, and the reserve on such yearly renewable term policy is $10, the reinsured company shall include $90 ($100 minus $10) in determining its life insurance reserves."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1.801-4(a)(3) (1972). (Emphasis added.)  <em>Accord,</em> \xc2\xa7 1.801-4(d)(5).  Thus, for purposes of the reserve ratio test of \xc2\xa7 801, life insurance reserves are attributable to the company assuming the risk under a reinsurance agreement.  The same attribution rule should be used in calculating the denominator of the reserve ratio (life plus nonlife reserves) as for the numerator (life reserves); as the majority recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#748">430 U. S. 748</a></span> n. 30, there is no reason not to adopt a consistent approach to allocation of both life and nonlife reserves in determining life insurance company status.</p>\n<p>The rule that life and nonlife reserves are attributable to the risk bearer reflects the familiar principles of cases such as <em>Lucas v. Earl,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/111/case.html">281 U. S. 111</a></span> (1930), where income earned by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 430 U. S. 759</a></p><p> a taxpayer was attributed to him notwithstanding a contractual arrangement under which the income was paid over to a third party.  In that case, the salary derived from the taxpayer\'s business activity was treated as "his" income even though he did not receive or hold it.  Similarly, the reserves applicable to the A&amp;H insurance business of each of the taxpayers here should be treated as "its" reserves.  <em>Cf. Commissioner v. Hansen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/446/case.html">360 U. S. 446</a></span> (1959). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority insists nonetheless that these predominantly nonlife insurance companies be given preferential tax treatment intended only for predominantly life insurance companies.  To reach this result, the majority relies not on the language or legislative history of the \xc2\xa7 801 reserve ratio test, but on \xc2\xa7 820 of the Code, which was added nearly 40 years after the reserve ratio test was adopted and which gives life insurance companies the choice of whether to have reserves </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 430 U. S. 760</a></p><p> under certain "modified coinsurance contracts" attributed to the reinsurer who bears the risk or to the reinsured who holds the reserves under the contract.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#745">430 U. S. 745</a></span>-748.  The majority finds this section at once "redundan[t]" and "incompatible" with the Commissioner\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 801.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#748">430 U. S. 748</a></span>.  What the majority overlooks is that \xc2\xa7 820 applies <em>only</em> to companies that have <em>already qualified as life insurance companies</em> by virtue of \xc2\xa7 801; it prescribes not how those companies qualify for life insurance company status, but rather how they are to be taxed once they have qualified for such status -- specifically, how they can avoid double taxation on investment income received by the reinsurer but paid over to the reinsured pursuant to the particular type of reinsurance contract defined in \xc2\xa7 820(b).  The option to attribute reserves for these contracts either to the reinsurer or the reinsured is given only to life insurance companies which qualify under \xc2\xa7 801, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 820(b)(1), and is expressly made inapplicable "for purposes of section 801" in determining whether they so qualify, \xc2\xa7 820(a)(1).</p>\n<p>The majority notes that \xc2\xa7 820(a)(1) denies insurance companies the choice of how to allocate their modified coinsurance contract reserves for purposes of the \xc2\xa7 801 reserve ratio test, but interprets this exception to \xc2\xa7 820 to "[mean] that, for purposes of \xc2\xa7 801, the reserves are invariably treated as held by the ceding company. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#748">430 U. S. 748</a></span> n. 30.  This "explanation" simply assumes the conclusion that the majority is attempting to justify:  what the parties to these cases are arguing about is whether, for \xc2\xa7 801 purposes, reserves are invariably attributable to the company holding them, rather than to the company bearing the risks that the reserves were set up to cover.  Mandatory attribution to the risk-bearer under \xc2\xa7 801 is just as consistent with the inapplicability of the \xc2\xa7 820 option as is mandatory attribution to the holder of those reserves, and is more consistent with the attribution rule prescribed by the Regulations for life insurance reserves.  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="761">Page 430 U. S. 761</a></p><p> <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#758">430 U. S. 758</a></span>.  Moreover, the definition of nonlife reserves under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 801(c)(2) and (3) is explicitly made applicable only "[f]or purposes of [the] subsection [801](a)" reserve ratio test.  The attribution rule at issue in these cases thus does not apply to the \xc2\xa7 820 rules for taxing the income of life insurance companies from modified coinsurance contracts (or to the taxation of any other insurance income).  In short, the majority\'s conclusion that \xc2\xa7 820 "affords an unmistakable indication" of congressional intent with respect to attribution of reserves under \xc2\xa7 801, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#749">430 U. S. 749</a></span>, is refuted by the language of the Code itself. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Life insurance company taxable income is calculated by a complicated three-stage process outlined in <em>Jefferson Standard Life Ins.

The end result of these intricate calculations is a substantial narrowing of the tax base of such companies.  <em>See</em> Clark, The Federal Income Taxation of Financial Intermediaries, 84 Yale L.J. 1603, 1637-1664 (1975).

But, as the Court of Claims below in No. 71221 observed, the goal of state insurance regulation is not to protect the federal treasury from tax avoidance by insurance companies doing predominantly nonlife business, but rather to protect policyholders by making sure that funds are set aside out of premium receipts for payment of claims.  207 Ct.Cl. at 645, 524 F.2d at 1171.  The majority suggests no reason why, as long as the insurer has made some arrangement for the establishment of reserves, the state regulatory authorities will care who holds them.</p>\n<p>The majority\'s hope that the States will prevent insurance companies from taking advantage of the loophole it has created is further undermined by its holding that the A&amp;H reserves involved in these cases were not attributable to the taxpayers under \xc2\xa7 801(c)(3) as "other insurance reserves required by [state] law."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#750">430 U.

The majority relies on this failure of state regulatory authorities to require inclusion of the A&amp;H reserves in the taxpayers\' annual statements, despite uncontradicted testimony of state insurance officials that the reason for this failure was the state officials\' unfamiliarity with these particular arrangements purporting to shift reserves to non-risk-bearing companies.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#751">430 U.

To cover this risk of loss, the dealers retained a portion of the purchase price of the obligations as a reserve.  The funds in these reserve accounts were ultimately paid over to the dealers, less amounts applied to cover the losses from nonpayment.  The Court held that these reserve accounts were income that accrued to the dealers when the accounts were established, because, at that time, the reserve funds "were vested in and belonged to the respective dealers, subject only to their . . . contingent liabilities to the finance companies."  360 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/446/case.html#463">360 U.

These reserves, like the dealer reserves held by the finance companies in <em>Hansen,</em> should be attributed to the risk bearers for tax purposes.</p>\n<p>The majority distinguishes <em>Hansen</em> by fiat, stating only that "[l]ife insurance accounting is a world unto itself."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/725/case.html#739">430 U.
