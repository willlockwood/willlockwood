The court denied a motion to dismiss based on a claim of immunity under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Speech or Debate Clause, and the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  The Office then sought to appeal under \xc2\xa7412 of the Act, which authorizes review in this Court of \xe2\x80\x9cany \xe2\x80\xa6 judgment \xe2\x80\xa6 upon the constitutionality of any provision\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0This Court lacks jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7412 because neither the dismissal denial nor the D.\xc2\xa0C.

The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order does not state any grounds for decision, so it cannot be characterized as a constitutional holding.  Moreover, neither the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of the Office\xe2\x80\x99s argument that forcing the Senator to defend against Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s allegations would necessarily contravene the Speech or Debate Clause, nor that court\xe2\x80\x99s leaving open the possibility that the Clause may limit the proceedings\xe2\x80\x99 scope in some respects, qualifies as a ruling on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s validity.

MARK DAYTON V. HANSON<br/>\n550 U. S. ____ (2007)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 06-618<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">OFFICE OF SENATOR MARK DAYTON, APPELLANT <em>v.</em>\nBRAD HANSON</p>\n<p align="left">on appeal from the united states court of appeals\nfor the district of columbia circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[May 21, 2007]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to January 3, 2007, Mark Dayton represented the State of Minnesota in the United States Senate.  Appellee, Brad Hanson, was employed in the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s Ft. Snelling office prior to his discharge by the Senator, which he alleges occurred on July 3, 2002.  Hanson brought this action for damages against appellant, the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s office (Office), invoking the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (Act), 109 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa71301 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), and alleging violations of three other federal statutes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The District Court denied appellant\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the complaint based on a claim of immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Fields</em> v. <em>Office of Eddie Bernice Johnson, Employing Office, United States Congress,</em> 459 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (CADC 2006), the Office invoked our appellate jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7412 of the Act, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71412, and we postponed consideration of jurisdiction pending hearing the case on the merits, 549 U. S. ___ (2007).  Because we do not have jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7412, we dismiss the appeal.  Treating appellant\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional statement as a petition for a writ of certiorari, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa7412 of the Act, direct review in this Court is available \xe2\x80\x9cfrom any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of a court upon the constitutionality of any provision\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Neither the order of the District Court denying appellant\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss nor the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming that order can fairly be characterized as a ruling \xe2\x80\x9cupon the constitutionality\xe2\x80\x9d of any provision of the Act.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s minute order denying the motion to dismiss does not state any grounds for decision.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a.  Both parties agree that that order cannot, therefore, be characterized as a constitutional holding.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion rejects appellant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that forcing Senator Dayton to defend against the allegations in this case would necessarily contravene the Speech or Debate Clause, although it leaves open the possibility that the Speech or Debate Clause may limit the scope of the proceedings in some respects.  Neither of those holdings qualifies as a ruling on the validity of the Act itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Office argues that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding amounts to a ruling that the Act is constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cas applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the Office, an \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional holding of that sort satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of \xc2\xa7412.  We find this reading difficult to reconcile with the statutory scheme.  Section 413 of the Act provides that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he authorization to bring judicial proceedings under [the Act] shall not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity for any other purpose, or of the privileges of any Senator or Member of the House of Representatives under [the Speech or Debate Clause] of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71413.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis provision demonstrates that Congress did not intend the Act to be interpreted to permit suits that would otherwise be prohibited under the Speech or Debate Clause.  Consequently, a court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that jurisdiction attaches despite a claim of Speech or Debate Clause immunity is best read as a ruling on the scope of the Act, not its constitutionality.  This reading is faithful, moreover, to our established practice of interpreting statutes to avoid constitutional difficulties.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/371/index.html">543 U. S. 371</a>, 381\xe2\x80\x93382 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision for appellate review is best understood as responding to a congressional concern that if a provision of the statute is declared invalid there is an interest in prompt adjudication by this Court.  To extend that review to instances in which the statute itself has not been called into question, giving litigants under the Act preference over litigants in other cases, does not accord with that rationale.  This is also consistent with our cases holding that \xe2\x80\x9cstatutes authorizing appeals are to be strictly construed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Perry Ed. Assn.</em> v. <em>Perry Local Educators\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/index.html">460 U. S. 37</a>, 43 (1983); see also <em>Fornaris</em> v. <em>Ridge Tool Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/41/index.html">400 U. S. 41</a>, 42, n.\xc2\xa01 (1970) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are there special circumstances that justify the exercise of our discretionary certiorari jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 affirmance of the interlocutory order entered by the District Court.  Having abandoned its decision in <em>Browning</em> v. <em>Clerk, U. S. House of Representatives</em>, 789 F.\xc2\xa02d 923 (1986), the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit is no longer in obvious conflict with any other Circuit on the application of the Speech or Debate Clause to suits challenging the personnel decisions of Members of Congress.  Compare 459 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (case below), with <em>Bastien</em> v. <em>Office of Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell</em>, 390 F.\xc2\xa03d 1301 (CA10 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction and certiorari is denied.  We express no opinion on the merits, nor do we decide whether this action became moot upon the expiration of Senator Dayton\xe2\x80\x99s term in office.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Appellee alleged violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 6, as amended, 29 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa72601 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 337, 42 U.
