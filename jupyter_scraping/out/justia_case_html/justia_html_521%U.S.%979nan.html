Appellants sued the county and others in the Federal District Court, claiming that \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required that the most recent change be precleared. A three-judge court held that preclearance was not required because the county was simply exercising its discretion to adjust the procedure according to party power; concluded that the Justice Department\'s preclearance of a 1985 submission of Texas\' recodified election code operated to preclear the county\'s use of partisan considerations; denied injunctive relief; and later dismissed appellants\' complaint.</p><p>Held: The District Court\'s decision is inconsistent with this Court\'s precedents.

The fact that the county\'s new procedures used political party affiliation as the selection criterion does not mean that the methods were exempt from preclearance.</p><p>Second, the State\'s 1985 submission (the recodification and a 30-page summary of changes to the old law) indicated that the only change being made to the statute concerning election judges was a change to "the beginning date and duration of [their] appointment." Thus, neither the recodified statute nor the State\'s explanations said anything about the use of specific, partisan-affiliation methods for selecting election judges. This submission was clearly insufficient under our precedents to put the Justice Department on notice that the State was seeking preclearance of the use of partisan affiliations in selecting election judges. See, <i>e. g., Young </i>v. <i>Fordice, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/520/273/case.html">520 U. S. 273</a>, 286-287 (1997); <i>Lopez </i>v. <i>Monterey County, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/519/9/case.html">519 U.

We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court in No. 96-1389, dismiss the appeal from the District Court\'s interlocutory judgment in No. 96987, see <i>Shaffer </i>v. <i>Carter, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/37/case.html">252 U.
