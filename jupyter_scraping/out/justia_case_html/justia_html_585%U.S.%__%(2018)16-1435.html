Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7211B.11(1) (Supp. 2017).  This \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical apparel ban\xe2\x80\x9d covers articles of clothing and accessories with political insignia upon them.

In response to the lawsuit, the State distributed an Election Day Policy to election officials providing guidance on enforcement of the ban.  The Election Day Policy specified examples of prohibited apparel to include items displaying the name of a political party, items displaying the name of a candidate, items supporting or opposing a ballot question, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ssue oriented material designed to influence or impact voting,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aterial promoting a group with recognizable political views.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert.

A polling place in Minnesota qualifies as a nonpublic forum under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  As such it may be subject to content-based restrictions on speech, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Cornelius</i> v. <i>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,</i>\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 788, 806\xe2\x80\x93811, so long as the restrictions are \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s view,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Perry Ed. Assn.</i> v. <i>Perry Local Educators\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.,</i>\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37, 46.  Because the text of the statute makes no distinction based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s political persuasion, the question is whether the apparel ban is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum\xe2\x80\x9d: voting.  <i>Cornelius</i>, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 806.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on political apparel serves a permissible objective.  In <i>Burson</i> v. <i>Freeman,</i>\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 191, the Court upheld a Tennessee law imposing a 100-foot zone around polling place entrances in which no person could solicit votes, distribute campaign materials, or \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay . . . campaign posters, signs or other campaign materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S., at 193\xe2\x80\x93194 (plurality opinion).  In finding that the law withstood even strict scrutiny, the <i>Burson </i>plurality\xe2\x80\x94whose analysis was endorsed by Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concurring in the judgment\xe2\x80\x94emphasized the problems of fraud, voter intimidation, confusion, and general disorder that had plagued polling places in the past.  Against that historical backdrop, the plurality and Justice Scalia upheld Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a campaign-free zone outside the polls was necessary to secure the advantages of the secret ballot and protect the right to vote.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">MVA argues that <i>Burson </i>considered only active campaigning outside the polling place by campaign workers and others trying to engage voters approaching the polls, while Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s ban prohibits passive self-expression by voters themselves when voting.  But although the plurality and Justice Scalia in <i>Burson </i>did not expressly address the application of the Tennessee law to apparel\xe2\x80\x94or consider the interior of the polling place as opposed to its environs\xe2\x80\x94the Tennessee law swept broadly to ban even the plain \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xe2\x80\x9d of a campaign-related message, and the <i>Burson </i>Court upheld the law in full.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the State was warranted in designating an area for the voters as \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own\xe2\x80\x9d as they enter the polling place, <i>id.,</i> at 210, suggests an interest more significant, not less, within that place.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">No basis exists for rejecting Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s determination that some forms of campaign advocacy should be excluded from the polling place in order to set it aside as \xe2\x80\x9can island of calm in which voters can peacefully contemplate their choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 43.  Casting a vote is a weighty civic act, and the State may reasonably decide that the interior of the polling place should reflect the distinction between voting and campaigning.  And while the Court has noted the \xe2\x80\x9cnondisruptive\xe2\x80\x9d nature of expressive apparel in more mundane settings, see, <i>e.g., Board of Airport Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Jews for Jesus, Inc.</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569, 576, those observations do not speak to the unique context of a polling place on Election Day.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0But the line the State draws must be reasonable.  The State therefore must be able to articulate some sensible basis for distinguishing what may come in from what must stay out.  The unmoored use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d in the Minnesota law, combined with haphazard interpretations the State has provided in official guidance and representations to this Court, cause Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s restriction to fail this test.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The statute does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical,\xe2\x80\x9d a word that can broadly encompass anything \xe2\x80\x9cof or relating to government, a government, or the conduct of governmental affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1755.  The State argues that the apparel ban should be interpreted more narrowly to proscribe \xe2\x80\x9conly words and symbols that an objectively reasonable observer would perceive as conveying a message about the electoral choices at issue in [the] polling place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 13.  At the same time, the State argues that the category of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d apparel is not limited to campaign apparel.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Court considers a State\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative constructions in interpreting a state law.  But far from clarifying the indeterminate scope of the provision, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celectoral choices\xe2\x80\x9d construction introduces confusing line-drawing problems.  For specific examples of what messages are banned under that standard, the State points to the Election Day Policy.  The first three categories of prohibited items in the Policy are clear.  But the next category\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cissue oriented material designed to influence or impact voting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94raises more questions than it answers.  The State takes the position that any subject on which a political candidate or party has taken a stance qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of that category.  Such a rule\xe2\x80\x94whose fair enforcement requires an election judge to maintain a mental index of the platforms and positions of every candidate and party on the ballot\xe2\x80\x94is not reasonable.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The next broad category in the Election Day Policy\xe2\x80\x94any item \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting a group with recognizable political views\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94makes matters worse.  The State does not confine that category to groups that have endorsed a candidate or taken a position on a ballot question.  As a result, any number of associations, educational institutions, businesses, and religious organizations could have an opinion on an \xe2\x80\x9cissue confronting voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  The State represents that the ban is limited to apparel promoting groups with \xe2\x80\x9cwell-known\xe2\x80\x9d political positions.  But that requirement only increases the potential for erratic application, as its enforcement may turn in significant part on the background knowledge of the particular election judge applying it.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">It is \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that an indeterminate prohibition carries with it \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he opportunity for abuse, especially where [it] has received a virtually open-ended interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jews for Jesus</i>, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 576.  The discretion election judges exercise in enforcing the ban must be guided by objective, workable standards.  Without them, an election judge\xe2\x80\x99s own politics may shape his views on what counts as \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical.\xe2\x80\x9d  And if voters experience or witness episodes of unfair or inconsistent enforcement of the ban, the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in maintaining a polling place free of distraction and disruption would be undermined by the very measure intended to further it.  Thus, if a State wishes to set its polling places apart as areas free of partisan discord, it must employ a more discernible approach than the one offered by Minnesota here.

Little about this ritual would have been familiar to a voter in the mid-to-late nineteenth century.  For one thing, voters typically deposited pri- vately prepared ballots at the polls instead of completing official ballots on-site.  These pre-made ballots often took the form of \xe2\x80\x9cparty tickets\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94printed slates of candidate selections, often distinctive in appearance, that political parties distributed to their supporters and pressed upon others around the polls.  See E. Evans, A History of the Australian Ballot System in the United States 6\xe2\x80\x9311 (1917) (Evans); R. Bensel, The American Ballot Box in the Mid-Nineteenth Century 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (2004) (Bensel).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The physical arrangement confronting the voter was also different.  The polling place often consisted simply of a \xe2\x80\x9cvoting window\xe2\x80\x9d through which the voter would hand his ballot to an election official situated in a separate room with the ballot box.  Bensel 11, 13; see, <i>e.g., </i>C. Rowell, Digest of Contested-Election Cases in the Fifty-First Congress 224 (1891) (report of Rep. Lacey) (considering whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to reach the window and actually tender the ticket to the [election] judges\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cessential in all cases to constitute a good offer to vote\xe2\x80\x9d); Holzer, Election Day 1860, Smithsonian Magazine (Nov. 2008), pp. 46, 52 (describing the interior voting window on the third floor of the Springfield, Illinois courthouse where Abraham Lincoln voted).  As a result of this arrangement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual act of voting was usually performed in the open,\xe2\x80\x9d frequently within view of interested onlookers.  Rusk, The Effect of the Australian Ballot Reform on Split Ticket Voting: 1876\xe2\x80\x931908, Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 1220, 1221 (1970) (Rusk); see Evans 11\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As documented in <i>Burson</i> v. <i>Freeman</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 191 (1992), \xe2\x80\x9c[a]pproaching the polling place under this system was akin to entering an open auction place.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Id.,</i> at 202 (plurality opinion).  The room containing the ballot boxes was \xe2\x80\x9cusually quiet and orderly,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he public space outside the window .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was chaotic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bensel 13.  Electioneering of all kinds was permitted.  See <i>id.</i>, at 13, 16\xe2\x80\x9317; R. Dinkin, Election Day: A Documentary History 19 (2002).  Crowds would gather to heckle and harass voters who appeared to be supporting the other side.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the informal conventions of the period, election etiquette required only that a \xe2\x80\x98man of ordinary courage\xe2\x80\x99 be able to make his way to the voting window.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bensel 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn short, these early elections were not a very pleasant spectacle for those who believed in democratic government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Burson,</i> 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By the late nineteenth century, States began implementing reforms to address these vulnerabilities and improve the reliability of elections.  Between 1888 and 1896, nearly every State adopted the secret ballot.  See <i>id.,</i> at 203\xe2\x80\x93205.  Because voters now needed to mark their state-printed ballots on-site and in secret, voting moved into a sequestered space where the voters could \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate and make a decision in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rusk 1221; see Evans 35; 1889 Minn. Stat. ch. 3, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x9328, p. 21 (regulating, as part of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s secret ballot law, the arrangement of voting compartments inside the polling place).  In addition, States enacted \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoint-neutral restrictions on election-day speech\xe2\x80\x9d in the immediate vicinity of the polls.  <i>Burson,</i> 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 214\xe2\x80\x93215 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (by 1900, 34 of 45 States had such restrictions).  Today, all 50 States and the District of Columbia have laws curbing various forms of speech in and around polling places on Election Day.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s such law contains three prohibitions, only one of which is challenged here.  See Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7211B.11(1) (Supp. 2017).  The first sentence of \xc2\xa7211B.11(1) forbids any person to \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay campaign material, post signs, ask, solicit, or in any manner try to induce or persuade a voter within a polling place or within 100 feet of the building in which a polling place is situ- ated\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cvote for or refrain from voting for a candidate or ballot question.\xe2\x80\x9d  The second sentence prohibits the distribution of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical badges, political buttons, or other political insignia to be worn at or about the polling place.\xe2\x80\x9d  The third sentence\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical apparel ban\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94states that a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical badge, political button, or other political insignia may not be worn at or about the polling place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Versions of all three prohibitions have been on the books in Minnesota for over a century.  See 1893 Minn. Laws ch. 4, \xc2\xa7108, pp. 51\xe2\x80\x9352; 1912 Minn. Laws, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 3, p. 24; 1988 Minn.

And petitioner Cilek\xe2\x80\x94who was wearing the same button and a T-shirt with the words \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Tread on Me\xe2\x80\x9d and the Tea Party Patriots logo\xe2\x80\x94was twice turned away from the polls altogether, then finally permitted to vote after an election judge recorded his information.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Back in court, MVA and the other plaintiffs (now joined by Cilek) argued that the ban was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to their apparel.  The District Court granted the State\xe2\x80\x99s motions to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  <i>Minnesota Majority </i>v. <i>Mansky</i>, 708 F.\xc2\xa03d 1051 (2013).  In evaluating MVA\xe2\x80\x99s facial challenge, the Court of Appeals observed that this Court<i> </i>had previously upheld a state law restricting speech \xe2\x80\x9crelated to a political campaign\xe2\x80\x9d in a 100-foot zone outside a polling place; the Court of Appeals determined that Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law likewise passed constitutional muster.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1056\xe2\x80\x931058<i> </i>(quoting <i>Burson</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197 (plurality opinion)).  The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied challenge, however, finding that the District Court had improperly considered matters outside the pleadings.  708 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1059.  Judge Shepherd concurred in part and dissented in part.  In his view, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s broad restriction on political apparel did not \xe2\x80\x9crationally and reasonably\xe2\x80\x9d serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interests.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1062.  On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment for the State on the as-applied challenge, and this time the Court of Appeals affirmed.  <i>Minnesota Majority </i>v. <i>Mansky</i>, 849 F.\xc2\xa03d 749 (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">MVA, Cilek, and Jeffers (hereinafter MVA) petitioned for review of their facial\n \nFirst Amendment claim only.

It therefore implicates our \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98forum based\xe2\x80\x99 approach for assessing restrictions that the government seeks to place on the use of its property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lee</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 672, 678 (1992) (<i>ISKCON</i>).  Generally speaking, our cases recognize three types of government-controlled spaces: traditional public forums, designated public forums, and nonpublic forums.  In a traditional public forum\xe2\x80\x94parks, streets, sidewalks, and the like\xe2\x80\x94the government may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on private speech, but restrictions based on content must satisfy strict scrutiny, and those based on viewpoint are prohibited.  See <i>Pleasant Grove City</i> v. <i>Summum</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460, 469 (2009).  The same standards apply in designated public forums\xe2\x80\x94spaces that have \xe2\x80\x9cnot traditionally been regarded as a public forum\xe2\x80\x9d but which the government has \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally opened up for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 469\xe2\x80\x93470.  In a nonpublic forum, on the other hand\xe2\x80\x94a space that \xe2\x80\x9cis not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the government has much more flexibility to craft rules limiting speech.  <i>Perry Ed. Assn.</i> v. <i>Perry Local Educators\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.</i>,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37, 46 (1983).  The government may reserve such a forum \xe2\x80\x9cfor its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court employs a distinct standard of review to assess speech restrictions in nonpublic forums because the government, \xe2\x80\x9cno less than a private owner of property,\xe2\x80\x9d retains the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Adderley</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 39, 47 (1966).  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the Constitution requires the Government freely to grant access to all who wish to exercise their right to free speech on every type of Government property without regard to the nature of the property or to the disruption that might be caused by the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cornelius</i> v. <i>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 788, 799\xe2\x80\x93800 (1985).  Accordingly, our decisions have long recognized that the government may impose some content-based restrictions on speech in nonpublic forums, including restrictions that exclude political advocates and forms of political advocacy.  See <i>id., </i>at 806\xe2\x80\x93811; <i>Greer </i>v.<i> Spock</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 828, 831\xe2\x80\x93833, 838\xe2\x80\x93839 (1976); <i>Lehman </i>v. <i>Shaker Heights</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298, 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (1974) (plurality opin- ion); <i>id.,</i> at 307\xe2\x80\x93308 (Douglas, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A polling place in Minnesota qualifies as a nonpublic forum.  It is, at least on Election Day, government-controlled property set aside for the sole purpose of voting.  The space is \xe2\x80\x9ca special enclave, subject to greater restriction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>ISKCON</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 680.

And while the four-Justice plurality in <i>Burson </i>and Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in the judgment parted ways over whether the public sidewalks and streets <i>surrounding </i>a polling place qualify as a nonpublic forum, neither opinion suggested that the interior of the building was anything but.

The text of the apparel ban makes no distinction based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s political persuasion, so MVA does not claim that the ban discriminates on the basis of viewpoint on its face.  The question accordingly is whether Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s ban on political apparel is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum\xe2\x80\x9d: voting.  <i>Cornelius</i>, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 806.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We first consider whether Minnesota is pursuing a permissible objective in prohibiting voters from wearing particular kinds of expressive apparel or accessories while inside the polling place.  The natural starting point for evaluating a\n \nFirst Amendment challenge to such a restriction is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Burson</i>, which upheld a Tennessee law imposing a 100-foot campaign-free zone around polling place entrances.  Under the Tennessee law\xe2\x80\x94much like Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s buffer-zone provision\xe2\x80\x94no person could solicit votes for or against a candidate, party, or ballot measure, distribute campaign materials, or \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. campaign posters, signs or other campaign materials\xe2\x80\x9d within the restricted zone.  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 193\xe2\x80\x93194 (plurality opinion).  The plurality found that the law withstood even the strict scrutiny applicable to speech restrictions in traditional public forums.  <i>Id.,</i> at 211.  In his opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia argued that the less rigorous \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review should apply, and found the law \xe2\x80\x9cat least reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  <i>Id.</i>, at 216.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That analysis emphasized the problems of fraud, voter intimidation, confusion, and general disorder that had plagued polling places in the past.  See <i>id.,</i> at 200\xe2\x80\x93204 (plurality opinion).  Against that historical backdrop, the plurality and Justice Scalia upheld Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s determination, supported by overwhelming consensus among the States and \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense,\xe2\x80\x9d that a campaign-free zone outside the polls was \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to secure the advantages of the secret ballot and protect the right to vote.  <i>Id.,</i> at 200, 206\xe2\x80\x93208, 211.  As the plurality explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State of Tennessee has decided that [the] last 15 seconds before its citizens enter the polling place should be their own, as free from interference as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 210.  That was not \xe2\x80\x9can unconstitutional choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">MVA disputes the relevance of <i>Burson </i>to Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s apparel ban.  On MVA\xe2\x80\x99s reading, <i>Burson </i>considered only \xe2\x80\x9cactive campaigning\xe2\x80\x9d outside the polling place by campaign workers and others trying to engage voters approaching the polls.  Brief for Petitioners 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  Minne- sota\xe2\x80\x99s law, by contrast, prohibits what MVA characterizes as \xe2\x80\x9cpassive, silent\xe2\x80\x9d self-expression by voters themselves when voting.  Reply Brief 17.  MVA also points out that the plurality focused on the extent to which the restricted zone combated \xe2\x80\x9cvoter intimidation and election fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 208\xe2\x80\x94concerns that, in MVA\xe2\x80\x99s view, have little to do with a prohibition on certain types of voter apparel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Campaign buttons and apparel did come up in the <i>Burson</i> briefing and argument, but neither the plurality nor Justice Scalia expressly addressed such applications of the law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Nor did either opinion specifically consider the interior of the polling place as opposed to its environs, and it is true that the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning focused on campaign activities of a sort not likely to occur in an area where, for the most part, only voters are permitted while voting.  At the same time, Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s law swept broadly to ban even the plain \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xe2\x80\x9d of a campaign-related message, and the Court upheld the law in full.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the State was warranted in designating an area for the voters as \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own\xe2\x80\x9d as they <i>enter</i> the polling place suggests an interest more significant, not less, <i>within</i> that place.  <i>Id.,</i> at 210.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, we see no basis for rejecting Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s determination that some forms of advocacy should be excluded from the polling place, to set it aside as \xe2\x80\x9can island of calm in which voters can peacefully contemplate their choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 43.  Casting a vote is a weighty civic act, akin to a jury\xe2\x80\x99s return of a verdict, or a representative\xe2\x80\x99s vote on a piece of legislation.  It is a time for choosing, not campaigning.  The State may reasonably decide that the interior of the polling place should reflect that distinction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, our decisions have noted the \xe2\x80\x9cnondisruptive\xe2\x80\x9d nature of expressive apparel in more mundane settings.  <i>Board of Airport Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Jews for Jesus, Inc.</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569, 576 (1987) (so characterizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe wearing of a T-shirt or button that contains a political message\xe2\x80\x9d in an airport); <i>Tinker</i> v. <i>Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.</i>,\n\n393 U.\xc2\xa0S. 503, 508 (1969) (students wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War engaged in \xe2\x80\x9csilent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\xe2\x80\x9d).  But those observations do not speak to the unique context of a polling place on Election Day.  Members of the public are brought together at that place, at the end of what may have been a divisive election season, to reach considered decisions about their government and laws.  The State may reasonably take steps to ensure that partisan discord not follow the voter up to the voting booth, and distract from a sense of shared civic obligation at the moment  it counts the most.  That interest may be thwarted by displays that do not raise significant concerns in other situations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other States can see the matter differently, and some do.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The majority, however, agree with Minnesota that at least some kinds of campaign-related clothing and accessories should stay outside.\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  That broadly shared judgment is entitled to respect.  Cf.<i> Burson</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206 (plurality opinion) (finding that a \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread and time-tested consensus\xe2\x80\x9d supported the constitutionality of campaign buffer zones).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, in light of the special purpose of the polling place itself, Minnesota may choose to prohibit certain apparel there because of the message it conveys, so that voters may focus on the important decisions immediately at hand.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">But the State must draw a reasonable line.  Although there is no requirement of narrow tailoring in a nonpublic forum, the State must be able to articulate some sensible basis for distinguishing what may come in from what must stay out.  See <i>Cornelius</i>, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 808\xe2\x80\x93809.  Here, the unmoored use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d in the Minnesota law, combined with haphazard interpretations the State has provided in official guidance and representations to this Court, cause Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s restriction to fail even this forgiving test.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Again, the statute prohibits wearing a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical badge, political button, or other political insignia.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the word can be expansive.  It can encompass anything \xe2\x80\x9cof or relating to government, a government, or the conduct of governmental affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1755 (2002), or anything \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f, relating to, or dealing with the structure or affairs of government, politics, or the state,\xe2\x80\x9d American Heritage Dictionary 1401 (3d ed. 1996).  Under a literal reading of those definitions, a button or T-shirt merely imploring others to \xe2\x80\x9cVote!\xe2\x80\x9d could qualify.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State argues that the apparel ban should not be read so broadly.  According to the State, the statute does not prohibit \xe2\x80\x9cany conceivably \xe2\x80\x98political\xe2\x80\x99 message\xe2\x80\x9d or cover \xe2\x80\x9call \xe2\x80\x98political\xe2\x80\x99 speech, broadly construed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 21, 23.  Instead, the State interprets the ban to proscribe \xe2\x80\x9conly words and symbols that an objectively reasonable observer would perceive as conveying a message about the electoral choices at issue in [the] polling place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 13; see <i>id.,</i> at 19 (the ban \xe2\x80\x9capplies not to <i>any </i>message regarding government or its affairs, but to messages relating to questions of governmental affairs facing voters on a given election day\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, the State argues that the category of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d apparel is <i>not </i>limited to campaign apparel.  After all, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign material\xe2\x80\x9d in the first sentence of the statute\xe2\x80\x94describing what one may not \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xe2\x80\x9d in the buffer zone as well as inside the polling place\xe2\x80\x94implies that the distinct term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d should be understood to cover a broader class of items.  As the State\xe2\x80\x99s counsel explained to the Court, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[s] the scope of what is prohibited from campaign speech to additional political speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We consider a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative constructions\xe2\x80\x9d in interpreting a state law.  <i>Forsyth County </i>v. <i>Nationalist Movement</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123, 131 (1992).  But far from clarifying the indeterminate scope of the political apparel provision, the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celectoral choices\xe2\x80\x9d construction introduces confusing line-drawing problems.

See Brief for Respondents 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  The first three examples in the Policy are clear enough: items displaying the name of a political party, items displaying the name of a candidate, and items demonstrating \xe2\x80\x9csupport of or opposition to a ballot question.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert.

What qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d?  The answer, as far as we can tell from the State\xe2\x80\x99s briefing and argument, is any subject on which a political candidate or party has taken a stance.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37 (explaining that the \xe2\x80\x9celectoral choices\xe2\x80\x9d test looks at the \xe2\x80\x9cissues that have been raised\xe2\x80\x9d in a campaign \xe2\x80\x9cthat are relevant to the election\xe2\x80\x9d).  For instance, the Election Day Policy specifically notes that the \xe2\x80\x9cPlease I. D. Me\xe2\x80\x9d buttons are prohibited.  App. to Pet. for Cert. I\xe2\x80\x932.  But a voter identification requirement was not on the ballot in 2010, see Brief for Respondents 47, n.\xc2\xa024, so a Minnesotan would have had no explicit \xe2\x80\x9celectoral choice\xe2\x80\x9d to make in that respect.  The buttons were nonetheless covered, the State tells us, because the Republican candidates for Governor and Secretary of State had staked out positions on whether photo identification should be required.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see App. 58\xe2\x80\x9360.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A rule whose fair enforcement requires an election judge to maintain a mental index of the platforms and positions of every candidate and party on the ballot is not reason- able.  Candidates for statewide and federal office and major political parties can be expected to take positions on a wide array of subjects of local and national import.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Democratic Platform Committee, 2016 Democratic Party Platform (approved July 2016) (stating positions on over 90 issues); Republican Platform Committee, Republican Platform 2016 (approved July 2016) (similar).  Would a \xe2\x80\x9cSupport Our Troops\xe2\x80\x9d shirt be banned, if one of the candidates or parties had expressed a view on military funding or aid for veterans?  What about a \xe2\x80\x9c#MeToo\xe2\x80\x9d shirt, referencing the movement to increase awareness of sexual harassment and assault?

We do not suggest that such provisions set the outer limit of what a State may proscribe, and do not pass on the constitutionality of laws that are not before us.

See, <i>e.g., Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Letter Carriers</i>,\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 548, 550\xe2\x80\x93551 (1973) (rejecting\n \nFirst Amendment overbreadth  and vagueness challenge to \xc2\xa79(a) of the Hatch Act, then codified at\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77324(a)(2), which prohibited federal employees from taking \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an active part in political management or in political campaigns\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Broadrick</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 601, 602 (1973) (rejecting\n \nFirst Amendment overbreadth and vagueness challenge to a similar Oklahoma law that \xe2\x80\x9crestricts the political activities of the State\xe2\x80\x99s classified civil servants\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even here, the majority recognizes a substantial amount of speech that \xe2\x80\x9cclear[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9citems displaying the name of a political party, items displaying the name of a candidate, and items demonstrating support of or opposition to a ballot question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The fact that the majority has some difficulty deciphering guidance to \xc2\xa7211B.11(1) that also proscribes \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ssue oriented material designed to influence or impact voting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aterial promoting a group with recognizable political views,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. I\xe2\x80\x932; see <i>ante,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9317, does not mean that the statute as a whole is not subject to a construction that falls within constitutional bounds.  As this Court has made clear in the context of the\n \nFirst Amendment overbreadth doctrine, the \xe2\x80\x9cmere fact\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9ccan conceive of some impermissible applications of [the] statute is not sufficient to render it\xe2\x80\x9d unconstitutional.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 285, 303 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is especially so where the state court is capable of clarifying the boundaries of state law in a manner that would permit the Court to engage in a comprehensive constitutional analysis.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383 (1988) (certifying questions to the Virginia Supreme Court for clarification as to whether a state statute was readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that would not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment); <i>Commonwealth </i>v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.</i>, 236 Va. 168, 372 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 618 (1988) (responding to certification with such a narrowing construction).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Furthermore, the Court also should consider the history of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimplementation\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute in evaluating the facial challenge here.  <i>Forsyth County</i> v. <i>Nationalist Movement</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123, 131 (1992).  That history offers some assurance that the statute has not been interpreted or applied in an unreasonable manner.  There is no evidence that any individual who refused to remove a political item has been prohibited from voting, and respondents maintain that no one has been referred for prosecution for violating the provision.  See Brief for Respondents 4, n.\xc2\xa02.  Since the political apparel ban was enacted in the late 19th century, this is the first time the statute has been challenged on the basis that certain speech is not \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.  Even then, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied challenge was rejected by the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  See <i>Minnesota Majority</i> v. <i>Mansky</i>, 62 F. Supp. 3d 870, 878 (Minn. 2014); <i>Minnesota Majority </i>v. <i>Mansky</i>, 2015 WL 13636675, *12 (D Minn., Mar. 23, 2015); <i>Minnesota Majority</i> v. <i>Mansky</i>, 849 F.\xc2\xa03d 749, 752\xe2\x80\x93753 (CA8 2017).  Petitioners did not seek review of those claims in this Court.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  On the whole, the historical application of the law helps illustrate that the statute is not so \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminate\xe2\x80\x9d so as to \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[y] with it \xe2\x80\x98[t]he opportunity for abuse.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 17.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Especially where there are undisputedly many constitutional applications of a state law that further weighty state interests, the Court should be wary of invalidating a law without giving the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court an opportunity to pass upon it.  See<i> Babbitt</i>, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 309; <i>Arizonans for Official English</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 79.  Because the Court declines to take the obvious step of certification in this case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0See, <i>e.g., </i>J.
