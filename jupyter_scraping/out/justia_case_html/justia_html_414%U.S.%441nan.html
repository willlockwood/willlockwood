The question for decision is whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments are violated by Indiana\'s requirement, Ind. Ann.Stat. \xc2\xa7 29-3812 (1969), that</p>\n<p>"[n]o existing or newly organized political party or organization shall be permitted on or to have the names of its candidates printed on the ballot used at any election until it has filed an affidavit, by its officers, under oath, that it does not advocate the overthrow </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 414 U. S. 443</a></p><p> of local, state or national government by force or violence. . . . [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>Appellants are the Communist Party of Indiana, a new political party in Indiana, certain of its officers and potential voters, and its candidates for President and Vice President in the 1972 election.  Appellees are the Indiana State Election Board and its members.  When appellants applied to the Election Board in August, 1972, for a place on Indiana\'s National Ballot for the 1972 general election without submitting the required oath, the Board, on the advice of the Attorney General of Indiana, rejected the application.  Appellants thereupon filed this action in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana seeking a declaration of the unconstitutionality </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 414 U. S. 444</a></p><p> of \xc2\xa7 29-3812, and an injunction requiring that the Election Board place the Party on the ballot.  A three-judge court was convened, and that court, on September 28, 1972, in an unreported opinion, declared the provision of \xc2\xa7 29-3812 that is challenged on this appeal constitutional, and issued an order requiring the Election Board to place the Communist Party and its nominees on the National Ballot only "[i]n the event that the Communist Party of Indiana shall submit an affidavit in keeping with this memorandum and order. . . ." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Communist Party submitted an affidavit that, in addition to the statutory language, added the following:</p>\n<p>"The term \'advocate,\' as used herein, has the meaning given it by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Yates v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/354/298/case.html">354 U. S. 298</a></span> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/354/298/case.html#320">354 U. S. 320</a></span>, \'the advocacy and teaching of concrete action for the forcible overthrow of the government, and not of principles divorced from action.\'"</p>\n<p>The Election Board rejected the affidavit, and appellants, on October 3, returned to the District Court, seeking an order directing the Board to accept it.  On the same day, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 414 U. S. 445</a></p><p> the Election Board filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the order of September 28. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The District Court, on October 4, denied both motions by order entered that day.  Appellants, on October 10, filed a notice of appeal to this Court to enable them to seek emergency relief.  That effort was abandoned, and appellants then sought leave of the District Court to withdraw the notice of appeal in order that the District Court might act on a motion of appellants, also filed October 10, that the District Court amend its September 28 order to include a determination that \xc2\xa7 29-3812 was constitutional "only insofar as it proscribes advocacy directed at promoting unlawful action, as distinguished from advocacy of abstract doctrine."  On October 31, the District Court entered an order granting leave to withdraw the notice of appeal of October 10 but denying the motion to amend the September 28 memorandum.</p>\n<p>Appellants refiled their notice of appeal on November 29.  Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal as jurisdictionally untimely, arguing that the 60-day period for appeal, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2101(b), expired on November 27.  We postponed consideration of the question of our jurisdiction to the merits.  410 U.S. 981 (1973).  We hold that the appeal was timely.  Appellees\' motion for reconsideration of October 3 suspended the finality of the judgment of September 28 until the District Court\'s denial of the motion on October 4 restored it.  Time </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 414 U. S. 446</a></p><p> for appeal thus began to run from October 4, and the notice of appeal filed November 29 was timely. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  As to the merits, we hold that the loyalty oath requirement of \xc2\xa7 29-3812 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 414 U. S. 447</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Loyalty oath cases are not strangers to this Court, <em>see</em> Note, Loyalty Oaths, 77 Yale L.J. 739 (1968), but the constitutional questions presented in earlier cases arising from their use to limit access to the ballot have not had plenary consideration. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The District Court decided this case under the pressure of a ballot printing deadline, and its memorandum opinion states no reasons, and cites no authorities to support the court\'s holding that</p>\n<p>"that portion of the statute providing \'that it does not advocate the overthrow of local, state, or national government by force or violence\' is constitutional, and hence enforceable by Indiana."</p>\n<p>Appellees do not deny that \xc2\xa7 29-3812 exacts a broad oath embracing advocacy of abstract doctrine as well as action.  Yet this Court has held in many contexts that the first and Fourteenth Amendments render invalid statutes regulating advocacy that are not limited to advocacy of action.  And, as we have so often emphasized, "[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms."  <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U.

We expressly overruled the earlier holding of <em>Whitney v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/case.html">274 U.

For, we said:\n</em></p>\n<p>"[L]ater decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.  As we said in <em>Noto v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/367/290/case.html">367 U.

It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control.  <em>Cf. Yates v.

S. 232</a></span> (1957).</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that the principle should nevertheless not obtain in cases of state regulation of access to the ballot.  We perceive no reason to make an exception, and appellees suggest none.  Indeed, all of the reasons for application of the principle in the other contexts are equally applicable here.</p>\n<p>"To be sure, administration of the electoral process is a matter that the Constitution largely entrusts to the States.  But, in exercising their powers of supervision over elections and in setting qualifications for voters, the States may not infringe upon basic constitutional protections."</p>\n<p><em>Kusper v. Pontikes, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html#57">414 U. S. 57</a></span> (footnote omitted).  At stake are appellants\' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas.  "The right to associate with the political party of one\'s choice is an integral part of this basic constitutional freedom."  <em>Ibid.; Williams v. Rhodes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/case.html">393 U. S. 23</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/case.html#30">393 U. S. 30</a></span> (1968).  At stake as well are appellants\' interests as party members in casting an effective ballot.  <em>See Bullock v. Carter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/134/case.html">405 U. S. 134</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/134/case.html#142">405 U. S. 142</a></span>-144 (1972).</p>\n<p>Thus, burdening access to the ballot, rights of association in the political party of one\'s choice, interests in casting an effective vote and in running for office not because the Party urges others "to do something, now or in the future . . . , [but] . . . merely to believe in something," <em>Yates v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/298/case.html#325">354 U. S. 325</a></span>, is to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 414 U.

For "the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights. . . ."  <em>Reynolds v.

Again, they argue</p>\n<p>"that the affidavit required under the statute refers to the official actions of the party itself, thus reducing to a minimum any possibility of \'innocent involvement\' in activities which might be considered advocacy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 10.  As we understand appellees, this is an argument that, at least for purposes of determining whether to grant a place on the ballot, any group that advocates violent overthrow as abstract doctrine must be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful action.

The American Independent Party and the Indiana Peace and Freedom Party then filed affidavits accepted by the Election Board and were placed on the National Ballot for the 1972 elections.  On November 11, the Election Board appealed that portion of the order to this Court.  We summarily affirmed.  <em>Whitcomb v. Communist Party,</em> 410 U.S. 976 (1973).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 29-3801, Ind.Stat.Ann. (1169), provides for ballot listing of any party that files petitions containing signatures of one-half of one percent "of the total vote of all parties cast in the state for secretary of state at the last preceding general election."  The sufficiency of the Communist Party petitions in this respect was challenged by appellees in the District Court, but was not discussed in the court\'s September 28 memorandum, although the issuance of the injunction presupposed a decision adverse to appellees.  The motion for reconsideration requested the court to reconsider that result.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellees also argue that the notice of appeal of November 29 was ineffective because the earlier notice of October 10 divested the District Court of jurisdiction, and that that jurisdiction could not have been revested by the granting of leave to withdraw the October 10 notice.  But since the October 10 notice was clearly timely, that argument is reduced to an attack on the untimeliness under Supreme Court Rule 13(1) of the filing of the jurisdictional statement on January 26, 1973.  Timely docketing of the jurisdictional statement is not, however, a jurisdictional requisite.  <em>Johnson v.

The statute was not relied upon by either the Election Board or the District Court when it denied declaratory relief.  In any event, insofar as the argument is that this statute bars the Communist Party of Indiana from maintaining this action, it is rejected.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/389/case.html">Communist Party, U.S.A. v.

Thus, we do not reach the question whether the Election Board\'s apparent failure to require the Republican and Democratic Parties, the two major parties in Indiana, to comply with the statute rises to the level of a denial of equal protection of the law as applied, or was within the Board\'s "prosecutorial discretion."  We note, however, that the only relevant testimony in the District Court, given by the Board\'s clerk, is entirely silent as to the reasons behind the omission.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>E.g., Lisker v.

In my view, it was quite unnecessary to reach the issue addressed by the Court.</p>\n<p>It was established at trial that appellees had certified the Democratic and Republican Parties despite the failure of party officials to submit the prescribed affidavits under Ind.Ann.Stat. \xc2\xa7 29-3812 (1969). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In <em>Williams v. Rhodes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/case.html">393 U.

S. 31</a></span> (1968), this Court held that a discriminatory preference for established parties under a State\'s electoral system can be justified only by a "compelling state interest."  In the present case, no colorable justification has been offered for placing on appellants burdens not imposed on the two established </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 414 U. S. 452</a></p><p> parties. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  It  follows that the appellees\' discriminatory application of the Indiana statute denied appellants equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint in this case expressly alleged that \xc2\xa7 29-3812 subjected appellants to burdens not imposed on the Republican and Democratic Parties, and proof at trial was directed to that issue.  The Court now maintains that this issue cannot be considered because it was not expressly raised in the jurisdictional statement.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/441/case.html#446">414 U. S. 446</a></span>-447, n. 6.  Supreme Court Rule 15(1)(c) provides, however, that the jurisdictional statement "will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein," and that "questions set forth in the jurisdictional statement or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court."  The issue of discriminatory application of the statute certainly falls within the gravamen of appellants\' jurisdictional statement, and should therefore be considered.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/365/case.html">388 U. S. 365</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/365/case.html#371">388 U. S. 371</a></span>-372 n. 4 (1967).  Moreover, the appropriate exercise of judicial power requires that important constitutional issues not be decided unnecessarily where narrower grounds exist for according relief.  This consideration applies even though such grounds are not raised in the jurisdictional submissions.  <em>Boynton v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/454/case.html">364 U. S. 454</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/454/case.html#457">364 U. S. 457</a></span> (1960).  <em>Cf. Barr v.

S. 171</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/171/case.html#172">355 U. S. 172</a></span> (1957).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s intimation that a <em>prima facie</em> case of constitutional deprivation was not established because Board officials were "silent as to the reasons behind the omission" of the established parties from the affidavit requirement (<em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/441/case.html#447">414 U. S. 447</a></span> n. 6) misses the point.  Nothing more need be shown than that the statute was, in fact, discriminatorily applied.  It is the Board officials, not the appellants, who must then come forth with reasons justifying the discriminatory application of the statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In view of this patently unconstitutional application of the statute, there is no occasion to reach the broader issue addressed by the Court today.  Although I express no conclusion on that issue, it should be noted that this is the first case touching upon the type of oath which may be required of a candidate for the office of President of the United States.  The Indiana oath, of course, is required of the party, rather than its presidential candidate.  But it could be argued that <em>Yates v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/298/case.html">354 U. S. 298</a></span> (1957), and its progeny are not controlling here.  Under Art. VI, cl. 3, all state and federal officers are bound by oath "to support this Constitution," and, under Art. II, \xc2\xa7 1, cl. 8, the President must swear that he will "faithfully execute the Office . . . and will to the best of [his] Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."  Art. II, \xc2\xa7 3, also imposes on the President the affirmative duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  Neither the effect of these explicit constitutional obligations nor the responsibility of a chief executive official of government to enforce the rule of law was a relevant issue in any of the <em>Yates</em> line of cases.  <em>Cf. Cole v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/676/case.html">405 U. S. 676</a></span> (1972).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
