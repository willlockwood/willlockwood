S. 11</a></span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The case presents two related questions arising under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71983 and 1988.  Respondents brought this suit in the Maine Superior Court alleging that petitioners, the State of Maine and its Commissioner of Human Services, violated \xc2\xa71983 by depriving respondents of welfare benefits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="3">Page 448 U. S. 3</a></p><p> to which they were entitled under the federal Social Security Act, specifically 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(7).  The petitioners present two issues:  (1) whether \xc2\xa71983 encompasses claims based on purely statutory violations of federal law, and (2) if so, whether attorney\'s fees under \xc2\xa71988 may be awarded to the prevailing party in such an action. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents, Lionel and Joline Thiboutot, are married and have eight children, three of whom are Lionel\'s by a previous marriage.  The Maine Department of Human Services notified Lionel that, in computing the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits to which he was entitled for the three children exclusively his, it would no longer make allowance for the money spent to support the other five children, even though Lionel is legally obligated to support them.  Respondents, challenging the State\'s interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(7), exhausted their state administrative remedies, and then sought judicial review of the administrative action in the State Superior Court.  By amended complaint, respondents also claimed relief under \xc2\xa7 1983 for themselves and others similarly situated.  The Superior Court\'s judgment enjoined petitioners from enforcing the challenged rule and ordered them to adopt new regulations, to notify class members of the new regulations, and to pay the correct amounts retroactively to respondents and prospectively to eligible class members. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The court, however, denied respondents\' motion for attorney\'s fees.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, 405 A.2d 230 (1979), concluded that respondents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 448 U. S. 4</a></p><p> had no entitlement to attorney\'s fees under state law, but were eligible for attorney\'s fees pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We granted certiorari.  444 U.S. 1042 (1980).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution <em>and laws,</em> shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The question before us is whether the phrase "and laws," as used in \xc2\xa7 1983, means what it says, or whether it should be limited to some subset of laws.  Given that Congress attached no modifiers to the phrase, the plain language of the statute undoubtedly embraces respondents\' claim that petitioners violated the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p>Even were the language ambiguous, however, any doubt as to its meaning has been resolved by our several cases suggesting, explicitly or implicitly, that the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy broadly encompasses violations of federal statutory as well as constitutional law.  <em>Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span> (1970), for example,</p>\n<p>"held that suits in federal court under \xc2\xa7 1983 are proper to secure compliance with the provisions of the Social Security Act on the part of participating States."</p>\n<p><em>Edelman v.

S. 543</a></span>, n. 7 (1972), noted that \xc2\xa7 1983\'s predecessor "was enlarged to provide protection for rights, privileges, or immunities secured by federal law."  <em>Greenwood v. Peacock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html">384 U.

As a final example, Mr. Justice Stone, writing in <em>Hague v. CIO,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html">307 U. S. 496</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html#525">307 U. S. 525</a></span>-526 (1939), expressed the opinion that \xc2\xa7 1983 was the product of an "exten[sion] to include rights, privileges and immunities secured by the laws of the United States as well as by the Constitution."</p>\n<p>While some might dismiss as dictum the foregoing statements, numerous and specific as they are, our analysis in several \xc2\xa7 1983 cases involving Social Security Act (SSA) claims has relied on the availability of a \xc2\xa7 1983 cause of action for statutory claims.  Constitutional claims were also raised </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 448 U. S. 6</a></p><p> in these cases, providing a jurisdictional base, but the statutory claims were allowed to go forward, and were decided on the merits, under the court\'s pendent jurisdiction.  In each of the following cases, \xc2\xa7 1983 was necessarily the exclusive statutory cause of action because, as the Court held in <em>Edelman v. Jordan,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/case.html#673">415 U.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Petitioners suggest that, when \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which accorded jurisdiction and a remedy for deprivations of rights secured by "the Constitution of the United States," was divided by the 1874 statutory revision into a remedial section, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1979, and jurisdictional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 448 U. S. 7</a></p><p> sections, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 563(12) and 629(16), Congress intended that the same change made in \xc2\xa7 629(16) be made as to each of the new sections as well.  Section 629(16), the jurisdictional provision for the circuit courts and the model for the current jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3), applied to deprivations of rights secured by "the Constitution of the United States, or of any right secured by any law providing for equal rights."  On the other hand, the remedial provision, the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 1983, was expanded to apply to deprivations of rights secured by "the Constitution and laws," and \xc2\xa7 563(12), the provision granting jurisdiction to the district courts, to deprivations of rights secured by "the Constitution of the United States, or of any right secured by any law of the United States."</p>\n<p>We need not repeat at length the detailed debate over the meaning of the scanty legislative history concerning the addition of the phrase "and laws."  <em>See Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html">441 U. S. 600</a></span> (1979); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#623">441 U.

S. 672</a></span> (STEWART, J., dissenting).  One conclusion which emerges clearly is that the legislative history does not permit a definitive answer.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#610">441 U. S. 610</a></span>-611; <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#674">441 U. S. 674</a></span> (STEWART, J., dissenting).  There is no express explanation offered for the insertion of the phrase "and laws."  On the one hand, a principal purpose of the added language was to</p>\n<p>"ensure that federal legislation providing specifically for equality of rights would be brought within the ambit of the civil action authorized by that statute."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#637">448 U. S. 637</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring).  On the other hand, there are no indications that that was the only purpose, and Congress\' attention was specifically directed to this new language.  Representative Lawrence, in a speech to the House of Representatives that began by observing that the revisers had very often changed the meaning of existing statutes, 2 Cong.Rec. 825 (1874), referred to the civil rights statutes as "possibly [showing] verbal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 448 U. S. 8</a></p><p> modifications bordering on legislation," <em>id.</em> at 827.  He went on to read to Congress the original and revised versions.  In short, Congress was aware of what it was doing, and the legislative history does not demonstrate that the plain language was not intended. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Petitioners\' arguments amount to the claim that, had Congress been more careful, and had it fully thought out the relationship among the various sections, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] it might have acted differently.  That argument, however, can best be addressed to Congress, which, it is important to note, has remained quiet in the face of our many pronouncements on the scope of \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Cf. TVA v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html">437 U. S. 153</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners next argue that, even if this claim is within \xc2\xa7 1983, Congress did not intend statutory claims to be covered by the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 448 U. S. 9</a></p><p> which added the following sentence to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 (emphasis added):</p>\n<p>"In <em>any action</em> or proceeding <em>to enforce</em> a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 198, 1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of Public Law 9318 [20 U.S.C. 1681 <em>et seq.</em>] or in any civil action or proceeding, by or on behalf of the United States of America, to enforce, or charging a violation of, a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d <em>et seq.</em>], the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\'s fee as part of the costs."</p>\n<p>Once again, given our holding in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#4">448 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> the plain language provides an answer.  The statute states that fees are available in <em>any</em> \xc2\xa7 1983 action.  Since we hold that this statutory action is properly brought under \xc2\xa7 1983, and since \xc2\xa7 1988 makes no exception for statutory \xc2\xa7 1983 actions, \xc2\xa7 1988 plainly applies to this suit. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The legislative history is entirely consistent with the plain language.  As was true with \xc2\xa7 1983, a major purpose of the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act was to benefit those claiming deprivations of constitutional and civil rights.  Principal sponsors of the measure in both the House and the Senate, however, explicitly stated during the floor debates that the statute would make fees available more broadly.

Representative Drinan described the purpose of the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act as "authoriz[ing] the award of a reasonable attorney\'s fee in actions brought in State or Federal courts."  122 Cong.Rec. 35122 (1976).

It follows from this history and from the Supremacy Clause that the fee provision is part of the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy whether the action is brought in federal or state court.

He assumed that Congress had instructed the revisers not to make changes, and that the revisers had obeyed those instructions.  In fact, the second section of the statute creating the Revision Commission, 14 Stat. 75, mandated that the commissioners</p>\n<p>"mak[e] such alterations as may be necessary to reconcile the contradictions, supply the omissions, and amend the imperfections of the original text."</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is clear that Congress understood this mandate to authorize the Commission to do more than merely "copy and arrange in proper order, and classify in heads the actual text of statutes in force."  2 Cong.Rec. 825 (1874).

Having transformed purely statutory claims into "civil rights" actions under \xc2\xa7 1983, the Court concludes that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 permits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 448 U.

These two holdings dramatically expand the liability of state and local officials, and may virtually eliminate the "American Rule" in suits against those officials</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion reflects little consideration of the consequences of its judgment.  It relies upon the "plain" meaning of the phrase "and laws" in \xc2\xa7 1983 and upon this Court\'s assertedly "consistent treatment" of that statute.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#4">448 U.

But the reading adopted today is anything but "plain" when the statutory language is placed in historical context.  Moreover, until today, this Court never had held that \xc2\xa7 1983 encompasses all purely statutory claims.  Past treatment of the subject has been incidental, and far from consistent.  The only firm basis for decision is the historical evidence, which convincingly shows that the phrase the Court now finds so clear was -- and remains -- nothing more than a shorthand reference to equal rights legislation enacted by Congress.  To read "and laws" more broadly is to ignore the lessons of history, logic, and policy.</p>\n<p>Part I of this opinion examines the Court\'s claim that it only construes the "plain meaning" of \xc2\xa7 1983, while  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#14">448 U.

When the language does not reflect what history reveals to have been the true legislative intent, we have readily construed the Civil Rights Acts to include words that Congress inadvertently omitted.  <em>See Examining Board v.

Thus, "plain meaning" is too simplistic a guide to the construction of \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>Blind reliance on plain meaning is particularly inappropriate where, as here, Congress inserted the critical language without explicit discussion when it revised the statutes in 1874.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#6">448 U.

Since the legislative history also shows that the revision generally was not intended to alter the meaning of existing law, <em>see</em> Part II, <em>infra,</em> this Court previously has insisted that apparent changes be scrutinized with some care.

Nevertheless, the Court\'s abrupt dismissal of the proposition that "Congress did not intend to change the meaning of existing laws when it revised the statutes in 1874," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#8">448 U. S. 8</a></span>, n. 5, reflects a misconception so fundamental as to require a summary of the historical record.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 1983 derives from \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which provided a cause of action for deprivations of constitutional rights only.  "Laws" were not mentioned.  Act of Apr. 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13.  The phrase "and laws" was added in 1874, when Congress consolidated the laws of the United States into a single volume under a new subject matter arrangement.  <em>See</em> 2 Cong.Rec. 827 (Jan. 21, 1874) (remarks of Rep. Lawrence).  Consequently, the intent of Congress in 1874 is central to this case.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating a cause of action, \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act conferred concurrent jurisdiction upon "the district or circuit courts of the United States. . . ."  17 Stat. 13.  In the 1874 revision, the remedial portion of \xc2\xa7 1 was codified as \xc2\xa7 1979 of the Revised Statutes, which provided for a cause of action in terms identical to the present \xc2\xa7 1983.  The jurisdictional portion of \xc2\xa7 1 was divided into \xc2\xa7 563(12), conferring district court jurisdiction, and \xc2\xa7 629(16), conferring circuit court jurisdiction.  Although \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1979, 563(12), and 629(16) came from the same source, each was worded differently.  Section 1979 referred to deprivations of rights "secured by the Constitution and laws"; \xc2\xa7 563(12) described rights secured "by the Constitution of the United States, or . . . by any law of the United States"; and \xc2\xa7 629(16) encompassed rights secured "by the Constitution of the United States, or . . . by any law providing for equal rights of citizens of the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 448 U.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  When Congress merged the jurisdiction of circuit and district courts in 1911, the narrower language of \xc2\xa7 629(16) was adopted, and ultimately became the present 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3).  Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \xc2\xa7 24(14), 36 Stat. 1092. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In my view, the legislative history unmistakably shows that the variations in phrasing introduced in the 1874 revision were inadvertent, and that each section was intended to have precisely the same scope.  <em>Chapman v.

Moreover, the only defensible interpretation of the contemporaneous legislative record is that the reference to "laws" in each section was intended</p>\n<p>"to do no more than ensure that federal legislation providing specifically for equality of rights would be brought within the ambit of the civil action authorized by [\xc2\xa7 1979]."</p>\n<p>441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#637">441 U.

The Revision Commission, which worked for six years on the project, submitted to Congress a draft that did contain substantive changes. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  But a Joint Congressional committee, which was appointed in early 1873 to transform the draft into a bill, concluded that it would be "utterly impossible to carry the measure through, if it was understood that it contained new legislation."  2 Cong.Rec. 646 (Jan. 14, 1874) (remarks of Rep.

Rec 646 (Jan. 14, 1874) (remarks of Rep. Poland); <em>see id.</em> at 826 (Jan. 21, 1874) (remarks of Rep. Lawrence); <em>id.</em> at 129 (Dec. 10, 1873) (remarks of Rep. Butler).  On December 10, 1873, Durant\'s completed work was introduced in the House with the solemn assurance that the bill "embodies the law as it is."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 448 U. S. 18</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The House met in a series of evening sessions to review the bill and to restore original meaning where necessary.  During one of these sessions, Representative Lawrence delivered the speech upon which the Court now relies.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#7">448 U. S. 7</a></span>-8.  Lawrence explained that the revisers often had separated existing statutes into substantive, remedial, and criminal sections to accord with the new organization of the statutes by topic.  He read both the original and revised versions of the civil rights statutes to illustrate the arrangement, and "possibly [to] show verbal modifications bordering on legislation."  2 Cong.Rec. 827 (Jan. 21, 1874).  After reading \xc2\xa7 1979 without mentioning the addition of "and laws," Lawrence stated that</p>\n<p>"[a] comparison of all these will present a fair specimen of the manner in which the work has been done, and from these, all can judge of the accuracy of the translation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 828.  Observing that "[t]his mode of classifying . . . to some extent duplicates in the revision portions of statutes" that previously were one, Lawrence praised "the general accuracy" of the revision.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nothing in this sequence of remarks supports the decision of the Court today.  There was no mention of the addition of "and laws," nor any hint that the reach of \xc2\xa7 1983 was to be extended.  If Lawrence had any such intention, his statement to the House was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 448 U. S. 19</a></p><p> a singularly disingenuous way of proposing a major piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>In context, it is plain that Representative Lawrence did not mention changes "bordering on legislation" as a way of introducing substantive changes in \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act.  Rather, he was emphasizing that the revision was not intended to modify existing statutes, and that his reading might reveal errors that should be eliminated.  No doubt Congress "was aware of what it was doing."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#8">448 U. S. 8</a></span>.  It was meeting specially in one last attempt to detect and strike out legislative changes that may have remained in the proposed revision despite the best efforts of Durant and the Joint Committee.  No Representative challenged those sections of the Revised Statutes that derived from \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  That silence reflected the understanding of those present that "and laws" did not alter the original meaning of the statute. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  The Members of Congress who participated in the year-long effort to expunge all substantive alterations from the Revised Statutes evinced no intent whatever to enact a far-reaching modification of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  The relevant evidence, largely ignored by the Court today, shows that Congress painstakingly sought to avoid just such changes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The legislative history alone refutes the Court\'s assertion that the 43d Congress intended to alter the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.  But there are other compelling reasons to reject the Court\'s interpretation of the phrase "and laws."  First, by reading those words to encompass every federal enactment, the Court extends \xc2\xa7 1983 beyond the reach of its jurisdictional counterpart.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 448 U. S. 20</a></p><p> Second, that reading creates a broad program for enforcing federal legislation that departs significantly from the purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983.  Such unexpected and plainly unintended consequences should be avoided whenever a statute reasonably may be given an interpretation that is consistent with the legislative purpose.  <em>See Sorrells v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/435/case.html">287 U.

S. 8</a></span>, n. 6. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The Court finds no "inherent illogic" in this view.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But the gap in the Court\'s logic is wide indeed in light of the history and purpose of the civil rights legislation we consider today.  Sections 1983 and 1343(3) derive from the same section of the same Act.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#15">448 U. S. 15</a></span>-16.  As originally enacted, the two sections necessarily were coextensive. <em> See Chapman v.

And this Court has emphasized repeatedly that the right to a federal forum in every case was viewed as a crucial ingredient in the federal remedy afforded by \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>We have stated, for example, that a major purpose of the Civil Rights Acts was to "involve the federal judiciary" in the effort to exert federal control over state officials who refused to enforce the law.  <em>District of Columbia v.

Congress did so, in part, because it thought the state courts at the time would not provide an impartial forum.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html#426">409 U.

Four Terms ago, we considered the origins of \xc2\xa7 1343(3) and \xc2\xa7 1983 and concluded that "the two provisions were meant to be, and are, complementary."  <em>Examining Board v.

The Court cites no evidence that Congress ever intended to alter so fundamentally its original remedial plan, and I am aware of none. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Nearly every commentator who has considered the question has concluded that \xc2\xa7 1343(3) was intended to supply federal jurisdiction in all \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  <em>See Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#637">441 U. S. 637</a></span>, n.19 (POWELL, J., concurring) (collecting citations). [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Since \xc2\xa7 1343(3) covers statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 448 U.

S. 615</a></span>-618, the same limitation necessarily is implicit in \xc2\xa7 1983.  The Court\'s decision to apply that statute without regard to the scope of its jurisdictional counterpart is at war with the plainly expressed intent of Congress.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion does not consider the nature or scope of the litigation it has authorized.  In practical effect, today\'s decision means that state and local governments, officers, and employees [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] now may face liability whenever a person believes he has been injured by the administration of any federal-state cooperative program, whether or not that program is related to equal or civil rights. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>1\n</em></p>\n<p>Even a cursory survey of the United States Code reveals that literally hundreds of cooperative regulatory and social welfare enactments may be affected. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  The States now participate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 448 U. S. 23</a></p><p> in the enforcement of federal laws governing migrant labor, noxious weeds, historic preservation, wildlife conservation, anadromous fisheries, scenic trails, and strip mining.  Various statutes authorize federal-state cooperative agreements in most aspects of federal land management.  In addition, federal grants administered by state and local governments now are available in virtually every area of public administration.  Unemployment, Medicaid, school lunch subsidies, food stamps, and other welfare benefits may provide particularly inviting subjects of litigation.  Federal assistance also includes a variety of subsidies for education, housing, health care, transportation, public works, and law enforcement.  Those who might benefit from these grants now will be potential \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>No one can predict the extent to which litigation arising from today\'s decision will harass state and local officials; nor can one foresee the number of new filings in our already overburdened courts.  But no one can doubt that these consequences will be substantial.  And the Court advances no reason to believe that any Congress -- from 1874 to the present day -- intended this expansion of federally imposed liability on state defendants.</p>\n<p>Moreover, state and local governments will bear the entire burden of liability for violations of statutory "civil rights" even when federal officials are involved equally in the administration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 448 U. S. 24</a></p><p> of the affected program.  Section 1983 grants no right of action against the United States, and few of the foregoing cooperative programs provide expressly for private actions to enforce their terms.  Thus, private litigants may sue responsible federal officials only in the relatively rare case in which a cause of action may be implied from the governing substantive statute.  <em>Cf. Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html">444 U. S. 11</a></span> (1979); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html">442 U. S. 560</a></span> (1979).  It defies reason to believe that Congress intended -- without discussion -- to impose such a burden only upon state defendants.</p>\n<p>Even when a cause of action against federal officials is available, litigants are likely to focus efforts upon state defendants in order to obtain attorney\'s fees under the liberal standard of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988.  There is some evidence that \xc2\xa7 1983 claims already are being appended to complaints solely for the purpose of obtaining fees in actions where "civil rights" of any kind are, at best, an afterthought.  In this case, for example, the respondents added a \xc2\xa7 1983 count to their complaint some years after the action was initiated, apparently in response to the enactment of the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976.  <em>See also United States v. Imperial Irrigation Dist.,</em> 595 F.2d 525, 529 (CA9 1979), <em>rev\'d on other grounds sub nom. Bryant v. Yellen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/352/case.html">447 U. S. 352</a></span> (1980).  The uses of this technique have not been explored fully.  But the rules of pendent jurisdiction are quite liberal, and plaintiffs who prevail on pendent claims may win awards under \xc2\xa7 1988.  <em>Maher v. Gagne, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/122/case.html">448 U. S. 122</a></span>.  Consequently, ingenious pleaders may find ways to recover attorney\'s fees in almost any suit against a state defendant. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Nothing in the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976 suggests that Congress intended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 448 U. S. 25</a></p><p> to remove so completely the protection of the "American Rule" in suits against state defendants. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>2\n</em></p>\n<p>When Congress revised the statutes in 1874, it hardly could have anticipated the subsequent proliferation of federal statutes.  Yet congressional power to enact laws under the Spending and Commerce Clauses was well known in 1874.  Congress need not have foreseen the ultimate scope of those powers to have understood that the expansion of \xc2\xa7 1983 to statutory claims would have serious consequences.</p>\n<p>Today\'s decision confers upon the courts unprecedented authority to oversee state actions that have little or nothing to do with the individual rights defined and enforced by the civil rights legislation of the Reconstruction Era. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  This result cannot be reconciled with the purposes for which \xc2\xa7 1983 was enacted.  It also imposes unequal burdens on state and federal officials in the joint administration of federal programs, and may expose state defendants to liability for attorney\'s fees in virtually every case.  If any Member of the 43d Congress had suggested legislation embodying these results, the proposal certainly would have been hotly debated.  It is simply </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 448 U. S. 26</a></p><p> inconceivable that Congress, while professing a firm intention not to make substantive changes in the law, nevertheless intended to enact a major new remedial program by approving -- without discussion -- the addition of two words to a statute adopted only three years earlier</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court finally insists that its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1983 is foreordained by a line of precedent so strong that further analysis is unnecessary.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#4">448 U. S. 4</a></span>-5.  It is true that suits against state officials alleging violations of the Social Security Act have become commonplace in the last decade.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The instant action follows that pattern.  Thus, the Court implies, today\'s decision is a largely inconsequential reaffirmation of a statutory interpretation that has been settled authoritatively for many years.</p>\n<p>This is a tempting way to avoid confronting the serious issues presented by this case.  But the attempt does not withstand analysis.  Far from being a long-accepted fact, purely statutory \xc2\xa7 1983 actions are an invention of the last 20 years.  And the Court\'s see-saw approach to \xc2\xa7 1983 over the last century leaves little room for certainty on any question that has not been discussed fully and resolved explicitly by this Court.  <em>Compare Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html">436 U. S. 658</a></span> (1978), <em>with Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961).  Yet, until last Term, neither this Court nor any Justice ever had undertaken -- directly and thoroughly -- a consideration of the question presented in this case.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Commentators have chronicled the tortuous path of judicial interpretation of the Civil Rights Acts enacted after the Civil War.  <em>See</em> Gressman, The Unhappy History of Civil Rights Legislation, 50 Mich.L.Rev. 1323 (1952); Note, Developments in the Law -- Section 1983 and Federalism, 90 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 448 U.

L.J. 361, 363 (1951).  Another lamented, as late as 1952, that the statute could not be given its intended broad effect without a "judicial and constitutional upheaval of the first magnitude."  Gressman, <em>supra</em> at 1357.  That upheaval ultimately did take place, and \xc2\xa7 1983 actions now constitute a substantial share of the federal caseload. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Nevertheless, cases dealing with purely statutory civil rights claims remain nearly as rare as in the early years.</p>\n<p><em>Holt v. Indiana Manufacturing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/176/68/case.html">176 U. S. 68</a></span> (1900), appears to be the first reported decision to deal with a statutory claim under \xc2\xa7 1983.  In that case, the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a claim based upon the Constitution and the federal patent laws.  The Court stated that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1979, 563(12), and 629(16) of the Revised Statutes "refer to civil rights only, and are inapplicable here."  176 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/176/68/case.html#72">176 U. S. 72</a></span>.  Since <em>Holt</em> involved both constitutional and statutory claims, its "civil rights" limitation later was viewed as a general restriction on the application of \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>Although constitutional claims under \xc2\xa7 1983 generally were limited to "personal" rights in the wake of <em>Holt</em> and Mr. Justice Stone\'s influential opinion in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html">Hague v.

When the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considered a statutory claim nearly half a century after <em>Holt,</em> it found no case whatever "in which the right or privilege at stake was secured by a <em>law\' of the United States."  <em>Bomar v. Keyes,</em> 162 F.2d 136, 139, <em>cert. denied,</em> 332 U.S. 825 (1947).  The plaintiff in <em>Bomar</em> was a public school teacher who alleged that the school board had discharged her because of absences incurred while exercising her statutory right to serve on a federal jury.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the complaint stated a claim under \xc2\xa7 1983.  162 F.2d at 139.\n</em></p>\n<p>The opinion in <em>Bomar,</em> which cited no authority and reviewed no legislative history, provoked widespread commentary.  <em>See generally</em> Note, The Propriety of Granting a Federal Hearing for Statutorily Based Actions under the Reconstruction-Era Civil Rights Acts:  <em>Blue v.

[<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  The issue did not arise with any frequency until the late 1960\'s, when challenges to state administration of federal social welfare legislation became commonplace.

Some found 1983 applicable to all federal statutory claims. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Others refused to apply it to purely statutory rights. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  Yet others believed that \xc2\xa7 1983 covered some, but not all, rights derived from nonconstitutional sources.

The plaintiffs in that case challenged a state welfare provision on constitutional grounds, premising jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3), and added a pendent statutory claim.  This Court held first that the District Court retained its power to adjudicate the statutory claim even after the constitutional claim, on which \xc2\xa7 1343(3) jurisdiction was based, became moot.  397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#402">397 U.

Although the Court had to assume the existence of a private right of action to enforce that Act, the opinion did not discuss or purport to decide whether \xc2\xa7 1983 applies to statutory claims.</p>\n<p><em>Rosado</em> is not the only case to have assumed <em>sub silentio</em> that welfare claimants have a cause of action to challenge the adequacy of state programs under the Social Security Act.  As the Court observes, many of our recent decisions construing the Act made the same unspoken assumption.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#6">448 U.

This rule applies with even greater force to questions involving the availability of a cause of action, because the question whether a cause of action exists -- unlike the existence of federal jurisdiction -- may be assumed without being decided.  <em>Burks v.

Thus, the Court\'s ruling finds no support in past cases in which the issue was not squarely raised.  Here, as in <em>Hagans v.

[<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court also relies upon "numerous and specific" dicta in prior decisions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">448 U.

For example, the Court occasionally has referred to \xc2\xa7 1983 as a remedy for violations of "federally protected rights" or of "the Federal Constitution and statutes."  <em>Monell v.

To the extent they have any relevance to the issue at hand, they could be countered by the frequent occasions on which the Court has referred to \xc2\xa7 1983 as a remedy for constitutional violations without mentioning statutes. [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]  But the debate would be meaningless, for none of these off-hand remarks provides the remotest support for the positions taken in this case. [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]</p>\n<p>The only remaining decisions in the Court\'s "consistent" line of precedents are <em>Greenwood v.

In each case, the Court asserted -- without discussion and in the course of disposing of other issues -- that \xc2\xa7 1983\'s coverage of statutory rights extended beyond federal equal rights laws.  Neither contains any discussion of the question; neither cites relevant authority. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]  Nor has this Court always uncritically assumed the proposition for which <em>Greenwood</em> and <em>Edelman</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 448 U. S. 33</a></p><p> now are said to stand.  On the same day the Court decided <em>Edelman,</em> it refused to express a view on the question whether \xc2\xa7 1983 creates a cause of action for purely statutory claims.  <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html#534">415 U. S. 534</a></span>, n, 5.

S. 404</a></span>-405, n, 5 (1979)</p>\n<p>To rest a landmark decision of this Court on two statements made in dictum without critical examination would be extraordinary in any case.  In the context of \xc2\xa7 1983, it is unprecedented.  Our decisions construing the civil rights legislation of the Reconstruction era have repudiated "blind adherence to the principle of <em>stare decisis.</em> . . ."  <em>Greenwood v. Peacock, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#831">384 U. S. 831</a></span>.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter once observed, the issues raised under \xc2\xa7 1983 concern "a basic problem of American federalism" that "has significance approximating constitutional dimension."  <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#222">365 U. S. 222</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  Although Mr. Justice Frankfurter\'s view did not prevail in <em>Monroe,</em> we have heeded consistently his admonition that the ordinary concerns of <em>stare decisis</em> apply less forcefully in this than in other areas of the law.  <em>E.g., Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, supra.</em>  Against this backdrop, there is no justification for the Court\'s reliance on unexamined dicta as the principal support for a major extension of liability under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my view, the Court\'s decision today significantly expands the concept of "civil rights" and creates a major new intrusion into state sovereignty under our federal system.  There is no probative evidence that Congress intended to authorize the pervasive judicial oversight of state officials that will flow from the Court\'s construction of \xc2\xa7 1983.  Although today\'s decision makes new law with far-reaching consequences, the Court brushes aside the critical issues of congressional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="34">Page 448 U. S. 34</a></p><p> intent, national policy, and the force of past decisions as precedent.  I would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The "plain meaning" of "and laws" may be more elusive than the Court admits.  One might expect that a statute referring to all rights secured either by the Constitution or by the laws would employ the disjunctive "or."  This is precisely what Congress did in the only Civil Rights Act that referred to laws when it was originally enacted.  Act of May 31, 1870, \xc2\xa7 6, 16 Stat. 141 (now codified at 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 241).  That statute created criminal penalties for conspiracy to deprive persons of rights secured by "the Constitution <em>or</em> laws."   <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Five years later, when Congress enacted a statute providing for general federal question jurisdiction, it described matters "arising under the Constitution <em>or</em> laws."  Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \xc2\xa7 1, 18 Stat. 470 (emphasis added) (now codified at 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331).</p>\n<p>In contrast, a natural reading of the conjunctive "and" in \xc2\xa7 1983 would require that the right at issue be secured both by the Constitution and by the laws.  In 1874, this would have included the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which had been incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment and reenacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1870.  <em>See</em> Gressman, The Unhappy History of Civil Rights Legislation, 50 Mich.L.Rev. 1323, 1329, 1333-1334 (1952).  The legislative history does not suggest that the Court should adopt such a limited construction.  But an advocate of "plain meaning" hardly can ignore the ambiguity.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1874 revision also drew a third jurisdictional provision from \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act.  That provision authorized review in this Court, without regard to the amount in controversy, of</p>\n<p>"[a]ny final judgment . . . in any case brought on account of the deprivation of any right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States, or of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States."</p>\n<p>Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 699(4).  Thus, \xc2\xa7 1 actually became four separate statutes in 1874.  In the Court\'s view, Congress intended to broaden the remedial and district court jurisdictional provisions to encompass violations of all laws, while simultaneously restricting circuit court jurisdiction to "laws providing for equal rights."  Although the Court does not mention \xc2\xa7 699(4), that statute is not easily read to encompass rights secured by any federal law.  Thus, the Court attributes to Congress an intention to create a new class of civil rights claims which could be litigated in district but not circuit courts, and without any right of review in this Court.  I would not assume that Congress intended such senseless jurisdictional results.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 563(12) did not survive the 1911 revision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>It is worth noting, however, that the statute creating the Revision Commission also directed that the revisers "shall suggest to Congress" all statutory imperfections they had corrected and "the mode" in which they had done so.  Act of June 27, 1866, \xc2\xa7 3, 14 Stat. 75.  The revisers obeyed this directive by placing marginal comments next to each section they deemed to have amended the law.  <em>See</em> 2 Cong.Rec. 648 (Jan. 14, 1874) (Rep. Hoar).  That no such comment accompanied \xc2\xa7 1979 is strong evidence that the revisers intended no substantive change.  <em>See</em> 1 Revision of the United States Statutes as Drafted by the Commissioners Appointed for that Purpose 947 (1872).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>These assurances were repeated again and again.

A month later, Representative Poland stated that the bill was meant to be</p>\n<p>"an exact transcript, an exact reflex, of the existing statute law of the United States -- that there shall be nothing omitted and nothing changed."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 646 (Jan. 14, 1874).  Senator Conkling said that "the aim throughout has been to preserve absolute identity of meaning. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 4220 (May 25, 1874).  <em>See Chapman v.

But the Court did not consider the legislative history of the 1874 revision, and the passing reference to \xc2\xa7 242 certainly is not binding precedent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The addition of "and laws" did not change the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1, because Congress assumed that that phrase referred only to federal equal rights legislation.  In 1874, the only such legislation was contained in the 1866 and 1870 Civil Rights Acts, which conferred rights also secured by the recently adopted Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>See</em> <l=|448 1fn2="" 1|="" u.s.="">n. 1, <em>supra.</em></l=|448></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 1343(3) supplies jurisdiction for claims involving rights secured by the Constitution "or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States."  Neither \xc2\xa7 1983 itself nor the Social Security Act provides for equal rights within the meaning of this section.  <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>In the Court\'s view today, \xc2\xa7 1983 actions based on statutes unrelated to equal rights could have been brought in district, but not circuit, courts after 1874.  <em>See</em> <l=|448 1fn2="" 2|="" u.s.="">n. 2, <em>supra.</em>  When Congress merged the two jurisdictional provisions in 1911, the narrower language of the circuit court provision was adopted.

The Senate Report states that the new section "merges the jurisdiction now vested in the district court . . . and in the circuit courts . . . and vests it in the district courts."  S.Rep.

Although I will refer to all such potential defendants as "state defendants" for purposes of this opinion, there may be a notable difference among them.  States are protected against retroactive damages awards by the Eleventh Amendment, and individual defendants generally can claim immunity when they act in good faith.  Municipalities, however, will be strictly liable for errors in the administration of complex federal statutes.  <em>See Owen v.

The relevant enactments typically fall into one of three categories:  (A) regulatory programs in which States are encouraged to participate, either by establishing their own plans of regulation that meet conditions set out in federal statutes, or by entering into cooperative agreements with federal officials; (B) resource management programs that may be administered by cooperative agreements between federal and state agencies; and (C) grant programs in which federal agencies either subsidize state and local activities or provide matching funds for state or local welfare plans that meet federal standards.</p>\n<p><em>A.
