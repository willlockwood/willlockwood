It was admitted by the claimant, that the <em>Caroline</em> came into this port equipped like any common merchant vessel, that she did, after her arrival, receive fitments and take on board articles calculated for the slave trade only.  It was satisfactorily proved that the claimant, after receiving information that such equipments were illegal, restored the <em>Caroline</em> to the condition in which she was when she entered this port, but that this was not done till after her seizure, and that the wooden parts of the fitments for slaves were marked as they were taken out of the vessel.  That in such condition she left Charleston bound to the Havana and to no other port.  That she arrived at the Havana on 28 June, 1810, and that there she was sold about 6 August, 1810, to Spanish subjects who fitted her out for the African slave trade.
