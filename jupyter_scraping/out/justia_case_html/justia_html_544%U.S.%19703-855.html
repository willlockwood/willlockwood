See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y. </em>v. <em>County of Oneida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/index.html">414 U. S. 661</a>, 664 <em>(Oneida I)</em>.  In 1788, the State and the Oneida Nation entered into a treaty whereby the Oneidas ceded all their lands to the State, but retained a reservation of about 300,000 acres for their own use.  See <em>County of Oneida</em> v. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/226/index.html">470 U. S. 226</a>, 231 (<em>Oneida II</em>).  The Federal Government initially pursued a policy protective of the New York Indians.  In 1790, Congress passed the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act (Nonintercourse Act), barring sales of tribal land without the Government\xe2\x80\x99s acquiescence.  And in the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, the United States \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledge[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 300,000-acre reservation and guaranteed their \xe2\x80\x9cfree use and enjoyment\xe2\x80\x9d of the reserved territory.  Act of Nov. 11, 1794, 7 Stat. 44, 45, Art.\xc2\xa0III.  Nevertheless, New York continued to purchase reservation land from the Oneidas.  Although the Washington administration objected, later administrations made not even a pretense of interfering with New York\xe2\x80\x99s purchases, and ultimately pursued a policy designed to open reservation lands to white settlers and to remove tribes westward.  Pressured by the removal policy, many Oneidas left the State.  Those who stayed continued to diminish in number and, during the 1840\xe2\x80\x99s, sold most of their remaining lands to New York.  By 1920, the New York Oneidas retained only 32 acres in the State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although early litigation over Oneida land claims trained on monetary recompense from the United States for past deprivations, the Oneidas ultimately shifted to suits against local governments.  In 1970, they filed a federal \xe2\x80\x9ctest case\xe2\x80\x9d against two New York counties, alleging that the cession of 100,000 acres to the State in 1795 violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 right to possession.  They sought damages measured by the fair rental value, for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestral land owned and occupied by the two counties.  The District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim.  This Court reversed in <em>Oneida I,</em> 414 U. S., at 675, 682, holding that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked.  After the Oneidas prevailed in the lower courts, this Court held, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Oneidas could maintain their claim to be compensated \xe2\x80\x9cfor violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Oneida II</em>, 470 U. S., at 236, but reserved \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to present day Oneida Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 253, n.\xc2\xa027.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997 and 1998, OIN purchased separate parcels of land in petitioner city of Sherrill, New York.  These properties, once contained within the historic Oneida Reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as a tribal entity in 1805.  In that year, the Oneida Nation transferred the parcels to one of its members, who sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.  The properties thereafter remained in non-Indian hands until OIN reacquired them in open-market transactions.  For two centuries, governance of the area in which the properties are located has been provided by the State and its county and municipal units.  According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the area\xe2\x80\x99s present-day population is non-Indian.  Nevertheless, because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the properties are tax exempt and accordingly refused to pay property taxes assessed by Sherrill.  Sherrill initiated state-court eviction proceedings, and OIN brought this federal-court suit.  In contrast to <em>Oneida I</em> and <em>II</em>, which involved demands for monetary compensation, OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the future, the imposition of property taxes.  The District Court concluded that the parcels are not taxable, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  In this Court, OIN resists the payment of the property taxes on the ground that OIN\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel, so that regulatory authority over the newly purchased properties no longer resides in Sherrill.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of central New York and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority over the area constantly exercised by the State and its counties and towns for 200 years, and the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the United States, standards of federal Indian law and federal equity practice preclude the Tribe from unilaterally reviving its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue.  The Oneidas long ago relinquished governmental reins and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the theory of OIN and the United States that, because <em>Oneida II</em> recognized the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 aboriginal title to their ancient reservation land and because the Tribe has now acquired the specific parcels at issue in the open market, it has unified fee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels.  The Oneidas sought only money damages in <em>Oneida II, </em>see 470 U. S., at 229, and the Court reserved the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cequitable considerations\xe2\x80\x9d should limit the relief available to the present-day Oneidas, <em>id.,</em> at 253, n.\xc2\xa027.  Substantive questions of rights and duties are very different from remedial questions.  Here, OIN seeks declaratory and injunctive relief recognizing its present and future sovereign immunity from local taxation on parcels the Tribe purchased in the open market, properties that had been subject to state and local taxation for generations.  The appropriateness of such relief must be evaluated in light of the long history of state sovereign control over the territory.  From the early 1800\xe2\x80\x99s into the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferent to, New York\xe2\x80\x99s governance of the land in question and the validity <em>vel non </em>of the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 sales to the State.  Moreover, the properties here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago.  The longstanding assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an area that is predominantly non-Indian in population and land use creates \xe2\x80\x9cjustifiable expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g., Rosebud Sioux Tribe</em> v. <em>Kneip,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/584/index.html">430 U. S. 584</a>, 604\xe2\x80\x93605.  Similar justifiable expectations, grounded in two centuries of New York\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of regulatory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, merit heavy weight here.  The wrongs of which OIN complains occurred during the early years of the Republic, whereas, for the past two centuries, New York and its local units have continuously governed the territory.  The Oneidas did not seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands by court decree until the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s.  And not until the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand for exemption of the parcels from local taxation.  This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The distance from 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 long delay in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, and developments in Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, and render inequitable the piecemeal shift in governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.  This Court has long recognized that the passage of time can preclude relief.  For example, the doctrine of laches focuses on one side\xe2\x80\x99s inaction and the other\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate reliance to bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Badger</em> v. <em>Badger,</em> 2 Wall. 87, 94.  Moreover, long acquiescence may have controlling effect on the exercise of States\xe2\x80\x99 dominion and sovereignty over territory.  <em>E.g., Ohio</em> v. <em>Kentucky,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/641/index.html">410 U. S. 641</a>, 651.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s original-jurisdiction state-sovereignty cases do not dictate a result here, but they provide a helpful point of reference: When a party belatedly asserts a right to present and future sovereign control over territory, longstanding observances and settled expectations are prime considerations.  It has been two centuries since the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over the properties here or held them free from local taxation.  Parcel-by-parcel revival of their sovereign status, given the extraordinary passage of time, would dishonor \xe2\x80\x9cthe historic wisdom in the value of repose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oneida II</em>, 470 U. S., at 262.  Finally, this Court has recognized the impracticability of returning to Indian control land that generations earlier passed into numerous private hands.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Yankton Sioux Tribe</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/351/index.html">272 U. S. 351</a>, 357.  The unilateral reestablishment of present and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the market price, would have disruptive practical consequences similar to those that led the <em>Yankton Sioux</em> Court to initiate the impossibility doctrine: Sherrill and the surrounding area are today overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians, and a checkerboard of state and tribal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94created unilaterally at OIN\xe2\x80\x99s behest\xe2\x80\x94would \xe2\x80\x9cseriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments\xe2\x80\x9d and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches.  <em>Hagen</em> v. <em>Utah</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/399/index.html">510 U. S. 399</a>, 421.  If OIN may unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove these parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent it from initiating a new generation of litigation to free the parcels from local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area.  See <em>Felix</em>, 145 U. S., at 335.  Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has provided, in 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7465, a mechanism for the acquisition of lands for tribal communities that takes account of the interests of others with stakes in the area\xe2\x80\x99s governance and well being.  Section 465 provides the proper avenue for OIN to reestablish sovereign authority over territory last held by the Oneidas 200 years ago.

The separate parcels of land in question, once contained within the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 300,000-acre reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as a tribal entity in 1805.  For two centuries, governance of the area in which the properties are located has been provided by the State of New York and its county and municipal units.  In <em>County of Oneida</em> v. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/226/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/226/index.html">470 U. S. 226</a> (1985) <em>(Oneida II)</em>, this Court held that the Oneidas stated a triable claim for damages against the County of Oneida for wrongful possession of lands they conveyed to New York State in 1795 in violation of federal law.  In the instant action, OIN resists the payment of property taxes to Sherrill on the ground that OIN\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel.  Consequently, the Tribe maintains, regulatory authority over OIN\xe2\x80\x99s newly purchased properties no longer resides in Sherrill.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our 1985 decision recognized that the Oneidas could maintain a federal common-law claim for damages for ancient wrongdoing in which both national and state governments were complicit.  Today, we decline to project redress for the Tribe into the present and future, thereby disrupting the governance of central New York\xe2\x80\x99s counties and towns.  Generations have passed during which non-Indians have owned and developed the area that once composed the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s historic reservation.  And at least since the middle years of the 19th century, most of the Oneidas have resided elsewhere.  Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of the area and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority constantly exercised by New York State and its counties and towns, and the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the United States, we hold that the Tribe cannot unilaterally revive its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue.  The Oneidas long ago relinquished the reins of government and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0OIN is a federally recognized Indian Tribe and a direct descendant of the Oneida Indian Nation (Oneida Nation), \xe2\x80\x9cone of the six nations of the Iroquois, the most powerful Indian Tribe in the Northeast at the time of the American Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 230.

They sought redress for lands New York had acquired through 25 treaties of cession concluded between 1795 and 1846.  The Oneidas alleged, and the Claims Commission agreed, that under the Nonintercourse Act of 1790 and successor statutes, the Federal Government had a fiduciary duty to assure that the Oneidas received from New York \xe2\x80\x9cconscionable consideration\xe2\x80\x9d for the lands in question.  <em>Oneida Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 26 Ind.

The Commission anticipated further proceedings to determine the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate liability, but the Oneidas had by then decided to pursue a different course.  On the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 request, the Court of Claims dismissed the proceedings.  See <em>Oneida Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 231 Ct.

In 1970, the Oneidas of New York and Wisconsin, asserting federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331 or \xc2\xa71362, instituted a \xe2\x80\x9ctest case\xe2\x80\x9d against the New York Counties of Oneida and Madison.  They alleged that the cession of 100,000 acres to New York State in 1795, see <em>supra</em>, at 4, violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 right to possession under the applicable federal treaties and statutes.  In this initial endeavor to gain compensation from governmental units other than the United States, the Oneidas confined their demand for relief.  They sought only damages measured by the fair rental value, for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestral land owned and occupied by the two counties.  The District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, dismissed the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 complaint for failure to state a claim arising under federal law.  We reversed that determination, holding that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked.  <em>Oneida I,</em> 414 U.

On review in <em>Oneida II</em>, we rejected various defenses the counties presented that might have barred the action for damages, 470 U. S., at 240\xe2\x80\x93250, and held that the Oneidas could maintain their claim to be compensated \xe2\x80\x9cfor violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 236.  While upholding the judgment of the Court of Appeals regarding the counties\xe2\x80\x99 liability under federal common law, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the Court of Appeals or presented to this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 253, n.\xc2\xa027.  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe express[ed] no opinion as to whether other considerations m[ight] be relevant to the final disposition of this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  On remand, the District Court entered a final judgment which fixed the amount of damages payable by the counties.  Allowing setoffs for the counties\xe2\x80\x99 good-faith improvements to the land, the court ordered recoveries of $15,994 from Oneida County and $18,970 from Madison County, plus prejudgment interest.  <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y. </em>v. <em>County of Oneida</em>, 217 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 292, 310 (NDNY 2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2000, litigation resumed in an action held in abeyance during the pendency of the test case.  In that revitalized action, the Oneidas sought damages from Oneida and Madison Counties for a period spanning over 200 years.  The amended complaint alleged that, through a series of agreements concluded during the years 1795 to 1846, approximately 250,000 acres of the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 ancestral land had been unlawfully conveyed to New York.  <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y. </em>v. <em>County of Oneida</em>, 199 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 61, 66\xe2\x80\x9368 (NDNY 2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Oneidas further sought to enlarge the action by  demanding recovery of land they had not occupied since the 1795\xe2\x80\x931846 conveyances.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  They attempted to join as defendants, <em>inter alia</em>, approximately 20,000 private landowners, and to obtain declaratory relief that would allow the Oneidas to eject these landowners.  <em>Id.</em>, at 67\xe2\x80\x9368.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court refused permission to join the landowners so late in the day, resting in part on the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 bad faith and undue delay.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79\xe2\x80\x9385.  Further, the court found the proposed amendment \xe2\x80\x9cfutile.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 94.  In this regard, the court emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9csharp distinction between the <em>existence </em>of a federal common law right to Indian homelands,\xe2\x80\x9d a right this Court recognized in <em>Oneida II</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cand how to <em>vindicate </em>that right.\xe2\x80\x9d  199 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 90.  That distinction \xe2\x80\x9cmust be drawn,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, <em>ibid.</em>, for in the two centuries since the alleged wrong, \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment of every type imaginable has been ongoing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 92.  Referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical concerns\xe2\x80\x9d that blocked restoration of Indians to their former lands, the court found it high time \xe2\x80\x9cto transcend the theoretical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Cases of this genre, the court observed, \xe2\x80\x9ccr[ied] out for a pragmatic approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The District Court therefore excluded the imposition of any liability against private landowners.  <em>Id.</em>, at 93\xe2\x80\x9395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This brings us to the present case, which concerns parcels of land in the city of Sherrill, located in Oneida County, New York.  According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the population in the area is non-Indian: American Indians represent less than 1% of the city of Sherrill\xe2\x80\x99s population and less than 0.5% of Oneida County\xe2\x80\x99s population.

Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, 2000 Census of Population and Housing, Summary Population and Housing Characteristics: New York, 2000 PHC\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x9334, Table 3, p. 124 (July 2002), available at http://\nwww.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-34.pdf (as visited Mar. 24, 2005, and available in the Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  OIN owns approximately 17,000 acres of land scattered throughout the Counties of Oneida and Madison, representing less than 1.5% of the counties\xe2\x80\x99 total area.  OIN\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, the Oneida Nation, had transferred the parcels at issue to one of its members in 1805, who sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.  The properties thereafter remained in non-Indian hands until OIN\xe2\x80\x99s acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 in open-market transactions.  See 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 144, n.\xc2\xa03.  OIN now operates commercial enterprises on these parcels: a gasoline station, a convenience store, and a textile facility.  <em>Id.</em>, at 144.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the properties are exempt from taxation, and accordingly refused to pay the assessed property taxes.  The city of Sherrill initiated eviction proceedings in state court, and OIN sued Sherrill in federal court.  In contrast to <em>Oneida I</em> and <em>II</em>, which involved demands for monetary compensation, OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the future, the imposition of property taxes.  OIN also sued Madison County, seeking a declaration that the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s properties in Madison are tax exempt.  The litigation involved a welter of claims and counterclaims.  Relevant here, the District Court concluded that parcels of land owned by the Tribe in Sherrill and Madison are not taxable.  See 145 F. Supp. 2d 226, 254\xe2\x80\x93259 (NDNY 2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed.  337 F.\xc2\xa03d 139.  Writing for the majority, Judge Parker ruled that the parcels qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cIndian country,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71151,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] because they fall within the boundaries of a reservation set aside by the 1794 Canandaigua Treaty for Indian use under federal supervision.  337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 155\xe2\x80\x93156; see <em>supra</em>, at 4.  The court further held that the Buffalo Creek Treaty did not demonstrate a clear congressional purpose to disestablish or diminish the Oneida Reservation.  337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 161, 165; see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Finally, the court found no legal requirement \xe2\x80\x9cthat a federally recognized tribe demonstrate its continuous existence in order to assert a claim to its reservation land.\xe2\x80\x9d  337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 165.  In any case, the court held, the record demonstrated OIN\xe2\x80\x99s continuous tribal existence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 166\xe2\x80\x93167.  Judge Van Graafeiland dissented as to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s primary holding.  In his view, the record raised a substantial question whether OIN had \xe2\x80\x9cforfeited\xe2\x80\x9d its aboriginal rights to the land because it abandoned \xe2\x80\x9cits tribal existence \xe2\x80\xa6 for a discernable period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 171.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the city of Sherrill\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari, 542 U.

From the early 1800\xe2\x80\x99s into the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferent to, New York\xe2\x80\x99s governance of the land in question and the validity <em>vel non </em>of the Oneidas\xe2\x80\x99 sales to the State.  See generally Gunther 23\xe2\x80\x9325 (attributing much of the confusion and conflict in the history of New York Indian affairs to \xe2\x80\x9cFederal inattention and ambivalence\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 policy and practice through much of the early 19th century was designed to dislodge east coast lands from Indian possession.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Moreover, the properties here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago.  Notably, it was not until lately that the Oneidas sought to regain ancient sovereignty over land converted from wilderness to become part of cities like Sherrill.

The Oneidas did not seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands by court decree until the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s.  See, <em>supra</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa04.  And not until the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand for exemption of the parcels from local taxation.  337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 144.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principle that the passage of time can preclude relief has deep roots in our law, and this Court has recognized this prescription in various guises.  It is well established that laches, a doctrine focused on one side\xe2\x80\x99s inaction and the other\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate reliance, may bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Badger</em> v. <em>Badger,</em> 2 Wall. 87, 94 (1865) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts of equity act upon their own inherent doctrine of discouraging, for the peace of society, antiquated demands, refuse to interfere where there has been gross laches in prosecuting the claim, or long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Wagner</em> v. <em>Baird,</em> 7 How. 234, 258 (1849) (same); <em>Bowman</em> v. <em>Wathen,</em> 1 How. 189, 194 (1843) (\xe2\x80\x9c[The] doctrine of an equitable bar by lapse of time, so distinctly announced by the chancellors of England and Ireland, \xe2\x80\xa6 should now be regarded as settled law in this court.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court applied the doctrine of laches in <em>Felix</em> v. <em>Patrick,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/145/317/index.html">145 U.

In the nearly three decades between the conveyance and the lawsuit, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] large part of the tract ha[d] been platted and recorded as an addition to the city of Omaha, and \xe2\x80\xa6 sold to purchasers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 326.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s the case stands at present,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cjustice requires only what the law \xe2\x80\xa6 would demand\xe2\x80\x94the repayment of the value of the [illegally conveyed] scrip.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 334.  The Court also recognized the disproportion between the value of the scrip issued to the Indian ($150) and the value of the property the heirs sought to acquire (over $1 million).  <em>Id.,</em> at 333.  The sort of changes to the value and character of the land noted by the <em>Felix</em> Court are present in even greater magnitude in this suit.

There is no dispute that it has been two centuries since the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over the properties here or held them free from local taxation.

The District Court, in the litigation dormant during the pendency of <em>Oneida II</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, rightly found these pragmatic concerns about restoring Indian sovereign control over land \xe2\x80\x9cmagnified exponentially here, where development of every type imaginable has been ongoing for more than two centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, 199 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 92.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cimpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine had no application because OIN acquired the land in the open market and does not seek to uproot current property owners.  337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 157.  But the unilateral reestablishment of present and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the market price, would have disruptive practical consequences similar to those that led this Court in <em>Yankton Sioux</em> to initiate the impossibility doctrine.  The city of Sherrill and Oneida County are today overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11.  A checkerboard of alternating state and tribal jurisdiction in New York State\xe2\x80\x94created unilaterally at OIN\xe2\x80\x99s behest\xe2\x80\x94would \xe2\x80\x9cseriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments\xe2\x80\x9d and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches.  <em>Hagen,</em> 510 U.

If OIN may unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove these parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent the Tribe from initiating a new generation of litigation to free the parcels from local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area.  See <em>Felix</em>, 145 U.

The Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s claim, whether affirmative or defensive, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa07, is one of territorial sovereign status entitled to recognition by the territorial state sovereign and its subdivisions.  The claim of present sovereign status turns not only on background law and the provisions of treaties, but also on the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s behavior over a long period of time:  the absence of the Tribe and tribal members from the particular lots of land, and the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s failure to assert sovereignty over them.  The Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s inaction cannot, therefore, be ignored here as affecting only a remedy to be considered later; it is, rather, central to the very claims of right made by the contending parties.  Since the subject of inaction was not expressly raised as a separate question presented for review, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa08, there is some question whether we should order reargument before dealing with it.  I think that is unnecessary; the issue was addressed by each side in the argument prior to submission of the case, notwithstanding the terms of the questions on which review was granted.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961813">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCITY OF SHERRILL V.

It does not implicate the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from other forms of state jurisdiction, nor does it concern the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority over property owned by non-Indians within the reservation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the purposes of its decision the Court assumes that the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly resolved the major issues of fact and law that the parties debated in those courts and that the City of Sherrill (City) presented to us in its petition for certiorari.  Thus, we accept those courts\xe2\x80\x99 conclusions that the Oneida Indian Nation of New York (Tribe) is a federally recognized Indian Tribe; that it is the successor-in-interest to the original Oneida Nation; that in 1788 the Treaty of Fort Schuyler created a 300,000 acre reservation for the Oneida; that in 1794 the Treaty of Canandaigua established that tract as a federally protected reservation; and that the reservation was not disestablished or diminished by the Treaty of Buffalo Creek in 1838.  It is undisputed that the City seeks to collect property taxes on parcels of land that are owned by the Tribe and located within the historic boundaries of its reservation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the outset of this litigation it has been common ground that if the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s properties are \xe2\x80\x9cIndian Country,\xe2\x80\x9d the City has no jurisdiction to tax them without express congressional consent.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  For the reasons set forth at length in the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals, it is abundantly clear that all of the land owned by the Tribe within the boundaries of its reservation qualifies as Indian country.  Without questioning the accuracy of that conclusion, the Court today nevertheless decides that the fact that most of the reservation has been occupied and governed by non-Indians for a long period of time precludes the Tribe \xe2\x80\x9cfrom rekindling embers of sovereignty that long ago grew cold.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  This is a novel holding, and in my judgment even more unwise than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>County of Oneida</em> v. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/226/index.html">470 U. S. 226</a> (1985), that the Tribe may recover damages for the alleged illegal conveyance of its lands that occurred in 1795.  In that case, I argued that the \xe2\x80\x9cremedy for the ancient wrong established at trial should be provided by Congress, not by judges seeking to rewrite history at this late date,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 270 (opinion dissenting in part).  In the present case, the Tribe is not attempting to collect damages or eject landowners as a remedy for a wrong that occurred centuries ago; rather, it is invoking an ancient immunity against a city\xe2\x80\x99s present-day attempts to tax its reservation lands.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without the benefit of relevant briefing from the parties, the Court has ventured into legal territory that belongs to Congress.  Its decision today is at war with at least two bedrock principles of Indian law.  First, only Congress has the power to diminish or disestablish a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s reservation.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Second, as a core incident of tribal sovereignty, a tribe enjoys immunity from state and local taxation of its reservation lands, until that immunity is explicitly revoked by Congress.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Far from revoking this immunity, Congress has specifically reconfirmed it with respect to the reservation lands of the New York Indians.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Ignoring these principles, the Court has done what only Congress may do\xe2\x80\x94it has effectively proclaimed a diminishment of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s reservation and an abrogation of its elemental right to tax immunity.  Under our precedents, whether it is wise policy to honor the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s tax immunity is a question for Congress, not this Court, to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a justification for its lawmaking decision, the Court relies heavily on the fact that the Tribe is seeking <em>equitable</em> relief in the form of an injunction.  The distinction between law and equity is unpersuasive because the outcome of the case turns on a narrow legal issue that could just as easily, if not most naturally, be raised by a tribe as a <em>defense </em>against a state collection proceeding.  In fact, that scenario actually occurred in this case: The City brought an eviction proceeding against the Tribe based on its refusal to pay property taxes; that proceeding was removed to federal court and consolidated with the present action; the District Court granted summary judgment for the Tribe; and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of tribal tax immunity.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Either this defensive use of tax immunity should still be available to the Tribe on remand, but see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa07, or the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the distinctions between law and equity and between substantive rights and remedies, see <em>ante</em>, at 13, is indefensible.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, as a matter of equity I believe that the \xe2\x80\x9cprinciple that the passage of time can preclude relief,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 16, should be applied sensibly and with an even hand.  It seems perverse to hold that the reliance interests of non-Indian New Yorkers that are predicated on almost two centuries of inaction by the Tribe do not foreclose the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of judicially created damages remedies for ancient wrongs, but do somehow mandate a forfeiture of a tribal immunity that has been consistently and uniformly protected throughout our history.  In this case, the Tribe reacquired reservation land in a peaceful and lawful manner that fully respected the interests of innocent landowners\xe2\x80\x94it purchased the land on the open market.  To now deny the Tribe its right to tax immunity\xe2\x80\x94at once the most fundamental of tribal rights and the least disruptive to other sovereigns\xe2\x80\x94is not only inequitable, but also irreconcilable with the principle that only Congress may abrogate or extinguish tribal sovereignty.  I would not decide this case on the basis of speculation about what may happen in future litigation over other regulatory issues.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  For the answer to the question whether the City may require the Tribe to pay taxes on its own property within its own reservation is pellucidly clear.  Under settled law, it may not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o argument is made that should a finding be made that the properties in question are Indian Country, they are nonetheless taxable.\xe2\x80\x9d  145 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 226, 241, n. 7 (NDNY 2001).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>South Dakota</em> v.<em> Yankton Sioux Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/329/index.html">522 U.

Given the State\xe2\x80\x99s strong interest in zoning its land without exception for a small number of Indian-held properties arranged in checkerboard fashion, the balance of interests obviously supports the retention of state jurisdiction in this sphere.
