Section 25524.2 imposes a moratorium on the certification of new nuclear plants until the State Commission finds that there has been developed, and that the United States through its authorized agency has approved, a demonstrated technology or means for the permanent and terminal disposal of high-level nuclear wastes.  Petitioner electric utilities filed an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that these provisions, <em>inter alia,</em> are invalid under the Supremacy Clause because they were preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.

The court went on to hold that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 was not designed to provide protection against radiation hazards but was adopted because uncertainties in the nuclear fuel cycle make nuclear power an uneconomical and uncertain source of energy, and therefore that the section was not preempted because \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 271 and 274(k) of the Atomic Energy Act constituted authorization for States to regulate nuclear powerplants for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.

Both of these factors counsel in favor of finding the challenge to \xc2\xa7 25524.2 ripe for adjudication.  The question of preemption is predominantly legal, and to require the industry to proceed without knowing whether the moratorium imposed by \xc2\xa7 25524.2 is valid would impose a palpable and considerable hardship on the utilities, and may ultimately work harm on the citizens of California.

Because the NRC\'s decision does not and could not compel a utility to develop a nuclear plant, compliance with both that decision and \xc2\xa7 25524.2 is possible.  Moreover, because the NRC\'s regulations are aimed at insuring that plants are safe, not necessarily that they are economical, \xc2\xa7 25524.2 does not interfere with the objective of those regulations.  And as there is no attempt on California\'s part to enter the field of developing and licensing nuclear waste disposal technology, a field occupied by the Federal Government, \xc2\xa7 25524.2 is not preempted any more by the NRC\'s obligations in the waste disposal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 461 U.

Nor does it appear that Congress intended, through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, to make the decision for the States as to whether there is now sufficient federal commitment to fuel storage and waste disposal that licensing of nuclear reactors may resume.  Moreover, that Act can be interpreted as being directed at solving the nuclear waste disposal problem for existing reactors without necessarily encouraging or requiring that future plant construction be undertaken.

Promotion of nuclear power is not to be accomplished "at all costs."  Moreover, Congress has given the States authority to determine, as a matter of economics, whether a nuclear plant <em>vis-a-vis</em> a fossil fuel plant should be built.  California\'s decision to exercise that authority does not, in itself, constitute a basis for preemption.

S. 194</a></p><p> American society.  To facilitate this development, the Federal Government relaxed its monopoly over fissionable materials and nuclear technology and, in its place, erected a complex scheme to promote the civilian development of nuclear energy while seeking to safeguard the public and the environment from the unpredictable risks of a new technology.  Early on it was decided that the States would continue their traditional role in the regulation of electricity production.  The interrelationship of federal and state authority in the nuclear energy field has not been simple; the federal regulatory structure has been frequently amended to optimize the partnership.</p>\n<p>This case emerges from the intersection of the Federal Government\'s efforts to ensure that nuclear power is safe with the exercise of the historic state authority over the generation and sale of electricity.  At issue is whether provisions in the 1976 amendments to California\'s Warren-Alquist Act, Cal.Pub.Res.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 25524.1(b) and 25524.2 (West 1977), which condition the construction of nuclear plants on findings by the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission that adequate storage facilities and means of disposal are available for nuclear waste, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 461 U. S. 195</a></p><p> are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 919, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2011 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>A nuclear reactor must be periodically refueled and the "spent fuel" removed.  This spent fuel is intensely radioactive, and must be carefully stored.  The general practice is to store the fuel in a water-filled pool at the reactor site.  For many years, it was assumed that this fuel would be reprocessed; accordingly, the storage pools were designed as short-term holding facilities with limited storage capacities.  As expectations for reprocessing remained unfulfilled, the spent fuel accumulated in the storage pools, creating the risk that nuclear reactors would have to be shut down.  This could occur if there were insufficient room in the pool to store spent fuel and also if there were not enough space to hold the entire fuel core when certain inspections or emergencies required unloading of the reactor.  In recent years, the problem has taken on special urgency.  Some 8,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have already accumulated, and it is projected that, by the year 2000, there will be some 72,000 metric tons of spent fuel. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Government studies indicate that a number of reactors could be forced to shut down in the near future due to the inability to store spent fuel. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="196">Page 461 U. S. 196</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is a second dimension to the problem.  Even with water pools adequate to store safely all the spent fuel produced during the working lifetime of the reactor, permanent disposal is needed because the wastes will remain radioactive for thousands of years. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  A number of long-term nuclear waste management strategies have been extensively examined.  These range from sinking the wastes in stable deep seabeds, to placing the wastes beneath ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, to ejecting the wastes into space by rocket.  The greatest attention has been focused on disposing of the wastes in subsurface geologic repositories such as salt deposits. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Problems of how and where to store nuclear wastes has engendered considerable scientific, political, and public debate.  There are both safety and economic aspects to the nuclear waste issue:  first, if not properly stored, nuclear wastes might leak and endanger both the environment and human health; [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] second, the lack of a long-term disposal option increases the risk that the insufficiency of interim storage space for spent fuel will lead to reactor shutdowns, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 461 U. S. 197</a></p><p> rendering nuclear energy an unpredictable and uneconomical adventure. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The California laws at issue here are responses to these concerns.  In 1974, California adopted the Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act, Cal.Pub.Res.Code Ann. 25000-25986 (West 1977 and Supp.1983).  The Act requires that a utility seeking to build in California any electric power generating plant, including a nuclear powerplant, must apply for certification to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Warren-Alquist Act was amended in 1976 to provide additional state regulation of new nuclear powerplant construction.</p>\n<p>Two sections of these amendments are before us.  Section 25524.1(b) provides that, before additional nuclear plants may be built, the Energy Commission must determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be "adequate capacity" for storage of a plant\'s spent fuel rods "at the time such nuclear facility requires such . . . storage."  The law also requires that each utility provide continuous, on-site, "full core reserve storage capacity" in order to permit storage of the entire reactor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 461 U. S. 198</a></p><p> core if it must be removed to permit repairs of the reactor.  In short, \xc2\xa7 25524.1(b) addresses the interim storage of spent fuel.</p>\n<p>Section 25524.2 deals with the long-term solution to nuclear wastes.  This section imposes a moratorium on the certification of new nuclear plants until the Energy Commission</p>\n<p>"finds that there has been developed and that the United States through its authorized agency has approved and there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste."</p>\n<p>"Disposal" is defined as a "method for the permanent and terminal disposition of high-level nuclear waste. . . ."  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 25524.2(a), (c).  Such a finding must be reported to the state legislature, which may nullify it. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1978, petitioners Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. filed this action in the United States District Court, requesting a declaration that numerous provisions of the Warren-Alquist Act, including the two sections challenged here, are invalid under the Supremacy Clause because they are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act.  The District Court held that petitioners had standing to challenge \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 25524.1(b) and 25524.2, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] that the issues presented by these two statutes are ripe for adjudication, and that the two provisions are void because they are preempted by and in conflict with the Atomic Energy Act.  489 F.Supp. 699 (ED Cal.1980). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 461 U. S. 199</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s ruling that the petitioners have standing to challenge the California statutes, and also agreed that the challenge to \xc2\xa7 25524.2 is ripe for review.  It concluded, however, that the challenge to \xc2\xa7 25524.1(b) was not ripe "[b]ecause we cannot know whether the Energy Commission will ever find a nuclear plant\'s storage capacity to be inadequate. . . ."  659 F.2d 903, 918 (1981). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  On the merits, the court held that the nuclear moratorium provisions of \xc2\xa7 25524.2 were not preempted because \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 271 and 274(k) of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2018 and 2021(k), constitute a congressional authorization for States to regulate nuclear powerplants "for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards." [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The court held that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 was not designed to provide protection against radiation hazards, but </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 461 U.

Nor was the provision invalid as a barrier to fulfillment of the federal goal of encouraging the development of atomic energy.  The granting of state authority in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 271 and 274(k), combined with recent federal enactments, demonstrated that Congress did not intend that nuclear power be developed "at all costs," but only that it proceed consistent with other priorities and subject to controls traditionally exercised by the States and expressly preserved by the federal statute.

The question of preemption is predominantly legal, and although it would be useful to have the benefit of California\'s interpretation of what constitutes a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste, resolution of the preemption issue need not await that development.  Moreover, postponement of decision would likely work substantial hardship on the utilities. As the Court of Appeals cogently reasoned, for the utilities to proceed in hopes that, when the time for certification came, either the required findings would be made or the law would be struck down requires the expenditures of millions of dollars over a number of years, without any certainty of recovery if certification were denied. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The construction of new nuclear facilities requires considerable advance planning -- on the order of 12 to 14 years.

While the waste disposal statute operates on a statewide basis, the Energy Commission is directed to make determinations under \xc2\xa7 25524.1(b) on a case-by-case basis.  As the Court of Appeals explained, because "we cannot know whether the Energy Commission will ever find a nuclear plant\'s storage capacity to be inadequate," judicial consideration of this provision should await further developments.

First, they submit that the statute -- because it regulates construction of nuclear plants and because it is allegedly predicated on safety concerns -- ignores the division between federal and state authority created by the Atomic Energy Act, and falls within the field that the Federal Government has preserved for its own exclusive control.  Second, the statute, and the judgments that underlie it, conflict with decisions concerning the nuclear waste disposal issue made by Congress and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Third, the California statute frustrates the federal goal of developing nuclear technology as a source of energy.  We consider each of these contentions in turn. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 461 U. S. 205</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Even a brief perusal of the Atomic Energy Act reveals that, despite its comprehensiveness, it does not at any point expressly require the States to construct or authorize nuclear powerplants or prohibit the States from deciding, as an absolute or conditional matter, not to permit the construction of any further reactors.  Instead, petitioners argue that the Act is intended to preserve the Federal Government as the sole regulator of all matters nuclear, and that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 falls within the scope of this impliedly preempted field.  But as we view the issue, Congress, in passing the 1954 Act and in subsequently amending it, intended that the Federal Government should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant, but that the States retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need, reliability, cost, and other related state concerns.</p>\n<p>Need for new power facilities, their economic feasibility, and rates and services, are areas that have been characteristically governed by the States.

Enrico Fermi demonstrated the first nuclear reactor in 1942, and Congress authorized civilian application of atomic power in 1946, Atomic Energy Act of 1946, <em>see</em> Act of Aug. 1, 1946, 60 Stat. 755, at which time the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created.  Until 1954, however, the use, control, and ownership of nuclear technology remained a federal monopoly.  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Act of Aug. 30, 1954, 68 Stat. 919, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 461 U. S. 207</a></p><p> amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2011 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. V), grew out of Congress\' determination that the national interest would be best served if the Government encouraged the private sector to become involved in the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes under a program of federal regulation and licensing.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 2181, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 1-11 (1954).  The Act implemented this policy decision by providing for licensing of private construction, ownership, and operation of commercial nuclear power reactors.  <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/59/case.html#63">438 U. S. 63</a></span>.  The AEC, however, was given exclusive jurisdiction to license the transfer, delivery, receipt, acquisition, possession, and use of nuclear materials.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2014(e), (z), (aa), 2061-2064, 2071-2078, 2091-2099, 2111-2114 (1976 ed. and Supp. V).  Upon these subjects, no role was left for the States.</p>\n<p>The Commission, however, was not given authority over the generation of electricity itself, or over the economic question whether a particular plant should be built.  We observed in <em>Vermont Yankee, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/519/case.html#550">435 U. S. 550</a></span>, that "[t]he Commission\'s prime area of concern in the licensing context, . . . is national security, public health, and safety."  <em>See also Power Reactor Development Co. v.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which now exercises the AEC\'s regulatory authority, does not purport to exercise its authority based on economic considerations, 10 CFR \xc2\xa7 8.4 (1982), and has recently repealed its regulations concerning the financial qualifications and capabilities of a utility proposing to construct and operate a nuclear powerplant.  47 Fed.Reg. 13751 (1982).  In its notice of rule repeal, the NRC stated that utility financial qualifications are only of concern to the NRC if related to the public health and safety. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  It is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 461 U. S. 208</a></p><p> almost inconceivable that Congress would have left a regulatory vacuum; the only reasonable inference is that Congress intended the States to continue to make these judgments.  Any doubt that ratemaking and plant-need questions were to remain in state hands was removed by \xc2\xa7 271, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2018, which provided:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the authority or regulations of any Federal, State or local agency with respect to the generation, sale, or transmission of electric power produced through the use of nuclear facilities licensed by the Commission. . . ."</p>\n<p>The legislative Reports accompanying this provision do little more than restate the statutory language, S.Rep. No. 1699, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 31 (1954); H.R.Rep. No. 2181, <em>supra,</em> at 31, but statements on the floor of Congress confirm that. while the safety of nuclear technology was the exclusive business of the Federal Government, state power over the production of electricity was not otherwise displaced. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1959 amendments reinforced this fundamental division of authority.  In 1959, Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act in order to</p>\n<p>"clarify the respective responsibilities </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 461 U. S. 209</a></p><p> . . . of the States and the Commission with respect to the regulation of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2021(a)(1).  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 870, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8, 10-12 (1959).  The authority of the States over the planning for new powerplants and ratemaking were not at issue.  Indeed, the point of the 1959 Amendments was to heighten the States\' role.  Section 274(b), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2021(b), authorized the NRC, by agreements with state governors to discontinue its regulatory authority over certain nuclear materials under limited conditions. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  State programs permitted under the amendment were required to be "coordinated and compatible" with that of the NRC.  \xc2\xa7 2021(g); S.Rep. No. 870, <em>supra,</em> at 11.  The subject matters of those agreements were also limited by \xc2\xa7 274(c), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2021(c), which states:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Commission shall retain authority and responsibility with respect to regulation of -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) the construction and operation of any production or utilization facility;"</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"(4) the disposal of such . . . byproduct, source, or special nuclear material as the Commission determines . . . should, because of the hazards or potential hazards thereof, not be so disposed of without a license from the Commission."</p>\n<p>Although the authority reserved by \xc2\xa7 274(c) was exclusively for the Commission to exercise, <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 870, <em>supra,</em> at 8, 9; H.R.Rep. No. 1125, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8, 9 (1959), Congress made clear that the section was not intended to cut back on preexisting state authority outside the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 461 U. S. 210</a></p><p> NRC\'s jurisdiction. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Section 274(k), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2021(k), states:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of any State or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards."</p>\n<p>Section 274(k), by itself, limits only the preemptive effect of "this section," that is, \xc2\xa7 274, and does not represent an affirmative grant of power to the States.  But Congress, by permitting regulation "for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards," underscored the distinction drawn in 1954 between the spheres of activity left respectively to the Federal Government and the States.</p>\n<p>This regulatory structure has remained unchanged, for our purposes, until 1965, when the following proviso was added to \xc2\xa7 271:</p>\n<p>"<em>Provided,</em> that this section shall not be deemed to confer upon any Federal, State or local agency any authority to regulate, control, or restrict any activities of the Commission."</p>\n<p>The accompanying Report by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy makes clear that the amendment was not intended to detract from state authority over energy facilities. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Instead, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 461 U. S. 211</a></p><p> the proviso was added to overrule a Court of Appeals opinion which interpreted \xc2\xa7 271 to allow a municipality to prohibit transmission lines necessary for the AEC\'s own activities.  <em>Maun v. United States,</em> 347 F.2d 970 (CA9 1965).  There is no indication that Congress intended any broader limitation of state regulatory power over utility companies.  Indeed, Reports and debates accompanying the 1965 amendment indicate that \xc2\xa7 271\'s purpose</p>\n<p>"was to make it absolutely clear that the Atomic Energy Act\'s special provisions on licensing of reactors did not disturb the <em>status quo</em> with respect to the then-existing authority of Federal, State, and local bodies to regulate generation, sale, or transmission of electric power."</p>\n<p>111 Cong.Rec.19822 (1965) (statement of Sen. Hickenlooper). [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>This account indicates that, from the passage of the Atomic Energy Act in 1954, through several revisions, and to the present day, Congress has preserved the dual regulation of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="212">Page 461 U. S. 212</a></p><p> nuclear powered electricity generation:  the Federal Government maintains complete control of the safety and "nuclear" aspects of energy generation; the States exercise their traditional authority over the need for additional generating capacity, the type of generating facilities to be licensed, land use, ratemaking, and the like. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>The above is not particularly controversial.  But deciding how \xc2\xa7 25524.2 is to be construed and classified is a more difficult proposition.  At the outset, we emphasize that the statute does not seek to regulate the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant.  It would clearly be impermissible for California to attempt to do so, for such regulation, even if enacted out of nonsafety concerns, would nevertheless directly conflict with the NRC\'s exclusive authority over plant construction and operation.  Respondents appear to concede as much.  Respondents do broadly argue, however, that although safety regulation of nuclear plants by States is forbidden, a State may completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns are satisfied by the Federal Government.  We reject this line of reasoning.  State safety regulation is not preempted only when it conflicts with federal law.  Rather, the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the States. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  When the Federal Government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="213">Page 461 U. S. 213</a></p><p> completely occupies a given field or an identifiable portion of it, as it has done here, the test of preemption is whether "the matter on which the State asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the Federal Act."  <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#236">331 U. S. 236</a></span>.  A state moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field.  Moreover, a state judgment that nuclear power is not safe enough to be further developed would conflict directly with the countervailing judgment of the NRC, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#218">461 U. S. 218</a></span>-219, that nuclear construction may proceed notwithstanding extant uncertainties as to waste disposal.  A state prohibition on nuclear construction for safety reasons would also be in the teeth of the Atomic Energy Act\'s objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use -- and would be preempted for that reason.  <em>Infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#221">461 U. S. 221</a></span>-222.</p>\n<p>That being the case, it is necessary to determine whether there is a nonsafety rationale for \xc2\xa7 25524.2.  California has maintained, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 was aimed at economic problems, not radiation hazards.  The California Assembly Committee on Resources, Land Use, and Energy, which proposed a package of bills including \xc2\xa7 25524.2, reported that the waste disposal problem was "largely economic or the result of poor planning, <em>not</em> safety related."  Reassessment of Nuclear Energy in California:  A Policy Analysis of Proposition 15 and its Alternatives, p. 18 (1976) (Reassessment Report) (emphasis in original).  The Committee explained that the lack of a federally approved method of waste disposal created a "clog" in the nuclear fuel cycle.  Storage space was limited, while more nuclear wastes were continuously produced.  Without a permanent means of disposal, the nuclear waste problem could become critical, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="214">Page 461 U. S. 214</a></p><p> leading to unpredictably high costs to contain the problem or, worse, shutdowns in reactors.  "Waste disposal <em>safety,</em>" the Reassessment Report notes,</p>\n<p>"is not directly addressed by the bills, which ask only that a method [of waste disposal] be chosen and accepted by the federal government."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 156 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals adopted this reading of \xc2\xa7 25524.2.  Relying on the Reassessment Report, the court concluded:</p>\n<p>"[S]ection 25524.2 is directed towards purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.  While Proposition 15 would have required California to judge the safety of a proposed method of waste disposal, section 25524.2 leaves that judgment to the federal government.  California is concerned not with the adequacy of the method, but rather with its existence."</p>\n<p>659 F.2d at 925.</p>\n<p>Our general practice is to place considerable confidence in the interpretations of state law reached by the federal courts of appeals.  <em>Cf. Mills v. Rogers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/291/case.html">457 U. S. 291</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/291/case.html#306">457 U. S. 306</a></span> (1982); <em>Bishop v.

S. 346</a></span> (1976).  Petitioners and <em>amici</em> nevertheless attempt to upset this interpretation in a number of ways.  First, they maintain that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 evinces no concern with the economics of nuclear power.  The statute states that the "development" and "existence" of a permanent disposal technology approved by federal authorities will lift the moratorium; the statute does not provide for considering the economic costs of the technology selected.  This view of the statute is overly myopic.  Once a technology is selected and demonstrated, the utilities and the California Public Utilities Commission would be able to estimate costs; such cost estimates cannot be made until the Federal Government has settled upon the method of long-term waste disposal.  Moreover, once a satisfactory disposal technology is found and demonstrated, fears of having to close down operating reactors should largely evaporate. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="215">Page 461 U. S. 215</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, it is suggested that California, if concerned with economics, would have banned California utilities from building plants outside the State.  This objection carries little force.  There is no indication that California utilities are contemplating such construction; the state legislature is not obligated to address purely hypothetical facets of a problem.</p>\n<p>Third, petitioners note that there already is a body, the California Public Utilities Commission, which is authorized to determine on economic grounds whether a nuclear powerplant should be constructed. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  While California is certainly free to make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, a State is not foreclosed from reaching the same decision through a legislative judgment, applicable to all cases.  The economic uncertainties engendered by the nuclear waste disposal problems are not factors that vary from facility to facility; the issue readily lends itself to more generalized decisionmaking, and California cannot be faulted for pursuing that course.</p>\n<p>Fourth, petitioners note that Proposition 15, the initiative out of which \xc2\xa7 25524.2 arose, and companion provisions in California\'s so-called nuclear laws, are more clearly written with safety purposes in mind. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  It is suggested that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 shares a common heritage with these laws, and should be presumed to have been enacted for the same purposes.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 461 U. S. 216</a></p><p> The short answer here is that these other state laws are not before the Court, and indeed, Proposition 15 was not passed; these provisions and their pedigree do not taint other parts of the Warren-Alquist Act.</p>\n<p>Although these specific indicia of California\'s intent in enacting \xc2\xa7 25524.2 are subject to varying interpretation, there are two further reasons why we should not become embroiled in attempting to ascertain California\'s true motive.  First, inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture.  <em>United States v. O\'Brien,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html">391 U. S. 367</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#383">391 U. S. 383</a></span> (1968).  What motivates one legislator to vote for a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.  Second, it would be particularly pointless for us to engage in such inquiry here when it is clear that the States have been allowed to retain authority over the need for electrical generating facilities easily sufficient to permit a State so inclined to halt the construction of new nuclear plants by refusing, on economic grounds, to issue certificates of public convenience in individual proceedings.  In these circumstances, it should be up to Congress to determine whether a State has misused the authority left in its hands.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we accept California\'s avowed economic purpose as the rationale for enacting \xc2\xa7 25524.2.  Accordingly, the statute lies outside the occupied field of nuclear safety regulation. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 461 U. S. 217</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners\' second major argument concerns federal regulation aimed at the nuclear waste disposal problem itself.  It is contended that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 conflicts with federal regulation of nuclear waste disposal, with the NRC\'s decision that it is permissible to continue to license reactors, notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding the waste disposal problem, and with Congress\' recent passage of legislation directed at that problem.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to its authority under the Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2071-2075, 2111-2114 (1976 ed. and Supp. V), the AEC, and later the NRC, promulgated extensive and detailed regulations concerning the operation of nuclear facilities and the handling of nuclear materials.  The following provisions are relevant to the spent fuel and waste disposal issues in this case.  To receive an NRC operating license, one must submit a safety analysis report, which includes a "radioactive waste handling syste[m]."  10 CFR \xc2\xa7 50.34(b)(2)(i), (ii) (1982).  <em>See also</em> 10 CFR \xc2\xa7 150.15(a)(1)(i) (1982).  The regulations specify general design criteria and control requirements for fuel storage and handling and radioactive waste to be stored at the reactor site.  10 CFR pt. 50, App. A, Criteria 60-64, p. 412 (1982).  In addition, the NRC has promulgated detailed regulations governing storage and disposal away from the reactor.  10 CFR pt. 72 (1982).  NRC has also promulgated procedural requirements covering license applications for disposal of high-level radioactive waste in geologic repositories.  10 CFR pt. 60 (1982).</p>\n<p>Congress gave the Department of Energy the responsibility for "the establishment of temporary and permanent facilities for storage, management, and ultimate disposal of nuclear wastes."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7133(a)(8)(C) (1976 ed., </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 461 U. S. 218</a></p><p> Supp. V).  No such permanent disposal facilities have yet been licensed, and the NRC and the Department of Energy continue to authorize the storage of spent fuel at reactor sites in pools of water.  In 1977, the NRC was asked by the Natural Resources Defense Council to halt reactor licensing until it had determined that there was a method of permanent disposal for high-level waste.  The NRC concluded that, given the progress toward the development of disposal facilities and the availability of interim storage, it could continue to license new reactors.  <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. NRC,</em> 582 F.2d 166, 168-169 (CA2 1978).</p>\n<p>The NRC\'s imprimatur, however, indicates only that it is safe to proceed with such plants, not that it is economically wise to do so. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Because the NRC order does not and could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="219">Page 461 U. S. 219</a></p><p> not compel a utility to develop a nuclear plant, compliance with both it and \xc2\xa7 25524.2 is possible.  Moreover, because the NRC\'s regulation are aimed at insuring that plants are safe, not necessarily that they are economical, \xc2\xa7 25524.2 does not interfere with the objective of the federal regulation.</p>\n<p>Nor has California sought through \xc2\xa7 25524.2 to impose its own standards on nuclear waste disposal.  The statute accepts that it is the federal responsibility to develop and license such technology.  As there is no attempt on California\'s part to enter this field, one which is occupied by the Federal Government, we do not find \xc2\xa7 25524.2 preempted any more by the NRC\'s obligations in the waste disposal field than by its licensing power over the plants themselves.</p>\n<p>After this case was decided by the Court of Appeals, a new piece was added to the regulatory puzzle.  In its closing week, the 97th Con gress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201, a complex bill providing for a multifaceted attack on the problem.  <em>Inter alia,</em> the bill authorizes repositories for disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, provides for licensing and expansion of interim storage, authorizes research and development, and provides a scheme for financing.  While the passage of this new legislation may convince state authorities that there is now a sufficient federal commitment to fuel storage and waste disposal that licensing of nuclear reactors may resume, and, indeed, this seems to be one of the purposes of the Act, [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] it does not appear that Congress intended  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="220">Page 461 U. S. 220</a></p><p> to make that decision for the States through this legislation.  Senator McClure attempted to do precisely that with an amendment to the Senate bill providing that the Act satisfied any legal requirements for the existence of an approved technology and facilities for disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste.  The amendment was adopted by the Senate without debate.  128 Cong.Rec. S4310 (Apr. 29, 1982).  During</p>\n<p>brk:</p>\n<p>subsequent House hearings, it was strongly urged that this language be omitted so as not to affect this case.  <em>See</em> Nuclear Waste Disposal Policy, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 356, 406, 553-554 (1982).  The bill which emerged from the House Committee did omit the Senate language, and its manager, Representative Ottinger, stated to the House that the language was deleted "to insure that there be no preemption."  128 Cong.Rec. H8797 (Dec. 2, 1982).  The bill ultimately signed into law followed the House language.  While we are correctly reluctant to draw inferences from the failure of Congress to act, it would, in this case, appear improper for us to give a reading to the Act that Congress considered and rejected.  Moreover, it is certainly possible to interpret the Act as directed at solving the nuclear waste disposal problem for existing reactors without necessarily encouraging or requiring that future plant construction be undertaken.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, it is strongly contended that \xc2\xa7 25524.2 frustrates the Atomic Energy Act\'s purpose to develop the commercial use of nuclear power.  It is well established that state law is preempted if it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="221">Page 461 U.

The Act itself states that it is a program</p>\n<p>"to encourage widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2013(d).  The House and Senate Reports confirmed that it was "a major policy goal of the United States" that the involvement of private industry would "speed the further development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy."  H.R.Rep. No. 883, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1965); H.R.Rep. No. 2181, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1954); S.Rep. No. 1699, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1954).  The same purpose is manifest in the passage of the Price-Anderson Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2210, which limits private liability from a nuclear accident.  The Act was passed "[i]n order to protect the public and to encourage the development of the atomic energy industry. . . ."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2012(i).  <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/59/case.html#63">438 U. S. 63</a></span>-67.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\' suggestion that legislation since 1974 has indicated a "change in congressional outlook" is unconvincing.  The court observed that Congress reorganized the Atomic Energy Commission in 1974 by dividing the promotional and safety responsibilities of the AEC, giving the former to the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] and the latter to the NRC.  Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 1233, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5801 <em>et seq.</em>  The evident desire of Congress to prevent safety from being </p><p><a class="page-number" name="222">Page 461 U. S. 222</a></p><p> compromised by promotional concerns does not translate into an abandonment of the objective of promoting nuclear power.  The legislation was carefully drafted, in fact, to avoid any antinuclear sentiment. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  The continuing commitment to nuclear power is reflected in the extension of the Price-Anderson Act\'s coverage until 1987, Pub.L. 94-197, \xc2\xa7 2-14, 89 Stat. 1111-1115, as well as in Congress\' express preclusion of reliance on natural gas and petroleum as primary energy sources in new powerplants, Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 3291, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8301(b)(3), 8311, 8312(a) (1976 ed., Supp. V).  It is true, of course, that Congress has sought to simultaneously promote the development of alternative energy sources, but we do not view these steps as an indication that Congress has retreated from its oft-expressed commitment to further development of nuclear power for electricity generation.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals is right, however, that the promotion of nuclear power is not to be accomplished "at all costs."  The elaborate licensing and safety provisions and the continued preservation of state regulation in traditional areas belie that.  Moreover, Congress has allowed the States to determine -- as a matter of economics -- whether a nuclear plant <em>vis-a-vis</em> a fossil fuel plant should be built.  The decision of California to exercise that authority does not, in itself, constitute a basis for preemption. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  Therefore, while the argument </p><p><a class="page-number" name="223">Page 461 U. S. 223</a></p><p> of petitioners and the United States has considerable force, the legal reality remains that Congress has left sufficient authority in the States to allow the development of nuclear power to be slowed or even stopped for economic reasons.  Given this statutory scheme, it is for Congress to rethink the division of regulatory authority in light of its possible exercise by the States to undercut a federal objective.  The courts should not assume the role which our system assigns to Congress.

Respondents also suggest that this lack of redressability rises to the level of an Art. III concern.

Respondents attempt to draw entirely too much from this statement.  The California certification provisions do not impose a moratorium on new construction; in the main, they require that information be gathered on a variety of issues and be considered by the Energy Commission.

It was recognized by the drafters that the authority of these other agencies with respect to the generation, sale, and transmission of electric power produced through the use of nuclear facilities was not affected by this new law; and that the AEC\'s regulatory control was limited to considerations involving the common defense and security and the protection of the health and safety of the public with respect to the special hazards associated with the operation of nuclear facilities.

In <em>Perez,</em> however, unlike this case, there was an actual conflict between state and federal law.  <em>Perez</em> involved an Arizona law that required insured motorists who had not satisfied judgments against them or had failed to pay settlements after accidents to prove their financial responsibility before the State would license them to drive again.  The Arizona law, contrary to the Federal Bankruptcy Act, specified that this obligation would not be discharged in bankruptcy.

The NRC denied the petition, stating that it had to examine only on-site safety risks in its licensing decisions.  42 Fed.Reg. 34391 (1977).  The NRC was <em>not</em> asked to consider whether nuclear reactors were sufficiently reliable investments in light of the unresolved waste disposal question, and the NRC did not address this issue.  Nor was the issue raised in the review of the NRC\'s decision in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. NRC,</em> 582 F.2d 166 (CA2 1978).

In the same manner, requiring compliance with state requirements would have reduced the project to a size that the Federal Power Commission had determined was inadequate, and compliance with state engineering requirements could handicap the financial success of the project.  The Atomic Energy Act does not give the NRC comprehensive planning responsibility.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7 25624.2 does not interfere with the type of plant that could be constructed.  State regulations which affected the construction and operation of federally approved nuclear powerplants would pose a different case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion, except to the extent it suggests that a State may not prohibit the construction of nuclear powerplants if the State is motivated by concerns about the safety of such plants.  Since the Court finds that California was not so motivated, this suggestion is unnecessary to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="224">Page 461 U. S. 224</a></p><p> Court\'s holding.  More important, I believe the Court\'s dictum is wrong in several respects.</p>\n<p>The Court takes the position that a State\'s safety-motivated decision to prohibit construction of nuclear powerplants would be preempted for three distinct reasons.  First, the Court states that "the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the States."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#212">461 U. S. 212</a></span>.  Second, the Court indicates that</p>\n<p>"a state judgment that nuclear power is not safe enough to be further developed would conflict squarely with the countervailing judgment of the NRC . . . that nuclear construction may proceed notwithstanding extant uncertainties as to waste disposal."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#213">461 U. S. 213</a></span>.  Third, the Court believes that a prohibition on construction of new nuclear plants would "be in the teeth of the Atomic Energy Act\'s objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use."  <em>Ibid.</em>  For reasons summarized below, I cannot agree that a State\'s nuclear moratorium, even if motivated by safety concerns, would be preempted on any of these grounds.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>First, Congress has occupied not the broad field of "nuclear safety concerns," but only the narrower area of how a nuclear plant should be constructed and operated to protect against radiation hazards. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  States traditionally have possessed the authority to choose which technologies to rely on in meeting their energy needs.  Nothing in the Atomic Energy Act limits this authority, or intimates that a State, in exercising this authority, may not consider the features that distinguish nuclear plants from other power sources.  On the contrary, \xc2\xa7 271 of the Act, 68 Stat. 960, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2018, indicates that States may continue, with respect to nuclear </p><p><a class="page-number" name="225">Page 461 U. S. 225</a></p><p> power, to exercise their traditional police power over the manner in which they meet their energy needs.  There is, in short, no evidence that Congress had a "clear and manifest purpose," <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span> (1947), to force States to be blind to whatever special dangers are posed by nuclear plants.</p>\n<p>Federal preemption of the States\' authority to decide against nuclear power would create a regulatory vacuum.  <em>See</em> Wiggins, Federalism Balancing and the Burger Court:  California\'s Nuclear Law as a Preemption Case Study, 13 U.C.D.L.Rev. 3, 64 (1979).  In making its traditional policy choices about what kinds of power are best suited to its needs, a State would be forced to ignore the undeniable fact that nuclear power entails certain risks.  While the NRC does evaluate the dangers of generating nuclear power, it does not balance those dangers against the risks, costs, and benefits of other choices available to the State or consider the State\'s standards of public convenience and necessity.  As Professor Wiggins noted:</p>\n<p>"If a state utility regulatory agency like California\'s Energy Commission is prevented from making a general evaluation of feasibility, on broad grounds of social, economic and ideological policy, then the decision <em>whether</em> to build a nuclear facility in a state will ultimately be made only by the public utility seeking its construction. . . .  It would be ironic if public energy utilities, granted a jurisdictional monopoly in large part because of their heavy regulation by the state, were freed from regulatory oversight of the one decision which promises to affect the greatest number of persons over the greatest possible time."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>In short, there is an important distinction between the threshold determination whether to permit the construction of new nuclear plants and, if the decision is to permit construction, the subsequent determinations of how to construct </p><p><a class="page-number" name="226">Page 461 U. S. 226</a></p><p> and operate those plants.  The threshold decision belongs to the State; the latter decisions are for the NRC.  <em>See</em> Note, May A State Say "No" to Nuclear Power?  <em>Pacific Legal Foundation</em> Gives a Disappointing Answer, 10 Envir.L. 189, 199 (1979) (criticizing District Court decision in the present case).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s second basis for suggesting that States may not prohibit the construction of nuclear plants on safety grounds is that such a prohibition would conflict with the NRC\'s judgment that construction of nuclear plants may safely proceed.  A flat ban for safety reasons, however, would not make "compliance with both federal and state regulations . . . a physical impossibility."  <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U. S. 142</a></span>-143 (1963).  The NRC has expressed its judgment that it is safe to proceed with construction and operation of nuclear plants, but neither the NRC nor Congress has mandated that States do so. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#205">461 U. S. 205</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>A state regulation also conflicts with federal law if it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."  <em>Hines v. Davidowitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html">312 U. S. 52</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html#67">312 U. S. 67</a></span> (1941).  The Court suggests that a safety-motivated state ban on nuclear plants would be preempted under this standard as well.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#213">461 U. S. 213</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#221">461 U. S. 221</a></span>-222. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  But Congress has merely encouraged the development </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 461 U. S. 227</a></p><p> of nuclear technology so as to make another source of energy available to the States; Congress has not forced the States to accept this particular source.  <em>See</em> Note, 10 Envir.L. at 199 ("Congress has not evidenced a dictatorial intent for every state to build nuclear powerplants").  A ban on nuclear plant construction for safety reasons thus does not conflict with Congress\' objectives or purposes.</p>\n<p>The Atomic Energy Act was intended to promote the technological development of nuclear power, at a time when there was no private nuclear power industry.  The Act addressed "the practical question of bringing such an industry into being," [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] in order to make available an additional energy source.  The Court makes much of the general statements of purpose in the Act and the legislative history, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#221">461 U. S. 221</a></span>, but those statements simply reflect Congress\' desire to create a private nuclear power industry.  Congress did not compel States to give preference to the eventual product of that industry or to ignore the peculiar problems associated with that product.  <em>See</em> Wiggins, 13 U.C.D.L.Rev. at 78.</p>\n<p>More recent legislation makes it very clear that there is no federal policy preventing a State from choosing to rely on technologies it considers safer than nuclear power.  The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 1233, 42 U.S.C. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="228">Page 461 U. S. 228</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 5801 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. V), separated promotional and regulatory functions in the area of nuclear power.  The Act established the NRC to perform the regulatory and licensing functions of the Atomic Energy Commission, \xc2\xa7 5841, and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) to "develop, and increase the efficiency and reliability of use of, all energy sources."  \xc2\xa7 5801(a). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  The legislative history of the Act expresses concern about a pronuclear bias in the regulatory agency and demonstrates a desire to have the Federal Government "place greater relative emphasis on nonnuclear energy."  S.Rep. No. 93-980, p. 14 (1974). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>This legislative purpose is consistent with the fact that States retain many means of prohibiting the construction of nuclear plants within their borders.  States may refuse to issue certificate of public convenience and necessity for individual nuclear powerplants.  They may establish siting and land use requirements for nuclear plants that are more stringent than those of the NRC.  <em>Cf.</em> NRC Authorization Act for Fiscal 1980, Pub.L. 96-295, \xc2\xa7 108(f), 94 Stat. 783.  Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, States may regulate radioactive air emissions from nuclear plants, and may impose more stringent emission standards than those promulgated by the NRC.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7416, 7422 (1976 ed., Supp. V).  This authority may be used to prevent the construction of nuclear plants altogether.  <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc. (Indian Point Station, Unit No. 2),</em> ALAB-453, 7 N.R.C. 31, 34, and n. 13 (1978). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="229">Page 461 U. S. 229</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In sum, Congress has not required States to "go nuclear," in whole or in part.  The Atomic Energy Act\'s twin goals were to promote the development of a technology and to ensure the safety of that technology.  Although that Act reserves to the NRC decisions about how to build and operate nuclear plants, the Court reads too much into the Act in suggesting that it also limits the States\' traditional power to decide what types of electric power to utilize.  Congress simply has made the nuclear option available, and a State may decline that option for any reason.  Rather than rest on the elusive test of legislative motive, therefore, I would conclude that the decision whether to build nuclear plants remains with the States.  In my view, a ban on construction of nuclear powerplants would be valid even if its authors were motivated by fear of a core meltdown or other nuclear catastrophe.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court recognizes the limited nature of the federal role, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#205">461 U.

A State\'s decision not to permit construction of nuclear plants, however, affects only indirectly the Atomic Energy Act\'s goal of ensuring that nuclear power be safe enough for widespread development.  A safety-motivated ban might highlight a State\'s perception that the federal safety goal had not been accomplished, but the ban itself would not interfere with efforts to achieve that goal.</p>\n<p>The Court apparently believes the Atomic Energy Act\'s actual purpose was to maximize the use of nuclear power to satisfy the Nation\'s needs.  A moratorium on construction of nuclear plants would prevent the accomplishment of this goal, but, as demonstrated <em>infra,</em> the Court is incorrect in attributing this goal to Congress.  Moreover, the degree to which a nuclear moratorium hampers achievement of the goal does not depend on the motives of its framers.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Address by Congressman Cole, Chairman of Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, delivered at International Congress on Nuclear Engineering (June 24, 1954), quoted in Lemov, State and Local Control Over the Location of Nuclear Reactors Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 39 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1008, 1018 (1964).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1977, ERDA\'s functions were transferred to the Department of Energy.  91 Stat. 577, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7151(a) (1976 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In subsequent legislation Congress has continued to promote many sources of energy, without giving preference to nuclear power.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 3291, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 8301 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed., Supp. V) (encouraging greater use of coal and other alternative fuels in lieu of natural gas and petroleum); Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, \xc2\xa7 210, 92 Stat. 3144, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3 1976 ed., Supp. V (encouraging development of cogeneration and small power production facilities).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
