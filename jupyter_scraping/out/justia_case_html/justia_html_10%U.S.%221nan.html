CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>Upon a critical examination of the act of assembly on which this action is founded, the Court is of opinion that it is rightly brought.  Although the drawer of the bill was not liable to the damages of Virginia, the endorser is subject to them, he having endorsed the bill in Alexandria.  The words of the act are that where a bill of exchange shall be protested, "the drawer or endorser shall be subject to 15 percent damages thereon."  The third section gives an action of debt "against the drawers or endorsers jointly, or against either of them separately."  The act of assembly appears to contemplate a distinct liability in the endorser, founded on the contract created by his own endorsement, which is not affected by the extent of the liability of the drawer.  This is the more reasonable as a bill of exchange is taken as much on the credit of the endorser as of the drawer, and the endorsement is understood to be not simply the transfer of the paper, but a new and a substantive contract. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="225">Page 10 U. S. 225</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is, however, an objection taken to this declaration.  It omits to allege notice of the protest -- an omission which is deemed fatal.</p>\n<p>It has been argued that, the act of assembly which gives the action of debt not requiring notice to be laid in the declaration, that requisite, which is only essential in an action founded on the custom of merchants, is totally dispensed with.  But this Court is not of that opinion.  In giving the action of debt to the holder of a bill of exchange, and in giving it the dignity of a specialty, the legislature has not altered the character of the paper in other respects.  It is still a pure commercial transaction governed by commercial law.  Notice of the protest is still necessary, and the omission to aver it in the declaration is still fatal.</p>\n<p>Had this error been moved in arrest of judgment, it is presumable the judgment would have been arrested; but it is not too late to allege as error, in this Court a fault in the declaration which ought to have prevented the rendition of a judgment in the court below.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment is arrested and the cause remanded with direction that the judgment be arrested.</em></p>\n<p>After the opinion was delivered, Youngs prayed that the cause might be remanded with leave to amend</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL.  Here is a verdict which must be set aside before an amendment can be allowed.</p>\n<p>It might be set aside by the court below, but this Court can see no reason in the record for setting it aside.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
