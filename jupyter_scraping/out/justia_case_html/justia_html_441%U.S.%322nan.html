JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented for decision is whether Okla.Stat., Tit. 29, \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) (Supp. 1978), violates the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution, insofar as it provides that "[n]o person may transport or ship minnows for sale outside the state which were seined or procured within the waters of this state. . . ." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 441 U. S. 324</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellant William Hughes holds a Texas license to operate a commercial minnow business near Wichita Falls, Tex.  An Oklahoma game ranger arrested him on a charge of violating \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) by transporting from Oklahoma to Wichita Falls a load of natural minnows purchased from a minnow dealer licensed to do business in Oklahoma.  Hughes\' defense that \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) was unconstitutional because it was repugnant to the Commerce Clause was rejected, and he was convicted and fined.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating:</p>\n<p>"The United States Supreme Court has held on numerous occasions that the wild animals and fish within a state\'s border are, so far as capable of ownership, owned by the state in its sovereign capacity for the common </p><p><a class="page-number" name="325">Page 441 U. S. 325</a></p><p> benefit of all its people.  Because of such ownership, and in the exercise of its police power, the state may regulate and control the taking, subsequent use and property rights that may be acquired therein.  <em>Lacoste v. Department of Conservation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/263/545/case.html">263 U. S. 545</a></span> . . . ; <em>Geer v.

As stated in <em>Lacoste, supra,</em> protection of the wildlife of a state is peculiarly within the police power of the state, an the state has great latitude in determining what means are appropriate for its protection."</p>\n<p>". . .  Oklahoma law does not prohibit commercial minnow hatcheries within her borders from selling stock minnows to anyone, resident or nonresident, and minnows purchased therefrom may be freely exported.  However, the law served to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma\'s natural streams through commercial exportation.  No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma.  Such a prohibition is not repugnant to the commerce clause. . . ."</p>\n<p>572 P.2d 573, 575 (1977).  We noted probable jurisdiction, 439 U.S. 815 (1978).  We reverse.  <em>Geer v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html">161 U. S. 519</a></span> (1896), on which the Court of Criminal Appeals relied, is overruled.  In that circumstance, \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) cannot survive appellant\'s Commerce Clause attack.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The few simple words of the Commerce Clause -- "The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . ." -- reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention:  the conviction that, in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 441 U. S. 326</a></p><p> <em>See H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/525/case.html">336 U.

The Commerce Clause has accordingly been interpreted by this Court not only as an authorization for congressional action, but also, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute, as a restriction on permissible state regulation. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The cases defining the cope of permissible state regulation in areas of congressional silence reflect an often controversial evolution of rules to accommodate federal and state interests. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Geer v. Connecticut</em> was decided relatively early in that evolutionary process.  We hold that time has revealed the error of the early resolution reached in that case, and accordingly, <em>Geer</em> is today overruled. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="327">Page 441 U. S. 327</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Geer</em> sustained against a Commerce Clause challenge a statute forbidding the transportation beyond the State of game birds that had been lawfully killed within the State. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The decision rested on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved.  This conclusion followed, in turn, from the view that the State had the power, as representative for its citizens, who "owned" in common all wild animals within the State, to control not only the taking of game but also the ownership of game that had been lawfully reduced to possession. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  By virtue of this power, Connecticut could qualify the ownership of wild game taken within the State by, for example, prohibiting its removal from the State:  "The common ownership imports the right to keep the property, if the sovereign so chooses, always within its jurisdiction for every purpose."  161 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html#530">161 U. S. 530</a></span>.  Accordingly, the State\'s power to qualify ownership raised serious doubts whether the sale or exchange of wild game constituted "commerce" at all; in any event, the Court held that the qualification imposed by the challenged statute removed any transactions involving wild game killed in Connecticut from <em>interstate</em> commerce. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 441 U. S. 328</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Mr. Justice Field and the first Mr. Justice Harlan dissented, rejecting as artificial and formalistic the Court\'s analysis of "ownership" and "commerce" in wild game.  They would have affirmed the State\'s power to provide for the protection of wild game, but only "so far as such protection . . . does not contravene the power of Congress in the regulation of interstate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 441 U. S. 329</a></p><p> commerce." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Their view was that,</p>\n<p>"[w]hen any animal . . . is lawfully killed for the purposes of food or other uses of man, it becomes an article of commerce, and its use cannot be limited to the citizens of one State to the exclusion of citizens of another State. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The view of the <em>Geer</em> dissenters increasingly prevailed in subsequent cases.  Indeed, not only has the <em>Geer</em> analysis been rejected when natural resources other than wild game were involved, but even state regulations of wild game have been held subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause under the pretext of distinctions from <em>Geer.</em></p>\n<p>The erosion of <em>Geer</em> began only 15 years after it was decided.  A Commerce Clause challenge was addressed to an Oklahoma statute designed to prohibit the transportation beyond the State of natural gas produced by wells within the State.  <em>West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/229/case.html">221 U. S. 229</a></span> (1911).  Based on reasoning parallel to that in <em>Geer,</em> Oklahoma urged its right to "conserve" the gas for the use of its own citizens, stressing the limited supply and the absence of alternative sources of fuel within the State.  Nevertheless, the Court, in a passage reminiscent of the dissents in <em>Geer,</em> condemned the obvious protectionist motive in the Oklahoma statute and rejected the State\'s arguments with a powerful reaffirmation of the vision of the Framers:</p>\n<p>"The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation. . . .  If the States have such power, a singular situation might result.  Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 441 U. S. 330</a></p><p> States their minerals.  And why may not the products of the field be brought within the principle?  Thus enlarged, or without that enlargement, its influence on interstate commerce need not be pointed out.  To what consequences does such power tend?  If one State has it, all States have it; embargo may be retaliated by embargo, and commerce will be halted at state lines.  And yet we have said that, \'in matters of foreign and interstate commerce, there are no state lines.\'  In such commerce, instead of the States, a new power appears, and a new welfare, a welfare which transcends that of any State.  But rather let us say it is constituted of the welfare of all of the States, and that of each State is made the greater by a division of its resources, natural and created, with every other State, and those of every other State with it.  This was the purpose, as it is the result, of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.  If there is to be a turning backward, it must be done by the authority of another instrumentality than a court."</p>\n<p>221 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/229/case.html#255">221 U. S. 255</a></span>-256.  The Court distinguished discriminatory or prohibatory regulations offensive to the Commerce Clause, such as the Oklahoma statute, from a valid "exercise of the police power to regulate the taking of natural gas" that was "universal in its application and justified by the nature of the gas and which allowed its transportation to other states."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/229/case.html#257">221 U.

If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will, of course, depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities."</p>\n<p>(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p>This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey\'s attempt to "conserve" the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State.  <em>Philadelphia v.

The first challenge to <em>Geer\'s</em> theory of a State\'s power over wild animals came in <em>Missouri v. Holland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/416/case.html">252 U. S. 416</a></span> (1920).  The State of Missouri, relying on the theory of state ownership of wild animals, attacked the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the ground that it interfered with the State\'s control over wild animals within its boundaries.  Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes upheld the Act as a proper </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 441 U. S. 332</a></p><p> exercise of the treatymaking power.  He commented in passing on he artificiality of the <em>Geer</em> rationale:  "To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed."  252 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/416/case.html#434">252 U.

A Louisiana statute forbade the transportation beyond the State of shrimp taken in Louisiana waters until the heads and shells had been removed. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The statute clearly relied on the <em>Geer</em> "state control of ownership" rationale. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Anyone lawfully taking shrimp from Louisiana waters was granted "a qualified interest which may be sold within the State."  Only after the head and shell </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 441 U.

The analysis resembled that employed in the natural gas cases, which were cited with approval, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/278/1/case.html#10">278 U.

Overruling <em>Geer</em> also eliminates the anomaly, created by the decisions distinguishing <em>Geer,</em> that statutes imposing the most extreme burdens on interstate commerce (essentially total embargoes) were the most immune from challenge.  At the same time, the general rule we adopt in this case makes ample allowance for preserving, in ways not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 441 U.

Under that general rule, we must inquire (1) whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; (2) whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, (3) whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce.  The burden to show discrimination rests on the party challenging the validity of the statute, but,</p>\n<p>"[w]hen discrimination against commerce . . . is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake."</p>\n<p><em>Hunt v.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  At a minimum, such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma argues that \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) serves a legitimate local purpose in that it is "readily apparent as a conservation measure."  Brief for Appellee 8.  The State\'s interest in maintaining the ecological balance in state waters by avoiding the removal of inordinate numbers of minnows may well qualify as a legitimate local purpose.  We consider the States\' interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes similar to the States\' interests in protecting the health and safety of their citizens.  <em>See, e.g., Firemen v. Chicago, R.I. &amp; P. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/129/case.html">393 U. S. 129</a></span> (1968).  But the scope of legitimate state interests in "conservation" is narrower under this analysis than it was under <em>Geer.</em>  A State may no longer "keep the property, if the sovereign so chooses, always within its jurisdiction for every purpose."  <em>Geer v. Connecticut,</em> 161 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html#530">161 U. S. 530</a></span>.  The fiction of state ownership may no longer be used to force those outside the State to bear the full costs of "conserving" the wild animals within its borders when equally effective nondiscriminatory conservation measures are available.</p>\n<p>Far from choosing the least discriminatory alternative, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="338">Page 441 U. S. 338</a></p><p> Oklahoma has chosen to "conserve" its minnows in the way that most overtly discriminates against interstate commerce.  The State places no limits on the numbers of minnows that can be taken by licensed minnow dealers; nor does it limit in any way how these minnows may be disposed of within the State. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Yet it forbids the transportation of any commercially significant number of natural minnows out of the State for sale. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Section 4-115(B) is certainly not a "last ditch" attempt at conservation after nondiscriminatory alternatives have proved unfeasible.  It is rather a choice of the most discriminatory means even though nondiscriminatory alternatives would seem likely to fulfill the State\'s purported legitimate local purpose more effectively. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>We therefore hold that \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) is repugnant to the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The overruling of <em>Geer</em> does not leave the States powerless to protect and conserve wild animal life within their borders.  Today\'s decision makes clear, however, that States may promote </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 441 U.

Another provision of that Code requires that persons have a minnow dealer\'s license before they can lawfully seine or trap minnows within the State except for their own use as bait -- \xc2\xa7 4-116 (Supp. 1978), but no limit is imposed on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters.  Nor is there any regulation except \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) concerning the disposition of lawfully acquired minnows; they may be sold within Oklahoma to any person and for any purpose, and may be taken out of the State for any purpose except sale.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commerce Clause is one of the most prolific sources of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the state.  While the Constitution vests in Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, it does not say what the states may or may not do in the absence of congressional action, nor how to draw the line between what is and what is not commerce among the states.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This Court\'s seeming preoccupation in recent years with laws relating to wildlife must, I suspect, appear curious to casual observers of this institution. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  It is no more curious, however, than this Court\'s recent pronouncements on the validity of <em>Geer v.

For less than one year ago, we unreservedly reaffirmed the principles announced in <em>Geer.</em> <em>Baldwin v.

Because I disagree with the Court\'s overruling of <em>Geer</em> and holding that Oklahoma\'s law relating to the sale of minnows violates the Commerce Clause, I dissent.</p>\n<p>In its headlong rush to overrule <em>Geer,</em> the Court characterizes that decision as "rest[ing] on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html#327">441 U. S. 327</a></span>.  It is true that one of the rationales relied on by the <em>Geer</em> Court was that the State could exercise its power to control the killing and ownership of animals <em>ferae naturae</em> to prohibit such game </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 441 U. S. 340</a></p><p> from leaving the borders of the State, and thus prevent the game from ever becoming the objects of interstate commerce.  161 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html#530">161 U. S. 530</a></span>-532.  Since the Court, in <em>Geer,</em> was of the view that the challenged statute effectively prevented certain game from entering the stream of interstate commerce, there could be no basis for a Commerce Clause challenge to the State\'s law.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html#530">161 U.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  I do not dispute the Court\'s rejection of this theory; as the Court points out, this rationale was rejected long before today.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html#329">441 U.

My objection is that this line of reasoning, while undoubtedly considered important by the majority in <em>Geer,</em> is unnecessary to sustain that decision [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] and is unneeded in the disposition of the present </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 441 U. S. 341</a></p><p> case.  And no one -- not the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals or the State in this Court -- contends that the minnows at issue are not the subjects of interstate commerce.  It is obvious that the Court has simply set this theory up as a sort of strawman to facilitate the toppling of a decision which, in other respects, enunciates principles that have remained valid and vital, albeit somewhat refined, at least until today. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Geer</em> expressed the view derived from Roman law that the wild fish and game located within the territorial limits of a State are the common property of its citizens, and that the State, as a kind of trustee, may exercise this common "ownership" for the benefit of its citizens.  161 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/519/case.html#529">161 U.

At least, no such showing has been made on the record before us.  <em>Cf. Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application.  <em>See</em> Okla.Stat., Tit. 29, \xc2\xa7 4-115(B) (Supp. 1978).  The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition.  <em>See Hunt v.

And, notwithstanding the Court\'s protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State\'s borders.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html#336">441 U.

On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma\'s regulatory scheme. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State.  But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State\'s waters in any way increases appellant\'s costs of doing business.  There also is nothing in the record to indicate that naturally seined minnows are any more desirable as items of commerce than hatchery minnows.  So far as the record before us indicates, hatchery minnows and naturally seined minnows are fungible.  Accordingly, any minimal burden that may result from requiring appellant to purchase minnows destined for sale out of state from hatcheries instead of from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 441 U. S. 346</a></p><p> those licensed to seine minnows is, in my view, more than outweighed by Oklahoma\'s substantial interest in conserving and regulating exploitation of its natural minnow population.

In <em>Pike,</em> the Court stated:</p>\n<p>"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. . . .  If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will, of course, depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities."</p>\n<p>397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html#142">397 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 18, 20, 21-23.  Since, in my view, the prohibition on export of naturally seined minnows imposes little, if any, burden on the interstate commerce in minnows, the State has not violated the Commerce Clause by choosing an export ban on natural minnows as the means to effectuate its special interest in conserving wildlife located within its territorial limits.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, even putting aside the decision in <em>Geer</em> and the principles for which it has come to be known and considering the Oklahoma statute "according to the same general rule applied to state regulations of other natural resources," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html#335">441 U.
