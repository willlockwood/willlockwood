This quartermaster in that month shipped to the officer in charge of military railroad transportation at Nashville 130,605 pounds of cotton, but whether the cotton of the claimant was included in the shipment was not shown.  It seemed, however, that the officer in charge turned over to the Treasury agent at Nashville 1,382 bales and a large quantity of loose cotton coming from Atlanta, Chattanooga, and points beyond Chattanooga, in Georgia.  The cotton received by this agent was forwarded to the supervising agent at Cincinnati and sold by him, and the proceeds paid into the Treasury.</p>\n<p>It was shown that in the month of December, 1864, there was a sale of cotton at Cincinnati, and sundry bales of cotton marked with the claimant\'s mark were sold.

The presumption in this case is strengthened by the fact that heavy statutory penalties would be incurred by neglect of duty.  There is nothing in the case to repel this presumption.  If any evidence to this effect exists, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 81 U. S. 5</a></p><p> it must be contained in the books of the Treasury Department, and these are under the control of the defendant.</p>\n<p>We think, therefore, that the conclusion of the Court of Claims that the proceeds of the 73 bales of cotton belonging to the claimant were paid into the Treasury, and that the claimant was entitled to judgment, was right.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* 12 Stat. at Large 820.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DAVIS, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE SWAYNE and MR. JUSTICE MILLER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the burden of proof in this case is on the claimant to show that the money which he seeks to obtain under the Captured and Abandoned Property Act has been paid into the Treasury.  The Court, in its opinion, throws the burden of proof, on this point on the United States, and on that account I am constrained to dissent from the judgment in the case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
