JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>When a state criminal proceeding under a disputed state criminal statute is pending against a federal plaintiff at the time his federal complaint is filed, <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971), and <em>Samuels v. Mackell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html">401 U. S. 66</a></span> (1971), held, respectively, that, unless bad faith enforcement or other special circumstances are demonstrated, principles of equity, comity, and federalism preclude issuance of a federal injunction restraining enforcement of the criminal statute and, in all but unusual circumstances, a declaratory judgment upon the constitutionality of the statute.  This case presents the important question reserved in <em>Samuels v. Mackell, id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html#73">401 U. S. 73</a></span>-74, whether declaratory relief is precluded when a state prosecution has been threatened, but is not pending, and a showing of bad faith enforcement or other special circumstances has not been made.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, and others, filed a complaint in the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, invoking the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, and its jurisdictional implementation, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343.  The complaint requested a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201-2202, that Ga.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 26-1603 (1972) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] was being applied in violation of petitioner\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 415 U. S. 455</a></p><p> First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and an injunction restraining respondents -- the solicitor of the Civil and Criminal Court of DeKalb County, the chief of the DeKalb County Police, the owner of the North DeKalb Shopping Center, and the manager of that shopping center -- from enforcing the statute so as to interfere with petitioner\'s constitutionally protected activities.</p>\n<p>The parties stipulated to the relevant facts:  on October 8, 1970, while petitioner and other individuals were distributing handbills protesting American involvement in Vietnam on an exterior sidewalk of the North DeKalb Shopping Center, shopping center employees asked them to stop handbilling and leave. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  They declined to do so, and police officers were summoned.  The officers told them that they would be arrested if they did not stop handbilling.  The group then left to avoid arrest.  Two days later, petitioner and a companion returned to the shopping center and again began handbilling.  The manager of the center called the police, and petitioner and his companion were once again told that failure to stop their handbilling would result in their arrests.  Petitioner left to avoid arrest.  His companion stayed, however, continued </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 415 U. S. 456</a></p><p> handbilling, and was arrested and subsequently arraigned on a charge of criminal trespass in violation of \xc2\xa7 26-1503. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Petitioner alleged in his complaint that, although he desired to return to the shopping center to distribute handbills, he had not done so because of his concern that he, too, would be arrested for violation of \xc2\xa7 26-1503; the parties stipulated that, if petitioner returned and refused upon request to stop handbilling, a warrant would be sworn out and he might be arrested and charged with a violation of the Georgia statute. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>After hearing, the District Court denied all relief and dismissed the action, finding that "no meaningful contention can be made that the state has [acted] or will in the future act in bad faith," and therefore "the rudiments of an active controversy between the parties . . . [are] lacking."  334 F.Supp. 1386, 1389-1390 (1971).  Petitioner appealed [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] only from the denial of declaratory relief. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, one judge concurring in the result, affirmed the District Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 415 U. S. 457</a></p><p> judgment refusing declaratory relief. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Becker v. Thompson,</em> 459 F.2d 919 (1972).  The court recognized that the holdings of <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>(1971), and <em>Samuels v. Mackell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html">401 U. S. 66</a></span> (1971), were expressly limited to situations where state prosecutions were pending when the federal action commenced, but was of the view that <em>Younger v. Harris</em> "made it clear beyond peradventure that irreparable injury must be measured by bad faith harassment and such test must be applied to a request for injunctive relief against threatened state court criminal prosecution" as well as against a pending prosecution; and, furthermore, since the opinion in <em>Samuels v. Mackell</em> reasoned that declaratory relief would normally disrupt the state criminal justice system in the manner of injunctive relief, it followed that "the same test of bad </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 415 U. S. 458</a></p><p> faith harassment is prerequisite . . . for declaratory relief in a threatened prosecution."  459 F.2d at 922.  A petition for rehearing en banc was denied, three judges dissenting.  463 F.2d 1338 (1972). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 410 U.S. 953 (1973), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the threshold, we must consider whether petitioner presents an "actual controversy," a requirement imposed by Art. III of the Constitution and the express terms of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 415 U. S. 459</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Unlike three of the appellees in <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#41">401 U. S. 41</a></span>, petitioner has alleged threats of prosecution that cannot be characterized as "imaginary or speculative," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#42">401 U. S. 42</a></span>.  He has been twice warned to stop handbilling that he claims is constitutionally protected, and has been told by the police that, if he again handbills at the shopping center and disobeys a warning to stop, he will likely be prosecuted.  The prosecution of petitioner\'s handbilling companion is ample demonstration that petitioner\'s concern with arrest has not been "chimerical," <em>Poe v. Ullman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html#508">367 U. S. 508</a></span> (1961).  In these circumstances, it is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional right.  <em>See, e.g., Epperson v. Arkansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/97/case.html">393 U. S. 97</a></span> (1968).  Moreover, petitioner\'s challenge is to those specific provisions of state law which have provided the basis for threats of criminal prosecution against him.  <em>Cf. Boyle v. Landry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/77/case.html">401 U. S. 77</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/77/case.html#81">401 U. S. 81</a></span> (1971); <em>Watson v. Buck,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/387/case.html">313 U.

S. 399</a></span>-400 (1941).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there remains a question as to the continuing existence of a live and acute controversy that must be resolved on the remand we order today. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In <em>Golden v. Zwickler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/103/case.html">394 U. S. 103</a></span> (1969), the appellee sought a declaratory judgment that a state criminal statute prohibiting the distribution of anonymous election-campaign literature was unconstitutional.  The appellee\'s complaint had expressed a desire to distribute handbills during the forthcoming reelection campaign of a Congressman, but it was later learned that the Congressman </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 415 U. S. 460</a></p><p> had retired from the House of Representatives to become a New York Supreme Court Justice.  In that circumstance, we found no extant controversy, since the record revealed that appellee\'s sole target of distribution had been the Congressman, and there was no immediate prospect of the Congressman\'s again becoming a candidate for public office.  Here, petitioner\'s complaint indicates that his handbilling activities were directed "against the War in Vietnam and the United States\' foreign policy in Southeast Asia."  Since we cannot ignore the recent developments reducing the Nation\'s involvement in that part of the world, it will be for the District Court on remand to determine if subsequent events have so altered petitioner\'s desire to engage in handbilling at the shopping center that it can no longer be said that this case presents</p>\n<p>"a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment."</p>\n<p><em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/270/case.html">312 U.

S. 244</a></span> n. 3 (1967).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We now turn to the question of whether the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly found petitioner\'s request for declaratory relief inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Sensitive to principles of equity, comity, and federalism, we recognized in <em>Younger v. Harris, supra,</em> that federal courts should ordinarily refrain from enjoining ongoing state criminal prosecutions.  We were cognizant that a pending state proceeding, in all but unusual cases, would provide the federal plaintiff with the necessary vehicle for vindicating his constitutional rights, and, in that circumstance, the restraining of an ongoing prosecution would entail an unseemly failure to give effect to the principle that state courts have the solemn responsibility, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 415 U. S. 461</a></p><p> equally with the federal courts "to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States. . . ."  <em>Robb v. Connolly,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/624/case.html">111 U. S. 624</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/624/case.html#637">111 U. S. 637</a></span> (1884).  In <em>Samuels v. Mackell, supra,</em> the Court also found that the same principles ordinarily would be flouted by issuance of a federal declaratory judgment when a state proceeding was pending, since the intrusive effect of declaratory relief</p>\n<p>"will result in precisely the same interference with and disruption of state proceedings that the longstanding policy limiting injunctions was designed to avoid."</p>\n<p>401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html#72">401 U. S. 72</a></span>. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  We therefore held in <em>Samuels</em> that,</p>\n<p>"in cases where the state criminal prosecution was begun prior to the federal suit, the same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html#73">401 U. S. 73</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Neither <em>Younger</em> nor <em>Samuels,</em> however, decided the question whether federal intervention might be permissible in the absence of a pending state prosecution.  In <em>Younger,</em> the Court said:</p>\n<p>"We express no view about the circumstances under which federal courts may act when there is no prosecution pending in state courts at the time the federal proceeding is begun."</p>\n<p>401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#41">401 U.

When no state criminal proceeding is pending at the time the federal complaint is filed, federal intervention does not result in duplicative legal proceedings or disruption of the state criminal justice system; nor can federal intervention, in that circumstance, be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state court\'s ability to enforce constitutional principles.  In addition, while a pending state prosecution provides the federal plaintiff with a concrete opportunity to vindicate his constitutional rights, a refusal on the part of the federal courts to intervene when no state proceeding is pending may place the hapless plaintiff between the Scylla of intentionally flouting state law and the Charybdis of forgoing what he believes to be constitutionally protected activity in order to avoid becoming enmeshed in a criminal proceeding.  <em>Cf. Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Four years later, in the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, Congress conferred upon the lower federal courts, for but the second time in their nearly century-old history, general federal question jurisdiction subject only to a jurisdictional amount requirement, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  With this latter enactment, the lower federal courts</p>\n<p>"ceased to be restricted tribunals of fair dealing between citizens of different states and became the <em>primary</em> and powerful reliances for vindicating every right given by the Constitution, the laws, and treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>F.

S. 107</a></span> (separate opinion of BRENNAN, J.).</p>\n<p>A "storm of controversy" raged in the wake of <em>Ex parte Young,</em> focusing principally on the power of a single federal judge to grant <em>ex parte</em> interlocutory injunctions against the enforcement of state statutes, H. Hart &amp; H. Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 967 (2d ed.1973); <em>see generally Goldstein v. Cox,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/471/case.html">396 U. S. 471</a></span> (1970); Hutcheson, A Case for Three Judges, 47 Harv.L.Rev. 795, 804-805 (1934).  This uproar was only partially quelled by Congress\' passage of legislation, 36 Stat. 557, requiring the convening of a three-judge district court [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] before a preliminary injunction against enforcement of a state statute could issue, and providing for direct appeal to this Court from a decision granting or denying such relief. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  <em>See</em> 28 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 415 U. S. 466</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2281, 1253.  From a State\'s viewpoint the granting of injunctive relief -- even by these courts of special dignity -- "rather clumsily" crippled state enforcement of its statutes pending further review, <em>see</em> H.R.Rep. No. 288, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1928); H.R.Rep. No. 94, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1929); H.R.Rep. No. 627, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1932).  Furthermore, plaintiffs were dissatisfied with this method of testing the constitutionality of state statutes, since it placed upon them the burden of demonstrating the traditional prerequisites to equitable relief -- most importantly, irreparable injury.  <em>See, e.g., Fenner v. Boykin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/271/240/case.html">271 U. S. 240</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/271/240/case.html#243">271 U. S. 243</a></span> (1926).</p>\n<p>To dispel these difficulties, Congress, in 1934, enacted the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2201-2202.  That Congress plainly intended declaratory relief to act as an alternative to the strong medicine of the injunction and to be utilized to test the constitutionality of state criminal statutes in cases where injunctive relief would be unavailable is amply evidenced by the legislative history of the Act, traced in full detail in <em>Perez v. Ledesma, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html#111">401 U. S. 111</a></span>-115 (separate opinion of BRENNAN, J.).  The highlights of that history, particularly pertinent to our inquiry today, emphasize that:</p>\n<p>"[I]n 1934, without expanding or reducing the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts or in any way diminishing the continuing vitality of <em>Ex parte Young</em> with respect to federal injunctions, Congress empowered the federal courts to grant a new remedy, the declaratory judgment. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 415 U. S. 467</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The express purpose of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act was to provide a milder alternative to the injunction remedy. . . .  Of particular significance on the question before us, the Senate report [S.Rep. No. 1005, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934)] makes it even clearer that the declaratory judgment was designed to be available to test state criminal statutes in circumstances where an injunction would not be appropriate. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Much of the hostility to federal injunctions referred to in the Senate report was hostility to their use against state officials seeking to enforce state regulatory statutes carrying criminal sanctions; this was the strong feeling that produced the Three-Judge Court Act in 1910, the Johnson Act of 1934, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342, and the Tax Injunction Act of 1937, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341.  The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act was intended to provide an alternative to injunctions against state officials, except where there was a federal policy against federal adjudication of the class of litigation altogether. . . .  Moreover, the Senate report\'s clear implication that declaratory relief would have been appropriate in <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/268/510/case.html">268 U. S. 510</a></span> (1925), and <em>Village of Euclid v.

Thompson</em> which also involved anticipatory federal adjudication of the constitutionality of a state criminal statute, make it plain that Congress anticipated that the declaratory judgment procedure would be used by the federal courts to test the constitutionality </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 415 U.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>It was this history that formed the backdrop to our decision in <em>Zwickler v. Koota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html">389 U. S. 241</a></span> (1967), where a state criminal statute was attacked on grounds of unconstitutional overbreadth and no state prosecution was pending against the federal plaintiff.  There, we found error in a three-judge district court\'s considering, as a single question, the propriety of granting injunctive and declaratory relief.  Although we noted that injunctive relief might well be unavailable under principles of equity jurisprudence canvassed in <em>Douglas v. City of Jeannette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/157/case.html">319 U. S. 157</a></span> (1943), we held that</p>\n<p>"a federal district court has the duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction."</p>\n<p>389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html#254">389 U.

In those two cases, we declined to decide whether the District Courts had properly denied to the federal plaintiffs, against whom no prosecutions were pending, injunctive relief restraining enforcement of the Texas and Georgia criminal abortion statutes; instead, we affirmed the issuance of declaratory judgments of unconstitutionality, anticipating that these would be given effect by state authorities.  We said:</p>\n<p>"The Court has recognized that <em>different considerations</em> enter into a federal court\'s decision as to declaratory relief, on the one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other.  <em>Zwickler v.

S. 201</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The "different considerations" entering into a decision whether to grant declaratory relief have their origins in the preceding historical summary.  First, as Congress recognized in 1934, a declaratory judgment will have a less intrusive effect on the administration of state criminal laws.  As was observed in <em>Perez v. Ledesma,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html#124">401 U. S. 124</a></span>-126 (separate opinion of BRENNAN, J.):</p>\n<p>"Of course, a favorable declaratory judgment may nevertheless be valuable to the plaintiff though it cannot make even an unconstitutional statute disappear.  A state statute may be declared unconstitutional <em>in toto</em> -- that is, incapable of having constitutional applications; or it may be declared unconstitutionally vague or overbroad -- that is, incapable of being constitutionally applied to the full extent of its purport.  In either case, a federal declaration of unconstitutionality reflects the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 415 U. S. 470</a></p><p> opinion of the federal court that the statute cannot be fully enforced.  If a declaration of total unconstitutionality is affirmed by this Court, it follows that this Court stands ready to reverse any conviction under the statute.  If a declaration of partial unconstitutionality is affirmed by this Court, the implication is that this Court will overturn particular applications of the statute, but that, if the statute is narrowly construed by the state courts it will not be incapable of constitutional applications.  Accordingly, the declaration does not necessarily bar prosecutions under the statute, as a broad injunction would.  Thus, where the highest court of a State has had an opportunity to give a statute regulating expression a narrowing or clarifying construction but has failed to do so, and later a federal court declares the statute unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, it may well be open to a state prosecutor, after the federal court decision, to bring a prosecution under the statute if he reasonably believes that the defendant\'s conduct is not constitutionally protected and that the state courts may give the statute a construction so as to yield a constitutionally valid conviction.  Even where a declaration of unconstitutionality is not reviewed by this Court, the declaration may still be able to cut down the deterrent effect of an unconstitutional state statute.  The persuasive force of the court\'s opinion and judgment may lead state prosecutors, courts, and legislators to reconsider their respective responsibilities toward the statute.  Enforcement policies or judicial construction may be changed, or the legislature may repeal the statute and start anew.  Finally, the federal court judgment may have some <em>res judicata</em> effect, though this point is not free from difficulty, and the governing rules remain to be developed with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 415 U. S. 471</a></p><p> a view to the proper workings of a federal system. What is clear, however, is that, even though a declaratory judgment has \'the force and effect of a final judgment,\' 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201, it is a much milder form of relief than an injunction.  Though it may be persuasive, it is not ultimately coercive; noncompliance with it may be inappropriate, but is not contempt. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]"</p>\n<p>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p>Second, engrafting upon the Declaratory Judgment Act a requirement that all of the traditional equitable prerequisites to the issuance of an injunction be satisfied before the issuance of a declaratory judgment is considered would defy Congress\' intent to make declaratory relief available in cases where an injunction would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p>"Were the law to be that a plaintiff could not obtain a declaratory judgment that a local ordinance was unconstitutional when no state prosecution is pending unless he could allege and prove circumstances justifying a federal injunction of an existing state prosecution, the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act would have been <em>pro tanto</em> repealed."</p>\n<p><em>Wulp v. Corcoran,</em> 454 F.2d 826, 832 (CA1 1972) (Coffin, J.).  <em>See Perez v. Ledesma,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html#116">401 U. S. 116</a></span> (separate opinion of BRENNAN, J.).  Thus, the Court of Appeals was in error when it ruled that a failure to demonstrate irreparable injury -- a traditional prerequisite to injunctive relief, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 415 U. S. 472</a></p><p> having no equivalent in the law of declaratory judgments, <em>see Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html">300 U. S. 227</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html#241">300 U. S. 241</a></span> (1937); <em>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co. v.

S. 264</a></span> (1933) -- precluded the granting of declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>The only occasions where this Court has disregarded these "different considerations" and found that a preclusion of injunctive relief inevitably led to a denial of declaratory relief have been cases in which principles of federalism militated altogether against federal intervention in a class of adjudications.  <em>See Great Lakes Co. v. Huffman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/293/case.html">319 U. S. 293</a></span> (1943) (federal policy against interfering with the enforcement of state tax laws); [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] <em>Samuels v. Mackell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html">401 U. S. 66</a></span> (1971).  In the instant case, principles of federalism not only do not preclude federal intervention, they compel it.  Requiring the federal courts totally to step aside when no state criminal prosecution is pending against the federal plaintiff would turn federalism on its head.  When federal claims are premised on 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3) -- as they are here -- we have not required exhaustion of state judicial or administrative remedies, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 415 U. S. 473</a></p><p> recognizing.the paramount role Congress has assigned to the federal courts to protect constitutional rights.  <em>See, e.g., McNeese v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/668/case.html">373 U. S. 668</a></span> (1963); <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961).  But exhaustion of state remedies is precisely what would be required if both federal injunctive and declaratory relief were unavailable in a case where no state prosecution had been commenced.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents, however, relying principally upon our decision in <em>Cameron v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/611/case.html">390 U. S. 611</a></span> (1968), argue that, although it may be appropriate to issue a declaratory judgment when no state criminal proceeding is pending and the attack is upon the facial validity of a state criminal statute, such a step would be improper where, as here, the attack is merely upon the constitutionality of the statute as applied, since the State\'s interest in unencumbered enforcement of its laws outweighs the minimal federal interest in protecting the constitutional rights of only a single individual.  We reject the argument.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cameron v. Johnson,</em> the appellants sought a declaratory judgment that a Mississippi anti-picketing law was an overly broad and vague regulation of protected expression and an injunction restraining pending prosecutions against them for violations of the statute.  We agreed with the District Court that the statute was not overly broad or vague, and that nothing in the record supported appellants\' assertion that they were being prosecuted in bad faith.  In that circumstance, we held that</p>\n<p>"[t]he mere possibility of erroneous application of the statute does not amount \'to the irreparable injury necessary to justify a disruption of orderly state proceedings.\' . . .  The issue of guilt or innocence is for the state court at the criminal trial; the State was not required to prove appellants guilty in the federal proceeding to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 415 U. S. 474</a></p><p> escape the finding that the State had no expectation of securing valid convictions."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/611/case.html#621">390 U. S. 621</a></span>.  Our holding in <em>Cameron</em> was thus that the state courts in which prosecutions were already pending would have to be given the first opportunity to correct any misapplication of the state criminal laws; <em>Cameron</em> is plainly not authority for the proposition that, in the absence of a pending state proceeding, a federal plaintiff may not seek a declaratory judgment that the state statute is being applied in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the State\'s concern with potential interference in the administration of its criminal laws is of lesser dimension when an attack is made upon the constitutionality of a state statute as applied.  A declaratory judgment of a lower federal court that a state statute is invalid <em>in toto</em> -- and therefore incapable of any valid application -- or is overbroad or vague -- and therefore no person can properly be convicted under the statute until it is given a narrowing or clarifying construction, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/363/case.html">402 U. S. 363</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/363/case.html#369">402 U. S. 369</a></span> (1971); <em>Gooding v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html">405 U. S. 518</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html#520">405 U. S. 520</a></span> (1972) -- will likely have a more significant potential for disruption of state enforcement policies than a declaration specifying a limited number of impermissible applications of the statute.  While the federal interest may be greater when a state statute is attacked on its face, since there exists the potential for eliminating any broad-ranging deterrent effect on would-be actors, <em>see Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965), we do not find this consideration controlling.  The solitary individual who suffers a deprivation of his constitutional rights is no less deserving of redress than one who suffers together with others.

Into this dilemma no civilized legal system operating under a constitution should force any person.  The court, in effect, by refusing an injunction, informs the prospective victim that the only way to determine whether the suspect is a mushroom or a toadstool is to eat it.

There would also, I think, be additional circumstances in which the federal judgment should be considered as more than a mere precedent bearing on the issue before the state court.</p>\n<p>Neither can I, at this stage, agree that the federal court, having rendered a declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiff, could not enjoin a later state prosecution for conduct that the federal court has declared immune.  The Declaratory Judgment Act itself provides that a "declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201; eminent authority anticipated that declaratory judgments would be <em>res judicata,</em> E. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 10-11 (2d ed.1941); and there is every reason for not reducing declaratory judgments to mere advisory opinions.  <em>Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/118/case.html">314 U. S. 118</a></span> (1941), once expressed the view that 28 U.S.C.  2283 forbade injunctions against relitigation in state courts of federally decided issues, but the section was then amended to overrule that case, the consequence being that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is clear that the <em>Toucey</em> rule </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 415 U. S. 478</a></p><p> is gone, and that, to protect or effectuate its judgment, a federal court may enjoin relitigation in the state court."</p>\n<p>C. Wright, Federal Courts 180 (2d ed.1970).  I see no more reason here to hold that the federal plaintiff must always rely solely on his plea of <em>res judicata</em> in the state courts.  The statute provides for "[f]urther necessary or proper relief . . . against any adverse party whose rights have been determined by such judgment," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2202, and it would not seem improper to enjoin local prosecutors who refuse to observe adverse federal judgments.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would think that a federal suit challenging a state criminal statute on federal constitutional grounds could be sufficiently far along so that ordinary consideration of economy would warrant refusal to dismiss the federal case solely because a state prosecution has subsequently been filed and the federal question may be litigated there.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the opinion of the Court.  Although my reading of the legislative history of the Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934 suggests that its primary purpose was to enable persons to obtain a definition of their rights before an actual injury had occurred, rather than to palliate any controversy arising from <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a></span> (1908).  Congress apparently was aware at the time it passed the Act that persons threatened with state criminal prosecutions might choose to forgo the offending conduct and, instead, seek a federal declaration of their rights.  Use of the declaratory judgment procedure in the circumstances presented by this case seems consistent with that congressional expectation.</p>\n<p>If this case were the Court\'s first opportunity to deal with this area of law, I would be content to let the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 415 U. S. 479</a></p><p> matter rest there.  But, as our cases abundantly illustrate, this area of law is in constant litigation, and it is an area through which our decisions have traced a path that may accurately be described as sinuous.  Attempting to accommodate the principles of the new declaratory judgment procedure with other more established principles -- in particular a proper regard for the relationship between the independent state and federal judiciary systems -- this Court has acted both to advance and to limit the Act.  <em>Compare Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html">300 U. S. 227</a></span> (1937), and <em>Zwickler v. Koota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html">389 U. S. 241</a></span> (1967), <em>with Great Lakes Co. v. Huffman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/293/case.html">319 U. S. 293</a></span> (1943), and <em>Samuels v. Mackell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html">401 U. S. 66</a></span> (1971).  Because the opinion today may possibly be read by resourceful counsel as commencing a new and less restrictive curve in this path of adjudication, I feel it is important to emphasize what the opinion does and does not say.</p>\n<p>To begin with, it seems appropriate to restate the obvious:  the Court\'s decision today deals only with declaratory relief and with threatened prosecutions.  The case provides no authority for the granting of any injunctive relief nor does it provide authority for the granting of any relief at all when prosecutions are pending.  The Court quite properly leaves for another day whether the granting of a declaratory judgment by a federal court will have any subsequent <em>res judicata</em> effect or will perhaps support the issuance of a later federal injunction.  But since possible resolutions of those issues would substantially undercut the principles of federalism reaffirmed in <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971), and preserved by the decision today, I feel it appropriate to add a few remarks.</p>\n<p>First, the legislative history of the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Court\'s opinion in this case both </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 415 U. S. 480</a></p><p> recognize that the declaratory judgment procedure is an alternative to pursuit of the arguably illegal activity. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  There is nothing in the Act\'s history to suggest that Congress intended to provide persons wishing to violate state laws with a federal shield behind which they could carry on their contemplated conduct.  Thus, I do not believe that a federal plaintiff in a declaratory judgment action can avoid, by the mere filing of a complaint, the principles so firmly expressed in <em>Samuels, supra.</em>  The plaintiff who continues to violate a state statute after the filing of his federal complaint does so both at the risk of state prosecution and at the risk of dismissal of his federal lawsuit.  For any arrest prior to resolution of the federal action would constitute a pending prosecution and bar declaratory relief under the principles of <em>Samuels.</em></p>\n<p>Second, I do not believe that today\'s decision can properly be raised to support the issuance of a federal injunction based upon a favorable declaratory judgment. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 415 U. S. 481</a></p><p> The Court\'s.description of declaratory relief as "<em>a milder alternative to the injunction remedy,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/case.html#467">415 U. S. 467</a></span>, having a "less intrusive effect on the administration of state criminal laws" than an injunction, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/case.html#469">415 U. S. 469</a></span>, indicates to me critical distinctions which make declaratory relief appropriate where injunctive relief would not be.  It would all but totally obscure these important distinctions if a successful application for declaratory relief came to be regarded not as the conclusion of a lawsuit, but as a giant step toward obtaining an injunction against a subsequent criminal prosecution.  The availability of injunctive relief must be considered with an eye toward the important policies of federalism which this Court has often recognized.\n</em></p>\n<p>If the rationale of cases such as <em>Younger</em> and <em>Samuels</em> turned in any way upon the relative ease with which a federal district court could reach a conclusion about the constitutionality of a challenged state statute, a preexisting judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional as applied to a particular plaintiff would, of course, be a factor favoring the issuance of an injunction as "further relief" under the Declaratory Judgment Act.  But, except for statutes that are "<em>flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph . . . ,\'" <em>Younger v. Harris, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#53">401 U. S. 53</a></span>, the rationale of those cases has no such basis.  Their direction that federal courts not interfere with state prosecutions does not vary depending on the closeness of the constitutional issue or on the degree of confidence which the federal court possesses in the correctness of its conclusions on the constitutional </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 415 U. S. 482</a></em></p><p><em> point.  Those decisions instead depend upon considerations relevant to the harmonious operation of separate federal and state court systems, with a special regard for the State\'s interest in enforcing its own criminal laws, considerations which are as relevant in guiding the action of a federal court which has previously issued a declaratory judgment as they are in guiding the action of one which has not.  While the result may be that injunctive relief is not available as "further relief" under the Declaratory Judgment Act in this particular class of cases, whereas it would be in similar cases not involving considerations of federalism, this would be no more a <em>pro tanto</em> repeal of that provision of the Declaratory Judgment Act than was <em>Younger</em> a <em>pro tanto</em> repeal of the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1651.\n</em></p>\n<p>A declaratory judgment is simply a statement of rights, not a binding order supplemented by continuing sanctions.  State authorities may choose to be guided by the judgment of a lower federal court, but they are not compelled to follow the decision by threat of contempt or other penalties.  If the federal plaintiff pursues the conduct for which he was previously threatened with arrest and is, in fact, arrested, he may not return the controversy to federal court, although he may, of course, raise the federal declaratory judgment in the state court for whatever value it may prove to have. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In any event, the defendant at that point is able to present his case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 415 U. S. 483</a></p><p> for full consideration by a state court charged, as are the federal courts, to preserve the defendant\'s constitutional rights.  Federal interference with this process would involve precisely the same concern\'s discussed in <em>Younger</em> and recited in the Court\'s opinion in this case. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, attempts to circumvent <em>Younger</em> by claiming that enforcement of a statute declared unconstitutional by a federal court is <em>per se</em> evidence of bad faith should not find support in the Court\'s decision in this case.  As the Court notes, quoting my Brother BRENNAN\'s separate opinion in <em>Perez v. Ledesma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html">401 U. S. 82</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html#125">401 U. S. 125</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"The persuasive force of the [federal] court\'s opinion and judgment <em>may</em> lead state prosecutors, courts, and legislators to reconsider their respective responsibilities toward the statute.  Enforcement policies or judicial construction <em>may</em> be changed, or the legislature <em>may</em> repeal the statute and start anew."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  This language clearly recognizes that continued belief in the constitutionality of the statute by state prosecutorial officials would not commonly be indicative of bad faith, and that such allegations, in the absence of highly unusual circumstances, would not justify a federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 415 U. S. 484</a></p><p> court\'s departure from the general principles of restraint discussed in <em>Younger.</em></p>\n<p>If the declaratory judgment remains, as I think the Declaratory Judgment Act intended, a simple declaration of rights without more, it will not be used merely as a dramatic tactical maneuver on the part of any state defendant seeking extended delays.  Nor will it force state officials to try cases time after time, first in the federal courts and then in the state courts.  I do not believe Congress desired such unnecessary results, and I do not think that today\'s decision should be read to sanction them.  Rather, the Act, and the decision, stand for the sensible proposition that both a potential state defendant, threatened with prosecution but not charged, and the State itself, confronted by a possible violation of its criminal laws, may benefit from a procedure which provides for a declaration of rights without activation of the criminal process.  If the federal court finds that the threatened prosecution would depend upon a statute it judges unconstitutional, the State may decide to forgo prosecution of similar conduct in the future, believing the judgment persuasive.  Should the state prosecutors not find the decision persuasive enough to justify forbearance, the successful federal plaintiff will at least be able to bolster his allegations of unconstitutionality in the state trial with a decision of the federal district court in the immediate locality.  The state courts may find the reasoning convincing even though the prosecutors did not.  Finally, of course, the state legislature may decide, on the basis of the federal decision, that the statute would be better amended or repealed.  All these possible avenues of relief would be reached voluntarily by the States, and would be completely consistent with the concepts of federalism discussed above.  Other more intrusive forms of relief should not be routinely available. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 415 U. S. 485</a></p><p></p>\n<p>These considerations should prove highly significant in reaching future decisions based upon the decision rendered today.  For the present it is enough to say, as the Court does, that petitioner, if he successfully establishes the existence of a continuing controversy on remand, may maintain an action for a declaratory judgment in the District Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The report accompanying the Senate version of the bill stated:</p>\n<p>"The procedure has been especially useful in avoiding the necessity, now so often present., of having to act at one\'s peril or to act on one\'s own interpretation of his rights, or abandon one\'s rights because of a fear of incurring damages.  So now it is often necessary, in the absence of the declaratory judgment procedure, to violate or purport to violate a statute in order to obtain a judicial determination of its meaning or validity. . . .  Persons now often have to act at their peril, a danger which could be frequently avoided by the ability to sue for a declaratory judgment as to their rights or duties."</p>\n<p>S.Rep.

S. 72</a></span> (1971), the Court expressed concern that a declaratory judgment issued while a state prosecution was pending "might serve as the basis for a subsequent injunction against those proceedings. . . ."  The Court recognized that this chain of litigation would "result in a clearly improper interference with the state proceedings."  <em>Ibid.</em>  As discussed <em>infra,</em> I believe that such improper interference would be present even though the declaratory judgment itself were issued prior to the time of the federal plaintiff\'s arrest.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion notes that the possible <em>res judicata</em> effect of a federal declaratory judgment in a subsequent state court prosecution is a question "<em>not free from difficulty.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/case.html#470">415 U. S. 470</a></span>.  I express no opinion on that issue here.  However, I do note that the federal decision would not be accorded the <em>stare decisis</em> effect in state court that it would have in a subsequent proceeding within the same federal jurisdiction.
