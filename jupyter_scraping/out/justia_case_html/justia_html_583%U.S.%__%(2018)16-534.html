Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort to codify the careful balance between respecting the immunity historically afforded to foreign sovereigns and holding them accountable, in certain circumstances, for their actions.  As a default, foreign states have immunity \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71604, but there are express exceptions, including the one at issue here, for state sponsors of terrorism, see \xc2\xa71605A(a).  The FSIA similarly provides as a default that \xe2\x80\x9cthe property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment arrest and execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71609.  But \xc2\xa71610 outlines certain exceptions to this immunity.  For example, \xc2\xa71610(a)(7) provides that property in the United States of a foreign state that is used for a commercial activity in the United States shall not be immune from attachment and execution where the plaintiff holds a \xc2\xa71605A judgment against the foreign state.  Before 2008, the FSIA did not expressly address under which circumstances a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s agencies or instrumentalities could be held liable for judgments against the state.  The Court had addressed that question in <i>First Nat. City Bank</i> v. <i>Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611\n (<i>Bancec</i>), and held that, as a default, agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign state are separate legal entities that cannot be held liable.  It recognized the availability of exceptions, however, and left the lower courts to determine whether an exception applied on a case-by-case basis.  The lower courts coalesced around five relevant factors (the <i>Bancec </i>factors) to assist in those determinations.  In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA, adding \xc2\xa71610(g).  Subparagraphs (A) through (E) incorporate almost verbatim the <i>Bancec </i>factors, leaving no dispute that, at a minimum, \xc2\xa71610(g) serves to abrogate <i>Bancec</i> where a \xc2\xa71605A judgment holder seeks to satisfy a judgment held against the foreign state.  The question here is whether, in addition to abrogating <i>Bancec</i>, it provides a freestanding exception to property immunity in the context of a \xc2\xa71605A judgment.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of \xc2\xa71610(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d is that it refers to \xc2\xa71610 as a whole, so that \xc2\xa71610(g)(1) will apply to property that is exempted from the grant of immunity as provided elsewhere in \xc2\xa71610.  Those \xc2\xa71610 provisions that do unambiguously revoke the immunity of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s property employ phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be immune,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71610(a)(7), and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71610(f)(1)(A).  Such textual markers are conspicuously absent from \xc2\xa71610(g).  Thus, its phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d is best read to signal only that a judgment holder seeking to take advantage of \xc2\xa71610(g)(1) must<i> </i>identify a basis under one of \xc2\xa71610\xe2\x80\x99s express immunity-abrogating provisions to attach and execute against a relevant property.  This reading provides relief to judgment holders who previously would not have been able to attach and execute against property of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state in light of <i>Bancec</i>.  It is also consistent with the basic interpretive canon to construe a statute so as to give effect to all of its provisions, see <i>Corley</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303\n, and with the historical practice of rescinding attachment and execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s commercial acts, see <i>Verlinden B. V.</i> v. <i>Central Bank of Nigeria</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480\n\xe2\x80\x93488.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 counterarguments are unpersuasive.  They assert that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d might refer to the procedures in \xc2\xa71610(f)(1), which permits \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders to attach and execute against property associated with certain prohibited financial transactions, but which was waived by the President before it could take effect.  However, it is not logical to read the phrase as indicating a congressional intent to create \xc2\xa71610(g) as an alternative to \xc2\xa71610(f)(1), particularly since Congress knows how to make clear when it is rescinding immunity.  Nor could Congress have intended \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to \xc2\xa71610(f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that the Federal Government assist in identifying assets, since that provision does not provide for attachment or execution at all.  Finally, there is no basis to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71610(g) reflects a mere drafting error.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The words \xe2\x80\x9cproperty of a foreign state,\xe2\x80\x9d which appear in the first substantive clause of \xc2\xa71610(g), are not rendered superfluous under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  Section 1610(g) serves to identify in one place all the categories of property that will be available to \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders for attachment and execution, and commands that the availability of such property will not be limited by the <i>Bancec</i> factors.  Also, without the opening clause, \xc2\xa71610(g) would abrogate the <i>Bancec</i> presumption of separateness in all cases, not just those involving terrorism judgments under \xc2\xa71605A.  Although petitioners contend that any uncertainty in \xc2\xa71610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to the legislative purpose behind its enactment\xe2\x80\x94removing obstacles to enforcing terrorism judgments\xe2\x80\x94they offer no real support for their position that \xc2\xa71610(g) was intended to divest all property of a foreign state or its agencies or instrumentalities of immunity.  <i>Bank Markazi</i> v. <i>Peterson</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa02, distinguished.

Petitioners contend that the property is stripped of its immunity by another provision of the FSIA, \xc2\xa71610(g), which they maintain provides a blanket exception to the immunity typically afforded to the property of a foreign state where the party seeking to attach and execute holds a \xc2\xa71605A judgment.</p><p>We disagree.

Petitioners are United States citizens who were either wounded in the attack or are the close relatives of those who were injured.  In an attempt to recover for their harm, petitioners sued Iran in the District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Iran was responsible for the bombing because it provided material support and training to Hamas.  At the time of that action, Iran was subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts pursuant to28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which rescinded the immunity of foreign states designated as state sponsors of terrorism with respect to claims arising out of acts of terrorism.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  830 F.\xc2\xa03d 470 (2016).  As relevant, the Seventh Circuit held that the text of \xc2\xa71610(g) demonstrates that the provision serves to identify the property of a foreign state or its agencies or instrumentalities that are subject to attachment and execution, but it does not in itself divest that property of immunity.

We agree with the conclusion of the Seventh Circuit, and therefore affirm.</p><p>B</p><p>We start with a brief review of the historical development of foreign sovereign immunity law and the statutory framework at issue here, as it provides a helpful guide to our decision.  This Court consistently has recognized that foreign sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\x9cis a matter of grace and comity on the part of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Verlinden B. V.</i> v. <i>Central Bank of Nigeria</i>,461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480,486 (1983); <i>Schooner Exchange</i> v. <i>McFaddon,</i> 7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812).  In determining whether to exercise jurisdiction over suits against foreign sovereigns, courts traditionally \xe2\x80\x9cdeferred to the decisions of the political branches .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on whether to take jurisdiction over actions against foreign sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Verlinden</i>, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 486<i>.</i></p><p>Prior to 1952, the State Department generally held the position that foreign states enjoyed absolute immunity from all actions in the United States.  See <i>ibid.</i>  But, as foreign states became more involved in commercial activity in the United States, the State Department recognized that such participation \xe2\x80\x9cmakes necessary a practice which will enable persons doing business with them to have their rights determined in the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Tate, Changed Policy Concerning the Granting of Sovereign Immunity to Foreign Governments, 26 Dept. State Bull. 984, 985 (1952).  The Department began to follow the \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive\xe2\x80\x9d theory of foreign sovereign immunity in advising courts whether they should take jurisdiction in any given case.  Immunity typically was afforded in cases involving a foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s public acts, but not in \xe2\x80\x9ccases arising out of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s strictly commercial acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Verlinden</i>,<i> </i>461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487.</p><p>In 1976, Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort to codify this careful balance between respecting the immunity historically afforded to foreign sovereigns and holding them accountable, in certain circumstances, for their actions.90Stat.2891, as amended,28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cFor the most part, the Act\xe2\x80\x9d tracks \xe2\x80\x9cthe restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Verlinden</i>,<i> </i>461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 488.  As a default, foreign states enjoy immunity \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71604.  But this immunity is subject to certain express exceptions.  For example, in line with the restrictive theory, a foreign sovereign will be stripped of jurisdictional immunity when a claim is based upon commercial activity it carried out in the United States.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).  The FSIA also provides that a foreign state will be subject to suit when it is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and damages are sought as a result of acts of terrorism.  See \xc2\xa71605A(a).</p><p>With respect to the immunity of property, the FSIA similarly provides as a default that \xe2\x80\x9cthe property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment arrest and execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71609.  But, again, there are exceptions, and \xc2\xa71610 outlines the circumstances under which property will not be immune.  See \xc2\xa71610. <i> </i>For example, subsection (a) expressly provides that property \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be immune\xe2\x80\x9d from attachment and execution where, <i>inter alia,</i> it is \xe2\x80\x9cused for a commercial activity in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment relates to a claim for which the foreign state is not immune under section 1605A or section 1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect on January 27, 2008), regardless of whether the property is or was involved with the act upon which the claim is based.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71610(a)(7).</p><p>Prior to 2008, the FSIA did not address expressly under what circumstances, if any, the agencies or instrumentalities of a foreign state could be held liable for judgments against the state.  Faced with that question in <i>First Nat. City Bank</i> v. <i>Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba</i>,462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611 (1983) (<i>Bancec</i>), this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 626\xe2\x80\x93627.  Thus, as a default, those agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign state were to be considered separate legal entities that cannot be held liable for acts of the foreign state.  See <i>id.,</i> at 628.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Court recognized that such a stringent rule should not be without exceptions.  The Court suggested that liability would be warranted, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere  a corporate entity is so extensively controlled by [the state] that a relationship of principal and agent is created,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 629, or where recognizing the state and its  agency or instrumentality as distinct entities \xe2\x80\x9cwould work fraud or injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  See <i>id.,</i> at 630.  But the Court declined to develop a \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical formula for determining\xe2\x80\x9d when these exceptions should apply, <i>id.,</i> at 633, leaving lower courts with the task of assessing the availability of exceptions on a case-by-case basis.  Over time, the Courts of Appeals coalesced around the following five factors (referred to as the <i>Bancec </i>factors) to aid in this analysis:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(1) the level of economic control by the government;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(2) whether the entity\xe2\x80\x99s profits go to the government;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(3) the degree to which government officials manage the entity or otherwise have a hand in its daily  affairs;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(4) whether the government is the real beneficiary of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; and</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(5) whether adherence to separate identities would entitle the foreign state to benefits in United States courts while avoiding its obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Walter Fuller Aircraft Sales, Inc.</i> v. <i>Republic of Philippines</i>, 965 F.\xc2\xa02d 1375, 1380, n. 7 (CA5 1992); see also <i>Flatow </i>v. <i>Islamic Republic of Iran</i>, 308 F.\xc2\xa03d 1065, 1071, n.\xc2\xa09 (CA9 2002).</p><p>In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA and added \xc2\xa71610(g).  See NDAA \xc2\xa71083(b)(3)(D),122Stat.341\xe2\x80\x93342.  Section 1610(g)(1) provides:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(g) Property in Certain Actions.\xe2\x80\x94</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(1) In general.

The issue at hand is whether \xc2\xa71610(g) does something more; whether, like the commercial activity exception in \xc2\xa71610(a)(7), it provides an independent exception to immunity so that it allows a \xc2\xa71605A judgment holder to attach and execute against <i>any</i> property of the foreign state, regardless of whether the property is deprived of immunity elsewhere in \xc2\xa71610.</p><p>II</p><p>We turn first to the text of the statute.  Section 1610(g)(1) provides that certain property will be \xe2\x80\x9csubject to attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a \xc2\xa71605A] judgment <i>as provided in this section</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The most natural reading is that \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xc2\xa71610 as a whole, so that \xc2\xa71610(g)(1) will govern the attachment and execution of property that is exempted from the grant of immunity as provided elsewhere in \xc2\xa71610.  Cf. <i>Reno</i> v. <i>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.</i>,525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471,487 (1999) (noting that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d in one subsection serves to incorporate \xe2\x80\x9cthe rest of\xe2\x80\x9d the section in which the subsection appears).</p><p>Other provisions of \xc2\xa71610 unambiguously revoke the immunity of property of a foreign state, including specifically where a plaintiff holds a judgment under \xc2\xa71605A, provided certain express conditions are satisfied.  For example, subsection (a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cproperty in the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. used for a commercial activity in the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not be immune\xe2\x80\x9d from attachment and execution in seven enumerated circumstances, including when \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment relates to a claim for which the foreign state is not immune under section 1605A .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71610(a)(7).  Subsections (b), (d), and (e) similarly set out circumstances in which certain property of a foreign state \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be immune.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  And two other provisions within \xc2\xa71610 specifically allow \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders to attach and execute against property of a foreign state, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d including those provisions otherwise granting immunity, but only with respect to assets associated with certain regulated and prohibited financial transactions.  See \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0)(1)(A); Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), \xc2\xa7201(a),116Stat.2337, note following28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71610.</p><p>Section 1610(g) conspicuously lacks the textual markers, \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be immune\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d that would have shown that it serves as an independent avenue for abrogation of immunity.  In fact, its use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d signals the opposite: A judgment holder seeking to take advantage of \xc2\xa71610(g)(1) must<i> </i>identify a basis under one of \xc2\xa71610\xe2\x80\x99s express immunity-abrogating provisions to attach and execute against a relevant property.</p><p>Reading \xc2\xa71610(g) in this way still provides relief to judgment holders who previously would not have been able to attach and execute against property of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Bancec</i>.  Suppose, for instance, that plaintiffs obtain a \xc2\xa71605A judgment against a foreign state and seek to collect against the assets located in the United States of a state-owned telecommunications company.  Cf. <i>Alejandre </i>v. <i>Telefonica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc.</i>, 183 F.\xc2\xa03d 1277 (CA11 1999).  Prior to the enactment of \xc2\xa71610(g), the plaintiffs would have had to establish that the <i>Bancec </i>factors favor holding the agency or instrumentality liable for the foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct.  With \xc2\xa71610(g), however, the plaintiffs could attach and execute against the property of the state-owned entity regardless of the <i>Bancec </i>factors, so long as the plaintiffs can establish that the property is otherwise not immune (<i>e.g.,</i> pursuant to \xc2\xa71610(a)(7) because it is used in commercial activity in the United States).</p><p>Moreover, our reading of \xc2\xa71610(g)(1) is consistent \xe2\x80\x9cwith one of the most basic interpretive canons, that [a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Corley</i> v. <i>United States</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303,314 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 1610 expressly references \xc2\xa71605A judgments in its immunity-abrogating provisions, such as 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f\xc2\xa0)(1), and \xc2\xa7201 of the TRIA, showing that those provisions extend to \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders\xe2\x80\x99 ability to attach and execute against property.  If the Court were to conclude that \xc2\xa71610(g) establishes a basis for the withdrawal of property immunity any time a plaintiff holds a judgment under \xc2\xa71605A, each of those provisions would be rendered superfluous because a judgment holder could always turn to \xc2\xa71610(g), regardless of whether the conditions of any other provision were met.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71610(g) is also consistent with the historical practice of rescinding attachment and execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s commercial acts.  See <i>Verlinden</i>,<i> </i>461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487\xe2\x80\x93488.  Indeed, the FSIA expressly provides in its findings and declaration of purpose that</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder international law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71602.</p><p>This focus of the FSIA is reflected within \xc2\xa71610, as subsections (a), (b), and (d) all outline exceptions to immunity of property when that property is used for commercial activity.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71610(g) means that individuals with \xc2\xa71605A judgments against a foreign state must primarily invoke other provisions revoking the grant of immunity for property related to commercial activity, including \xc2\xa71610(a)(7), unless the property is expressly carved out in an exception that applies \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0)(1)(A); \xc2\xa7201(a) of the TRIA.  That result is consistent with the history and structure of the FSIA.</p><p>Throughout the FSIA, special avenues of relief to victims of terrorism exist, even absent a nexus to commercial activity.  Where the FSIA goes so far as to divest a foreign state or property of immunity in relation to terrorism-related judgments, however, it does so expressly.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71605A, 1610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f\xc2\xa0)(1)(A); \xc2\xa7201(a) of the TRIA.  Out of respect for the delicate balance that Congress struck in enacting the FSIA, we decline to read into the statute a blanket abrogation of attachment and execution immunity for \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders absent a clearer indication of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.</p><p>III</p><p>A</p><p>Petitioners resist that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xc2\xa71610 as a whole and contend that Congress more likely was referencing a specific provision within \xc2\xa71610 or a section in the NDAA.  That explanation is unpersuasive.</p><p>Petitioners first assert that \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d might refer to procedures contained in \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0).  Section 1610(f\xc2\xa0) permits \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders to attach and execute against property associated with certain regulated and prohibited financial transactions, \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0)(1), and it provides that the United States Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury will make every effort to assist in \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying, locating, and executing against the property of [a] foreign state or any agency or instrumentality of such state,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0)(2).  Petitioners point out that paragraph (1) of subsection (f\xc2\xa0) has never come into effect because it was immediately waived by the President after it was enacted, pursuant to \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0)(3).[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  So, the argument goes, it would make sense that Congress created \xc2\xa71610(g) as an alternative mechanism to achieve a similar result.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]</p><p>This is a strained and unnatural reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  In enacting \xc2\xa7201(a) of the TRIA, which, similar to28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0), permits attachment and execution against blocked assets, Congress signaled that it was rescinding immunity by permitting attachment and execution \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7201(a) of the TRIA.  Had Congress likewise intended \xc2\xa71610(g) to have such an effect, it knew how to say so.  Cf. <i>Bank Markazi</i> v. <i>Peterson</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (2016) (slip op., at 4, n.\xc2\xa02) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ection 1610(g) does not take precedence over \xe2\x80\x98any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x99 as the TRIA does\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>Petitioners fare no better in arguing that Congress may have intended \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to the instruction in \xc2\xa71610(f\xc2\xa0)(2) that the United States Government assist in identifying assets.  Section 1610(f\xc2\xa0)(2) does not provide for attachment or execution at all, so petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument does not account for the lack of textual indicators that exist in provisions like \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71610(a)(7) and (f\xc2\xa0)(1) that unambiguously abrogate immunity and permit attachment and execution.</p><p>Finally, petitioners assert that \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d could possibly reflect a drafting error that was intended to actually refer to \xc2\xa71083 of the NDAA, the Public Law in which \xc2\xa71610(g) was enacted.  This interpretation would require not only a stark deviation from the plain text of \xc2\xa71610(g), but also a departure from the clear text of the NDAA.  Section 1083(b)(3) of the NDAA provides that \xe2\x80\x9cSection 1610 of title 28, United States Code, is amended .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by adding at the end\xe2\x80\x9d the new subsection \xe2\x80\x9c(g).\xe2\x80\x9d122Stat.341.  The language \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d within (g), then, clearly and expressly incorporates the NDAA\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cSection 1610\xe2\x80\x9d as a whole.  There is no basis to conclude that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to change \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71610(g) was the result of a mere drafting error.</p><p>B</p><p>In an effort to show that \xc2\xa71610(g) does much more than simply abrogate the <i>Bancec </i>factors, petitioners argue that the words \xe2\x80\x9cproperty of a foreign state,\xe2\x80\x9d which appear in the first substantive clause of \xc2\xa71610(g), would otherwise be rendered superfluous because the property of a foreign state will never be subject to a <i>Bancec </i>inquiry.  By its plain text, \xc2\xa71610(g)(1) permits enforcement of a \xc2\xa71605A judgment against both the property of a foreign state and the property of the agencies or instrumentalities of that foreign state.  Because the <i>Bancec</i> factors would never have applied to the property of a foreign state, petitioners contend, those words must signal something else: that \xc2\xa71610(g) provides an independent basis for the withdrawal of immunity.</p><p>The words \xe2\x80\x9cproperty of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x9d accomplish at least two things, however, that are consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the effect of \xc2\xa71610(g).  First, \xc2\xa71610(g) serves to identify in one place all the categories of property that will be available to \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders for attachment and execution, whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cproperty of the foreign state\xe2\x80\x9d or property of its agencies or instrumentalities, and commands that the availability of such property will not be limited by the <i>Bancec </i>factors.  So long as the property is deprived of its immunity \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in [\xc2\xa71610],\xe2\x80\x9d all of the types of property identified in \xc2\xa71610(g) will be available to \xc2\xa71605A judgment holders.</p><p>Second, in the context of the entire phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cthe property of a foreign state against which a judgment is entered under section 1605A,\xe2\x80\x9d the words \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d identify the type of judgment that will invoke application of \xc2\xa71610(g); specifically, a judgment held against a foreign state and entered under \xc2\xa71605A.  Without this opening phrase, \xc2\xa71610(g) would abrogate the <i>Bancec</i> presumption of separateness in all cases, not just those involving terrorism judgments under \xc2\xa71605A.  The words, \xe2\x80\x9cproperty of a foreign state,\xe2\x80\x9d thus, are not rendered superfluous under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading because they do not merely identify a category of property that is subject to \xc2\xa71610(g) but also help inform when \xc2\xa71610(g) will apply in the first place.  Indeed, \xc2\xa71610(g) would make no sense if those words were removed.</p><p>C</p><p>All else aside, petitioners contend that any uncertainty in \xc2\xa71610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to the legislative purpose behind its enactment.  Petitioners posit that Congress enacted \xc2\xa71610(g) \xe2\x80\x9cwith the specific purpose of removing the remaining obstacles to terrorism judgment enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 26.  In support of that position, they reference a brief discussion of \xc2\xa71610(g) in a footnote to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Bank Markazi</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, that notes that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[ed] the availability of assets for postjudgment execution\xe2\x80\x9d when it added \xc2\xa71610(g) by making \xe2\x80\x9cavailable for execution the property (whether or not blocked) of a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, or its agency or instrumentality, to satisfy a judgment against that state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (slip op., at 4, n.\xc2\xa02).  But <i>Bank Markazi</i>\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of \xc2\xa71610(g) simply mirrors the text of \xc2\xa71610(g) and is entirely consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today that \xc2\xa71610(g) expands the assets available for attachment and execution by abrogating this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Bancec</i> with respect to judgments held under \xc2\xa71605A.  Beyond their citation to <i>Bank Markazi</i>, petitioners have not directed us to any evidence that supports their position that \xc2\xa71610(g) was intended to divest all property of a foreign state or its agencies or instrumentalities of immunity.</p><p>IV</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis for parties holding a judgment under \xc2\xa71605A to attach and execute against the property of a foreign state, where the immunity of the property is not otherwise rescinded under a separate provision within \xc2\xa71610.
