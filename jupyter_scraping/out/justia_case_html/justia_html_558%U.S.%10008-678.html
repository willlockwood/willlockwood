Mohawk directed Carpenter to meet with the company\xe2\x80\x99s retained counsel in <em>Williams</em>, who allegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.  When he refused, Carpenter maintains in this unlawful termination suit, Mohawk fired him under false pretenses.  In granting Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with retained counsel and the company\xe2\x80\x99s termination decision, the District Court agreed with Mohawk that the requested information was protected by the attorney-client privilege, but concluded that Mohawk had implicitly waived the privilege through its disclosures in the <em>Williams </em>case.  The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mohawk\xe2\x80\x99s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding, <em>inter alia,</em> that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling did not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order under <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U.

Appellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.  Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review apart from collateral order appeal.  First, a party may ask the district court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory appeal involving \xe2\x80\x9ca controlling question of law\xe2\x80\x9d the prompt resolution of which \xe2\x80\x9cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71292(b).  Second, in extraordinary circumstances where a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.  <em>Cheney</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for D.\xc2\xa0C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/367/index.html">542 U. S. 367</a>, 380.  Another option is for a party to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that, <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cdirec[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprohibi[t] the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstrik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa037(b)(2).  Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punishment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Church of Scientology of Cal.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/9/index.html">506 U. S. 9</a>, 18, n.\xc2\xa011.  These established appellate review mechanisms not only provide assurances to clients and counsel about the security of their confidential communications; they also go a long way toward addressing Mohawk\xe2\x80\x99s concern that, absent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe hardship.  The limited benefits of applying \xe2\x80\x9cthe blunt, categorical instrument of \xc2\xa71291 collateral order appeal\xe2\x80\x9d to privilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify the likely institutional costs, <em>Digital Equipment, supra,</em> at 883, including unduly delaying the resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burdening the courts of appeals, cf. <em>Cunningham</em> v. <em>Hamilton County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/198/index.html">527 U.

S. 541</a>, 546 (1949).  In this case, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc., attempted to bring a collateral order appeal after the District Court ordered it to disclose certain confidential materials on the ground that Mohawk had waived the attorney-client privilege.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.  Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, we hold that they do not.  Postjudgment appeals, together with other review mechanisms, suffice to protect the rights of litigants and preserve the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2007, respondent Norman Carpenter, a former shift supervisor at a Mohawk manufacturing facility, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleging that Mohawk had terminated him in violation of 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71985(2) and various Georgia laws.  According to Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, his termination came after he informed a member of Mohawk\xe2\x80\x99s human resources department in an e-mail that the company was employing undocumented immigrants.  At the time, unbeknownst to Carpenter, Mohawk stood accused in a pending class-action lawsuit of conspiring to drive down the wages of its legal employees by knowingly hiring undocumented workers in violation of federal and state racketeering laws.  See <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Mohawk Indus., Inc.</em>, No. 4:04\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300003\xe2\x80\x93HLM (ND Ga., Jan. 6, 2004).  Company officials directed Carpenter to meet with the company\xe2\x80\x99s retained counsel in the <em>Williams </em>case, and counsel allegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.  When he refused, Carpenter alleges, Mohawk fired him under false pretenses.  App. 57a\xe2\x80\x9364a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After learning of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, the plaintiffs in the <em>Williams </em>case sought an evidentiary hearing to explore Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.  In its response to their motion, Mohawk described Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s accusations as \xe2\x80\x9cpure fantasy\xe2\x80\x9d and recounted the \xe2\x80\x9ctrue facts\xe2\x80\x9d of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal.  <em>Id</em>., at 208a.  According to Mohawk, Carpenter himself had \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in blatant and illegal misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d by attempting to have Mohawk hire an undocumented worker.  <em>Id</em>., at 209a.  The company \xe2\x80\x9ccommenced an immediate investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d during which retained counsel interviewed Carpenter.  <em>Id</em>., at 210a.  Because Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cefforts to cause Mohawk to circumvent federal immigration law\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cblatantly violated Mohawk policy,\xe2\x80\x9d the company terminated him.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As these events were unfolding in the <em>Williams </em>case, discovery was underway in Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Carpenter filed a motion to compel Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with retained counsel and the company\xe2\x80\x99s termination decision.  Mohawk maintained that the requested information was protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court agreed that the privilege applied to the requested information, but it granted Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel disclosure after concluding that Mohawk had implicitly waived the privilege through its representations in the <em>Williams </em>case.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.  The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory appeal under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b).  But, recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe seriousness of its [waiver] finding,\xe2\x80\x9d it stayed its ruling to allow Mohawk to explore other potential \xe2\x80\x9cavenues to appeal \xe2\x80\xa6 , such as a petition for mandamus or appealing this Order under the collateral order doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mohawk filed a notice of appeal and a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Eleventh Circuit.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291, holding that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling did not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order within the meaning of <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html"></a><a href="/us/337/541/index.html">337 U. S. 541</a>.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnder <em>Cohen</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9can order is appealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 F.\xc2\xa03d 1048, 1052 (2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  According to the court, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s waiver ruling satisfied the first two of these requirements but not the third, because \xe2\x80\x9ca discovery order that implicates the attorney-client privilege\xe2\x80\x9d can be adequately reviewed \xe2\x80\x9con appeal from a final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court of Appeals also rejected Mohawk\xe2\x80\x99s mandamus petition, finding no \xe2\x80\x9cclear usurpation of power or abuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d by the District Court.  <em>Id</em>., at 1055.

A \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d is typically one \xe2\x80\x9cby which a district court disassociates itself from a case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swint</em> v. <em>Chambers County Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/35/index.html">514 U.

As we held in <em>Cohen</em>, the statute encompasses not only judgments that \xe2\x80\x9cterminate an action,\xe2\x80\x9d but also a \xe2\x80\x9csmall class\xe2\x80\x9d of collateral rulings that, although they do not end the litigation, are appropriately deemed \xe2\x80\x9cfinal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 545\xe2\x80\x93546.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat small category includes only decisions that are conclusive, that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swint</em>, 514 U. S., at 42.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In applying <em>Cohen</em>\xe2\x80\x99s collateral order doctrine, we have stressed that it must \xe2\x80\x9cnever be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Digital Equipment Corp.</em> v. <em>Desktop Direct, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/863/index.html">511 U.

Permitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals, we have recognized, undermines \xe2\x80\x9cefficient judicial administration\xe2\x80\x9d and encroaches upon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial role\xe2\x80\x9d in managing ongoing litigation.  <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Risjord</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/368/index.html">449 U.

The second condition insists upon \xe2\x80\x9c<em>important</em> questions separate from the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swint</em>, 514 U. S., at 42 (emphasis added).  More significantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe third <em>Cohen </em>question, whether a right is \xe2\x80\x98adequately vindicable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98effectively reviewable,\xe2\x80\x99 simply cannot be answered without a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Digital Equipment</em>, 511 U.

Brief for Petitioner 23.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney-client privilege, which \xe2\x80\x9cis one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swidler &amp; Berlin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/399/index.html">524 U. S. 399</a>, 403 (1998).  By assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make \xe2\x80\x9cfull and frank\xe2\x80\x9d disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.  <em>Upjohn Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/383/index.html">449 U. S. 383</a>, 389 (1981).  This, in turn, serves \xe2\x80\x9cbroader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The crucial question, however, is not whether an interest is important in the abstract; it is whether deferring review until final judgment so imperils the interest as to justify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of the entire class of relevant orders.  We routinely require litigants to wait until after final judgment to vindicate valuable rights, including rights central to our adversarial system.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Richardson-Merrell</em>, 472 U. S., at 426 (holding an order disqualifying counsel in a civil case did not qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine); <em>Flanagan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/259/index.html">465 U. S. 259</a>, 260 (1984) (reaching the same result in a criminal case, notwithstanding the Sixth Amendment rights at stake).  In <em>Digital Equipment</em>, we rejected an assertion that collateral order review was necessary to promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe public policy favoring voluntary resolution of disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 881.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt defies common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cto maintain that parties\xe2\x80\x99 readiness to settle will be significantly dampened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a rule that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to let allegedly barred litigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of right only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reach a similar conclusion here.  In our estimation, postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.  Appellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dismissing such relief as inadequate, Mohawk emphasizes that the attorney-client privilege does not merely \xe2\x80\x9cprohibi[t] use of protected information at trial\xe2\x80\x9d; it provides a \xe2\x80\x9cright not to disclose the privileged information in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 25.  Mohawk is undoubtedly correct that an order to disclose privileged information intrudes on the confidentiality of attorney-client communications.  But deferring review until final judgment does not meaningfully reduce the <em>ex ante </em>incentives for full and frank consultations between clients and counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One reason for the lack of a discernible chill is that, in deciding how freely to speak, clients and counsel are unlikely to focus on the remote prospect of an erroneous disclosure order, let alone on the timing of a possible appeal.  Whether or not immediate collateral order appeals are available, clients and counsel must account for the possibility that they will later be required by law to disclose their communications for a variety of reasons\xe2\x80\x94for example, because they misjudged the scope of the privilege, because they waived the privilege, or because their communications fell within the privilege\xe2\x80\x99s crime-fraud exception.  Most district court rulings on these matters involve the routine application of settled legal principles.  They are unlikely to be reversed on appeal, particularly when they rest on factual determinations for which appellate deference is the norm.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Richardson-Merrell</em>, 472 U. S., at 434 (\xe2\x80\x9cMost pretrial orders of district judges are ultimately affirmed by appellate courts.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Reise</em> v. <em>Board of Regents</em>, 957 F. 2d 293, 295 (CA7 1992) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9calmost all interlocutory appeals from discovery orders would end in affirmance\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court possesses discretion, and review is deferential\xe2\x80\x9d).  The breadth of the privilege and the narrowness of its exceptions will thus tend to exert a much greater influence on the conduct of clients and counsel than the small risk that the law will be misapplied.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, were attorneys and clients to reflect upon their appellate options, they would find that litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling have several potential avenues of review apart from collateral order appeal.  First, a party may ask the district court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b).  The preconditions for \xc2\xa71292(b) review\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca controlling question of law,\xe2\x80\x9d the prompt resolution of which \xe2\x80\x9cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are most likely to be satisfied when a privilege ruling involves a new legal question or is of special consequence, and district courts should not hesitate to certify an interlocutory appeal in such cases.  Second, in extraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, when a disclosure order \xe2\x80\x9camount[s] to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise works a manifest injustice\xe2\x80\x94a party may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.  <em>Cheney</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for D. C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/367/index.html">542 U. S. 367</a>, 390 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Firestone</em>, 449 U. S., at 378\xe2\x80\x93379, n.\xc2\xa013.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  While these discretionary review mechanisms do not provide relief in every case, they serve as useful \xe2\x80\x9csafety valve[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for promptly correcting serious errors.  <em>Digital Equipment</em>, 511 U. S., at 883.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions.  District courts have a range of sanctions from which to choose, including \xe2\x80\x9cdirecting that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstriking pleadings in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa037(b)(2)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii).  Such sanctions allow a party to obtain postjudgment review without having to reveal its privileged information.  Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant it, a district court may hold a noncomplying party in contempt.  The party can then appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punishment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Church of Scientology of Cal.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/9/index.html">506 U. S. 9</a>, 18, n. 11 (1992); <em>Firestone</em>, 449 U. S., at 377; <em>Cobbledick</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/323/index.html">309 U. S. 323</a>, 328 (1940); see also Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa73914.23, at 140\xe2\x80\x93155.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These established mechanisms for appellate review not only provide assurances to clients and counsel about the security of their confidential communications; they also go a long way toward addressing Mohawk\xe2\x80\x99s concern that, absent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe hardship.  Mohawk is no doubt right that an order to disclose privileged material may, in some situations, have implications beyond the case at hand.  But the same can be said about many categories of pretrial discovery orders for which collateral order appeals are unavailable.  As with these other orders, rulings adverse to the privilege vary in their significance; some may be momentous, but others are more mundane.  Section 1292(b) appeals, mandamus, and appeals from contempt citations facilitate immediate review of some of the more consequential attorney-client privilege rulings.  Moreover, protective orders are available to limit the spillover effects of disclosing sensitive information.  That a fraction of orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege may nevertheless harm individual litigants in ways that are \xe2\x80\x9conly imperfectly reparable\xe2\x80\x9d does not justify making all such orders immediately appealable as of right under \xc2\xa71291.  <em>Digital Equipment</em>, 511 U. S., at 872.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the limited benefits of applying \xe2\x80\x9cthe blunt, categorical instrument of \xc2\xa71291 collateral order appeal\xe2\x80\x9d to privilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify the likely institutional costs.  <em>Id</em>., at 883.  Permitting parties to undertake successive, piecemeal appeals of all adverse attorney-client rulings would unduly delay the resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden the Courts of Appeals.  See Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa73914.23, at 123 (\xe2\x80\x9cRoutine appeal from disputed discovery orders would disrupt the orderly progress of the litigation, swamp the courts of appeals, and substantially reduce the district court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to control the discovery process.\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Cunningham</em> v. <em>Hamilton County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/198/index.html">527 U. S. 198</a>, 209 (1999) (expressing concern that allowing immediate appeal as of right from orders fining attorneys for discovery violations would result in \xe2\x80\x9cthe very sorts of piecemeal appeals and concomitant delays that the final judgment rule was designed to prevent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Attempting to downplay such concerns, Mohawk asserts that the three Circuits in which the collateral order doctrine currently applies to adverse privilege rulings have seen only a trickle of appeals.  But this may be due to the fact that the practice in all three Circuits is relatively new and not yet widely known.  Were this Court to approve collateral order appeals in the attorney-client privilege context, many more litigants would likely choose that route.  They would also likely seek to extend such a ruling to disclosure orders implicating many other categories of sensitive information, raising an array of line-drawing difficulties.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that sufficiently effective review of adverse attorney-client privilege rulings can be had without resort to the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine, we reiterate that the class of collaterally appealable orders must remain \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow and selective in its membership.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Will</em>, 546 U. S., at 350.  This admonition has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, \xe2\x80\x9cnot expansion by court decision,\xe2\x80\x9d as the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable.  <em>Swint</em>, 514 U. S., at 48.  Specifically, Congress in 1990 amended the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72071 <em>et seq</em>., to authorize this Court to adopt rules \xe2\x80\x9cdefin[ing] when a ruling of a district court is final for the purposes of appeal under section 1291.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72072(c).  Shortly thereafter, and along similar lines, Congress empowered this Court to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe rules, in accordance with [\xc2\xa72072], to provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for under [\xc2\xa71292].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71292(e).  These provisions, we have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cwarran[t] the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s full respect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swint</em>, 514 U. S., at 48; see also <em>Cunningham</em>, 527 U. S., at 210.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the rulemaking process has important virtues.  It draws on the collective experience of bench and bar, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72073, and it facilitates the adoption of measured, practical solutions.  We expect that the combination of standard postjudgment appeals, \xc2\xa71292(b) appeals, mandamus, and contempt appeals will continue to provide adequate protection to litigants ordered to disclose materials purportedly subject to the attorney-client privilege.   Any further avenue for immediate appeal of such rulings should be furnished, if at all, through rulemaking, with the opportunity for full airing it provides.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we conclude that the collateral order doctrine does not extend to disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege.

It is for that reason that I do not join the remainder of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The scope of federal appellate jurisdiction is a matter the Constitution expressly commits to Congress, see Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 9, and that Congress has addressed not only in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71291 and 1292, but also in the Rules Enabling Act amendments to which the Court refers.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72072\xe2\x80\x932074).  The Court recognizes that these amendments \xe2\x80\x9cdesignat[e] rulemaking, \xe2\x80\x98not expansion by court decision,\xe2\x80\x99 as the preferred means of determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (quoting <em>Swint</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 48).  Because that designation is entitled to our full respect, and because the privilege order here is not on all fours with orders we previously have held to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine, see <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U. S. 541</a> (1949), I would affirm the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on the ground that any \xe2\x80\x9cavenue for immediate appeal\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the three avenues addressed in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion must be left to the \xe2\x80\x9crulemaking process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ant</em>e, at 13; see <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312 (discussing certification under 28 U.

In taking this path, the Court needlessly perpetuates a judicial policy that we for many years have criticized and struggled to limit.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Iqbal</em>, 556 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s choice of analysis is the more ironic because applying <em>Cohen</em> to the facts of this case requires the Court to reach conclusions on, and thus potentially prejudice, the very matters it says would benefit from \xe2\x80\x9cthe collective experience of bench and bar\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9copportunity for full airing\xe2\x80\x9d that rulemaking provides.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFinality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure\xe2\x80\x9d that was incorporated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself has \xe2\x80\x9cdeparted from only when observance of it would practically defeat the right to any review at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cobbledick</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/323/index.html">309 U. S. 323</a>, 324\xe2\x80\x93325 (1940).  Until 1949, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the appellate jurisdiction statute reflected this principle and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Catlin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/229/index.html">324 U. S. 229</a>, 233 (1945) (holding that \xc2\xa7128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U.

See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Will</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (explaining that an interlocutory order typically will be \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d enough to justify <em>Cohen</em> review only where \xe2\x80\x9csome particular value of a high order,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9chonoring the separation of powers, preserving the efficiency of government . . . , [or] respecting a State\xe2\x80\x99s dignitary interests,\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cmarshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court determines that denying review would \xe2\x80\x9cimperil\xe2\x80\x9d that interest); <em>Digital Equipment</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 878\xe2\x80\x93879 (noting that appealability under <em>Cohen</em> turns on a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an interest \xe2\x80\x9cqualifies as \xe2\x80\x98important\xe2\x80\x99 in <em>Cohen</em>\xe2\x80\x99s sense\xe2\x80\x9d if it is \xe2\x80\x9cweightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we recognized last Term, however, our attempts to contain the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine have not all been successful or persuasive.  See <em>Ashcroft</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a general matter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the criteria set out in <em>Cohen</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  In my view, this case presents an opportunity to improve our approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The privilege interest at issue here is undoubtedly important, both in its own right and when compared to some of the interests (<em>e.g</em>., in bond and notice-cost rulings) we have held to be appealable under <em>Cohen</em>.  Accordingly, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Cohen</em> analysis does not rest on the privilege order\xe2\x80\x99s relative unimportance, but instead on its effective reviewability after final judgment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9312.  Although I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion, I see two difficulties with this approach.  First, the Court emphasizes that the alternative avenues of review it discusses (which did not prove adequate in this case) would be adequate where the privilege ruling at issue is \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly injurious or novel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  If that is right, and it seems to me that it is, then the opinion raises the question why such avenues were not also adequate to address the orders whose unusual importance or particularly injurious nature we have held <em>justified </em>immediate appeal under <em>Cohen</em>.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Sell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 177.  Second, the facts of this particular case seem in several respects to undercut the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the benefits of collateral order review \xe2\x80\x9ccannot justify the likely institutional costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.*<footcall num="*">  The Court responds that these case-specific arguments miss the point because the focus of the <em>Cohen</em> analysis is whether the \xe2\x80\x9centire category\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cclass of claims\xe2\x80\x9d at issue merits appellate review under the collateral order doctrine.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is exactly right, and illustrates what increasingly has bothered me about making this kind of appealability determination via case-by-case adjudication.  The exercise forces the reviewing court to subordinate the realities of each case before it to generalized conclusions about the \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d costs and benefits of allowing an exception to the final judgment rule in an entire \xe2\x80\x9cclass of cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court concedes that Congress, which holds the constitutional reins in this area, has determined that such value judgments are better left to the \xe2\x80\x9ccollective experience of bench and bar\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9copportunity for full airing\xe2\x80\x9d that rulemaking provides.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  This determination is entitled to our full respect, in deed as well as in word.  Accordingly, I would leave the value judgments the Court makes in its opinion to the rulemaking process, and in so doing take this opportunity to limit\xe2\x80\x94effectively, predictably, and in a way we should have done long ago\xe2\x80\x94the doctrine that, with a sweep of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pen, subordinated what the appellate jurisdiction statute says to what the Court thinks is a good idea.</footcall></p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The Court concludes, for example, that in most cases final judgment review of an erroneous privilege ruling will suffice to vindicate the injured party\xe2\x80\x99s rights because the appellate court can vacate the adverse judgment and remand for a new trial in which the protected material is excluded.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  But this case appears to involve one of the (perhaps rare) situations in which final judgment review might not be sufficient because it is a case in which the challenged order already has had \xe2\x80\x9cimplications beyond the case at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, in the separate class action in <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Mohawk Indus., Inc.,</em> No. 4:04\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x930003\xe2\x80\x93HLM (ND Ga.).  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  The Court also concludes that the \xe2\x80\x9clikely institutional costs\xe2\x80\x9d of allowing collateral order review would outweigh its benefits because, <em>inter alia</em>, such review would \xe2\x80\x9cneedlessly burden the Courts of Appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But as the Court concedes, it must speculate on this point because the three Circuits that allow <em>Cohen</em> appeals of privilege rulings have not been overwhelmed.
