In 1980, Congress amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to provide trustees of multiemployer benefit plans with an effective federal remedy to collect delinquent contributions.  The question presented in this case is whether that remedy encompasses actions based on an alleged breach of the employer\'s statutory duty as well as those based on an alleged breach of contract.  We agree with the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that the remedy is limited to the collection of "promised contributions."</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Prior to 1983, respondent was a member of the Associated General Contractors of California and a party to two multiemployer collective bargaining agreements negotiated on its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 484 U. S. 542</a></p><p> behalf by that association. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The agreements included provisions requiring respondent to make monthly contributions to eight different employee benefit plans. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The collective bargaining agreements, which were executed in 1980, had an expiration date of June 15, 1983.</p>\n<p>On April 1, 1983, respondent notified both unions that it had terminated the association\'s authority to bargain on its behalf, that it would not be bound by either master agreement (or any successor agreement) after the June 15, 1983, expiration date, and that it was prepared to negotiate with the unions independently.  Respondent continued to contribute to the eight trust funds until June 15, 1983, but has made no contributions since that date.</p>\n<p>In December, 1983, the trustees of the eight plans (petitioners) [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] brought suit in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California against respondent to collect contributions for the period after June 15, 1983.  Petitioners allege that respondent\'s unilateral decision to change the terms and conditions of employment by discontinuing its contributions constituted a breach of its duty to bargain in good faith and violated \xc2\xa7 8(a)(5) of the NLRA.  61 Stat. 141, 29 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 484 U. S. 543</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(a)(5).  The complaints alleged that the federal court had jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 502(g)(2) and 515 of ERISA. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s answer to the complaint challenged the District Court\'s jurisdiction, and also denied that respondent had any statutory duty to make contributions to the funds because its negotiations with the unions had reached an "impasse." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The "impasse" issue has never been resolved </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 484 U. S. 544</a></p><p> because the District Court granted a motion for summa judgment based on two other grounds:  that \xc2\xa7 515 of ERISA does not apply to an employer\'s obligations under \xc2\xa7 8(a)(5) of the NLRA, and that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has exclusive jurisdiction over petitioners\' claims.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed.  779 F.2d 497 (CA9 1985).  It necessarily assumed that petitioner could prove that respondent\'s post-contract refusal to contribute to the funds was an unfair labor practice. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  It held, however, that the claims should be resolved by the NLRB, rather than by a federal district court.  After examining the text and the legislative history of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA), the Court concluded: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 484 U. S. 545</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"We find no persuasive evidence in either the plain words or legislative history of ERISA or the MPPAA that Congress intended section 515 to be an exception to the general rule of NLRB preemption for that narrow category of suits seeking recovery of unpaid contributions accrued during the period between contract expiration and impasse."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 505. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 479 U.S. 1083 (1987), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In its 1980 amendments to ERISA, Congress responded to two concerns that are relevant to the question presented by this case.  It was primarily concerned about the burden placed upon the remaining contributors to a multiemployer fund when one or more of them withdraw. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In response to this concern, Congress enacted an elaborate provision imposing "withdrawal liability" on such withdrawing employers. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  That liability arises when an employer ceases to have an "obligation to contribute" to the plan. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  That term is defined for the purposes of the withdrawal liability portion of the statute in language that unambiguously includes both the employer\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 484 U. S. 546</a></p><p> contractual obligations and any obligation imposed by the NLRA. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  That definition is significant, because it demonstrates that Congress was aware of the two different sources of an employer\'s duty to contribute to covered plans.</p>\n<p>Congress was also concerned about the problem that had arisen because a substantial number of employers had failed to make their "promised contributions" on a regular and timely basis. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Sections 515 and 502(g)(2) of ERISA, the provisions at issue in this case, were enacted in response to that concern.  The text of \xc2\xa7 515 plainly describes the employer\'s contractual obligation to make contributions, but omits any reference to a noncontractual obligation imposed by the NLRA.  Section 515 provides:</p>\n<p>"Every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall, to the extent not inconsistent with law, make such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 484 U. S. 547</a></p><p> contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement."</p>\n<p>94 Stat. 1295, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1145.</p>\n<p>The liability created by \xc2\xa7 515 may be enforced by the trustees of a plan by bringing an action in federal district court pursuant to \xc2\xa7 502.  The special remedy against employers who are delinquent in meeting their contractual obligations that is created by \xc2\xa7 502(g)(2) includes a mandatory award of prejudgment interest plus liquidated damages in an amount at least equal to that interest, as well as attorney\'s fees and costs. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The legislative history of these provisions explains that Congress added these strict remedies to give employers a strong incentive to honor their contractual obligations to contribute and to facilitate the collection of delinquent accounts. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 484 U. S. 548</a></p><p> That history contains no mention of the employer\'s statutory duty to make post-contract contributions while negotiations for a new contract are being conducted. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Thus, both the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 484 U. S. 549</a></p><p> text and the legislative history of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 515 and 502(g)(2) provide firm support for the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that this remedy is limited to the collection of "promised contributions," and does not confer jurisdiction on district courts to determine whether an employer\'s unilateral decision to refuse to make post-contract contributions constitutes a violation of the NLRA. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 484 U. S. 550</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners, supported by the United States as <em>Amicus Curiae,</em> advance two policy arguments for giving \xc2\xa7 515 a broad construction that would include post-contract delinquencies.  First, they argue that the reasons for giving a district </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 484 U. S. 551</a></p><p> court jurisdiction of collection actions apply to post-contract delinquencies as well as those arising during the term of the contract, and that it is unwise to leave a "gap" in the enforcement scheme.  Second, they argue that the remedies available in NLRB proceedings are inadequate.</p>\n<p>Our principal reason for rejecting these arguments is our conviction that Congress\' intent is so plain that policy arguments of this kind must be addressed to the body that has the authority to amend the legislation, rather than one whose authority is limited to interpreting it.  We nevertheless note that there are countervailing policy arguments that make it highly unlikely that the limited reach of the statute is the consequence of inadvertence, rather than deliberate choice.</p>\n<p>With respect to the asserted "gap" in the enforcement scheme, three observations are pertinent.  First, the incidence of the asserted gap is unknown.  Presumably, most employers who anticipate a continuing relationship with a union honor their obligations to preserve the <em>status quo</em> during negotiations for a new contract.  If a new contract is ultimately signed, it should define the employer\'s obligations during the period subsequent to the expiration of the preceding contract; therefore, any delinquency during that period would be covered by \xc2\xa7 515.  On the other hand, if no new contract is ever signed, there is at least a possibility that an impasse had been reached either before, or only a short time after, the expiration of the old contract.  The fact that this type of delinquency appears not even to have been called to the attention of Congress indicates that it may not be a problem of serious magnitude. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, the issues that must be decided in a dispute over an employer\'s refusal to make any post-contract contributions are more complex than those that are presented in a simple collection action.  Whereas it is entirely appropriate to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 484 U. S. 552</a></p><p> award prejudgment interest or liquidated damages as a remedy for an employer\'s failure to make the payments specified in a contract, those remedies are problematic in cases in which there is a good faith dispute over both the existence and the extent of the employer\'s liability.  The question whether and when an impasse has been reached is often a matter of judgment based on an evaluation of the parties\' bargaining history against standards that are imprecise at best. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, whether an employer\'s unilateral decision to discontinue contributions to a pension plan constitutes a violation of the statutory duty to bargain in good faith is the kind of question that is routinely resolved by the administrative agency with expertise in labor law.  There are situations in which district judges must occasionally resolve labor issues, but they surely represent the exception, rather than the rule.  In cases like this, which involve either an actual or an "arguable" violation of \xc2\xa7 8 of the NLRA, federal courts typically defer to the judgment of the NLRB.  <em>See San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U. S. 236</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html#245">359 U. S. 245</a></span> (1959). [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners may be correct in contending that the remedies available in an NLRB proceeding are less effective than an ERISA action would be.  Under ERISA, they are entitled to attorney\'s fees, prejudgment interest, and liquidated damages, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 484 U. S. 553</a></p><p> whereas the scope of relief available in an NLRB proceeding is often a matter of agency discretion.  Moreover, an unfair labor practice charge must be filed within a 6-month period, and the general counsel has discretion to refuse to issue a complaint if she is not persuaded that the charge has merit or is of sufficient importance to justify prosecution.  Finally, the employer and the union may enter into a settlement that either reduces, or even might waive, the employer\'s post-contract obligations to contribute to the pension fund.</p>\n<p>But these asserted defects in petitioners\' labor law remedy are characteristic of all unfair labor practice proceedings before the NLRB.  If the labor legislation were simply repealed, <em>in toto,</em> petitioners would have no basis whatsoever for claiming that an employer had any duty to continue making contributions to a fund after the expiration of its contractual commitment to do so.  The duty that does exist is simply a consequence of a broader labor law duty that was created to protect the collective bargaining process.  Unilateral changes in the terms and conditions of employment are prohibited, not to vindicate the interests that motivated the enactment of \xc2\xa7 515 in 1980, but rather to carry out the purposes of the NLRA.  The net effect of the labor law duties imposed on employers by that legislation provides a substantial benefit to ERISA plan trustees, but Congress has not provided them with a unique and preferred procedure for obtaining redress for an employer\'s violation of its duty to bargain with the union.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>One agreement was with the District Council of Plasterers and Cement Masons of Northern California, and the other was with the Northern California District Council of Laborers.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Those eight plans are:  The Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California; the Laborers Pension Trust Fund for Northern California; the Laborers Vacations-Holiday-Dues Trust Fund for Northern California; the Laborers Training and Retraining Trust Funds for Northern California; the Cement Masons\' Health and Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California; the Cement Masons Pension Trust Fund for Northern California; the Cement Masons Vacation-Holiday-Supplemental Dues Trust Fund for Northern California; and the Cement Masons Apprenticeship and Training Trust Fund for Northern California Fund.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The named parties are the plans, rather than the trustees, but the relevant statute refers to an action "by a fiduciary for or on behalf of a plan."  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1132(g)(2).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>"As a general rule, federal courts do not have jurisdiction over activity [that] is \'arguably subject to \xc2\xa7 7 or \xc2\xa7 8 of the [NLRA],\' and they \'must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Kaiser Steel Corp. v.

This statement does not address the issue of the source of the employer\'s obligations.  Representative Thompson, Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, explained similarly that \xc2\xa7 515 would provide "a direct, unambiguous ERISA cause of action to a plan against a delinquent employer."  <em>Id.</em> at 23039.  He added:</p>\n<p>"The public policy of this legislation to foster the preservation of the private multiemployer plan system necessitates that provision be made to discourage delinquencies and simplify delinquency collection.  <em>The bill imposes a Federal statutory duty to contribute on employers that are already obligated to make contributions to multiemployer plans.</em>  A plan sponsor that prevails in any action to collect delinquent contributions will be entitled to recover the delinquent contributions, court costs, attorney\'s fees, interest on the contributions owed and liquidated damages.  <em>The intent of this section is to promote the prompt payment of contributions and assist plans in recovering the costs incurred in connection with delinquencies.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphases added).  Petitioners add the emphases in their brief, but even the highlighted sentences do not speak to the issue of the source of an employer\'s obligations.</p>\n<p>In fact, parts of Representative Thompson\'s statement not excerpted by petitioners tend to disprove their case.  At one point, he stated that "[f]ailure of employers to make <em>promised</em> contributions in a timely fashion imposes a variety of costs on plans."  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  A bit later, he exclaimed that</p>\n<p>"[s]ound national pension policy demands that employers <em>who enter into agreements</em> providing for pension contributions not be permitted to repudiate their pension promises."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphases added).  Immediately following, he cited, "[i]n this regard," five judicial decisions, endorsing three and criticizing two.  As respondent correctly explains, all five cases "concerned extraneous matters interposed as defenses to a clear contractual obligation arising during the term of the labor agreement."

Williams, identical to that of Rep. Thompson).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners advance three unpersuasive arguments for the opposite conclusion.  First, petitioners offer an alternative reading of what they deem \xc2\xa7 515\'s "operative phrase," <em>i.e.,</em> "employer who is obligated to make contributions . . . under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement."  Petitioners suggest that this language</p>\n<p>"can be read to refer to employers whose contributions are <em>defined and measured by the terms</em> of a collective bargaining agreement, but whose obligation to contribute exists as a matter of law, independent of the contract.  So read, Section 515 would require employers to adhere to all legal duties to make contributions to collectively bargained plans."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners 14 (emphasis in original).  In other words, petitioners construe the word "under" to mean "defined and measured by," and read "obligated" to include both contractual and statutory duties.  But if Congress had meant to say this, surely it could have done so more clearly; as written, \xc2\xa7 516 plainly refers to obligations that themselves arise from either a "plan" or a "collectively bargained agreement."</p>\n<p>Petitioners next point out that ERISA \xc2\xa7 4301(b) provides that</p>\n<p>"[i]n any action under this section to compel an employer to pay withdrawal liability, any failure of the employer to make any withdrawal liability payment within the time prescribed shall be treated in the same manner as a delinquent contribution (within the meaning of section 515)."</p>\n<p>94 Stat. 1263, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1451(b).  Because of this "statutory linkage" between the remedies available for withdrawal and delinquency liability, petitioners contend,</p>\n<p>"it is appropriate and instructive in gleaning the intended scope of the Section 515 duty to examine how Congress defined the obligation to contribute for withdrawal liability purposes."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners 21.  Since withdrawal liability may arise from either a contractual or a statutory duty, <em>see</em> ERISA \xc2\xa7 4212(a), n. 11, <em>supra,</em> petitioners conclude that delinquency liability must be similarly engendered.</p>\n<p>It is easy to see that this argument is a false syllogism, for it reasons from the fact that Congress intended withdrawal and delinquency liability to have similar <em>remedies</em> to the erroneous conclusion that withdrawal and delinquency liability are themselves equivalent because both originated in contractual and statutory duties.  As we have explained in the text, though, \xc2\xa7 4212(a) actually cuts against petitioners, since it makes clear that, while withdrawal liability may arise from both contractual and statutory duties, \xc2\xa7 515 provides only for a contractual origin for delinquency liability.</p>\n<p>Finally, petitioners maintain that, if \xc2\xa7 515</p>\n<p>"were read to apply only to obligations imposed by collective bargaining agreements, the section would be entirely duplicative of Section 301 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185, which creates a federal cause of action for the breach of such contracts."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners 24.  But, as respondent points out, "this argument conveniently ignores the specific purpose of Section 515."  Brief for Respondent 22.  That is, the new \xc2\xa7 502(g)(2) remedies of mandatory prejudgment interest, liquidated damages equal at least to that interest, and attorney\'s fees and costs, plus such other relief as the court deems appropriate, are indeed "the potent new weapon previously unavailable to plans under" \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA.  Brief for Respondent 23.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Even petitioners concede that "most collection actions are brought to enforce an existing collective bargaining agreement."

In this case, for example, respondent avers that</p>\n<p>"issues exist concerning the unions\' waiver of bargaining rights and their failure to satisfy their statutory bargaining obligations under Section 8(b)(3) of the NLRA."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondent 36 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em>  It is true, as petitioners point out, that district courts may find it necessary to decide whether an impasse occurred in withdrawal liability cases in which there is a dispute over the date of withdrawal.  In such a proceeding, however, there would not normally be any claim that the employer was guilty of an unfair labor practice, or that liquidated damages were mandated because the employer misjudged the impasse date.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
