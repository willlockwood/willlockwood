With Vaden conceding that her state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by \xc2\xa727 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbitration.  The Fourth Circuit then affirmed.  The Court of Appeals recognized that, in <em>Holmes Group, Inc.</em> v. <em>Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/826/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/826/index.html">535 U.

The phrase \xe2\x80\x9csave for [the arbitration] agreement\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it \xe2\x80\x9cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9cthe controversy between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d which is most straightforwardly read to mean the \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying dispute\xe2\x80\x9d between the parties.  See <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/index.html">460 U. S. 1</a>, 25, n. 32.  Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the relevant \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d is simply and only the parties\xe2\x80\x99 discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult to square with \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s language.  If courts are to determine whether they would have jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d how can a dispute over an arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x99s existence or applicability be the controversy that counts?  The Court is unpersuaded that the \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d clause means only that the \xe2\x80\x9cantiquated and arcane\xe2\x80\x9d ouster notion no longer holds sway.  To the extent that the ancient \xe2\x80\x9couster\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitration agreements, FAA \xc2\xa72, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccenterpiece provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U. S. 614</a>, 625, directly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any other contract.  Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s approach also has curious practical consequences.  It would permit a federal court to entertain a \xc2\xa74 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not accommodate a \xc2\xa74 petitioner who <em>could</em> file a federal-question suit in, or remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so.  In contrast, the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach permits a \xc2\xa74 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating or removing a federal-question suit.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Having determined that a district court should look through a \xc2\xa74 petition, this Court considers whether the court \xe2\x80\x9cwould have [federal-question] jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9ca suit arising out of the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d between Discover and Vaden.  Because \xc2\xa74 does not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain such a court\xe2\x80\x99s assistance only if, \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement, the entire, actual \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d as they have framed it, could be litigated in federal court.  Here, the actual controversy is not amenable to federal-court adjudication.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy between the parties\xe2\x80\x9d arose from Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9calleged debt,\xe2\x80\x9d a claim that plainly did not \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law; nor did it qualify under any other head of federal-court jurisdiction.  The Fourth Circuit misapprehended <em>Holmes Group</em> when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper because Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key capable of opening a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s door.  Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s responsive counterclaims challenging the legality of Discover\xe2\x80\x99s charges are merely an aspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state court.  Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involving that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point.  The relevant question is whether the whole controversy is one over which the federal courts would have jurisdiction.  Section 4 does not give parties license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in order to obtain a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s aid in compelling arbitration.  It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case took the shape it did.  Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counterclaims.  Section 4 does not invite federal courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties\xe2\x80\x99 controversy.  Allowing parties to commandeer a federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while leaving the remainder of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 controversy pending in state court makes scant sense.  Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is totally preempted by federal law may complicate the \xc2\xa74 inquiry.  Although FAA \xc2\xa74 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration here, Discover is not left without recourse.  Because the FAA obliges both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agreements, Discover may petition Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s courts for appropriate aid in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland credit cardholders.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74, authorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, \xe2\x80\x9csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9ca suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  We consider in this opinion two questions concerning a district court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction over a \xc2\xa74 petition: Should a district court, if asked to compel arbitration pursuant to \xc2\xa74, \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the petition and grant the requested relief if the court would have federal-question jurisdiction over the underlying controversy?  And if the answer to that question is yes, may a district court exercise jurisdiction over a \xc2\xa74 petition when the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint rests on state law but an actual or potential counterclaim rests on federal law?  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The litigation giving rise to these questions began when Discover Bank\xe2\x80\x99s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland state court.  Presenting a claim arising solely under state law, Discover sought to recover past-due charges from one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.  Vaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Discover\xe2\x80\x99s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated state law.  Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \xc2\xa74 petition in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to compel arbitration of Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims.  The District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over its petition, Discover maintained, because Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by federal banking law.  The District Court agreed and ordered arbitration.  Reasoning that a federal court has jurisdiction over a \xc2\xa74 petition if the parties\xe2\x80\x99 underlying dispute presents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit eventually affirmed.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part.  A federal court may \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa74 petition and order arbitration if, \xe2\x80\x9csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d the court would have jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9cthe [substantive] controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals misidentified the dimensions of \xe2\x80\x9cthe controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Focusing on only a slice of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 entire controversy, the court seized on Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims, held them completely preempted, and on that basis affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order compelling arbitration.  Lost from sight was the triggering plea\xe2\x80\x94Discover\xe2\x80\x99s claim for the balance due on Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s account.  Given that entirely state-based plea and the established rule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy between the parties\xe2\x80\x9d does not qualify for federal-court adjudication.  Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case originated as a garden-variety, state-law-based contract action: Discover sued its cardholder, Vaden, in a Maryland state court to recover arrearages amounting to $10,610.74, plus interest and counsel fees.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s answer asserted usury as an affirmative defense.  Vaden also filed several counterclaims, styled as class actions.  Like Discover\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings invoked only state law: Vaden asserted that Discover\xe2\x80\x99s demands for finance charges, interest, and late fees violated Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s credit laws.  See Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x93506, 12\xe2\x80\x93506.2 (Lexis 2005).  Neither party invoked\xe2\x80\x94by notice to the other or petition to the state court\xe2\x80\x94the clause in the credit card agreement providing for arbitration of \xe2\x80\x9cany claim or dispute between [Discover and Vaden],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 44 (capitalization and bold typeface omitted).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faced with Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims, Discover sought federal-court aid.  It petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Maryland for an order, pursuant to \xc2\xa74 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74, compelling arbitration of Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Although those counterclaims were framed under state law, Discover urged that they were governed entirely by federal law, specifically, \xc2\xa727(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71831d(a).  Section 27(a) prescribes the interest rates state-chartered, federally insured banks like Discover can charge, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted.\xe2\x80\x9d  This provision, Discover maintained, was completely preemptive, <em>i.e.</em>, it superseded otherwise applicable Maryland law, and placed Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims under the exclusive governance of the FDIA.  On that basis, Discover asserted, the District Court had authority to entertain the \xc2\xa74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted Discover\xe2\x80\x99s petition, ordered arbitration, and stayed Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution of her counterclaims in state court pending the outcome of arbitration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a\xe2\x80\x9390a.  On Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit inquired whether the District Court had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa74 petition.  To make that determination, the Court of Appeals instructed, the District Court should \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the \xc2\xa74 petition to the substantive controversy between the parties.  396 F.\xc2\xa03d 366, 369, 373 (2005).  The appellate court then remanded the case for an express determination whether that controversy presented \xe2\x80\x9ca properly invoked federal question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 373. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, Vaden \xe2\x80\x9cconcede[d] that the FDIA completely preempts any state claims against a federally insured bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 632, 636 (Md. 2006).    Accepting this concession, the District Court expressly held that it had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa74 petition and again ordered arbitration.  <em>Id.</em>, at 634\xe2\x80\x93636, 639.  In this second round, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, dividing 2 to 1.  489 F.\xc2\xa03d 594 (2007).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9ca party may not create jurisdiction by concession,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 604, n.\xc2\xa010, the Fourth Circuit majority conducted its own analysis of FDIA \xc2\xa727(a), ultimately concluding that the provision completely preempted state law and therefore governed Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Holmes Group, Inc.</em> v. <em>Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/826/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/826/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/826/index.html">535 U.

Compare <em>Wisconsin</em> v. <em>Ho-Chunk Nation</em>, 463 F.\xc2\xa03d 655, 659 (CA7 2006) (in determining jurisdiction over a \xc2\xa74 petition, the court may not \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the petition and focus on the underlying dispute); <em>Smith Barney, Inc.</em> v. <em>Sarver</em>, 108 F.\xc2\xa03d 92, 94 (CA6 1997) (same); <em>Westmoreland Capital Corp.</em> v. <em>Findlay</em>, 100 F.\xc2\xa03d 263, 267\xe2\x80\x93269 (CA2 1996) (same); and <em>Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.</em> v. <em>Fitch</em>, 966 F.\xc2\xa02d 981, 986\xe2\x80\x93989 (CA5 1992) (same), with <em>Community State Bank</em> v. <em>Strong</em>, 485 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 605\xe2\x80\x93606 (court may \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d the petition and train on the underlying dispute), vacated, reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc granted, 508 F.\xc2\xa03d 576 (CA11 2007);[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and 396 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 369\xe2\x80\x93370 (case below) (same).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this case shows, if the underlying dispute is the proper focus of a \xc2\xa74 petition, a further question may arise.  The dispute brought to state court by Discover concerned Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay over $10,000 in past-due credit card charges.  In support of that complaint, Discover invoked no federal law.  When Vaden answered and counterclaimed, however, Discover asserted that federal law, specifically \xc2\xa727(a) of the FDIA, displaced the state laws on which Vaden relied.  What counts as the underlying dispute in a case so postured?  May Discover invoke \xc2\xa74, not on the basis of its own complaint, which had no federal element, but on the basis of counterclaims asserted by Vaden? To answer these questions, we first review relevant provisions of the FAA, 9 U.

See 396 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 369, 372 (case below).  Jurisdiction over what?  The text of \xc2\xa74 refers us to \xe2\x80\x9cthe controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  That phrase, the Fourth Circuit said, and we agree, is most straightforwardly read to mean the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive conflict between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 370.  See also <em>Moses H. Cone</em>, 460 U.

See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  The relevant \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d Vaden insists, is simply and only the parties\xe2\x80\x99 discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims.  She relies, quite reasonably, on the fact that a \xc2\xa74 petition to compel arbitration seeks no adjudication on the merits of the underlying controversy.  Indeed, its very purpose is to have an arbitrator, rather than a court, resolve the merits.  A \xc2\xa74 petition, Vaden observes, is essentially a plea for specific performance of an agreement to arbitrate, and it thus presents principally contractual questions: Did the parties validly agree to arbitrate?  What issues does their agreement encompass?  Has one party dishonored the agreement?  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s argument, though reasonable, is difficult to square with the statutory language.  Section 4 directs courts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  How, then, can a dispute over the existence or applicability of an arbitration agreement be the controversy that counts?  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d clause, courts espousing the view embraced by Vaden respond, means only that the \xe2\x80\x9cantiquated and arcane\xe2\x80\x9d ouster notion no longer holds sway.  <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc.</em> v. <em>Valenzuela Bock</em>, 696 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 957, 961 (SDNY 1988).  Adherents to this \xe2\x80\x9couster\xe2\x80\x9d explanation of \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s language recall that courts traditionally viewed arbitration clauses as unworthy attempts to \xe2\x80\x9coust\xe2\x80\x9d them of jurisdiction; accordingly, to guard against encroachment on their domain, they refused to order specific enforcement of agreements to arbitrate.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1\xe2\x80\x932 (1924) (discussed in <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/index.html">470 U.

The \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d clause, as comprehended by proponents of the \xe2\x80\x9couster\xe2\x80\x9d explanation, was designed to ensure that courts would no longer consider themselves ousted of jurisdiction and would therefore specifically enforce arbitration agreements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Westmoreland</em>, 100 F. 3d, at 267\xe2\x80\x93268, and n. 6 (adopting the \xe2\x80\x9couster\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation advanced in <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, </em>696 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 961\xe2\x80\x93963); <em>Strong</em>, 485 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 631 (Marcus, J., specially concurring) (reading \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d clause \xe2\x80\x9cas instructing the court to \xe2\x80\x98set aside\xe2\x80\x99 not the arbitration agreement \xe2\x80\xa6 , but merely the previous judicial hostility to arbitration agreements\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded that the \xe2\x80\x9couster\xe2\x80\x9d explanation of \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d clause carries the day.  To the extent that the ancient \xe2\x80\x9couster\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitration agreements, \xc2\xa72 of the FAA, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccenterpiece provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U.

It would permit a federal court to entertain a \xc2\xa74 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitrability involves a maritime contract.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Westmoreland</em>, 100 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 268\xe2\x80\x93269; 1 MacNeil \xc2\xa79.2.3.1, pp.\xc2\xa09:12\xe2\x80\x939:13 (when a federal-question suit has been filed in or removed to federal court, the court \xe2\x80\x9cmay order arbitration under FAA \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s approach would not accommodate a \xc2\xa74 petitioner who <em>could</em> file a federal-question suit in (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not done so.  In contrast, when the parties\xe2\x80\x99 underlying dispute arises under federal law, the \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d approach permits a \xc2\xa74 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating or removing a federal-question suit\xe2\x80\x94that is, without seeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants to arbitrate rather than litigate.  See 1 <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa79.2.3.3, p.\xc2\xa09:21 (explaining that the approach Vaden advocates \xe2\x80\x9ccreates a totally artificial distinction\xe2\x80\x9d based on whether a dispute is subject to pending federal litigation).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having determined that a district court should \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa74 petition, we now consider whether the court \xe2\x80\x9cwould have [federal-question] jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9ca suit arising out of the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d between Discover and Vaden.  9 U.

Mindful of that limitation, we read \xc2\xa74 to convey that a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s assistance only if, \xe2\x80\x9csave for\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement, the entire, actual \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d as they have framed it, could be litigated in federal court.  We conclude that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 actual controversy, here precipitated by Discover\xe2\x80\x99s state-court suit for the balance due on Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s account, is not amenable to federal-court adjudication.

Discover\xe2\x80\x99s complaint in Maryland state court plainly did not \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law, nor did it qualify under any other head of federal-court jurisdiction.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3, and n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding that Discover properly invoked federal-court jurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit looked beyond Discover\xe2\x80\x99s complaint and homed in on Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s state-law-based defense and counterclaims.  Those responsive pleadings, Discover alleged, and the Fourth Circuit determined, were completely preempted by the FDIA.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  The Fourth Circuit, however, misapprehended our decision in <em>Holmes Group</em>.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a counterclaim and thus does not provide a key capable of opening a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s door.

Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s responsive counterclaims challenging the legality of Discover\xe2\x80\x99s charges are a discrete aspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state court.  Whether one might imagine a federal-question suit involving the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement over Discover\xe2\x80\x99s charges is beside the point.  The relevant question is whether the whole controversy between the parties\xe2\x80\x94not just a piece broken off from that controversy\xe2\x80\x94is one over which the federal courts would have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent would have us treat a \xc2\xa74 petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the issues to be arbitrated as the relevant controversy even when that statement does not convey the full flavor of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 entire dispute.  Artful dodges by a \xc2\xa74 petitioner should not divert us from recognizing the actual dimensions of that controversy.  The text of \xc2\xa74 instructs federal courts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ca suit arising out of <em>the </em>controversy between the parties\xe2\x80\x9d; it does not give \xc2\xa74 petitioners license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s aid in compelling arbitration.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewed contextually and straightforwardly, it is hardly \xe2\x80\x9cfortuit[ous]\xe2\x80\x9d that the controversy in this case took the shape it did.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 2.  Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counterclaims.  Perhaps events could have unfolded differently, but \xc2\xa74 does not invite federal courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties\xe2\x80\x99 controversy.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the dissent would have it, parties could commandeer a federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for arbitration while leaving the remainder of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 controversy pending in state court.  That seems a bizarre way to proceed.  In this case, Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims would be sent to arbitration while the complaint to which they are addressed\xe2\x80\x94Discover\xe2\x80\x99s state-law-grounded debt-collection action\xe2\x80\x94would remain pending in a Maryland court.  When the controversy between the parties is not one over which a federal court would have jurisdiction, it makes scant sense to allow one of the parties to enlist a federal court to disturb the state-court proceedings by carving out issues for separate resolution.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is totally preempted by federal law may complicate the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa74 inquiry.  This case is illustrative.  The dissent relates that Vaden eventually conceded that FDIA \xc2\xa727(a), not Maryland law, governs the charges and fees Discover may impose.  <em>Post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  But because the issue is jurisdictional, Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s concession is not determinative.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, and n.\xc2\xa04.  The dissent simply glides by the preemption issue, devoting no attention to it, although this Court has not yet resolved the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, \xc2\xa74 of the FAA instructs district courts asked to compel arbitration to inquire whether the court would have jurisdiction, \xe2\x80\x9csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9ca suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  We read that prescription in light of the well-pleaded complaint rule and the corollary rule that federal jurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or counterclaim.  Parties may not circumvent those rules by asking a federal court to order arbitration of the portion of a controversy that implicates federal law when the court would not have federal-question jurisdiction over the controversy as a whole.  It does not suffice to show that a federal question lurks somewhere inside the parties\xe2\x80\x99 controversy, or that a defense or counterclaim would arise under federal law.  Because the controversy between Discover and Vaden, properly perceived, is not one qualifying for federal-court adjudication, \xc2\xa74 of the FAA does not empower a federal court to order arbitration of that controversy, in whole or in part.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discover, we note, is not left without recourse.  Under the FAA, state courts as well as federal courts are obliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.  <em>Southland</em>, 465 U. S., at 12; <em>Moses H. Cone</em>, 460 U.

Section 2 of the FAA, which does bind the state courts, renders agreements to arbitrate \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable, and <em>enforceable</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  This provision \xe2\x80\x9ccarries with it duties [to credit and enforce arbitration agreements] indistinguishable from those imposed on federal courts by FAA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 MacNeil \xc2\xa710.8.1, p.\xc2\xa010:77.  Notably, Maryland, like many other States, provides a statutory remedy nearly identical to \xc2\xa74.  See Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x93207 (Lexis 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf a party to an arbitration agreement . . . refuses to arbitrate, the other party may file a petition with a court to order arbitration. . . .  If the court determines that the agreement exists, it shall order arbitration.  Otherwise it shall deny the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d).

But if a federal court would have jurisdiction over the parties\xe2\x80\x99 whole controversy, we see nothing anomalous about the court\xe2\x80\x99s ordering arbitration of a state-law claim constituting part of that controversy.

But look through to what?  The statute provides a clear and sensible answer: The court may consider the \xc2\xa74 petition if the court \xe2\x80\x9cwould have\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9cthe subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xc2\xa74 petition in this case explains that the controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether \xe2\x80\x9cDiscover Bank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 30.  Discover contends in its petition that the resolution of this dispute is controlled by federal law\xe2\x80\x94specifically \xc2\xa727(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71831d(a) (setting forth the interest rates a state-chartered, federally insured bank may charge \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted\xe2\x80\x9d).  Vaden agrees that the legality of Discover\xe2\x80\x99s charges and fees is governed by\nthe FDIA.*<footcall num="*"> A federal court therefore \xe2\x80\x9cwould have jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d Discover seeks to arbitrate.  That suit could be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority is diverted off this straightforward path by the fortuity that a complaint happens to have been filed in this case.  Instead of looking to the controversy the \xc2\xa74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the controversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>whole</em> controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d as reflected in \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties\xe2\x80\x99 state-court filings,\xe2\x80\x9d arises under federal law.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (emphasis added).  Because that litigation was commenced as a state-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes there is no \xc2\xa74 jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach is contrary to the language of \xc2\xa74, and sharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xc2\xa74 refers is the dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration.  The \xc2\xa74 petitioner must set forth the nature of that dispute\xe2\x80\x94the one he seeks to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x94in the \xc2\xa74 petition seeking an order to compel arbitration.  Section 4 requires that the petitioner be \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d by the other party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure, neglect, or refusal \xe2\x80\xa6 to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d; that language guides the district court to the specific controversy the other party is unwilling to arbitrate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is clear from the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s repeated and consistent use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d to mean the specific dispute asserted to be subject to arbitration, not to some broader, \xe2\x80\x9cfull flavor[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfull-bodied\xe2\x80\x9d notion of the disagreement between the parties.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, and n.\xc2\xa016.  In \xc2\xa72, for example, the \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d is the one \xe2\x80\x9cto [be] settle[d] by arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d and the one \xe2\x80\x9cto [be] submit[ted] to\narbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  In \xc2\xa710(a)(3), it is a ground for vacating an arbitration award that the arbitrator refused to hear evidence \xe2\x80\x9cpertinent and material to the\ncontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94obviously the \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d subject to\narbitration, or the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consider the evidence would hardly be objectionable.  In \xc2\xa711(c), an award may be modified if \xe2\x80\x9cimperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94again, necessarily the controversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore the subject of the award.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reason to suppose \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d meant the controversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the FAA, but something quite different in \xc2\xa74.  The issue is whether there is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to resolve a controversy; why would the pertinent controversy for assessing jurisdiction be anything other than the same one asserted to be subject to arbitration?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority looks instead to the controversy the state-court litigation seeks to resolve.  This produces the odd result of defining \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d more broadly than the \xc2\xa74 petition itself.  Discover\xe2\x80\x99s petition does not seek to\narbitrate its state-law debt-collection claims, but rather Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that the fees Discover has been\ncharging her (and other members of her proposed class) violate the FDIA.  See App. 30.  The majority does not appear to question that there would be federal jurisdiction over a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute.  The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however, because \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court could not entertain Discover\xe2\x80\x99s state-law debt-collection claim.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa019.  There is no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal controversy\xe2\x80\x94the FDIA dispute\xe2\x80\x94because there is no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute.  But why Discover should have to demonstrate federal jurisdiction over a state-court claim it does not seek to arbitrate is a mystery.  Cf. <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/index.html">460 U. S. 1</a>, 19\xe2\x80\x9321 (1983) (affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a \xc2\xa74 petition seeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in state-court litigation); <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/index.html">470 U. S. 213</a>, 218\xe2\x80\x93221 (1985) (when litigation involves multiple claims, only some of which are covered by an arbitration agreement, district court must compel arbitration of the covered claims if so requested).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach will allow federal jurisdiction to compel arbitration of <em>entirely </em>state-law claims.  Under that approach the \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d is not the one the \xc2\xa74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encompassing the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole controversy\xe2\x80\x9d between the parties.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  If that broader dispute involves both federal and state-law claims, and the \xe2\x80\x9coriginating\xe2\x80\x9d dispute is federal, <em>ibid.</em>, a party could seek arbitration of just the state-law claims.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view would qualify as federal, giving rise to \xc2\xa74 jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely state-law claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Take this case as an example.  If Vaden had filed her FDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a state-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one that \xe2\x80\x9ccould be litigated in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  As a result, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach would seem to permit Vaden to file a \xc2\xa74 petition to compel arbitration of the entirely state-law-based debt-collection dispute, because that dispute would be part and parcel of the \xe2\x80\x9cfull flavor[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coriginating\xe2\x80\x9d FDIA controversy.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16, 17.  Defining the controversy as the dispute the \xc2\xa74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by ensuring that the <em>actual dispute </em>subject to arbitration is federal. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this controversy \xe2\x80\x9cis not one qualifying for federal-court adjudication,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, stems from its mistaken focus on the existing litigation.  Rather than ask whether a court \xe2\x80\x9cwould have\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over the \xe2\x80\x9csubject matter\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d suit arising out of the \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority asks only whether the court <em>does </em>have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a <em>particular </em>complaint.  But \xc2\xa74 does not speak of actual jurisdiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of prospective jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9cthe subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74.  The fact that Vaden has chosen to package the FDIA controversy in counterclaims in pending state-court litigation in no way means that a district court \xe2\x80\x9cwould [not] have\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over the \xe2\x80\x9csubject matter\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ca suit\xe2\x80\x9d arising out of the FDIA controversy.  A big part of arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of formal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a court to compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in a pending case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By focusing on the sequence in which state-court litigation has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule that produces inconsistent results.  Because Discover\xe2\x80\x99s debt-collection claim was filed before Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaims, the majority treats the debt-collection dispute as the \xe2\x80\x9coriginating controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  But nothing would have prevented the same disagreements between the parties from producing a different sequence of events.  Vaden could have filed a complaint raising her FDIA claims before Discover sought to collect on any amounts Vaden owes.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9coriginating controversy\xe2\x80\x9d in that complaint would be whether Discover has charged fees illegal under federal law, in that situation Discover presumably <em>could</em> bring a \xc2\xa74 petition to compel arbitration of the FDIA dispute.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule thus makes \xc2\xa74 jurisdiction over the same controversy entirely dependent upon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has unfolded.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in \xc2\xa74 suggests such a result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority glosses over another problem inherent in its approach: In many if not most cases under \xc2\xa74, no complaint will have been filed.  See <em>Hartford Financial Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Florida Software Servs., Inc.</em>, 712 F.\xc2\xa02d 724, 728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cNormally, [\xc2\xa74] motions are brought in independent proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  What to \xe2\x80\x9clook through\xe2\x80\x9d to then?  The majority instructs courts to look to the \xe2\x80\x9cfull-bodied controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa016.  But as this case illustrates, that would lead to a different result had the state-court complaint not been filed.  Discover does not seek to arbitrate whether an outstanding debt exists; indeed, Discover\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa74 petition does not even allege any dispute on that point.  See App. 28\xe2\x80\x9341.  A district court would therefore not understand the \xc2\xa74 \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d to include the debt-collection claim in the absence of the state-court suit.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, the FDIA dispute would be treated as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d qualifying under \xc2\xa74 before the state suit and counterclaims had been filed, but not after.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The far more concrete and administrable approach would be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to the controversy the \xc2\xa74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x94as set forth in the \xc2\xa74 petition\xe2\x80\x94and assess whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a suit arising out of that controversy.  The controversy the moving party seeks to arbitrate and the other party will not would be the same controversy used to assess jurisdiction to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority objects that this would allow a court to \xe2\x80\x9chypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none.  Not so.  A district court entertaining a \xc2\xa74 petition is required to determine what \xe2\x80\x9ca suit\xe2\x80\x9d arising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy would look like.  There is no helping that, given the statute\xe2\x80\x99s subjunctive language.  But that does not mean the inquiry is the free-form one the majority posits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the contrary, a district court must look to the specific controversy\xe2\x80\x94the concrete dispute that one party has \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x94and determine whether <em>that</em> controversy would give rise to a suit under federal law.  District courts do that sort of thing often enough; the exercise is closely analogous to the jurisdictional analysis in a typical declaratory judgment action.  See <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/index.html">463 U. S. 1</a>, 19 (1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action exists when, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>if</em> the declaratory judgment defendant brought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit would necessarily present a federal question\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Looking to the specific controversy outlined in Discover\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa74 petition (whether its fees violate the FDIA), it hardly requires \xe2\x80\x9cdream[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d to conceive of a lawsuit in which Vaden would claim the FDIA has been violated and Discover would claim it has not.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor would respondents\xe2\x80\x99 approach allow a \xc2\xa74 petitioner to simply \xe2\x80\x9crecharacterize\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacture\xe2\x80\x9d a controversy to create federal jurisdiction.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  All of the\nestablished rules of federal jurisdiction are fully applicable in scrutinizing whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over a suit arising out of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 underlying controversy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, a federal question must be presented by the specific controversy the \xc2\xa74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue \xe2\x80\x9clurking in the background.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gully</em> v. <em>First Nat. Bank in Meridian</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/index.html">299 U. S. 109</a>, 117 (1936).  A district court could not compel arbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a potential federal defense that the \xc2\xa74 petitioner is not seeking to arbitrate, because the \xe2\x80\x9cclaim itself<em> </em>must present a federal question\xe2\x80\x9d to arise under federal law.  <em>Skelly Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/667/index.html">339 U. S. 667</a>, 672 (1950).  Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a dispute that, though not federal in character, could lead to the filing of a federal counterclaim, for \xe2\x80\x9ca counterclaim \xe2\x80\xa6 cannot serve as the basis for [federal] jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of the state-law dispute itself.  <em>Holmes Group, Inc.</em> v. <em>Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/826/index.html">535 U. S. 826</a>, 831 (2002). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle state-law claims into federal court through \xc2\xa74 than they can through declaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of action.  To the extent \xc2\xa74 brings some issues into federal court in a particular case that may not be brought in through other procedural mechanisms, it does so by \xe2\x80\x9cenlarg[ing] the range of remedies available in the federal courts[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 not extend[ing] their jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skelly Oil</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 671.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is why the majority\xe2\x80\x99s recital of the basic rules of federal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion is beside the point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no one disputes that they must be followed under \xc2\xa74 in\ndeciding whether a federal court \xe2\x80\x9cwould have jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the\ncontroversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  The issue is instead <em>what</em> suit should be scrutinized for compliance with those rules.  In defining \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to existing litigation, the majority artificially limits the reach of \xc2\xa74 to the particular suit filed.  The correct approach is to accord \xc2\xa74 the scope mandated by its language and look to \xe2\x80\x9ca suit,\xe2\x80\x9d arising out of the \xe2\x80\x9csubject matter\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d the \xc2\xa74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and determine whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over such a suit. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority concludes by noting that state courts are obliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  The question here, however, is one of remedy.  It is a common feature of our federal system that States often provide remedies similar to those under federal law for the same wrongs.  We do not, however, narrowly construe the federal remedies\xe2\x80\x94say federal antitrust or civil rights remedies\xe2\x80\x94because state law provides remedies in those areas as well.  Cf. <em>Monroe</em> v. <em>Pape</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/index.html">365 U. S. 167</a>, 183 (1961) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced would give relief\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discover and Vaden have agreed to arbitrate any\ndispute arising out of Vaden\xe2\x80\x99s account with Discover.

Resolution of the controversy is governed by federal law, specifically the FDIA.  There is no dispute about that.
