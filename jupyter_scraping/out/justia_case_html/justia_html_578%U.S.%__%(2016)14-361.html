When petitioner and other Baltimore officers reported to the scene of an auto accident, they persuaded the owners of damaged cars to have their vehicles towed to the repair shop, and in exchange for this service the officers received payments from the shopowners.  Petitioner was convicted of obtaining money from the shopowners under color of official right, in violation of the Hobbs Act,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951, and of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act, in violation of\n\n18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7371.  He now challenges his conspiracy conviction, contending that, as a matter of law, he cannot be convicted of conspiring with the shopowners to obtain money from them under color of official right.  We reject this argument because it is contrary to age-old principles of conspiracy law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Hernan Alexis Moreno Mejia (known as Moreno) and Edwin Javier Mejia (known as Mejia) are brothers who co-owned and operated the Majestic Auto Repair Shop (Majestic).  In 2008, Majestic was struggling to attract customers, so Moreno and Mejia made a deal with a Baltimore police officer, Jhonn Corona.  In exchange for kickbacks, Officer Corona would refer motorists whose cars were damaged in accidents to Majestic for towing and repairs.  Officer Corona then spread the word to other members of the force, and eventually as many as 60 other officers sent damaged cars to Majestic in exchange for payments of $150 to $300 per referral.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner began to participate in this scheme in 2009.  On several occasions from 2009 to 2011, he convinced accident victims to have their cars towed to Majestic.  Often, before sending a car to Majestic, petitioner called Moreno from the scene of an accident to ensure that the make and model of the car, the extent of the damage, and the car\xe2\x80\x99s insurance coverage would allow the shopowners to turn a profit on the repairs.  After directing a vehicle to Majestic, petitioner would call Moreno and request his payment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because police are often among the first to arrive at the scene of an accident, the Baltimore officers were well positioned to route damaged vehicles to Majestic.  As a result, the kickback scheme was highly successful: It substantially increased Majestic\xe2\x80\x99s volume of business and profits, and by early 2011 it provided Majestic with at least 90% of its customers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreno, Mejia, petitioner, and nine other Baltimore officers were indicted in 2011.  The shopowners and most of the other officers eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to plea deals, but petitioner did not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a superseding indictment, petitioner was charged with three counts of violating the Hobbs Act,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951, by extorting money from Moreno with his consent and under color of official right.  As all parties agree, the type of extortion for which petitioner was convicted\xe2\x80\x94obtaining property from another with his consent and under color of official right\xe2\x80\x94is the \xe2\x80\x9crough equivalent of what we would now describe as \xe2\x80\x98taking a bribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Evans</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 255,\n260 (1992)\n.  To prove this offense, the Government \xe2\x80\x9cneed only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 268.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner and another Baltimore officer, Kelvin Quade Manrich, were also charged with violating the general federal conspiracy statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371.  The indictment alleged that petitioner and Manrich conspired with Moreno, Mejia, and other Baltimore officers to bring about the same sort of substantive violations with which petitioner was charged.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before trial, petitioner began to raise a variant of the legal argument that has brought his case to this Court.  He sought a jury instruction stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n order to convict a defendant of conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy was to obtain money or property from some person who was not a member of the conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 53.  In support of this instruction, petitioner relied on the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>United</i> <i>States</i> v. <i>Brock</i>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 762 (2007), which concerned two bail bondsmen who made payments to a court clerk in exchange for the alteration of court records.  The Sixth Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o be covered by the [Hobbs Act], the alleged conspirators .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must have formed an agreement to obtain \xe2\x80\x98property from <i>another</i>,\xe2\x80\x99 which is to say, formed an agreement to obtain property from someone outside the conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 767.  The District Court did not rule on this request prior to trial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s codefendant, Manrich, pleaded guilty during the trial, and at the close of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case and again at the close of all evidence, petitioner moved for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count based on <i>Brock</i>.  The District Court denied these motions, concluding that the Fourth Circuit had already rejected <i>Brock</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Spitler</i>, 800 F.\xc2\xa02d 1267 (1986).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court also refused to give petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed instruction.  Instead, the court adopted the sort of standard instructions that are typically used in conspiracy cases.  See generally L. Sand et\xc2\xa0al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions: Criminal \xc2\xa719.01 (2015).  In order to convict petitioner of the conspiracy charge, the jury was told, the prosecution was required to prove (1)\xc2\xa0that two or more persons entered into an unlawful agreement; (2)\xc2\xa0that petitioner knowingly and willfully became a member of the conspiracy; (3)\xc2\xa0that at least one member of the conspiracy knowingly committed at least one overt act; and (4) that the overt act was committed to further an objective of the conspiracy.  The court \xe2\x80\x9ccaution[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthat mere knowledge or acquiescence, without participation in the unlawful plan, is not sufficient\xe2\x80\x9d to demonstrate membership in the conspiracy.  App. 195.  Rather, the court explained, the conspirators must have had \xe2\x80\x9ca mutual understanding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to cooperate with each other to accomplish an unlawful act,\xe2\x80\x9d and petitioner must have joined the conspiracy \xe2\x80\x9cwith the intention of aiding in the accomplishment of those unlawful ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 192, 195.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury found petitioner guilty on both the conspiracy count and the three substantive extortion counts, and the District Court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 18 months in prison on all four counts.  On appeal to the Fourth Circuit, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument was the same one he had pressed before the District Court: that his conspiracy conviction was fatally flawed because the conspirators had not agreed to obtain money from a person who was not a member of the conspiracy.  The Fourth Circuit rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument and affirmed his convictions.  750 F.\xc2\xa03d 399 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We then granted certiorari, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under longstanding principles of conspiracy law, a defendant may be convicted of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act based on proof that he entered into a conspiracy that had as its objective the obtaining of property from another conspirator with his consent and under color of official right.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In analyzing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, we begin with the text of the statute under which he was convicted, namely, the general federal conspiracy statute, which makes it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9c<i>conspire </i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to commit any offense against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371 (emphasis added).  Section 371\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cconspire\xe2\x80\x9d incorporates long-recognized principles of conspiracy law.  And under established case law, the fundamental characteristic of aconspiracy is a joint commitment to an \xe2\x80\x9cendeavor which,if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of [the underlying substantive] criminal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Salinas</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52,\n65 (1997)\n; see 2 J.

A defendant must merely reach an agreement with the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific intent that the underlying crime <i>be committed</i>\xe2\x80\x9d by some member of the conspiracy.  2 K. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, J. Grenig, &amp; W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions: Criminal \xc2\xa731:03, p. 225 (6th ed. 2008) (emphasis added); see also <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa731:02, at 220 (explaining that a defendant must \xe2\x80\x9cintend to agree and must intend that the substantive offense <i>be committed</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe government does not have to prove that the defendant intended to commit the underlying offense himself/herself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, \xc2\xa731:03, at 226.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f conspirators have a plan which calls for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support, the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Salinas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 64; see Sand, <i>supra</i>, \xc2\xa719.01, at 19\xe2\x80\x9354 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen people enter into a conspiracy to accomplish an unlawful end, each and every member becomes an agent for the other conspirators in carrying out the conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A few simple examples illustrate this important point.  Entering a dwelling is historically an element of burglary, see, <i>e.g.</i>, LaFave, <i>supra</i>, at 1069, but a person may conspire to commit burglary without agreeing to set foot inside the targeted home.  It is enough if the conspirator agrees to help the person who will actually enter the dwelling, perhaps by serving as a lookout or driving the getaway car.  Likewise, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] specific intent to distribute drugs oneself is not required to secure a conviction for participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Piper</i>, 35 F.\xc2\xa03d 611, 614 (CA1 1994).  Agreeing to store drugs at one\xe2\x80\x99s house in support of the conspiracy may be sufficient.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Not only is it unnecessary for each member of a conspiracy to agree to commit each element of the substantive offense, but also a conspirator may be convicted \xe2\x80\x9ceven though he was incapable of committing the substantive offense\xe2\x80\x9d himself.  <i>Salinas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 64; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rabinowich</i>,\n\n238 U.\xc2\xa0S. 78,\n86 (1915)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cA person may be guilty of conspiring although incapable of committing the objective offense\xe2\x80\x9d); Sand, <i>supra</i>, \xc2\xa719.01, at 19\xe2\x80\x933 (\xe2\x80\x9c[\xc2\xa0Y\xc2\xa0]ou may find the defendant guilty of conspiracy despite the fact that he himself was incapable of committing the substantive crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court applied these principles in two cases involving the Mann Act.  See Act of June 25, 1910, ch. 395,\n\n36Stat.\n825.  Section 2 of the Mann Act made it a crime to transport a woman or cause her to be transported across state lines for an immoral purpose.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Holte</i>,\n\n236 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140 (1915)\n, a federal grand jury charged a woman, Clara Holte, with conspiring with a man named Chester Laudenschleger to violate this provision.  The District Court dismissed the charge against Holte, holding that because a woman such as Holte could not be con-victed for the substantive offense of transporting herselfor causing herself to be transported across state lines, she also could not be convicted of conspiring to commit that offense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a succinct opinion by Justice Holmes, the Court rejected this argument, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cplainly a person may conspire for the commission of a crime by a third person,\xe2\x80\x9d even if \xe2\x80\x9cshe could not commit the substantive crime\xe2\x80\x9d herself.  <i>Id.</i>, at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The dissent argued that this holding effectively turned every woman who acquiesced in a covered interstate trip into a conspirator, see <i>id.</i>, at 148 (opinion of Lamar, J.), but the Court disagreed.  The Court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be a degree of co\xc3\xb6peration\xe2\x80\x9d insufficient to make a woman a conspirator, but it refused to rule out the possibility that a woman could conspire to cause herself to be transported.  <i>Id.</i>, at 144.  To illustrate this point, the Court provided the example of a woman who played an active role in planning and carrying out the trip.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court expanded on these points in <i>Gebardi</i> v.<i>United States</i>,\n\n287 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112 (1932)\n, another Mann Act conspiracy case.  A man and a woman were convicted for conspiring to transport the woman from one state to another for an immoral purpose.  <i>Id.</i>, at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  In deciding the case, the <i>Gebardi</i> Court explicitly reaffirmed the longstanding principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ncapacity of one to commit the substantive offense does not necessarily imply that he may with impunity conspire with others who are able to commit it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 120.  Moreover, the Court fully accepted <i>Holte</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a woman could be convicted of conspiring to cause herself to be transported across state lines.  See 287 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 116\xe2\x80\x93117.  But the Court held that the evidence before it was insufficient to support the conspiracy convictions because it \xe2\x80\x9cshow[ed] no more than that [the woman] went willingly upon the journeys for the purposes alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 117.  Noting that there was no evidence that the woman was \xe2\x80\x9cthe active or moving spirit in conceiving or carrying out the transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that the evidence of her \xe2\x80\x9cmere consent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cacquiescence\xe2\x80\x9d was not enough.  <i>Id</i>., at 117, 123.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Holte</i> and <i>Gebardi </i>make perfectly clear that a person may be convicted of conspiring to commit a substantive offense that he or she cannot personally commit.  They also show that when that person\xe2\x80\x99s consent or acquiescence is inherent in the underlying substantive offense, something more than bare consent or acquiescence may be needed to prove that the person was a conspirator.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">These basic principles of conspiracy law resolve this case.  In order to establish the existence of a conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act, the Government has no obligation to demonstrate that each conspirator agreed personally to commit\xe2\x80\x94or was even capable of committing\xe2\x80\x94the substantive offense of Hobbs Act extortion.  It is sufficient to prove that the conspirators agreed that the underlying crime <i>be committed</i> by a member of the conspiracy who was capable of committing it.  In other words, each conspirator must have specifically intended that <i>some conspirator </i>commit each element of the substantive offense.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is exactly what happened here: Petitioner, Moreno, and Mejia \xe2\x80\x9cshare[d] a common purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, that <i>petitioner</i> and other police officers would commit every element of the substantive extortion offense.  <i>Salinas</i>, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364.  Petitioner and other officers would obtain property \xe2\x80\x9cunder color of official right,\xe2\x80\x9d something that Moreno and Mejia were incapable of doing because they were not public officials.  And petitioner and other officers would obtain that money from \xe2\x80\x9canother,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, from Mo-reno, Mejia, or Majestic.  Although Moreno and Mejia were incapable of committing the underlying substantive offense as principals,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>] they could, under the reasoning of <i>Holte </i>and <i>Gebardi</i>, conspire to commit Hobbs Act extortion by agreeing to help petitioner and other officers commit the substantive offense.  See <i>Holte</i>, 236 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 145 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] conspiracy with an officer or employ\xc3\xa9 of the government or any other for an offence that only he could commit has been held for many years to fall within the conspiracy section . . . of the penal code\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Salinas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 63\xe2\x80\x9364; <i>Gebardi</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 120\xe2\x80\x93121; <i>Rabinowich</i>, 238 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 86.  For these reasons, it is clear that petitioner could be convicted of conspiring to obtain property from the shopowners with their consent and under color of official right.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In an effort to escape this conclusion, petitioner argues that the usual rules do not apply to the type of Hobbs Act conspiracy charged in this case.  His basic argument, as ultimately clarified,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>] is as follows.  All members of a conspiracy must share the same criminal objective.  The objective of the conspiracy charged in this case was to obtain money \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another, with his consent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under color of official right.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Moreno and Mejia did not have the objective of obtaining money \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d because the money in question was their own.  Accordingly, they were incapable of being members of the conspiracy charged in this case.  And since there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that petitioner conspired with anyone other than Moreno and Mejia, he must be acquitted.  See Reply Brief 3\xe2\x80\x9311, 17\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument fails for a very simple reason: Contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim, he and the shopowners <i>did</i> have a common criminal objective.  The objective was not that each conspirator, including Moreno and Mejia, would obtain money from \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d but rather that petitioner and other Baltimore officers would do so.  See App. 36\xe2\x80\x9337, Superseding Indictment \xc2\xb611 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a purpose of the conspiracy for Moreno and Mejia to enrich over 50 BPD [Baltimore Police Department] Officers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in exchange for the BPD Officers\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of their official positions and influence to cause vehicles to be towed or otherwise delivered to Majestic\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioner does not dispute that he was properly convicted for three substantive Hobbs Act violations based on proof that he obtained money \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another.\xe2\x80\x9d  The criminal objective on which petitioner, Moreno, and Mejia agreed was that <i>petitioner</i> <i>and other Baltimore officers</i> would commit substantive violations of this nature.  Thus, under well-established rules of conspiracy law, petitioner was properly charged with and convicted of conspiring with the shopowners.  Nothing in the text of the Hobbs Act even remotely undermines this conclusion, and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the rule of lenity[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>] and principles of federalism[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>] is unavailing.</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner argues that our interpretation makes the Hobbs Act sweep too broadly, creating a national antibribery law and displacing a carefully crafted network of state and federal statutes.  He contends that a charge of conspiring to obtain money from a conspirator with his consent and under color of official right is tantamount to a charge of soliciting or accepting a bribe and that allowing such a charge undermines\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7666 (a federal bribery statute applicable to state and local officials) and state bribery laws.  He also argues that extortion conspiracies of this sort were not known prior to the enactment of the Hobbs Act and that there is no evidence that Congress meant for that Act to plow this new ground.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The subtext of these arguments is that it seems unnatural to prosecute bribery on the basis of a statute prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cextortion,\xe2\x80\x9d but this Court held in <i>Evans</i> that Hobbs Act extortion \xe2\x80\x9cunder color of official right\xe2\x80\x9d includes the \xe2\x80\x9crough equivalent of what we would now describe as \xe2\x80\x98taking a bribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 260.  Petitioner does not ask us to overturn <i>Evans</i>, see, <i>e.g.</i>, Brief for Petitioner 1; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x935, 12\xe2\x80\x9313, and we have no occasion to do so.  Having already held that \xc2\xa71951 prohibits the \xe2\x80\x9crough equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of bribery, we have no principled basis for precluding the prosecution of conspiracies to commit that same offense.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner also exaggerates the reach of our decision.  It does not, as he claims, dissolve the distinction between extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion.  Because every act of extortion under the Hobbs Act requires property to be obtained with \xe2\x80\x9cconsent,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner argues, proof of that consent will always or nearly always establish the existence of a conspiratorial agreement and thus allow the Government to turn virtually every such extortion case into a conspiracy case.  But there are plenty of instances in which the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d required under the Hobbs Act will not be enough to constitute the sort of agreement needed under the law of conspiracy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As used in the Hobbs Act, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwith his consent\xe2\x80\x9d is designed to distinguish extortion (\xe2\x80\x9cobtaining of property from another, <i>with his consent</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(b)(2) (emphasis added)) from robbery (\xe2\x80\x9cobtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence of another, <i>against his will</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(1) (emphasis added)).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d simply signifies the taking of property under circumstances falling short of robbery, and such \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d is quite different from the <i>mens rea</i> necessary for aconspiracy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This conclusion is clear from the language of \xc2\xa71951 prohibiting the obtaining of property \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another, with his consent, <i>induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(2) (emphasisadded).  This language applies when, for example, a store owner makes periodic protection payments to gang members out of fear that they will otherwise trash the store.  While these payments are obtained with the store owner\xe2\x80\x99s grudging consent, the store owner, simply by making the demanded payments, does not enter into a conspiratorial agreement with the gang members conducting the shakedown.  See <i>Salinas</i>, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9365 (conspirators must pursue \xe2\x80\x9cthe same criminal objective\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bailey</i>,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 394,\n405 (1980)\n (conspiracy requires \xe2\x80\x9ca heightened mental state\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211,\n223 (1974)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecution must show that the offender acted with a specific intent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Just as mere acquiescence in a Mann Act violation is insufficient to create a conspiracy, see <i>Gebardi</i>, 287 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 121\xe2\x80\x93123; <i>Holte</i>, 236 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 145, the minimal \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d required to trigger \xc2\xa71951 is insufficient to form a conspiratorial agreement.  Our interpretation thus does not turn virtually every act of extortion into a conspiracy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does our reading transform every bribe of a public official into a conspiracy to commit extortion.  The \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d required to pay a bribe does not necessarily create a conspiratorial agreement.  In cases where the bribe payor is merely complying with an official demand, the payor lacks the <i>mens rea</i> necessary for a conspiracy.  See <i>Sa-linas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 63\xe2\x80\x9365; <i>Bailey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 405; <i>Anderson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 223; <i>Gebardi</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 121\xe2\x80\x93123.  For example, imagine that a health inspector demands a bribe from a restaurant owner, threatening to close down the restaurant if the owner does not pay.  If the owner reluctantly pays the bribe in order to keep the business open, the owner has \xe2\x80\x9cconsented\xe2\x80\x9d to the inspector\xe2\x80\x99s demand, butthis mere acquiescence in the demand does not form a conspiracy.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While petitioner exaggerates the impact of our decision, his argument would create serious practical problems.  The validity of a charge of Hobbs Act conspiracy would often depend on difficult property-law questions having little to do with criminal culpability.  In this case, for example, ownership of the money obtained by petitioner is far from clear.  It appears that the funds came from Majestic\xe2\x80\x99s account, App. 97\xe2\x80\x9398, 149, and there is evidence that during the period of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the conspiracy, Majestic was converted from a limited liability company to a regular business corporation, <i>id.</i>, at 145; App. in No. 12\xe2\x80\x934462 (CA4), pp. 655\xe2\x80\x93656, 736.  After that transformation, the money obtained by petitioner may have come from corporate funds.  A corporation is an entity distinct from its shareholders, and therefore, even under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the applicable law, Moreno and Mejia would have agreed that petitioner would obtain money \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another,\xe2\x80\x9d not from them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Suppose that Moreno or Mejia had made the payments by taking money from a personal bank account.  Would that dictate a different outcome?  Or suppose that Majestic was a partnership and the payments came from a com-pany account.  Would that mean that Moreno agreed that officers would obtain money \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as they would obtain Mejia\xe2\x80\x99s share of the partnership funds and that Mejia similarly agreed that officers would obtain money \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as they would obtain the share belonging to Moreno?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Or consider this example.  Suppose that the owner and manager of a nightclub reach an agreement with a public official under which the owner will bribe the official to approve the club\xe2\x80\x99s liquor license application.  Under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the public official and the club manager may be guilty of conspiring to commit extortion, because they agreed that the official would obtain property \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, the owner.  But as \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98another\xe2\x80\x99 from whom the property is obtained,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 10, the owner could not be prosecuted.  There is no apparent reason, however, why the manager but not the owner should be culpable in this situation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A defendant may be convicted of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act based on proof that he reached an agreement with the owner of the property in question to obtain that property under color of official right.

When Congress enacted the Hobbs Act in 1946, \xe2\x80\x9cthe offense was [thus] understood to involve not merely a wrongful takingby a public official, but a wrongful taking under a false pretense of official right.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 281 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the established meaning of under-color-of-official-right extortion adopted in the Hobbs Act, the Court in <i>Evans</i> erred in equating common-law extortion with taking a bribe.  <i>Id.,</i> at 283.  Bribery and extortion are different crimes.  <i>Ibid.</i>  With extortion, \xe2\x80\x9cthe public official is the sole wrongdoer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Because the official \xe2\x80\x9cacts \xe2\x80\x98under color of office,\xe2\x80\x99 the law regards the payor as an innocent victim and not an accomplice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  An official who solicits or takes a bribe, by contrast, does not do so \xe2\x80\x9cunder color of office\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xe2\x80\x9cunder [a] pretense of official entitlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  With bribery, \xe2\x80\x9cthe payor knows the recipient official is not entitled to the payment,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9che, as well as the official, may be punished for the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Relying on <i>Evans</i>\xe2\x80\x99 definition of Hobbs Act extortion, see <i>ante,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 14, the Court holds that an extortionist can conspire to commit extortion with the person whom he is extorting.  <i>Ante, </i>at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 18.  That holding is irreconcilable with a correct understanding of Hobbs Act extortion and needlessly extends <i>Evans</i>\xe2\x80\x99 error to the conspiracy context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The general federal conspiracy statute makes it a crime for \xe2\x80\x9ctwo or more persons [to] conspire . . . to commit any offense against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371.  To be guilty of conspiracy to commit under-color-of-official-right extortion, then, two or more persons must conspire to \xe2\x80\x9cobtai[n] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. property from another, with his consent, induced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under color of official right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under a correct understanding of Hobbs Act extortion, it is illogical and wrong to say that two people conspired to extort one of themselves.  As explained, in a Hobbs Act extortion case, the only perpetrator is the public official; the payor is a victim and not a participant.  See <i>Evans</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 283 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  That understanding is irreconcilable with the view that an extortionist and his payor-victim can be co-conspirators to extortion of the payor.  If a payor conspires with a public official for the payor to pay that official, then\xe2\x80\x94whatever the two can be said to have done\xe2\x80\x94they have not conspired to obtain payments to that official \xe2\x80\x9cunder .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pretense of official entitlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The extortionist and payor both know that the official is not entitled to the payments as a matter of his office.  They have not conspired to commit Hobbs Act extortion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record confirms that the scheme here did not involve extortion as the common law understood that crime.  Far from victimizing repair-shop owners Alexis Moreno and Edwin Mejia, the allegedly extortionate scheme benefited them and their repair shop.  Over time, 90% or more of the shop\xe2\x80\x99s business came from paid-for referrals from police officers.  Moreno and Mejia worked with Ocasio and other officers to maximize the shop\xe2\x80\x99s profits from the scheme.  Moreno and Mejia both pleaded guilty to Hobbs Act extortion and conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94belying any claim that they were innocent victims.  The Government itself does not maintain that the repair-shop owners paid Ocasio based on his assertion of \xe2\x80\x9ca false pretense of official right to the payment[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 282 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The Government is instead emphatic that Moreno and Mejia \xe2\x80\x9cparticipated as full partners\xe2\x80\x9d in the scheme and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. refutes any suggestion that [they] were the \xe2\x80\x98victims\xe2\x80\x99 of th[e] scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 41.  Whatever crime Ocasio may have committed, it was not a conspiracy to commit extortion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is plausible under <i>Evans</i>\xe2\x80\x99 redefinition of extortion.  But that is a reason not to extend <i>Evans</i>\xe2\x80\x99 error.  Only by blurring the distinction between bribery and extortion could <i>Evans </i>make it seem plausible that an extortionist and a victim can conspire to extort the victim.  The Court today takes another step away from the common-law understanding of extortion that the Hobbs Act adopted.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is unfortunate because it expands federal criminal liability in a way that conflicts with principles of federalism.  Even when <i>Evans</i> was decided nearly 25 years ago, the Hobbs Act had already \xe2\x80\x9cserved as the engine for a stunning expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction into a field traditionally policed by state and local laws\xe2\x80\x94acts of public corruption by state and local officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 290 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  By disregarding the distinction between extortion and bribery, <i>Evans</i> expanded the Hobbs Act to allow federal prosecutors to reach more conduct by state and local government officials.  See <i>id.,</i> at 291\xe2\x80\x93294.  That expansion was unwarranted.  Congress had not made its intent to regulate state officials \xe2\x80\x9cunmistakably clear in the language of the\xe2\x80\x9d Hobbs Act, <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452,\n460 (1991)\n (internal quotation marks omitted), so this Court had no basis for reading the Hobbs Act so expansively.  <i>Evans</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 291\xe2\x80\x93292 (Thomas, J., dissenting); see <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,\n858 (2000)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed tohave significantly changed the federal-state balance inthe prosecution of crimes\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today the Court again broadens the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s reach to enable federal prosecutors to punish for conspiracy all participants in a public-official bribery scheme.  The invasion of state sovereign functions is again substantial.  The Federal Government can now more expansively charge state and local officials.  And it can now more easily obtain pleas or convictions from these officials: Because the Government can prosecute bribe-payors with sweeping conspiracy charges, it will be easier to induce those payors to plead out and testify against state and local officials.  The Court thus further wrenches from States the presumptive control that they should have over their own officials\xe2\x80\x99 wrongdoing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As in <i>Evans</i>, the Court cites no statutory text \xe2\x80\x9cclearly\xe2\x80\x9d authorizing this intrusion into matters presumptively left to the States.  <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 858.  As in <i>Evans</i>, there is no need for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s overreach because state law already punishes the conduct at issue here.  See Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x93201 (2012) (punishing bribery of and bribery by a public official); cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Brock</i>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 762, 769 (CA6 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo one doubts that the States have criminal laws prohibiting their citizens from bribing public officials.  [We cannot think of] any reason to doubt the States\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to invoke these laws when their citizens engage in [a brazen bribery scheme]\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, as in <i>Evans</i>, the Court reaches its decision with barely a nod to the sovereignty interests that it tramples.  See <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and n.\xc2\xa09 (summarily dismissing as \xe2\x80\x9cunavailing\xe2\x80\x9d Ocasio\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinvocation of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. principles of federalism\xe2\x80\x9d).

In one of its decisions, this Court held that even though the transported \xe2\x80\x9cwoman or girl\xe2\x80\x9d was ostensibly the victim<i> </i>of the crime, nothing in the statute precluded prosecutors from also convicting the woman for conspiring with another person to transport herself illegally.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Holte</i>,\n\n236 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140,\n144 (1915)\n.  From this, the Court derives a generic principle of conspiracy law that a victim of Hobbs Act extortion can also be liable as a co-conspirator, just like the victim of a Mann Act violation can.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court stretches this Mann Act case beyond its tethers.  The Court in <i>Holte </i>based its analysis entirely on the text of the Act, not generic principles of conspiracy law.  Unlike the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9c<i>another</i> person,\xe2\x80\x9d the Mann Act prohibits transporting \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any</i> woman.\xe2\x80\x9d  Based on this language, the Court concluded that a woman could be held liable for conspiring with others to violate the Act.  <i>Holte,</i> 236 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144\xe2\x80\x9345.  For example, a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional prostitute\xe2\x80\x9d could \xe2\x80\x9csuggest and carry out a journey\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbuy the railroad tickets.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 145; see also\n\n36Stat.\n825 (Mann Act) (specifying that \xe2\x80\x9cprocuring or obtaining, any ticket or tickets\xe2\x80\x9d was assistance of a criminal sort).  Thus, the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would be <i>within the letter of the act</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , and we see no reason why the act should not be held to apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  236 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 145 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, because <i>Holte</i> based its holding on the text of the relevant substantive offense, its reasoning is consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s actual principles of conspiracy, which adopt the perspective of the conspiratorial group to determine if their agreed-upon conduct violated the text of the statute.  If the members of an alleged Mann Act conspiracy agree to transport illegally \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any</i> woman,\xe2\x80\x9d the group enterprise can logically and naturally intend to transport a female member of the group.  But that logic does not hold in this case, where the Hobbs Act requires the conspirators to agree to obtain property \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cAny,\xe2\x80\x9d unlike \xe2\x80\x9canother,\xe2\x80\x9d is not a relational word that requires determining who is in the group and who is out.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court similarly attempts to create a generic conspiracy principle when it cites <i>Gebardi</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n287 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112 (1932)\n, another Mann Act case that relies on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text.  In <i>Gebardi</i>, the Court considered the question whether a woman who merely acquiesced to being transported could be held liable for conspiring to violate the Act.  The Court held that a conspiracy could exist only if the woman aided and assisted in her own transportation\xe2\x80\x94something more than \xe2\x80\x9cmere agreement\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmere acquiescence\xe2\x80\x9d to being transported.  <i>Id.,</i> at 119, 123.  The Court based this decision explicitly on the language of the Mann Act, which \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not punish the woman for transporting herself .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  For the woman to fall within the ban of the statute she must, at the least, \xe2\x80\x98aid or assist\xe2\x80\x99 someone else in transporting or in procuring transportation for herself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 118\xe2\x80\x93119.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, the Court reasoned, the \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary implication\xe2\x80\x9d of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to include a woman who merely consents in the scope of the Act was \xe2\x80\x9cthat when the Mann Act and the conspiracy statute came to be construed together, as they necessarily would be,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress did not intend for that woman to nevertheless always be held liable as a conspirator.  <i>Id.,</i> at 123.  This Court later characterized <i>Gebardi</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>holding as an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptio[n] of a limited character\xe2\x80\x9d to ordinary conspiracy law based on the \xe2\x80\x9cdefinition of the substantive offense,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>the text of the statute.  <i>Pinkerton</i>, 328 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 643.  Whatever ordinary conspiracy principles might dictate, it was clear what Congress intended the outcome to be in that case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court tries to elicit a general principle of conspiracy law from <i>Gebardi</i>: that while the ostensible victim of the statute\xe2\x80\x94there a woman transported, here a person paying a bribe\xe2\x80\x94cannot be convicted as a co-conspirator if she merely acquiesces to the transportation or bribe, an active participant in the conspiratorial group can nevertheless be found guilty of conspiracy.  <i>Ante, </i>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  The Court draws this rough analogy in an attempt to cabin the scope of future Hobbs Act conspiracy charges to exclude potential defendants whose participation in extortion amounts to no more than \xe2\x80\x9cmere acquiescence.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this ignores the reasoning of <i>Gebardi</i>\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the express terms of the Mann Act, not any generic conspiracy principles, led the Court to exclude a woman who \xe2\x80\x9cmerely acquiesces\xe2\x80\x9d to being transported.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to the Mann Act, the Court argues that its interpretation is correct because Mejia and Moreno can be held liable for conspiring to commit extortion even though they were incapable of committing the substantive crime themselves.  (Because they are not public officials, Mejia and Moreno cannot obtain property \xe2\x80\x9cunder color of official right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x937.)  True enough.  But this principle does not lead to the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d takes the perspective of Ocasio as its reference point, as opposed to the conspiratorial group.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For example, suppose a politician and a lobbyist conspire to have the lobbyist tell his clients to pay the politician bribes in exchange for official acts.  The lobbyist cannot obtain those bribes under color of official right and so could not be charged with a substantive Hobbs Act extortion violation.  But the conspiracy would still violate the Hobbs Act, see <i>Evans</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 268, because the<i> </i>conspiratorial group obtained property \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>from the clients who are<i> </i>outside the conspiracy that exists between the lobbyist and the politician.  Now suppose the lobbyist instead agrees to pay the bribe himself.  We would be back to the question at the heart of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s incapable-of-committing-the-substantive-offense principle therefore cannot do the work the Court thinks it does.  It is entirely consistent to say obtaining property \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the Hobbs Act requires the conspirators to agree to obtain property from someone outside the conspiracy, and to say that every conspirator who enters into that agreement need not be capable of committing the substantive offense himself.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the Court raises policy concerns: It mentions that it would be odd to immunize the ostensible victims of a conspiracy to commit extortion\xe2\x80\x94here, Mejia and Moreno\xe2\x80\x94if they play just as active a role in the conspiracy as other members.  <i>Ante</i>, at 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While perhaps odd, that concern does not warrant the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contortion of conspiracy law where there are other criminal statutes\xe2\x80\x94like federal antibribery laws and state laws\xe2\x80\x94that reach similar conduct.  See, <i>e.g.,</i>\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7666 (criminalizing bribery of state, local, or tribal officials in specified circumstances); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x93201 (2012) (criminalizing bribery of public employee).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Of course, the Government could have attempted to convict Ocasio for conspiracy on these facts without relying on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s odd theory\xe2\x80\x94for example, by proving that Ocasio conspired with other Baltimore police officers to extort property from the brothers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And, in its effort to make sure Ocasio, Moreno, and Mejia get their just deserts, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s atextual interpretation of the Hobbs Act exposes innocent victims of extortion to charges that they \xe2\x80\x9cconspired\xe2\x80\x9d with their extorter whenever they agree to pay a bribe.  The Court says not to worry, it will limit the scope of a conspiracy to exclude potential defendants whose participation in the extortion amounts to no more than \xe2\x80\x9cmere acquiescence,\xe2\x80\x9d analogizing to <i>Gebardi</i>.  <i>Ante</i>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But <i>Gebardi</i> grounded its \xe2\x80\x9cmere acquiescence\xe2\x80\x9d standard in the text of the Mann Act.  See <i>supra</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Here, without any textual hook in the Hobbs Act, the Court rests on no more than intuitions drawn from basic examples.  If a restaurant owner threatened with closure by a health official reluctantly pays a bribe, the Court says that the owner is not guilty of conspiracy.  <i>Ante</i>, at 16.  According to the Court, he \xe2\x80\x9cconsented\xe2\x80\x9d to extortion, but his mere acquiescence to an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial demand\xe2\x80\x9d did not create a conspiratorial agreement.  <i>Ibid</i>.  By contrast, the Court says, if a nightclub owner pursues a liquor license by asking his manager to bribe a public official, he is clearly guilty of conspiracy.  <i>Ante</i>, at 18.  He agreed with the public official that the official would obtain property \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, from him, in exchange for a license.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These examples raise more questions than answers.  When does mere \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d tip over into conspiracy?  Does it depend on whose idea it was?  Whether the bribe was floated as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial demand\xe2\x80\x9d or a suggestion?  How happy the citizen is to pay off the public official?  How much money is involved?  Whether the citizen gained a benefit (a liquor license) or avoided a loss (closing the restaurant)?  How many times the citizen paid the bribes?  Whether he ever resisted paying or called the police?  The Court does not say.  It leaves it for federal prosecutors to answer those questions in the first instance, raising the specter of potentially charging everybody with conspiracy and seeing what sticks and who flips.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When three people agree to obtain property \xe2\x80\x9cfromanother,\xe2\x80\x9d the everyday understanding of their agreement is that they intend to obtain property from someone outsideof their conspiracy.  The Court reaches the opposite conclusion, based entirely on an assumption that the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cfrom another\xe2\x80\x9d takes as its reference point the vantage of Ocasio alone, rather than the group endeavor that constitutes conspiracy.  The Court offers no explanation\xe2\x80\x94grounded in either the text of the statute or so-called \xe2\x80\x9cage-old principles of conspiracy law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for why that assumption is correct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Conspiracy has long been criticized as vague and elastic, fitting whatever a prosecutor needs in a given case.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Krulewitch</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440\n\xe2\x80\x93457 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring).  This Court has warned that \xe2\x80\x9cwe will view with disfavor attempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Grunewald</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n353 U.\xc2\xa0S. 391,\n404 (1957)\n.  Today, in reaching an unnatural outcome predicated on an unsupported assumption, the Court says never mind.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas sets forth why he believes <i>Evans </i>was wrongly decided.  <i>Ante,</i> at 1 (dissenting opinion).
