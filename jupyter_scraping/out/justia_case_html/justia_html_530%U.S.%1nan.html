On September 5, 1991, Hen House filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. As a Chapter 11 debtorin-possession, Hen House retained possession of its assets and continued operating its business.</p><p>Respondent had been Hen House\'s primary lender.1 At the time the Chapter 11 petition was filed, it held a security interest in essentially all of Hen House\'s real and personal property, securing an indebtedness of over $4 million. After the Chapter 11 proceedings were commenced, it agreed to lend Hen House an additional $300,000 to help finance the reorganization.

Although the policy required monthly premium payments, Hen House repeatedly failed to make them; Hartford continued to provide insurance nonetheless. The reorganization ultimately failed, and on January 20, 1993, the Bankruptcy Court converted the case to a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 and appointed a trustee. At the time of the conversion, Hen House owed Hartford more than $50,000 in unpaid premiums. Hartford learned of Hen House\'s bankruptcy proceedings after the conversion, in March 1993.</p><p>Recognizing that the estate lacked unencumbered funds to pay the premiums, Hartford attempted to charge the premiums to respondent, the secured creditor, by filing with the Bankruptcy Court an "Application for Allowance of Administrative Expense, Pursuant to 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 503 and Charge Against Collateral, Pursuant to 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 506(c)." The Bankruptcy Court ruled in favor of Hartford, and the District Court and an Eighth Circuit panel affirmed, <i>In re Hen House Interstate, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/150/868/">150 F.3d 868</a> <i>(CA8 </i>1998). The Eighth Circuit subsequently granted en banc review, however, and reversed, concluding that \xc2\xa7 506(c) could not be invoked by an administrative claimant. <i>In re Hen House Interstate, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/177/719/">177 F.3d 719</a> (1999). We granted certiorari. 528 U. S. 985 (2000).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Petitioner\'s effort to recover the unpaid premiums involves two provisions, 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 503(b) and 506(c). Section 503(b) provides that "the actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the commence-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="5">5</a></p><p>ment of the case," are treated as administrative expenses, which are, as a rule, entitled to priority over prepetition unsecured claims, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 507(a)(1), 726(a)(1), 1129(a)(9)(A). Respondent does not dispute that the cost of the workers\' compensation insurance Hen House purchased from petitioner is an administrative expense within the meaning of this provision. Administrative expenses, however, do not have priority over secured claims, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 506, 725-726, 1129(b)(2)(A); <i>United Sav. Assn. of Tex. </i>v. <i>Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/365/case.html">484 U. S. 365</a>, 378-379 (1988), and because respondent held a security interest in essentially all of the estate\'s assets, there were no unencumbered funds available to pay even administrative claimants.</p><p>Petitioner therefore looked to \xc2\xa7 506(c), which constitutes an important exception to the rule that secured claims are superior to administrative claims. That section provides as follows:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable, necessary costs and expenses of preserving, or disposing of, such property to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such claim." \xc2\xa7 506(c).</p></blockquote><p>Petitioner argued that this provision entitled it to recover from the property subject to respondent\'s security interest the unpaid premiums owed by Hen House, since its furnishing of workers\' compensation insurance benefited respondent by allowing continued operation of Hen House\'s business, thereby preserving the value of respondent\'s collateral; or alternatively, that such benefit could be presumed from respondent\'s consent to the postpetition financing order. Although it was contested below whether, under either theory, the workers\' compensation insurance constituted a "benefit to the holder" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 506(c), that issue is not before us here; we assume for purposes of this decision that it did, and consider only whether peti-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="6">6</a></p><p>tioner-an administrative claimant-is a proper party to seek recovery under \xc2\xa7 506(c).2</p><p>In answering this question, we begin with the understanding that Congress "says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there," <i>Connecticut Nat. Bank </i>v. <i>Germain, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/case.html">503 U. S. 249</a>, 254 (1992). As we have previously noted in construing another provision of \xc2\xa7 506, when "the statute\'s language is plain, \'the sole function of the courts\' "-at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd-" \'is to enforce it according to its terms.\'" <i>United States </i>v. <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 </i>U. S. 235, 241 (1989) (quoting <i>Caminetti </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/242/470/case.html">242 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1917)). Here, the statute appears quite plain in specifying who may use \xc2\xa7 506(c)-"[t]he trustee." It is true, however, as petitioner notes, that all this actually "says" is that the trustee may seek recovery under the section, not that others may not. The question thus becomes whether it is a proper inference that the trustee is the only party empowered to invoke the provision.3 We have little difficulty answering yes.</p><p>Several contextual features here support the conclusion that exclusivity is intended. First, a situation in which a statute authorizes specific action and designates a particular party empowered to take it is surely among the least appropriate in which to presume nonexclusivity. "Where a</p><p>2 In addition to seeking recovery under \xc2\xa7 506(c), petitioner argued to the Eighth Circuit en bane that it was entitled to recover under the terms of the postpetition financing order itself. Petitioner sought to enforce that order under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7071, which incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71 ("When an order is made in favor of a person who is not a party to the action, that person may enforce obedience to the order by the same process as if a party ... "). The Eighth Circuit declined to address this issue, since it had not been raised until the rehearing en bane, <i>In re Hen House Interstate, Inc., </i>177</p><p>3 Debtors-in-possession may also use the section, as they are expressly given the rights and powers of a trustee by 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1107.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="7">7</a></p><p>statute ... names the parties granted [the] right to invoke its provisions, ... such parties only may act." 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7 47.23, p. 217 (5th ed. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Federal Election Comm\'n </i>v. <i>National Conservative Political Action Comm., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/480/case.html">470 U. S. 480</a>, 486 (1985). Second, the fact that the sole party named-the trustee-has a unique role in bankruptcy proceedings makes it entirely plausible that Congress would provide a power to him and not to others. Indeed, had no particular parties been specified-had \xc2\xa7 506(c) read simply "[t]here may be recovered from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable, necessary costs and expenses, etc."-the trustee is the most obvious party who would have been thought empowered to use the provision. It is thus far more sensible to view the provision as answering the question "Who may use the provision?" with "only the trustee" than to view it as simply answering the question "May the trustee use the provision?" with "yes."</p><p>Nor can it be argued that the point of the provision was simply to establish that certain costs may be recovered from collateral, and not to say anything about who may recover them. Had that been Congress\'s intention, it could easily have used the formulation just suggested. Similarly, had Congress intended the provision to be broadly available, it could simply have said so, as it did in describing the parties who could act under other sections of the Code. Section 502(a), for example, provides that a claim is allowed unless "a party in interest" objects, and \xc2\xa7 503(b)(4) allows "an entity" to file a request for payment of an administrative expense. The broad phrasing of these sections, when contrasted with the use of "the trustee" in \xc2\xa7 506(c), supports the conclusion that entities other than the trustee are not entitled to use \xc2\xa7 506(c). <i>Russello </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/case.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983).</p><p>Petitioner\'s primary argument from the text of \xc2\xa7 506(c) is that "what matters is that section 506(c) does not say that</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="8">8</a></p><p>\'only\' a trustee may enforce its provisions." Brief for Petitioner 29. To bolster this argument, petitioner cites other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that do use "only" or other expressly restrictive language in specifying the parties at issue. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>\xc2\xa7 109(a) ("[O]nly a person that resides or has a domicile, a place of business, or property in the United States, or a municipality, may be a debtor under this title"); \xc2\xa7 707(b) (providing that a case may be dismissed for substantial abuse by "the court, on its own motion or on a motion by the United States trustee, but not at the request or suggestion of any party in interest"). Petitioner argues that in the absence of such restrictive language, no party in interest is excluded. This theory-that the expression of one thing indicates the inclusion of others unless exclusion is made explicit-is contrary to common sense and common usage. Many provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that do not contain an express exclusion cannot sensibly be read to extend to all parties in interest. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>\xc2\xa7 363(b)(1) (providing that "[t]he trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease ... property of the estate"); \xc2\xa7 364(a) (providing that "the trustee" may incur debt on behalf of the bankruptcy estate); \xc2\xa7 554(a) (giving "the trustee" power to abandon property of the bankruptcy estate).</p><p>Petitioner further argues that \xc2\xa7 1109 evidences the right of a nontrustee to recover under \xc2\xa7 506(c). We are not persuaded. That section, which provides that a "party in interest" "may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under [Chapter 11]," is by its terms inapplicable here, since petitioner\'s attempt to use \xc2\xa7 506(c) came after the bankruptcy proceeding was converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7. In any event, we do not read \xc2\xa7 1109(b)\'s general provision of a right to be heard as broadly allowing a creditor to pursue substantive remedies that other Code provisions make available only to other specific parties. Cf. 7 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy ~ 1109.05 (rev. 15th ed. 1999) ("In general, section 1109 does not bestow any right to usurp the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="9">9</a></p><p>trustee\'s role as representative of the estate with respect to the initiation of certain types of litigation that belong exclusively to the estate").</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Because we believe that by far the most natural reading of \xc2\xa7 506(c) is that it extends only to the trustee, petitioner\'s burden of persuading us that the section must be read to allow its use by other parties is "\'exceptionally heavy.\'" <i>Patterson </i>v. <i>Shumate, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/753/case.html">504 U. S. 753</a>, 760 (1992) (quoting <i>Union Bank </i>v. <i>Wolas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/151/case.html">502 U. S. 151</a>, 156 (1991)). To support its proffered reading, petitioner advances arguments based on pre-Code practice and policy considerations. We address these arguments in turn.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>Section 506(c)\'s provision for the charge of certain administrative expenses against lienholders continues a practice that existed under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>In re Tyne, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/257/310/">257 F.2d 310</a>,312 <i>(CA7 </i>1958); 4 Collier on Bankruptcy, <i>supra, ~ </i>506.05[1]. It was not to be found in the text of the Act, but traced its origin to early cases establishing an equitable principle that where a court has custody of property, costs of administering and preserving the property are a dominant charge, see, <i>e. g., Bronson </i>v. <i>La Crosse </i>&amp; <i>Milwaukee R. Co., </i>1 Wall. 405, 410 (1864); <i>Atlantic Trust Co. </i>v. <i>Chapman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/360/case.html">208 U. S. 360</a>, 376 (1908). It was the norm that recovery of costs from a secured creditor would be sought by the trustee, see, <i>e. g., Textile Banking Co. </i>v. <i>Widener, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/265/446/">265 F.2d 446</a>, 453-454 <i>(CA4 </i>1959); <i>Tyne, supra, </i>at 312. Petitioner cites a number of lower court cases, however, in which-without meaningful discussion of the pointparties other than the trustee were permitted to pursue such charges under the Act, sometimes simultaneously with the trustee\'s pursuit of his own expenses, see, <i>e. g., First Western Savings and Loan Assn. </i>v. <i>Anderson, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/252/544/">252 F.2d 544</a>, 547-548 <i>(CA9 </i>1958); <i>In re Louisville Storage Co., </i>21 F.

Petitioner also relies on early decisions of this Court allowing individual claimants to seek recovery from secured assets, see <i>Louisville, E. </i>&amp; <i>St. L. R. Co. </i>v. <i>Wilson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/138/501/case.html">138 U. S. 501</a>, 506 (1891); <i>Burnham </i>v. <i>Bowen, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/776/case.html">111 U.

In any event, while pre-Code practice "informs our understanding of the language of the Code," <i>id., </i>at 44, it cannot overcome that language. It is a tool of construction, not an extratextual supplement. We have applied it to the construction of provisions which were "subject to interpretation," <i>id., </i>at 50, or contained "ambiguity in the text," <i>Dewsnup, supra, </i>at 417. "[W]here the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code\'s text is itself clear ... its operation is unimpeded by contrary ... prior practice," <i>BFP </i>v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/531/case.html">511 U. S. 531</a>, 546 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). See, <i>e. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare </i>v. <i>Davenport, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/552/case.html">495 U.

If \xc2\xa7 506(c) provided only that certain costs and expenses could be recovered from property securing a secured claim, without specifying any particular party by whom the recovery could be pursued, the case would be akin to those in which we used prior practice to fill in the details of a pre-Code concept that the Code had adopted without elaboration. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>United States </i>v. <i>Noland, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/535/case.html">517 U. S. 535</a>, 539 (1996) (looking to pre-Code practice in interpreting Code\'s reference to "principles of equitable subordination"); <i>Midlantic Nat. Bank </i>v. <i>New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/494/case.html">474 U. S. 494</a>, 501 (1986) (codification of trustee\'s abandonment power held to incorporate established exceptions). Here, however, it is not the unelaborated concept but only a specifically narrowed one that has been adopted: a rule allowing the charge of costs to secured assets <i>by the trustee. </i>PreCode practice cannot transform \xc2\xa7 506(c)\'s reference to "the trustee" to "the trustee and other parties in interest."</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>Finally, petitioner argues that its reading is necessary as a matter of policy, since in some cases the trustee may lack an incentive to pursue payment. Section 506(c) must be open to nontrustees, petitioner asserts, lest secured creditors enjoy the benefit of services without paying for them. Moreover, ensuring that administrative claimants are compensated may also serve purposes beyond the avoidance of unjust enrichment. To the extent that there are circumstances in which the trustee will not use the section although an individual creditor would,4 allowing suits by nontrustees</p><p>4 The frequency with which such circumstances arise may depend in part on who ultimately receives the recovery obtained by a trustee under \xc2\xa7 506(c). Petitioner argues that it goes to the party who provided the services that benefited collateral (assuming that party has not already been compensated by the estate). Respondent argues that this read-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="12">12</a></p><p>could encourage the provision of postpetition services to debtors on more favorable terms, which would in turn further bankruptcy\'s goals.</p><p>Although these concerns may be valid, it is far from clear that the policy implications favor petitioner\'s position. The class of cases in which \xc2\xa7 506(c) would lie dormant without nontrustee use is limited by the fact that the trustee is obliged to seek recovery under the section whenever his fiduciary duties so require. And limiting \xc2\xa7 506(c) to the trustee does not leave those who provide goods or services that benefit secured interests without other means of protecting themselves as against other creditors: They may insist on cash payment, or contract directly with the secured creditor, and may be able to obtain superpriority under \xc2\xa7 364(c)(1) or a security interest under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 364(c)(2), (3), or \xc2\xa7 364(d). And of course postpetition creditors can avoid unnecessary losses simply by paying attention to the status of their accounts, a protection which, by all appearances, petitioner neglected here.</p><p>On the other side of the ledger, petitioner\'s reading would itself lead to results that seem undesirable as a matter of policy. In particular, expanding the number of parties who could use \xc2\xa7 506(c) would create the possibility of multiple administrative claimants seeking recovery under the sec-</p><p>ing, like a reading that allows creditors themselves to use \xc2\xa7 506(c), upsets the Code\'s priority scheme by giving administrative claimants who benefit collateral an effective priority over others-allowing, for example, a Chapter 11 administrative creditor (like petitioner) to obtain payment via \xc2\xa7 506(c) while Chapter 7 administrative creditors remain unpaid, despite \xc2\xa7 726(b)\'s provision that Chapter 7 administrative claims have priority over Chapter 11 administrative claims. Thus, respondent asserts that a trustee\'s recovery under \xc2\xa7 506(c) simply goes into the estate to be distributed according to the Code\'s priority provisions. Since this case does not involve a trustee\'s recovery under \xc2\xa7 506(c), we do not address this question, or the related question whether the trustee may use the provision prior to paying the expenses for which reimbursement is sought, see <i>In re K </i>&amp; <i>L Lakeland, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/128/203/">128 F.3d 203</a>, 207, 212 <i>(CA4 1997).</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="13">13</a></p><p>tion. Each such claim would require inquiry into the necessity of the services at issue and the degree of benefit to the secured creditor. Allowing recovery to be sought at the behest of parties other than the trustee could therefore impair the ability of the bankruptcy court to coordinate proceedings, as well as the ability of the trustee to manage the estate. Indeed, if administrative claimants were free to seek recovery on their own, they could proceed even where the trustee himself planned to do so. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>In re Bluffton Castings Corp., </i>224 B. R. 902, 904 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ind. 1998).5 Further, where unencumbered assets were scarce, creditors might attempt to use \xc2\xa7 506(c) even though their claim to have benefited the secured creditor was quite weak. The possibility of being targeted for such claims by various administrative claimants could make secured creditors less willing to provide postpetition financing.</p><p>In any event, we do not sit to assess the relative merits of different approaches to various bankruptcy problems. It suffices that the natural reading of the text produces the result we announce. Achieving a better policy outcome-if what petitioner urges is that-is a task for Congress, not</p><p>5We do not address whether a bankruptcy court can allow other interested parties to act in the trustee\'s stead in pursuing recovery under \xc2\xa7 506(c). <i>Amici </i>American Insurance Association and National Union Fire Insurance Co. draw our attention to the practice of some courts of allowing creditors or creditors\' committees a derivative right to bring avoidance actions when the trustee refuses to do so, even though the applicable Code provisions, see 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 544,545, 547(b), 548(a), 549(a), mention only the trustee. See, <i>e. g., In re Gibson Group, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/66/1436/">66 F.3d 1436</a>, 1438 <i>(CA6 </i>1995). Whatever the validity of that practice, it has no analogous application here, since petitioner did not ask the trustee to pursue payment under \xc2\xa7 506(c) and did not seek permission from the Bankruptcy Court to take such action in the trustee\'s stead. Petitioner asserted an independent right to use \xc2\xa7 506(c), which is what we reject today.
