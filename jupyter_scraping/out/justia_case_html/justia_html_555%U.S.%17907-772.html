SARAUSAD</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93772.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 15, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 21, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Sarausad drove the car in a driveby shooting at a high school, which was the culmination of a gang dispute.  En route to school, Ronquillo, the front seat passenger, covered his lower face and readied a handgun.  Sarausad abruptly slowed down upon reaching the school, Ronquillo fired at a group of students, killing one and wounding another, and Sarausad then sped away.  He, Ronquillo, and Reyes, another passenger, were tried on murder and related charges.  Sarausad and Reyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued that they were not accomplices to murder because they had not known Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s plan and had expected at most another fistfight.  In her closing argument, the prosecutor stressed Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a shooting, noting how he drove at the scene, that he knew that fighting alone would not regain respect for his gang, and that he was \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury received two instructions that directly quoted Washington\xe2\x80\x99s accomplice-liability law.  When it failed to reach a verdict as to Reyes, the judge declared a mistrial as to him.  The jury then convicted Ronquillo on all counts and convicted Sarausad of second-degree murder and related crimes.  In affirming Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, the State Court of Appeals, among other things, referred to an \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d accomplice-liability theory.  The State Supreme Court denied review, but in its subsequent <em>Roberts </em>case, it clarified that \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d was not the best descriptor of accomplice liability because an accomplice must have knowledge of the crime that occurred.  The court also explicitly reaffirmed its precedent that the type of jury instructions used at Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s trial comport with Washington law.  Sarausad sought state postconviction relief, arguing that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s improper \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d argument may have led the jury to convict him as an accomplice to murder based solely on a finding that he had anticipated that an assault would occur.  The state appeals court reexamined the trial record in light of <em>Roberts</em>, but found<em> </em>no error requiring correction.  The State Supreme Court denied Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s petition, holding that the trial court correctly instructed the jury and that no prejudicial error resulted from the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s potentially improper hypothetical.  Sarausad then sought review under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, which,<em> inter alia, </em>permits a federal court to grant habeas relief on a claim \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d in state court only if the decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\xe2\x80\x9d this Court, \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The District Court granted the petition, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding it unreasonable for the state court to affirm Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s conviction because the jury instruction on accomplice liability was ambiguous and there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury misinterpreted the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a shooting beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the state-court decision did not result in an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), the Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief to Sarausad.

S. 433</a>, 436 <em>(per curiam).  </em>A defendant challenging the constitutionality of a jury instruction that quotes a state statute must show both that the instruction was ambiguous and that there was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury applied the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>McGuire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/62/index.html">502 U. S. 62</a>, 72.  The instruction \xe2\x80\x9cmust be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>and the pertinent question is whether the \xe2\x80\x9cinstruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because the Washington courts\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that the jury instruction was unambiguous was not objectively unreasonable, the Ninth Circuit should have ended its \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) inquiry there.  The instruction parroted the state statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, requiring the jury to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice \xe2\x80\x9cin the commission of the [murder]\xe2\x80\x9d if he acted \xe2\x80\x9cwith knowledge that [his conduct would] promote or facilitate the commission of the [murder],\xe2\x80\x9d Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a).  The instruction cannot be assigned any meaning different from the one given to it by the Washington courts.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Even if the instruction were ambiguous, the Ninth Circuit still erred in finding it so ambiguous as to cause a federal constitutional violation requiring reversal under AEDPA.  The Washington courts reasonably applied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent when they found no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument caused the jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facilitating a driveby shooting.  She never argued that the admission by Sarausad and Reyes that they anticipated a fight was a concession of accomplice liability for murder.  Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s attorney also homed in on the key question, stressing a lack of evidence showing that Sarausad knew that his assistance would promote or facilitate a premeditated murder.  Every state and federal appellate court that reviewed the verdict found the evidence supporting Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a shooting legally sufficient to convict him under Washington law.  Given the strength of that evidence, and the jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to convict Reyes\xe2\x80\x94who had also been charged as an accomplice to murder and admitted knowledge of a possible fight\xe2\x80\x94it was not objectively unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the jury convicted Sarausad because it believed that he, unlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reasoning is unconvincing.

S. ____ (2009)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 07-772<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">DOUG WADDINGTON, SUPERINTENDENT,\nWASHINGTON CORRECTIONS CENTER,\nPETITIONER <em>v. </em>CESAR SARAUSAD</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[January 21, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arose from a fatal driveby shooting into a group of students standing in front of a Seattle high school.  Brian Ronquillo was ultimately identified as the gunman; at the time of the shooting, he was a passenger in a car driven by respondent Cesar Sarausad II.  A jury convicted Sarausad as an accomplice to second-degree murder, attempted murder, and assault; he was sentenced to just over 27 years of imprisonment.  The Washington courts affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct review, and his state-court motions for postconviction relief were denied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, then, filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  The District Court granted the writ.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court that the state-court decision was an objectively \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals found it unreasonable for the state court to reject Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s argument that certain jury instructions used at his trial were ambiguous and were likely misinterpreted by the jury to relieve the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Sarausad </em>v. <em>Porter</em>, 479 F.\xc2\xa03d 671 (2007).  We disagree.  Because the Washington courts reasonably applied our precedent to the facts of this case, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The driveby shooting was the culmination of a gang dispute between the 23d Street Diablos, of which Cesar Sarausad was a member, and the Bad Side Posse, which was headquartered at Ballard High School in Seattle, Washington.  A member of the Diablos, Jerome Reyes, had been chased from Ballard by members of the Bad Side Posse, so the Diablos decided to go \xe2\x80\x9cto Ballard High School to show that the Diablos were not afraid\xe2\x80\x9d of the rival gang.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 235a.  The Diablos started a fight with the Bad Side Posse, but left quickly after someone indicated that police were nearby.  They went to a gang member\xe2\x80\x99s house, still angry because the Bad Side Posse had \xe2\x80\x9ccalled [them] weak.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 2660\xe2\x80\x932661.  Brian Ronquillo retrieved a handgun, and the gang decided to return to Ballard and \xe2\x80\x9cget [their] respect back.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2699.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sarausad drove, with Ronquillo in the front passenger seat and Reyes and two other Diablos in the back seat.  En route, someone in the car mentioned \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98capping\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Bad Side Posse, and Ronquillo tied a bandana over the lower part of his face and readied the handgun.  <em>Sarausad </em>v. <em>State</em>, 109 Wash. App. 824, 844, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d 308, 319 (2001).  Shortly before reaching the high school, a second car of Diablos pulled up next to Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s car and the drivers of the two cars talked briefly.  Sarausad asked the other driver, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Are you ready?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id., </em>at 844\xe2\x80\x93845, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 319, and then sped the rest of the way to the high school.  Once in front of the school, Sarausad abruptly slowed to about five miles per hour while Ronquillo fired 6 to 10 shots at a group of students standing in front of it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 831, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 312.  Sarausad \xe2\x80\x9csaw everyone go down,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 2870, and then sped away, 109 Wash. App., at 832, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 313.  The gunfire killed one student; another student was wounded when a bullet fragment struck his leg.<em>  Id., </em>at 831\xe2\x80\x93832, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 312\xe2\x80\x93313.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sarausad, Ronquillo, and Reyes were tried for the first-degree murder of Melissa Fernandes, the attempted first-degree murders of Ryan Lam and Tam Nguyen, and the second-degree assault of Brent Mason.  Sarausad and Reyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued at trial that they could not have been accomplices to murder because they \xe2\x80\x9chad no idea whatsoever that Ronquillo had armed himself for the return trip.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 832, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 313.  They claimed that they expected, at most, another fistfight with the Bad Side Posse and were \xe2\x80\x9ctotally and utterly dismayed when Ronquillo started shooting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, in particular, argued that there was no evidence that Sarausad expected anything more than that the two gangs \xe2\x80\x9cwould exchange insults, and maybe, maybe get into a fight.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 1151.  Sarausad testified that he considered only the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d id.,</em> at 2799, but never the possibility of a shooting, 109 Wash. App.,\nat 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313.  During closing arguments, Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s attorney again argued that the evidence showed only that Sarausad was \xe2\x80\x9cwilling to fight them the way they fought them the first time.  And that is by pushing and shoving and more tough talk.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 81.  That was not sufficient, the attorney argued, to find that \xe2\x80\x9cCesar [Sarausad] had knowledge that his assistance would promote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 83.  Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s attorney also explained to the jury that knowledge of just any crime, such as knowledge that criminal assistance would be rendered after the shooting, would be insufficient to hold Sarausad responsible as an accomplice to murder because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ccomplice liability requires that one assists with knowledge, that their actions will promote or facilitate the commission of <em>the</em> crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 100 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response, the prosecutor focused much of her closing argument on the evidence of Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a shooting.  He had \xe2\x80\x9cslowed down before the shots were fired, stayed slowed down until the shots were over and immediately sped up.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 39.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no hesitation, there was no stopping the car.  There was no attempt for Mr. Sarausad to swerve his car out of the way so that innocent people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get shot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 40.  She also argued that Sarausad knew when he drove back to the school that his gang\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfists didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, the pushing didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, the flashing of the signs, the violent altercation didn\xe2\x80\x99t work\xe2\x80\x9d because the Bad Side Posse still \xe2\x80\x9claughed at them, they called them weak, they called them nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 44.  So, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen they rode down to Ballard High School that last time, \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]hey knew they were there to commit a crime, to disrespect the gang, to fight, to shoot, to get that respect back.  A fist didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, pushing didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.  Shouting insults at them didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.  Shooting was going to work.  In for a dime, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 123\xe2\x80\x93124.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the close of trial, the jury received two instructions that directly quoted Washington\xe2\x80\x99s accomplice-liability statute.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Instruction number 45 provided:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYou are instructed that a person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable.

One questioned the accomplice-liability standard as it related to the first-degree murder instructions; one questioned the standard as it related to the second-degree murder instructions; and one stated that the jury was \xe2\x80\x9chaving difficulty agreeing on the legal definition and concept of \xe2\x80\x98accomplice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and whether a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwilling participat[ion] in a group activity\xe2\x80\x9d makes \xe2\x80\x9cthat person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 129.  In response to each question, the judge instructed the jury to reread the accomplice-liability instructions and to consider the instructions as a whole.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to Reyes, and the judge declared a mistrial as to him.  The jury then returned guilty verdicts on all counts for Ronquillo and convicted Sarausad of the lesser included crimes of second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and second-degree assault.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Sarausad argued that because the State did not prove that he had intent to kill, he could not be convicted as an accomplice to second-degree murder under Washington law.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions, explaining that under Washington law, an accomplice must have \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that the crime will occur, but need not have the specific intent required for that crime\xe2\x80\x99s commission.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a.  The court referred to accomplice liability as \xe2\x80\x9ca theory of criminal liability that in Washington has been reduced to the maxim, \xe2\x80\x98in for a dime, in for a dollar.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 235a.  The Washington Supreme Court denied discretionary review.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Ronquillo</em>, 136 Wash.\xc2\xa02d 1018, 966 P.\xc2\xa02d 1277 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly thereafter, the Washington Supreme Court clarified in an unrelated criminal case that \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d is not the best descriptor of accomplice liability under Washington law because an accomplice must have knowledge of \xe2\x80\x9cthe crime\xe2\x80\x9d that occurs.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts</em>, 142 Wash.\xc2\xa02d 471, 509\xe2\x80\x93510, 14 P.\xc2\xa03d 713, 734\xe2\x80\x93735 (2000).  Therefore, an accomplice who knows of one crime\xe2\x80\x94the dime\xe2\x80\x94is not guilty of a greater crime\xe2\x80\x94the dollar\xe2\x80\x94if he has no knowledge of that greater crime.

The court explained that in every situation but one, the prosecutor clearly did not use that phrase to argue that Sarausad could be convicted of murder if he intended only a fistfight.  Instead, she used it to convey a \xe2\x80\x9cgang mentality\xe2\x80\x9d that requires a wrong to the gang to be avenged by any means necessary.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, according to the prosecutor, when a fight did not work, Sarausad knew that a shooting was required to avenge his gang.

The instruction parroted the language of the statute, requiring that an accomplice \xe2\x80\x9cin the commission of <em>the crime</em>\xe2\x80\x9d take action \xe2\x80\x9cwith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of <em>the crime</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (emphasis added); Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a) (2008).  It is impossible to assign any meaning to this instruction different from the meaning given to it by the Washington courts.  By its plain terms, it instructed the jury to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice \xe2\x80\x9cin the commission of the [murder]\xe2\x80\x9d only if he acted \xe2\x80\x9cwith knowledge that [his conduct] will promote or facilitate the commission of the [murder].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9317.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Because the conclusion reached by the Washington courts that the jury instruction was unambiguous was not objectively unreasonable, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) inquiry should have ended there.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we agreed that the instruction was ambiguous, the Court of Appeals still erred in finding that the instruction was so ambiguous as to cause a federal constitutional violation, as required for us to reverse the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination under AEDPA, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  The Washington courts reasonably applied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent when they determined that there was no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument caused Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facilitating a driveby shooting.  Indeed, Sarausad and Reyes had admitted under oath that they anticipated a fight, Tr. 2671, 2794, and yet the prosecutor never argued that their admission was a concession of accomplice liability for murder.  She instead argued that Sarausad knew that a shooting was intended, App. 123, because he drove his car in a way that would help Ronquillo \xe2\x80\x9cfire those shots,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 39.  The closing argument of Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s attorney also homed in on the key legal question: He challenged the jury to look for evidence that Sarausad \xe2\x80\x9chad knowledge that his assistance would promote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder\xe2\x80\x9d and argued that no such evidence existed.  <em>Id.,</em> at 83.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Put simply, there was no evidence of ultimate juror confusion as to the test for accomplice liability under Washington law.  Rather, the jury simply reached a unanimous decision that the State had proved Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Indeed, every state and federal appellate court that reviewed the verdict found that the evidence supporting Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a shooting was legally sufficient to convict him under Washington law.  479 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 677\xe2\x80\x93683; <em>Sarausad,</em> 109 Wash.\xc2\xa0App., at 844\xe2\x80\x93845, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 319.  Given the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction, along with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to convict Reyes\xe2\x80\x94who also had been charged as an accomplice to murder and also had admitted knowledge of a possible fight\xe2\x80\x94it was not objectively unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the jury convicted Sarausad only because it believed that he, unlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeals, which failed to review the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 resolution of this question through the deferential lens of AEDPA, does not convince us otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court of Appeals found that the evidence of Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the shooting was so \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury must have incorrectly believed that proof of such knowledge was not required.  479 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 692\xe2\x80\x93693.  That conclusion, however, is foreclosed by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 own determination that the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to reasonably infer that Sarausad knowingly facilitated the driveby shooting.  As explained above, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the evidence showed that Ronquillo, while seated in Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s front passenger seat, tied a bandana over the lower part of his face and pulled out a gun.  <em>Id.,</em> at 681.  There also was evidence that Sarausad then asked the Diablos in the other car, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Are you ready?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d before driving to the school and \xe2\x80\x9cslow[ing] his car in front of the school in a manner that facilitated a drive-by shooting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Other gang members testified to prior knowledge of the gun and to discussing the shooting as an option during the gang meeting held between trips to Ballard High School.  <em>Id.,</em> at 682.  There also was testimony from Sarausad that he suspected that members of the Bad Side Posse would be armed when they returned to Ballard High School, <em>ibid.</em>, making it reasonable to conclude that Sarausad would expect his gang to be similarly prepared for the confrontation.  There was nothing \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d about the evidence of Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court of Appeals faulted the prosecutor for arguing \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and forcefully\xe2\x80\x9d for an \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d theory of accomplice liability.  <em>Id.,</em> at 693.  But the Washington Court of Appeals conducted an in-depth analysis of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s argument and reasonably found that it contained, at most, one problematic hypothetical.  <em>Sarausad, supra,</em> at 842\xe2\x80\x93843, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 318\xe2\x80\x93319.  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the one hypothetical did not taint the proper instruction of state law was reasonable under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, which acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9carguments of counsel generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyde</em>, 494 U. S., at 384.  On habeas review, the Court of Appeals should not have dissected the closing argument and exaggerated the possible effect of one hypothetical in it<em>.   </em>There was nothing objectively unreasonable about the Washington courts\xe2\x80\x99 resolution of this question.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, and last, the Court of Appeals believed that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s questions \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated substantial confusion about what the State was required to prove.\xe2\x80\x9d  479 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 693<em>.</em>  Sarausad focuses special attention on this factor, arguing that it was the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to remedy\xe2\x80\x9d this confusion that sets this case apart from previous decisions and establishes that the jury likely \xe2\x80\x9cdid not understand accomplice liability\xe2\x80\x9d when it returned its verdict.  Brief for Respondent 29, 31.  But this Court has determined that the Constitution generally requires nothing more from a trial judge than the type of answers given to the jury here.  <em>Weeks</em>, 528 U. S., at 234.  Where a judge \xe2\x80\x9crespond[s] to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s question by directing its attention to the precise paragraph of the constitutionally adequate instruction that answers its inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d and the jury asks no followup question, this Court has presumed that the jury fully understood the judge\xe2\x80\x99s answer and appropriately applied the jury instructions.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this established standard, it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s jury received the answers it needed to resolve its confusion.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Its questions were spaced throughout seven days of deliberations, involved different criminal charges, and implicated the interrelation of several different jury instructions.  The judge pinpointed his answers to the particular instructions responsive to the questions and those instructions reflected state law.  Under these circumstances, the state court did not act in an objectively unreasonable manner in finding that the jury knew the proper legal standard for conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the state-court decision did not result in an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U.

But the confusion in the Court of Appeals over the application of the statute involved the related, but legally distinct, question whether an accomplice is required to share the specific intent of the principal actor under Washington law.  On direct appeal, respondent argued that he should not have been convicted as an accomplice to murder because he did not have the specific intent to kill.  The Washington Court of Appeals rejected that argument because \xe2\x80\x9cit was not necessary for the State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or knew that there was a potential for gunplay that day\xe2\x80\x9d under Washington law, App. to Pet. for Cert.<em> </em>266a, where \xe2\x80\x9caccomplice liability predicates criminal liability on general knowledge of a crime, rather than specific knowledge of the elements of the principal\xe2\x80\x99s crime,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 259a.  But the Washington Court of Appeals never held that knowledge of a completely different crime, such as assault, would be sufficient under Washington law for accomplice liability for murder.  See <em>id.,</em> at 258a\xe2\x80\x93259a; see also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Domingo</em>, 155 Wash. 2d 356, 367\xe2\x80\x93368, 119 P.\xc2\xa03d 816, 822 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]either <em>Davis </em>nor any of this court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions subsequent to <em>Davis</em> approves of the proposition that accomplice liability attaches for any and all crimes committed by the principal so long as the putative accomplice knowingly aided in any one of the crimes\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, the Court of Appeals had evaluated whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction required a specific intent versus a general intent to kill, not whether it required knowledge of a murder versus knowledge of an assault\xe2\x80\x94the issue under review here.  Thus, the confusion in the state courts referenced by the dissent has no bearing on the question presented in this appeal, and does not support the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the jury instruction in question was ambiguous.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To the extent that the Court of Appeals attempted to rewrite state law by proposing that the instruction should have included \xe2\x80\x9can explicit statement that an accomplice must have knowledge of \xe2\x80\xa6 the actual crime the principal intends to commit,\xe2\x80\x9d 479 F.\xc2\xa03d 671, 689\xe2\x80\x93690 (CA9 2007), it compounded its error.  The Washington Supreme Court expressly held that the jury instruction correctly set forth state law, App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a, and we have repeatedly held that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Estelle</em> v.<em> McGuire, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/62/index.html"></a><a href="/us/502/62/index.html">502 U.

We disagree.  The proper inquiry is whether the state court was objectively unreasonable in concluding that the instruction (which precisely tracked the language of the accomplice-liability statute) was not warped by this one-paragraph hypothetical in an argument and rebuttal spanning 31 pages of the joint appendix.  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was not unreasonable.  The hypothetical was presented during closing arguments, which juries generally \xe2\x80\x9cvie[w] as the statements of advocates\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cas definitive and binding statements of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/370/index.html">494 U.

But our decision cannot turn on a <em>de novo</em> review of the record or a finding that the answers were \xe2\x80\x9cthe best way to answer jurors\xe2\x80\x99 questions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 10.  On federal habeas review, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry is limited to whether the state court violated clearly established federal law when it held that the jury applied the correct standard, in light of the answers given to its questions.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  On that issue, the state court was not objectively unreasonable; the jury\xe2\x80\x99s questions were answered in a manner previously approved by this Court, and they consistently referred the jury to the correct standard for accomplice liability in Washington.  The dissent also ignores the important fact that the jury convicted Ronquillo of first-degree murder, convicted respondent of second-degree murder, and failed to reach an agreement on Reyes\xe2\x80\x99 guilt, causing a mistrial on the first-degree murder charge pending against him.  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s assignment of culpability to two of the codefendants, versus its deadlock over a third who, like respondent, conceded knowledge of an assault, demonstrates that the jury understood the legal significance of each defendant\xe2\x80\x99s relative knowledge and intent with respect to the murder.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962841">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nWADDINGTON V. SARAUSAD<br/>\n555 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 07-772<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">DOUG WADDINGTON, SUPERINTENDENT,\nWASHINGTON CORRECTIONS CENTER,\nPETITIONER <em>v. </em>CESAR SARAUSAD</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[January 21, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issue in this habeas case is whether it was objectively reasonable for the state court to find that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury convicted respondent Cesar Sarausad on a mistaken understanding of Washington law.  The underlying question is whether the jury may have thought it could find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice to murder on the theory that he assisted in what he expected would be a fist fight, or whether the jury knew that to convict him Washington law required it to conclude Sarausad aided in what he understood was intended to be a killing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So far as the instructions addressed these alternatives, the judge charged the jurors in these words:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA person is an accomplice in the commission of a crime if, with knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime, he or she either:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests another person to commit the crime or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) aids or agrees to aid another person in planning or committing the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 17.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority answers the underlying question by relying on the general rule that incorporating a clear statute into a jury charge almost always produces an adequate instruction, which the jury is assumed to follow.  The kicker of course is that the general rule is only good if the incorporated statute is clear enough to require the jury to find facts amounting to a violation of the law as correctly understood.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Does the rule apply here?  The majority says it does.  It says the instruction quoted is unambiguous because it parrots the language of the Washington statute on accomplice liability, <em>ante</em>, at 11, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is impossible to assign any meaning to this instruction\xe2\x80\x9d and, by extension, the statute, \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from the meaning given to it by the Washington courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not, however, what the record shows.  Rather than a single understanding, the Washington courts have produced a record of discordant positions on the meaning of the statute, and the Washington Court of Appeals can itself attest to a degree of difficulty in understanding the statutory requirement sufficient to show the statute to be ambiguous and the statute-based instruction constitutionally inadequate: that court read the statute to mean just the opposite of what the majority now claims it unambiguously requires.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal in 1998, the State Court of Appeals set out the principles on which it understood accomplice liability in Washington to be premised.  It did not say that the accomplice must understand that he is aiding in the commission of the same offense the principal has in mind, or the offense actually committed.  Instead, the Washington Court of Appeals said this:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) To convict of accomplice liability, the State need not prove that principal and accomplice shared the same mental state, (2) accomplice liability predicates criminal liability on general knowledge of a crime, rather than specific knowledge of the elements of the principal\xe2\x80\x99s crime, and (3) an accomplice, having agreed to participate in a criminal activity, runs the risk that the primary actor will exceed the scope of the preplanned illegality.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Ronquillo</em>, No. 35840\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93I etc. (Mar. 2, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 233a, 258a\xe2\x80\x93259a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn support, the court cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, 101 Wash. 2d 654, 682 P.\xc2\xa02d 883 (1984), in which the Supreme Court of Washington noted that \xe2\x80\x9can accomplice, having agreed to participate in a criminal act, runs the risk of having the primary actor exceed the scope of the preplanned illegality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 658, 682 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 886.   As today\xe2\x80\x99s majority notes, <em>ante</em>, at 6, the state appellate court remarked that the Washington law of accomplice liability (as it then understood it) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98has been reduced to the maxim, \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; the court also held that \xe2\x80\x9cit was not necessary for the State to prove Sarausad \xe2\x80\xa6 knew that there was a potential for gunplay that day.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Ronquillo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 235a, 266a.  So much for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s confidence that the statute-based instruction can only be understood as requiring what the State Supreme Court now says it requires: proof that the accomplice understood that he was aiding in the commission of the very crime he is charged with facilitating.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State Supreme Court clarified this requirement two years after the Court of Appeals held against Sarausad.  In <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts</em>, 142 Wash. 2d 471, 14 P.\xc2\xa03d 713 (2000), the Supreme Court of Washington held that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d view of accomplice liability was a misreading of the statute and a flat-out misstatement of law.  In <em>Roberts</em>, the State Supreme Court revisited <em>Davis</em>, which it explained as standing for the principle \xe2\x80\x9cthat an accomplice need not have specific knowledge of <em>every element</em> of the crime committed by the principal, provided he has general knowledge of that specific crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  142 Wash. 2d, at 512, 14 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 736.  Although a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthat specific crime\xe2\x80\x9d intended by a confederate and eventually committed will suffice for the mental element of accomplice liability, mere \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge by the accomplice that the principal intends to commit \xe2\x80\x98a crime\xe2\x80\x99 does not impose strict liability for any and all offenses that follow.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 513, 14 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 736.  In other words, it was incorrect to read the statute as the Supreme Court of Washington had arguably done in <em>Davis</em> (and the State Court of Appeals certainly did in this case), to mean that anyone who agrees \xe2\x80\x9cto participate in a criminal act \xe2\x80\xa6 runs the risk of [accomplice liability for a more serious crime if] the primary actor exceed[s] the scope of the preplanned illegality,\xe2\x80\x9d 101 Wash. 2d, at 658, 682 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 886.  The reductive maxim \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d was now understood to be a distortion of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s accomplice liability law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Washington Court of Appeals said as much when Sarausad appeared before it the second time, seeking postconviction relief: \xe2\x80\x9c[Sarausad] points out, and correctly so, that this court decided [his direct] appeal on the premise that \xe2\x80\x98in for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x99 correctly characterized Washington accomplice liability law.  We said that \xe2\x80\x98an accomplice, \xe2\x80\x9chaving agreed to participate in a criminal act, runs the risk of having the primary actor exceed the scope of the preplanned illegality.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sarausad </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, 109 Wash. App. 824, 833\xe2\x80\x93834, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d 308, 313 (2001).  The Court of Appeals said that it had \xe2\x80\x9cerred\xe2\x80\x9d in determining that it was unnecessary for the State to prove Sarausad knew he was facilitating a drive-by shooting.  <em>Id</em>., at 837, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This profession of judicial error in understanding the law is the touchmark not of a clear statute, but of an indistinct or perplexing one, which the law calls ambiguous.  The majority is thus unquestionably mistaken in finding it \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible to assign any meaning to [the instruction quoting the statute that is] different from the meaning\xe2\x80\x9d the majority thinks is clear.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  Given that error on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s part, it has not justified its reversal of the Ninth Circuit by showing that the instruction was clear.*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There remains the question whether the majority\xe2\x80\x99s second conclusion is also unjustifiable: despite inadequate instruction, did the jurors nevertheless apply the correct view of state law, which only recently, and after the trial, attained its current clarity?  The state postconviction court found no reasonable likelihood that the jurors failed to apply a correct understanding of accomplice liability, <em>Sarausad </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 843\xe2\x80\x93844, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 318\xe2\x80\x93319, and Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s burden here (on federal habeas) is to demonstrate that the state court was objectively unreasonable in drawing this conclusion, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The District Court and the Ninth Circuit found he had done just that, whereas the majority today insists those courts were wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s position is simply unrealistic.  Even a juror with a preternatural grasp of the statutory subtlety would have lost his grip after listening to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument, which first addressed the state law of accomplice liability with a statement that was flatout error, followed that with a confusing argument that could have reflected either the correct or the erroneous view, and concluded with an argument that could have fit either theory but ended with a phrase defined to express the erroneous one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In her first pass at the subject, the prosecutor said unequivocally that assaultive, not murderous, intent on Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s part would suffice for the intent required of an accomplice to murder.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you a good example of accomplice liability.  A friend comes up to you and says, \xe2\x80\x98Hold this person\xe2\x80\x99s arms while I hit him.\xe2\x80\x99  You say, \xe2\x80\x98Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that person, anyway.\xe2\x80\x99  You hold the arms.  The person not only gets assaulted, he gets killed.  You are an accomplice and you can\xe2\x80\x99t come back and say, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I only intended this much damage to happen.\xe2\x80\x99  Your presence, your readiness to assist caused the crime to occur and you are an accomplice.  The law in the State of Washington says, if you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a dime, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a dollar.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re there or even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not there and you\xe2\x80\x99re helping in some fashion to bring about this crime, you are just as guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 38.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, in what the majority would launder into \xe2\x80\x9cone problematic hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, the prosecutor introduced the \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d locution, which she defined to mean that readiness to aid in the commission of any crime thought to be intended by the principal is enough intent for accomplice liability for whatever crime the principal actually commits.  This lead-off misstatement of the law, never corrected by the trial judge, infects every further statement bearing on accomplice law the prosecutor made, for into each effort she consistently introduced the viral catchphrase \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a second reference to accomplice law, the prosecutor discussed gang mentality and used the phrase, without modifying her earlier explanation of its legal meaning, then followed up with a reference to the evidence that could have fit either the erroneous theory or the law as corrected by <em>Roberts:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sarausad [was] present and \xe2\x80\xa6 certainly ready to assist.  And I remind you, too, what you heard not only from \xe2\x80\xa6 the gang expert in this case, but from [gang] member after [gang] member who told you that an affront to one is an affront to all, \xe2\x80\x98When you disrespect me you disrespect my gang.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey were all there that day \xe2\x80\xa6 ready to back each other up in whatever happened.

Not true, not true.  And that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the instruction says.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you the old adage, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a dime, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a dollar.  If their logic was correct, they\xe2\x80\x99re not ever an accomplice to anything.

Shouting insults at them didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.  Shooting was going to work.  In for a dime, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.</em>, at 123\xe2\x80\x93124.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s jumble of rules, one proposition is both clear and clearly erroneous: the statement of law, \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d  It unmistakably contradicts the construction for which Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s counsel correctly argued, which would have required the jury to find that Sarausad understood that the object was killing in order to find him guilty as an accomplice to murder.  <em>Id</em>., at 83\xe2\x80\x9384.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point here is not to excoriate the prosecutor, who tried this case in the period between <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Davis</em> and could fairly assume that her expansive (\xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime  \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d) view of accomplice liability was good law in her State.  The point is just the obvious one that cannot be evaded without playing make-believe with the record: an uncertain instruction by the trial judge was combined with confounding prosecutorial argument incorporating what the state courts now acknowledge was a clearly-erroneous statement of law, in contrast to the view of the law argued by defense counsel.  In these circumstances jury confu-\nsion is all but inevitable and jury error the reasonable likelihood.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If there were any doubt about that, one could simply look at the record of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations, in the course of which the jurors repeatedly asked the court to clarify the law on accomplice liability.  They began deliberating on Friday, October 21, 1994, and the following Tuesday, they asked (as to the instructions laying out the crime of first-degree murder and the required premeditation), \xe2\x80\x9cdoes the \xe2\x80\x98intent\xe2\x80\x99 apply to (the defendant only) or to (the defendant or his accomplice)?\xe2\x80\x9d  App<em>.</em> 126.  The judge replied, \xe2\x80\x9cRefer to instructions 46 and 47 and consider your instructions as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. <em> </em>Three days later, October 28, this time in reference to the second-degree murder instructions, the jury enquired a second time about accomplice liability, asking whether \xe2\x80\x9cintentional appl[ies] to only the defendant or only his accomplice?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 128.  The judge\xe2\x80\x99s response was nearly identical to his first one: \xe2\x80\x9cRefer to instructions 45 &amp; 46 and consider the instructions as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The following Monday, the jury returned to deliberations and requested help yet again, spelling out its confusion: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are having difficulty agreeing on the legal definition and concept of \xe2\x80\x98accomplice.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6  [W]hen a person willing[ly] participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 129.  Once again, the judge sent the jurors back to the written charge: \xe2\x80\x9cRefer to instructions \xe2\x80\xa6 45, 46, 47, and 48 and consider your instructions as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority sidesteps the thrust of this record by suggesting that the jurors failed to let the court know of any confusion: it says the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 questions \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved different criminal charges, and implicated the interrelation of several different jury instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  But this simply ignores the disclosure obviously common to all those questions: the jurors did not understand the state of mind the prosecution had to prove for accomplice liability.  Their final question makes this unmistakable.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority says, in any case, that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references back to the written instructions were enough and that \xe2\x80\x9cit was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that [the] jury received the answers it needed to resolve its confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  But after the jurors asked three times?  In many trials, reference back to written instructions would be the best way to answer jurors\xe2\x80\x99 questions, which may reflect uncertain memory, not deficient instruction.  But not in this case: the accomplice liability instruction was defective owing to the ambiguity of the statutory language it incorporated, and its deficiency was underscored by the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous argument.  Telling the jurors to read an inadequate instruction three more times did nothing to improve upon it or enlighten the readers.  The District Court and the Ninth Circuit drew the only conclusion reasonably possible on this record.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0As the majority notes, <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa04, in the Washington Court of Appeals on direct review, Sarausad\xe2\x80\x99s counsel claimed that state law required that an accomplice to murder have a specific intent to kill (or aid in killing).  The Court of Appeals rejected this position.  Contrary to the majority view, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa04, in gauging the adequacy of an instruction incorporating statutory terms, the fact that defense counsel may have asked for too much does nothing to lessen the pertinence of opaque state law or its uncertainty in the minds of the state judges.   The Court of Appeals in its very response to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s argument demonstrated its misunderstanding of the scope of Washington accomplice liability law: \xe2\x80\x9caccomplice liability predicates criminal liability on general knowledge of <em>a </em>crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Ronquillo</em>, No. 35840\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93I etc. (Mar. 2, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 233a, 259a (emphasis added).   For that matter, the Court of Appeals subsequently disavowed the very statement used by the majority to support its contention that the court was focused solely on the issue of specific intent.  The court, in the postconviction proceedings, concluded that it was in fact necessary for the State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or knew there was potential for gunplay that day.  <em>Sarausad </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, 109 Wash. App. 824, 837, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d 308, 315 (2001).  This knowledge would have been necessary regardless of whether the law required Sarausad to have specific or general intent to kill, unless, of course, accomplice liability was predicated on an \xe2\x80\x9cin for a dime, in for a dollar\xe2\x80\x9d theory of liability and knowledge of a fistfight could suffice.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
