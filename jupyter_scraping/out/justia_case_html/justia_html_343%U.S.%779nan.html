JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question before us arises in an admiralty proceedings by a seaman against his employer to recover wages earned on a merchant vessel of United States registry.  The question is whether the employer may set off against the seaman\'s wages its expenditures for the medical care and hospitalization of another member of the crew necessitated by injuries inflicted on him by the seaman, without justification, during the voyage on which the wages were earned.  For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that it may not do so.</p>\n<p>In 1948, respondent, Johnson, was employed by petitioner, Isbrandtsen Company, Inc., as a messman on a foreign voyage of a vessel of United States registry, chartered by petitioner.  On April 21, while the vessel was on its course in the Pacific, Johnson, without justification, stabbed Brandon, another member of the crew.  He injured Brandon so severely that petitioner found it necessary to divert its vessel from its course in order to hospitalize Brandon on the Island of Tonga.  Johnson makes no claim for wages earned after April 21.  However, when discharged in Philadelphia, May 31, 1948, Johnson claimed $439.27 as earned wages due him above all deductions, without making allowance for any expenditures made by petitioner for the care or hospitalization of Brandon.  When petitioner refused to pay Johnson anything, he filed a libel and complaint in the United States District Court to recover the balance due on his earned wages, plus interest, transportation to Seattle (his port of signing on) and double wages for each day of unlawful delay in the payment of the sum due. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Petitioner set up a counterclaim of $2,500, later reduced to $1,691.55, for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 343 U. S. 781</a></p><p> expenses and losses caused it by Johnson\'s attack on Brandon. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It contended also that the nature of this defense demonstrated the existence of sufficient statutory cause for its delay in making payment.</p>\n<p>The District Court disallowed petitioner\'s counterclaim and entered judgment for respondent\'s earned wages and transportation allowance, plus interest and costs.  It disallowed respondent\'s claim for double wages. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  91 F.Supp. 872.  Petitioner appealed, but the Court of Appeals affirmed.  190 F.2d 991.  We granted certiorari because the decision below presents an important question of maritime law not heretofore determined by this Court.  342 U.S. 940,.</p>\n<p>Petitioner cites several early lower court decisions which allowed a setoff against a seaman\'s suit for wages.  These were largely rendered before the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872 or rendered later without discussion of that or subsequent legislation. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We are convinced, however, that the legislation passed by Congress for the protection of seamen, beginning in 1872, has now covered this field.  Petitioner\'s setoff is not prescribed, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 343 U. S. 782</a></p><p> recognized or permitted by such legislation.  So far as that legislation goes, such a setoff is not available as a defense against a seaman\'s claim for earned wages.  R.S. \xc2\xa7 4547, 30 Stat. 756, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 604.  On the other hand, the absence of such authorization for the employer to set off such a counterclaim does not preclude it from seeking to collect the claim otherwise.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this case, we may assume that petitioner owed Brandon the legal duty to provide him with the medical care and hospitalization which it provided, and also owed him the duty to divert its vessel from its course to secure his hospitalization at Tonga.  <em>Aguilar v.

No rule of construction precludes giving a natural meaning to legislation like this that obviously is of a remedial, beneficial and amendatory character.  It should be interpreted so as to effect its purpose.

The full force of this became evident when this Court, in 1908, interpreted "attachment" and "arrestment" to mean that the Act prohibits the seizure of a seaman\'s earned wages even by levying execution against them to collect valid judgments.  <em>Wilder v. Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/239/case.html">211 U. S. 239</a></span>; <em>see</em> 1 Norris, The Law of Seamen (1951), 347-350.</p>\n<p>Congressional legislation now touches nearly every phase of a seaman\'s life.  It concerns itself with his personal safety, comfort, and health in many ways not necessary to review here.  It deals specifically with his shipping articles and the payment to him of his wages.  It insures generally a partial payment to him of his wages at each port where his vessel loads or delivers cargo.  It </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 343 U. S. 785</a></p><p> insures the payment to him of the balance of those wages upon completion of his voyage or shortly after his discharge. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  It deals explicitly with the final payment of wages. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It describes "forfeitures" which lawfully may be deducted from a seaman\'s wages "for the benefit of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 343 U. S. 786</a></p><p> master or owner by whom the wages are payable." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  These provisions for the return of wages to the employer are remedial, rather than penal, in their nature.  <em>See</em> Crawford, The Construction of Statutes (1940), 106. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 343 U. S. 787</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In keeping with the spirit of such legislation and the need for clear rules governing the computation of the balance due each seaman upon his discharge, it is reasonable to hold that only such deductions and setoffs for derelictions in the performance of his duties shall be allowed against his wages as are recognized in the statutes.  Other claims against him may be valid, but their collection must be sought through other means. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The appropriateness of this solution is emphasized in the case of unliquidated counterclaims.  Petitioner\'s unliquidated claim </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 343 U. S. 788</a></p><p> was first estimated at $2,500.  It now has been fixed at $1,691.55.  The factors making up such a claim are largely within the control and knowledge of the employer alone, and it easily could wipe out every cent of a seaman\'s earned wages.</p>\n<p>There is little substance to the suggestion that the expenses at issue can be brought within the statutorily recognized "forfeitures."  Assuming that Johnson\'s attack amounted to a breach of general discipline, it hardly amounted to "willful disobedience to any lawful command at sea. . . ."  R.S. 4596, Fourth. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Assuming that it caused expense to petitioner, it hardly amounted to "willfully damaging the vessel . . . or . . . any of the stores or cargo. . . ."  R.S. \xc2\xa7 4596, Seventh. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>From this, we conclude that Congress has preempted the area relating to deductions and setoffs based upon derelictions of duty as against a seaman\'s claim to his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="789">Page 343 U. S. 789</a></p><p> wages.  Congress has gone so far in expressly listing such deductions and setoffs that it is a fair inference that those not listed may not be made.  It thus remains for the courts to determine only what are the deductions or setoffs for derelictions of duty that are listed by Congress, rather than to determine which of the deductions or setoffs once known to the general maritime law Congress has failed to exclude.  Congress, in effect, has excluded all of them except those which it has listed affirmatively.

The Act of July 20, 1790, 1 Stat. 131, in effect prior to 1872, was a limited forerunner of the expansive remedial legislation that followed.  It did not attempt to cover the field to an extent comparable to that done by the later legislation.  Accordingly, decisions rendered before 1872, recognizing an employer\'s right of recoupment against seamen\'s wages under general maritime law, are not authoritative guides today.  The early cases are reviewed in 1 Norris, The Law of Seamen (1951), 378-391.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>That appraisal was reaffirmed in <em>Cortes v.

If no "forfeiture" may be set off against a seaman\'s wages for expenses resulting to his employer from his assault upon a superior officer, there is little basis to imply congressional approval of a setoff against his wages to cover expenses resulting from his assault upon a fellow member of the crew not his superior.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>For comparable reasons, petitioner\'s counterclaim may not be set off against the allowance made to respondent for transportation to his port of signing on.
