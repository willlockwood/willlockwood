UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93848.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 7, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 22, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">Under the Postal Reorganization Act, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) applies to \xe2\x80\x9ctort claims arising out of [Postal Service] activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7409(c).  The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign immunity in certain cases involving negligence committed by federal employees in the course of their employment, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1), making the United States liable \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72674.  However, the sovereign immunity bar remains as to, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(b).  Consequently, the United States may be liable if postal workers commit torts under local law, but not for claims defined by the exception.  Petitioner Dolan filed an FTCA suit against the Postal Service for injuries she suffered when she tripped and fell over mail left on her porch by postal employees.  The District Court dismissed the suit, and the Third Circuit affirmed, both concluding that, although the FTCA generally waives sovereign immunity as to federal employees\xe2\x80\x99 torts, Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s claims were barred by \xc2\xa72680(b)\xe2\x80\x99s exception.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the postal exception is inapplicable in this case, Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s claim may go forward.  This Court assumes that under the applicable state law a person injured by tripping over a package or bundle negligently left by a private party would have a cause of action for damages.  The question is whether \xc2\xa72860(b)\xe2\x80\x99s exception preserves sovereign immunity in such a case.  Considered in isolation, \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d could embrace a wide range of acts.  However, interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and context.  Here, both context and precedent require reading the phrase so that it does not go beyond negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.  Starting with context, \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d follows the terms \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage,\xe2\x80\x9d which limit the reach of transmission.  Mail is \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d if it is destroyed or misplaced and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarried\xe2\x80\x9d if it goes to the wrong address.  Since both terms refer to failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d swept far more broadly to include injuries caused by postal employees but involving neither failure to transmit mail nor damage to its contents.  This interpretation is supported by <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html">465 U. S. 848</a>, where this Court noted that one of the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes was to waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from liability for injuries resulting from auto accidents involving postal trucks delivering\xe2\x80\x94and thus \xe2\x80\x9ctransmitting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the mail.  Nothing in the statutory text supports a distinction between negligent driving, which the Government claims relates only circumstantially to the mail, and Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s accident, which was caused by the mail itself.  In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail.  In addition, focusing on whether the mail itself caused the injury would yield anomalies, perhaps making liability turn on<em>, e.g.,</em> whether a mail sack was empty or full.  It is more likely that Congress intended to retain immunity only for injuries arising because mail either fails to arrive or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address, since such harms are primarily identified with the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s function of transporting mail.  The Government claims that, given the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s vast operations, Congress must have intended to insulate delivery-related torts from liability, but \xc2\xa72680(b)\xe2\x80\x99s specificity indicates otherwise.  Had Congress intended to preserve immunity for all delivery-related torts, it could have used sweeping language similar to that used in other FTCA exceptions, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa72860(i).  Furthermore, losses of the type for which immunity is retained under \xc2\xa72680(b) are at least to some degree avoidable or compensable through postal registration and insurance.  The Government raises the specter of frivolous slip-and-fall claims inundating the Postal Service, but that is a risk shared by any business making home deliveries.  Finally, the general rule that a sovereign immunity waiver \xe2\x80\x9cwill be strictly construed \xe2\x80\xa6 in favor of the sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lane</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/187/index.html">518 U. S. 187</a>, 192, is \xe2\x80\x9cunhelpful\xe2\x80\x9d in the FTCA context, where \xe2\x80\x9cunduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating\xe2\x80\x9d the central purpose of the statute,<em> Kosak, supra</em>, at 853, n.\xc2\xa09, which \xe2\x80\x9cwaives the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit in sweeping language,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Yellow Cab Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/543/index.html">340 U.

This case involves one such delivery point\xe2\x80\x94petitioner Barbara Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s porch\xe2\x80\x94where mail left by postal employees allegedly caused her to trip and fall.  Claiming injuries as a result, Dolan filed a claim for administrative relief from the Postal Service.  When her claim was denied, she and her husband (whose claim for loss of consortium the Dolans later conceded was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserting that the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s negligent placement of mail at their home subjected the Government to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346(b)(1), 2674.  The District Court dismissed Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s suit, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 377 F.\xc2\xa03d 285 (2004).  Both courts concluded that, although the FTCA generally waives sovereign immunity as to federal employees\xe2\x80\x99 torts, Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s claims were barred by an exception to that waiver, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(b).  We disagree and hold that Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s suit may proceed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101 <em>et seq.</em>, the Postal Service is \xe2\x80\x9can independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7201.  Holding a monopoly over carriage of letters, the Postal Service has \xe2\x80\x9csignificant governmental powers,\xe2\x80\x9d including the power of eminent domain, the authority to make searches and seizures in the enforcement of laws protecting the mails, the authority to promulgate postal regulations, and, subject to the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s supervision, the power to enter international postal agreements.  See <em>Postal Service</em> v. <em>Flamingo Industries (USA) Ltd., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/736/index.html">540 U. S. 736</a>, 741 (2004) (discussing 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101, 401, 407, 601\xe2\x80\x93606).  Consistent with this status, the Postal Service enjoys federal sovereign immunity absent a waiver.  See <em>ibid.;</em> cf. <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 475 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Postal Reorganization Act generally \xe2\x80\x9cwaives the immunity of the Postal Service from suit by giving it the power \xe2\x80\x98to sue and be sued in its official name,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flamingo Industries, supra</em>, at 741 (quoting 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(1)), the statute also provides that the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply to tort claims arising out of activities of the Postal Service,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7409(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign immunity in two different sections of the United States Code.  The first confers federal-court jurisdiction in a defined category of cases involving negligence committed by federal employees in the course of their employment.  This jurisdictional grant covers:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cclaims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs to claims falling within this jurisdictional grant, the FTCA, in a second provision, makes the United States liable \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d though not \xe2\x80\x9cfor interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72674; see generally <em>United States</em> v. <em>Olson</em>, 546 U. S. ___\xc2\xa0, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FTCA qualifies its waiver of sovereign immunity for certain categories of claims (13 in all).  If one of the exceptions applies, the bar of sovereign immunity remains.  The 13 categories of exempted claims are set forth in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680, and the relevant subsection for our purposes, pertaining to postal operations, is \xc2\xa72680(b).  It states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to \xe2\x80\xa6 [a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs a consequence, the United States may be liable if postal employees commit torts under local law, but not for claims defined by this exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was the provision relied upon by the District Court and Court of Appeals to dismiss Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision created a conflict with a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  See <em>Raila</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 121 (CA2 2004).  We granted certiorari.  544 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We assume that under the applicable state law a person injured by tripping over a package or bundle of papers negligently left on the porch of a residence by a private party would have a cause of action for damages.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346(b)(1), 2674.  The question is whether, when mail left by the Postal Service causes the slip and fall, the \xc2\xa72680(b) exception for \xe2\x80\x9closs, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\xe2\x80\x9d preserves sovereign immunity despite the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s more general statements of waiver.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If considered in isolation, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d could embrace a wide range of negligent acts committed by the Postal Service in the course of delivering mail, including creation of slip-and-fall hazards from leaving packets and parcels on the porch of a residence.  After all, in ordinary meaning and usage, transmission of the mail is not complete until it arrives at the destination.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2429 (1971) (defining \xe2\x80\x9ctransmission\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can act, process, or instance of transmitting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto cause to go or be conveyed to another person or place\xe2\x80\x9d).  In large part this inference\xe2\x80\x94transmission includes delivery\xe2\x80\x94led the District Court and Court of Appeals to rule for the Government.  See 377 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 288; App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a\xe2\x80\x936a.  The definition of words in isolation, however, is not necessarily controlling in statutory construction.  A word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.  Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.  Here, we conclude both context and precedent require a narrower reading, so that \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d does not go beyond negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.  See <em>Raila, supra</em>, at 121 (holding the postal exception covers \xe2\x80\x9cdamages and delay of the postal material itself and consequential damages therefrom\xe2\x80\x9d).  The phrase does not comprehend all negligence occurring in the course of mail delivery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Starting with context, the words \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72680(b) follow two other terms, \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those terms, we think, limit the reach of \xe2\x80\x9ctransmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] word is known by the company it keeps\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a rule that \xe2\x80\x9cis often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jarecki</em> v. <em>G.\xc2\xa0D. Searle &amp; Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/303/index.html">367 U. S. 303</a>, 307 (1961); see also <em>Dole</em> v. <em>Steelworkers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/26/index.html">494 U. S. 26</a>, 36 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]ords grouped in a list should be given related meaning\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Here, as both parties acknowledge, mail is \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d if it is destroyed or misplaced and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarried\xe2\x80\x9d if it goes to the wrong address.  Since both those terms refer to failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d swept far more broadly to include injuries like those alleged here\xe2\x80\x94injuries that happen to be caused by postal employees but involve neither failure to transmit mail nor damage to its contents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our interpretation would be less secure were it not for a precedent we deem to have decisive weight here.  We refer to <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html">465 U. S. 848</a> (1984).  In <em>Kosak</em>, an art collector alleged in an FTCA suit that artworks he owned were damaged when the United States Customs Service seized and detained them.  <em>Id.</em>, at 849\xe2\x80\x93850.  The question was whether the Government retained immunity based on \xc2\xa72680(c), a provision that has since been amended but at the time covered:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or any other law-enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 852, n.\xc2\xa06 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn its opinion concluding the exception did apply and thus that the United States retained sovereign immunity, the Court gave specific consideration to the postal exception.  In a part of the opinion central to its holding, the Court contrasted what it called the \xe2\x80\x9cgenerality of \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9cspecificity of \xc2\xa72680(b),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 855.  The Court observed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the principal purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act was to waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from liability for injuries resulting from auto accidents in which employees of the Postal System were at fault.  In order to ensure that \xc2\xa72680(b), which governs torts committed by mailmen, did not have the effect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct for which the Government was not assuming financial responsibility\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x98the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94thereby excluding, by implication, negligent handling of motor vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case neither party suggests Kosak</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion regarding negligent operation of postal motor vehicles should be ignored as dictum.  In light of <em>Kosak</em>\xe2\x80\x99s discussion, we cannot interpret the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72680(b) to cover all negligence in the course of mail delivery.  Although postal trucks may well be delivering\xe2\x80\x94and thus transmitting\xe2\x80\x94mail when they collide with other vehicles, <em>Kosak</em> indicates the United States, nonetheless, retains no immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seeking to distinguish postal auto accidents from Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s fall, the Government argues that negligent driving relates only circumstantially to the mail, whereas Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s accident was caused by the mail itself.  Nothing in the statutory text supports this distinction.  Quite the contrary, if placing mail so as to create a slip-and-fall risk constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission,\xe2\x80\x9d the same should be true of driving postal trucks in a manner that endangers others on the road.  In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail.  In addition, as the Second Circuit recognized and as the Government acknowledged at oral argument, focusing on whether the mail itself caused the injury would yield anomalies, perhaps making liability turn on whether a mail sack causing a slip-and-fall was empty or full, or whether a pedestrian sideswiped by a passing truck was hit by the side-view mirror or a dangling parcel.  See <em>Raila</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 122\xe2\x80\x93123.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it more likely that Congress intended to retain immunity, as a general rule, only for injuries arising, directly or consequentially, because mail either fails to arrive at all or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.  Illustrative instances of the exception\xe2\x80\x99s operation, then, would be personal or financial harms arising from nondelivery or late delivery of sensitive materials or information (<em>e.g.,</em> medicines or a mortgage foreclosure notice) or from negligent handling of a mailed parcel (<em>e.g.,</em> shattering of shipped china).  Such harms, after all, are the sort primarily identified with the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s function of transporting mail throughout the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resisting this conclusion, the Government emphasizes the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s vast operations\xe2\x80\x94the 660 million daily mailings and 142 million delivery points mentioned at the outset.  See Brief for Respondents 36.  As delivery to mailboxes and doorsteps is essential to this nationwide undertaking, Congress must have intended, the Government asserts, to insulate delivery-related torts from liability.  If, however, doorstep delivery is essential to the postal enterprise, then driving postal trucks is no less so.  And in any event, while it is true \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xc2\xa72680 exceptions are designed to protect certain important governmental functions and prerogatives from disruption,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Molzof</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/301/index.html">502 U. S. 301</a>, 311 (1992), the specificity of \xc2\xa72680(b), see <em>Kosak, </em>465 U. S., at 855, indicates that Congress did not intend to immunize all postal activities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other FTCA exceptions paint with a far broader brush.  They cover, for example:  \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(i); \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(j); \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(k); \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(<em>l</em>), or \xe2\x80\x9cthe Panama Canal Company,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(m); and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(n).  Had Congress intended to preserve immunity for all torts related to postal delivery\xe2\x80\x94torts including hazardous mail placement at customer homes\xe2\x80\x94it could have used similarly sweeping language in \xc2\xa72680(b).  By instead \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully delineat[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d just three types of harm (loss, miscarriage, and negligent transmission), see <em>Kosak, supra</em>, at 855, Congress expressed the intent to immunize only a subset of postal wrongdoing, not all torts committed in the course of mail delivery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further supporting our interpretation, losses of the type for which immunity is retained under \xc2\xa72680(b) are at least to some degree avoidable or compensable through postal registration and insurance.  See United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual pt. 609.1.1 (Nov. 10, 2005), available at http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/609.htm (as visited Jan. 9, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (allowing indemnity claims for loss or damage of \xe2\x80\x9cinsured, collect on delivery (COD), registered with postal insurance, or Express Mail\xe2\x80\x9d); 39 CFR \xc2\xa7111.1 (2005) (incorporating by reference the Domestic Mail Manual).  The same was true when Congress enacted the FTCA in 1946.  See 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7245 (1940 ed. and Supp. V) (setting rates and conditions for mail insurance); 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7381 (1946 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor the greater security of valuable mail matter the Postmaster General may establish a uniform system of registration, and as a part of such system he may provide rules under which the senders or owners of any registered matter shall be indemnified for loss, rifling, or damage thereof in the mails\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  As <em>Kosak</em> explains, one purpose of the FTCA exceptions was to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cextending the coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available,\xe2\x80\x9d 465 U. S., at 858\xe2\x80\x94an objective consistent with retaining immunity as to claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal registration and insurance.  While the Government suggests other injuries falling outside the FTCA are also subject to administrative relief, even assuming that is true the provision the Government cites permits only discretionary relief, not an automatic remedy like postal insurance.  See 39 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72603 (indicating the Postal Service \xe2\x80\x9cmay adjust and settle\xe2\x80\x9d personal-injury and property-damage claims \xe2\x80\x9cnot cognizable\xe2\x80\x9d under the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative relief provision); see also 31 U.

It is true that, in addition to other considerations we have identified, <em>Kosak</em> describes \xe2\x80\x9cavoiding exposure of the United States to liability for excessive or fraudulent claims\xe2\x80\x9d as a principal aim of the FTCA exceptions, 465 U. S., at 858.  Slip-and-fall liability, however, to the extent state tort law imposes it, is a risk shared by any business that makes home deliveries.  Given that \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission,\xe2\x80\x9d viewed in context and in light of <em>Kosak</em>, cannot sweep as broadly as the Government claims, ordinary protections against frivolous litigation must suffice here, just as they do in the case of motor vehicle collisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it should be noted that this case does not implicate the general rule that \xe2\x80\x9ca waiver of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lane</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/187/index.html">518 U. S. 187</a>, 192 (1996).  As <em>Kosak</em> explains, this principle is \xe2\x80\x9cunhelpful\xe2\x80\x9d in the FTCA context, where \xe2\x80\x9cunduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U.

Today, the Court concludes that Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit may proceed because her claim does not fall within the exception.  I disagree.  Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s claim arises out of the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d of mail and is thus covered by the terms of the postal exception.  Even if the exception is ambiguous, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases require that ambiguities as to the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity be resolved in its favor.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of the postal exception, and every term therein, should be ascribed its ordinary meaning.  See <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 477 (1994) (noting that we interpret a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary meaning when that term is not defined in the statute).  The term in controversy here is \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  The crux of my disagreement with the majority is its failure to assign the term \xe2\x80\x9ctransmission\xe2\x80\x9d its plain meaning.  That term is defined as the \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ct, operation, or process, of transmitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2692 (2d ed. 1934, as republished 1945).  \xe2\x80\x9cTransmit\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o send or transfer from one person or place to another; to forward by rail, post, wire, etc.,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 [t]o cause\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 to pass or be conveyed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2692\xe2\x80\x932693.  There is no cause to conclude that Congress was unaware of the ordinary definition of the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctransmission\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit\xe2\x80\x9d when it enacted the FTCA and the postal exception in 1946.  Nor is there textual indication that Congress intended to deviate from the ordinary meaning of these terms.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Accordingly, I would interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9ctransmission\xe2\x80\x9d consistent, with its ordinary meaning, see <em>ante</em>, at 4, and conclude that the postal exception exempts the Government from liability for <em>any</em> claim arising out of the negligent delivery of the mail to a Postal Service patron, including Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s slip-and-fall claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning and usage\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority concludes that the term covers only injury arising \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly or consequentially\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cnegligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, 7.  Thus, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d covers direct injury to the mail as well as personal injury arising from injury to the mail, but does not cover personal injury that does not arise from damage to the mail.  For example, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, if a mail carrier negligently drops a mailbox containing glassware on a patron\xe2\x80\x99s doorstep, causing the contents to shatter, and the patron later injures himself while attempting to handle the shards of glass, the postal exception would bar a claim for damages for the destroyed item as well as a related claim for personal injury.  That view is correct, as far as it goes.  However, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, if the mail carrier negligently places a heap of mail on a patron\xe2\x80\x99s front porch and the patron trips and falls over the mail as he walks out of his front door, his personal injury claim may go forward.  There is no basis in the text for the line drawn by the majority.  Indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view is at odds with the broad language of the postal exception, which expressly applies to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[a]ny claim</em> arising out of \xe2\x80\xa6 negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority rationalizes its view by concluding that the terms \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily limit the term \xe2\x80\x9ctransmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 5.  Applying the rule of <em>noscitur a sociis</em>\xe2\x80\x94that a word is known by the company it keeps\xe2\x80\x94the majority reasons that because both \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage\xe2\x80\x9d refer to \xe2\x80\x9cfailings in the postal obligation to<em> </em>deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if \xe2\x80\x98negligent transmission\xe2\x80\x99 swept more broadly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But there is nothing \xe2\x80\x9codd\xe2\x80\x9d about interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass more ground than the decidedly narrower terms \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule of <em>noscitur a sociis</em> is intended to prevent ascribing to one word a meaning so expansive that it conflicts with other terms of the provision in a manner that gives \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unintended breadth to an Act of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U.

That rule, however, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require [the Court] to construe every term in a series narrowly because of the meaning given to just one of the terms,\xe2\x80\x9d where, as here, nothing in the text demands a more limited construction.  <em>Gustafson, supra,</em> at 586 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted).  Indeed, to read Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of narrow terms in a list as limiting the meaning of broad terms in the same list \xe2\x80\x9cwould defy common sense; doing so would prevent Congress from giving effect to expansive words in a list whenever they are combined with one word with a more restricted meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 587.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/848/index.html">465 U. S. 848</a> (1984), support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s narrow construction of the postal exception.  In <em>Kosak</em>, this Court suggested that the postal exception does not apply to suits arising from the negligent handling of motor vehicles by Postal Service employees.  Specifically, the Court stated that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the principal purposes of the [FTCA] was to waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from liability for injuries resulting from <em>auto accidents </em>\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  In order to ensure that \xc2\xa72680(b) \xe2\x80\xa6 did not have the effect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct for which the Government was not assuming financial responsibility\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x98the loss, miscarriage, <em>or </em>negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6  <em>Id</em>., at 855 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThat observation has no import beyond the recognition that the postal exception\xe2\x80\x94whatever its scope may be\xe2\x80\x94was carefully crafted so as not to undermine an undisputed principal purpose of the FTCA\xe2\x80\x94to waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity for injuries arising from <em>auto accidents</em>.  It says nothing further about the acts Congress intended to capture when enacting the postal exception, and, thus, is unremarkable for purposes of construing the exception. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if <em>Kosak</em> does inform the outcome in this case, it does not support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  As discussed above, the majority does not purport to limit the type of negligent <em>act</em> that may fall under the postal exception; rather it limits the scope of the exception based on the type of <em>consequence</em> that the negligent act causes (damage to the mail, late delivery, etc.)  But <em>Kosak</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of the <em>act </em>of negligent driving\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether the <em>consequence </em>of that act is damage to the mail or injury to a person\xe2\x80\x94from the scope of the postal exception implies, if anything, that the <em>Kosak </em>Court envisioned discrete <em>acts </em>as being covered, independently of the nature of their consequences.  See 465 U. S., at 855 (excluding \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent handling of motor vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9ctypes of misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d for which liability is barred by the postal exception).  As such, <em>Kosak</em> does not support an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d based upon the type of injury that is caused by the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s negligent handling of the mail.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming that the postal exception is ambiguous, as the majority suggests, see <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, settled principles governing the interpretation of waivers of sovereign immunity require us to rule in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A court may only exercise jurisdiction over the Government pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9ca clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity . . . together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/465/index.html">537 U.

These settled legal principles apply not only to the interpretation of the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity, but also to the interpretation of the scope of any exceptions to that waiver.  See <em>ibid.</em> (explaining that, consistent with rules of construction respecting waivers of sovereign immunity, ambiguities created by conditions on and qualifications of the waiver must be strictly construed in favor of sovereign immunity).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the majority is incorrect to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthis case does not implicate the general rule that \xe2\x80\x98a waiver of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  As this case clearly illustrates, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s amenability to suit can only be ascertained after construing both the waiver of immunity and its exceptions.  The well-established rationale for construing a waiver in favor of the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s immunity, thus, applies with equal force to the construction of an exception to that waiver.  Accordingly, even if I were to conclude that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent transmission\xe2\x80\x9d were as plausible as my own, I would still resolve this case in favor of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity as mandated by our canons of construction.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would hold that a tort claim for personal injury arising out of negligent delivery of mail to a postal patron is barred by 28 U.

S., at 858).  The majority, however, ignores the fact that, in most cases, such insurance covers only the sender, not the recipient, in which case recipients have no means of obtaining compensation for loss or damage to money, gifts, heirlooms, valuable papers, delayed medicine, or time-sensitive documents.  See United States Postal Service, Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7609.4.3(f) and (ae), pp. 1129, 1130 (rev. Jan. 6, 2005).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s justification also fails to take into account the fact that postal patrons cannot insure against the loss of items of sentimental value.  See <em>id</em>., \xc2\xa7609.4.3, generally.  With a more accurate depiction of registration and insurance coverage in hand, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that, like injuries arising from negligent transmission of mail, other injuries outside the reach of the FTCA are also amenable to administrative relief is not so easily dismissed.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  Specifically, 39 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72603, as the Government argues, provides for the settlement of claims, within the discretion of the United States, for injuries caused by the Postal Service that are not otherwise cognizable, which would include claims like Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s.  The discretionary nature of such settlements does not alter the fact that \xc2\xa72603 undermines the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position that the purported unavailability of administrative recovery for claims such as Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s supports its proposed interpretation.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0There is no canon of construction that counsels in favor of construing the ambiguity against the Government.  Although we have \xe2\x80\x9con occasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d we have done so in cases where Congress plainly waived the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity for the particular claim at issue, and the only question before the Court was the permissibility of the form of the suit.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nordic Village</em>, <em>Inc</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/30/index.html">503 U.

In cases where, as here, the question whether a particular claim is subject to an exception is disputed, we have construed FTCA exceptions broadly to preclude claims for actions Congress intended to except from the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s general waiver of immunity.
