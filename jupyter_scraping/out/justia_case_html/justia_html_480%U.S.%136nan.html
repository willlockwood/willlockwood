The question to be decided is whether Florida\'s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to appellant violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 480 U. S. 138</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Lawton and Company (Lawton), a Florida jeweler, hired appellant Paula Hobbie in October, 1981.  She was employed by Lawton for 2 1/2 years, first as a trainee and then as assistant manager of a retail jewelry store.  In April, 1984, Hobbie informed her immediate supervisor that she was to be baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church and that, for religious reasons, she would no longer be able to work on her Sabbath, from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The supervisor devised an arrangement with Hobbie:  she agreed to work evenings and Sundays, and he agreed to substitute for her whenever she was scheduled to work on a Friday evening or a Saturday.</p>\n<p>This arrangement continued until the general manager of Lawton learned of it in June, 1984.  At that time, after a meeting with Hobbie and her minister, the general manager informed appellant that she could either work her scheduled shifts or submit her resignation to the company.  When Hobbie refused to do either, Lawton discharged her.</p>\n<p>On June 4, 1984, appellant filed a claim for unemployment compensation with the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security.  Under Florida law, unemployment compensation benefits are available to persons who become "unemployed through no fault of their own."  Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 443.021 (1985).  Lawton contested the payment of benefits on the ground that Hobbie was "disqualified for benefits" because she had been discharged for "misconduct connected with [her] work."  \xc2\xa7 443.101(1)(a). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 480 U. S. 139</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A claims examiner for the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation denied Hobbie\'s claim for benefits, and she appealed that determination.  Following a hearing before a referee, the Unemployment Appeals Commission (Appeals Commission) affirmed the denial of benefits, agreeing that Hobbie\'s refusal to work scheduled shifts constituted "misconduct connected with [her] work."  App. 3.</p>\n<p>Hobbie challenged the Appeals Commission\'s order in the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal.  On September 10, 1985, that court summarily affirmed the Appeals Commission. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We postponed jurisdiction, 475 U.S. 1117 (1985), and we now reverse. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Under our precedents, the Appeals Commission\'s disqualification of appellant from receipt of benefits violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 480 U. S. 140</a></p><p> States through the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Sherbert v. Verner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html">374 U. S. 398</a></span> (1963); <em>Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/707/case.html">450 U. S. 707</a></span> (1981).  In <em>Sherbert,</em> we considered South Carolina\'s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to a Sabbatarian who, like Hobbie, refused to work on Saturdays.  The Court held that the State\'s disqualification of <em>Sherbert</em></p>\n<p>"force[d] her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand.  Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against [her] for her Saturday worship."</p>\n<p>374 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html#404">374 U. S. 404</a></span>.  We concluded that the State had imposed a burden upon Sherbert\'s free exercise rights that had not been justified by a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p>In <em>Thomas,</em> too, the Court held that a State\'s denial of unemployment benefits unlawfully burdened an employee\'s right to free exercise of religion.  Thomas, a Jehovah\'s Witness, held religious beliefs that forbade his participation in the production of armaments.  He was forced to leave his job when the employer closed his department and transferred him to a division that fabricated turrets for tanks.  Indiana then denied Thomas unemployment compensation benefits.  The Court found that the employee had been "put to a choice between fidelity to religious belief or cessation of work," and that the coercive impact of the forfeiture of benefits in this situation was undeniable:</p>\n<p>"\'Not only is it apparent that appellant\'s declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 480 U. S. 141</a></p><p> . . . religion, but the pressure upon [the employee] to forego that practice is unmistakable.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Thomas, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/707/case.html#717">450 U.

S. 404</a></span>).</p>\n<p>We see no meaningful distinction among the situations of Sherbert, Thomas, and Hobbie.  We again affirm, as stated in <em>Thomas:</em></p>\n<p>"Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, <em>or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs,</em> a burden upon religion exists.  While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial."</p>\n<p>450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/707/case.html#717">450 U. S. 717</a></span>-718 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Both <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em> held that such infringements must be subjected to strict scrutiny and could be justified only by proof by the State of a compelling interest.  The Appeals Commission does not seriously contend that its denial of benefits can withstand strict scrutiny; rather, it urges that we hold that its justification should be determined under the less rigorous standard articulated in Chief Justice Burger\'s opinion in <em>Bowen v. Roy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html">476 U. S. 693</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html#707">476 U.

S. 215</a></span> (1972) ("[O]nly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion"). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Appeals Commission also suggests two grounds upon which we might distinguish <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em> from the present case.  First, the Appeals Commission points out that, in <em>Sherbert,</em> the employee was deemed completely ineligible for benefits under South Carolina\'s unemployment insurance scheme because she would not accept work that conflicted with her Sabbath.  The Appeals Commission contends that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 480 U. S. 143</a></p><p> under Florida law, Hobbie faces only a limited disqualification from receipt of benefits, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and that once this fixed term has been served, she will again "be on an equal footing with all other workers, provided she avoids employment that conflicts with her religious beliefs."  Brief for Appellee Appeals Commission 12.  The Appeals Commission argues that such a disqualification provision is less coercive than the ineligibility determination in <em>Sherbert,</em> and that the burden it imposes on free exercise is therefore permissible.</p>\n<p>This distinction is without substance.  The immediate effects of ineligibility and disqualification are identical, and the disqualification penalty is substantial.  Moreover, <em>Sherbert</em> was given controlling weight in <em>Thomas,</em> which involved a disqualification provision similar in all relevant respects to the statutory section implicated here.  <em>See Thomas,</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/707/case.html#709">450 U. S. 709</a></span>-710, n. 1.</p>\n<p>The Appeals Commission also attempts to distinguish this case by arguing that, unlike the employees in <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas,</em> Hobbie was the "agent of change" and is therefore responsible for the consequences of the conflict between her job and her religious beliefs.  In <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas,</em> the employees held their respective religious beliefs at the time of hire; subsequent changes in the conditions of employment made <em>by the employer</em> caused the conflict between work and belief.  In this case, Hobbie\'s beliefs changed during the course of her employment, creating a conflict between job and faith that had not previously existed.  The Appeals Commission contends that</p>\n<p>"it is . . . unfair for an employee to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 480 U. S. 144</a></p><p> adopt religious beliefs that conflict with existing employment and expect to continue the employment without compromising those beliefs"</p>\n<p>and that this "intentional disregard of the employer\'s interests . . . constitutes misconduct."  Brief for Appellee Appeals Commission 20-21.</p>\n<p>In effect, the Appeals Commission asks us to single out the religious convert for different, less favorable treatment than that given an individual whose adherence to his or her faith precedes employment.  We decline to do so.  The First Amendment protects the free exercise rights of employees who adopt religious beliefs or convert from one faith to another after they are hired. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The timing of Hobbie\'s conversion is immaterial to our determination that her free exercise rights have been burdened; the salient inquiry under the Free Exercise Clause is the burden involved.  In <em>Sherbert, Thomas,</em> and the present case, the employee was forced to choose between fidelity to religious belief and continued employment; the forfeiture of unemployment benefits for choosing the former over the latter brings unlawful coercion to bear on the employee\'s choice.</p>\n<p>Finally, we reject the Appeals Commission\'s argument that the awarding of benefits to Hobbie would violate the Establishment Clause.  This Court has long recognized that the government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices, and that it may do so without violating the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="145">Page 480 U. S. 145</a></p><p> Establishment Clause. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>See, e.g., Wisconsin v. Yoder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/205/case.html">406 U.

Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/case.html">397 U. S. 664</a></span> (1970) (tax exemption for churches).  As in <em>Sherbert,</em> the accommodation at issue here does not entangle the State in an unlawful fostering of religion:</p>\n<p>"In holding as we do, plainly we are not fostering the \'establishment\' of the Seventh-day Adventist religion in South Carolina, for the extension of unemployment benefits to Sabbatarians in common with Sunday worshipers reflects nothing more than the governmental obligation of neutrality in the face of religious differences, and does not represent the involvement of religious with secular institutions which it is the object of the Establishment Clause to forestall."</p>\n<p>374 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html#409">374 U.

In his opinion, Chief Justice Burger expressly reaffirmed <em>Sherbert v. Verner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html">374 U.

The \'good cause\' standard created a mechanism for individualized exemptions.  If a state creates such a mechanism, its refusal to extend an exemption to an instance of religious hardship suggests a discriminatory intent.  Thus, as was urged in <em>Thomas,</em> to consider a religiously motivated resignation to be \'without good cause\' tends to exhibit hostility, not neutrality, towards religion. . . .  In those cases, therefore, it was appropriate to require the State to demonstrate a compelling reason for denying the requested exemption."</p>\n<p>476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html#708">476 U.

Although the purpose of the statute is to provide benefits to those persons who become "unemployed through no fault of their own," Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 443.021 (1985), Florida nonetheless views a religiously motivated choice which leads to dismissal as "misconduct connected with . . . work."  \xc2\xa7 443.101.  This scheme -- which labels and penalizes behavior dictated by religious belief as intentional misconduct -- exhibits greater hostility toward religion than one deeming such resignations to be "without good cause."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>When an employee voluntarily leaves a position without good cause attributable to the employer, he or she is disqualified from receipt of benefits for the week of the departure and until he or she becomes reemployed and earns 17 times the weekly benefit amount.  \xc2\xa7 443.101(1)(a)(1).

In <em>Thornton,</em> we held that a Connecticut statute that provided employees with an absolute right not to work on their Sabbath violated the Establishment Clause.  The Court determined that the State\'s</p>\n<p>"unyielding weighting in favor of Sabbath observers over all other interests . . . ha[d] a primary effect that impermissibly advance[d] a particular religious practice,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/703/case.html#710">472 U.

In both of those cases, the Court applied strict scrutiny analysis to a State\'s decision to deny unemployment benefits to an employee forced to leave a job because of his or her religious convictions.  In each of these cases, the Court found that the State\'s action was not justified by a compelling interest, and therefore violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  The situation in this case is remarkably similar:  The State denied Hobbie unemployment compensation, even though she was forced to leave her job because of sincerely held religious beliefs.  As the Court recognizes, there is "no meaningful distinction among the situations of <em>Sherbert, Thomas, and</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 480 U.

Accordingly, the established analysis of <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em> should apply to this case.</p>\n<p>This Court\'s decision last Term in <em>Bowen v. Roy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html">476 U. S. 693</a></span> (1986), did nothing to undercut the applicability of <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em> to the present case.  A plurality in <em>Roy</em> indicated that "some incidental neutral restraints on the free exercise of religion," such as the requirement that applicants for Social Security benefits use assigned numbers, need not be supported by a compelling justification.  476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html#712">476 U. S. 712</a></span>.  The plurality distinguished <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em> as cases where the statute at issue "created a mechanism for individualized exemptions."  476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html#708">476 U.

The plurality noted:</p>\n<p>"If a [S]tate creates such a mechanism, its refusal to extend an exemption to an instance of religious hardship suggests a discriminatory intent. . . .  In [<em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em>], therefore, it was appropriate to require the State to demonstrate a compelling reason for denying the requested exemption."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, the decision in <em>Roy</em> makes explicitly clear that its reasoning does not apply to the state conduct in this case.</p>\n<p>The Court recognizes in a footnote that the reasoning of <em>Roy</em> does not apply to this case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/136/case.html#142">480 U.

Given its context, the Court\'s rejection of <em>Roy\'s</em> reasoning is dictum.  The proper approach in this case is to apply the established precedent of <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas.</em>  Because the Court goes further, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>As the Court concludes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/136/case.html#141">480 U.

The State thus regards her "religious claims less favorably than other claims," <em>see Bowen v. Roy</em>, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html">476 U.

In such an instance, granting unemployment benefits is necessary to protect religious observers against unequal treatment.  <em>See United States v.
