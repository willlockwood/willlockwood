BELMONTES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">AYERS, ACTING WARDEN <em>v</em>. BELMONTES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x93493.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 3, 2006\xe2\x80\x94Decided November 13, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">In the penalty phase of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s capital murder trial, he introduced mitigating evidence to show, <em>inter alia,</em> that he would lead a constructive life if incarcerated rather than executed, testifying that he had done so during a previous incarceration, when he had embraced Christianity.  Two prison chaplains and his Christian sponsors from that time testified on his behalf, and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 closing arguments discussed this mitigating evidence and how the jury should consider it.  The trial judge told the jury to consider \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d an instruction known as \xe2\x80\x9cfactor (k)\xe2\x80\x9d under California\xe2\x80\x99s then-applicable statutory scheme.  Respondent was sentenced to death.  He contended, on direct review and in federal habeas proceedings, that factor (k) and the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s other instructions barred the jury from considering his forward-looking mitigation evidence in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.  The Federal District Court denied relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  On reconsideration in light of <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Payton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/133/index.html">544 U. S. 133</a>, the Ninth Circuit again invalidated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The factor (k) instruction is consistent with the constitutional right to present mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court has previously found that factor (k) does not preclude consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence, such as mitigating evidence about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s precrime background and character, <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a>, 377\xe2\x80\x93378, 386, or postcrime rehabilitation, <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Payton, supra</em>, at 135\xe2\x80\x93136, and found the proper inquiry to be \xe2\x80\x9cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Boyde, supra, </em>at 380.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0That inquiry applies here.  Like <em>Payton, </em>this case involves forward-looking evidence and comes to the Court on federal habeas proceedings, but unlike <em>Payton, </em>it was filed before the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  The Ninth Circuit distinguished <em>Payton </em>on this ground, but erred in finding a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury did not consider evidence of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential.  414 F.\xc2\xa03d 1094, 1138.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Circuit adopted a narrow and unrealistic interpretation of factor (k), ruling that \xe2\x80\x9cthis instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d 414 F.\xc2\xa03d 1094, 1134.  As <em>Boyde</em> and <em>Payton</em> explain, the jury is directed \xe2\x80\x9cto consider <em>any other circumstance</em> that might excuse the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyde, supra, </em>at 382.  Just as precrime background and character <em>(Boyde) </em>and postcrime rehabilitation <em>(Payton)</em> may \xe2\x80\x9cextenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d so may some likelihood of future good conduct count as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less deserving of the death penalty.  The Ninth Circuit failed to heed the full import of <em>Payton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, which is significant even where AEDPA is inapplicable.  Moreover, since respondent sought to extrapolate future behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation theory was more analogous to the good-character evidence <em>Boyde </em>found to fall within factor (k)\xe2\x80\x99s purview.<em> </em>Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consistent with the evidence presented to the jury, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 closing arguments, and the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s other instructions.  It is improbable that the jury believed that the parties were engaged in an exercise in futility when respondent presented extensive forward-looking evidence in open court.  Both prosecution and defense arguments assumed the evidence was relevant.  The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that the evidence was weak and his opinion about the weight it should be given confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s personal pleas were consistent with a trial in which the jury would assess his future prospects in determining what sentence to impose.  This analysis is confirmed by defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing arguments.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s other instructions make it quite implausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed from considering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s full case in mitigation.  The judge told the jury to consider all of the evidence, which included respondent\xe2\x80\x99s forward-looking mitigation case.  The sharp contrast between the aggravation instruction (only enumerated factors could be considered) and the mitigation one (listed factors were merely examples) also made clear that the jury was to take a broad view of mitigating evidence.  In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit cited juror queries as evidence of confusion.  Assuming that interpretation is correct, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presupposes what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evidence could not fall within factor (k).

A jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree and then determined he should be sentenced to death.  The issue before us concerns a jury instruction in the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court, following the statute then in effect, directed the jury, with other instructions and in a context to be discussed in more detail, to consider certain specific factors either as aggravating or mitigating.  The trial court further instructed the jury to consider \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 184.  Under the then-applicable statutory scheme this general or catchall factor was codified at Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3 (k) (West 1988); and it is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cfactor (k).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Belmontes contended, on direct review, in state collateral proceedings, and in the federal habeas proceedings giving rise to this case, that factor (k) and the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s other instructions barred the jury from considering his forward-looking mitigation evidence\xe2\x80\x94specifically evidence that he likely would lead a constructive life if incarcerated instead of executed.  The alleged limitation, in his view, prevented the jury from considering relevant mitigation evidence, in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.  See, <em>e.g., Penry</em> v. <em>Johnson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/782/index.html">532 U. S. 782</a>, 797 (2001); <em>Skipper</em> v. <em>South Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/index.html">476 U. S. 1</a>, 4\xe2\x80\x935, 8 (1986); <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 112 (1982).  The California Supreme Court, affirming the judgment and sentence, rejected this contention and other challenges.  <em>People</em> v. <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 799\xe2\x80\x93802, 819, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d 310, 341\xe2\x80\x93343, 355 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 1994, after exhausting state remedies, respondent filed an amended federal habeas petition.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California denied relief, App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a\xe2\x80\x93141a, 145a, but a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, <em>Belmontes</em> v. <em>Woodford</em>, 350 F.\xc2\xa03d 861, 908 (2003).  Over the dissent of eight judges, the Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  <em>Belmontes</em> v. <em>Woodford</em>, 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 1079 (2004).  This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Payton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/133/index.html">544 U. S. 133</a> (2005).  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Belmontes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/945/index.html">544 U. S. 945</a> (2005).  On remand, a divided panel again invalidated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence; it distinguished <em>Payton</em> on the grounds that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, though applicable in that case, does not apply here.  <em>Belmontes</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 414 F.\xc2\xa03d 1094, 1101\xe2\x80\x931102 (2005).  Over yet another dissent, the Court of Appeals again denied rehearing en banc.  <em>Belmontes</em> v. <em>Stokes</em>, 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 663 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence at trial showed that in March 1981, while burglarizing a home where two accomplices had attended a party, respondent unexpectedly encountered 19-year-old Steacy McConnell.  Respondent killed her by striking her head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar.  Respondent had armed himself with the dumbbell bar before entering the victim\xe2\x80\x99s home.  See <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d, at 760\xe2\x80\x93764, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 315\xe2\x80\x93317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the sentencing phase of his trial Belmontes introduced mitigating evidence to show, <em>inter alia</em>, that he would make positive contributions to society in a structured prison environment.  Respondent testified that, during a previous term under the California Youth Authority (CYA), he had behaved in a constructive way, working his way to the number two position on a fire crew in the CYA fire camp in which he was incarcerated.  App. 44\xe2\x80\x9345, 53.  About that time he had embraced Christianity and entered into a Christian sponsorship program.  He admitted that initially he participated in this program to spend time away from the camp.  Later, after forming a good relationship with the married couple who were his Christian sponsors, he pursued a more religious life and was baptized.  Although his religious commitment lapsed upon his release from the CYA, he testified that he would once again turn to religion whenever he could rededicate himself fully to it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 46\xe2\x80\x9348, 53\xe2\x80\x9355.  Finally, he answered in the affirmative when asked if he was \xe2\x80\x9cprepared to contribute in anyway [he] can to society if [he was] put in prison for the rest of [his] life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s former CYA chaplain testified at the sentencing hearing that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conversion appeared genuine.  The chaplain, describing respondent as \xe2\x80\x9csalvageable,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed hope that respondent would contribute to prison ministries if given a life sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79\xe2\x80\x9383.  An assistant chaplain similarly testified that, based on past experience, respondent likely would be adept at counseling other prisoners to avoid the mistakes he had made when they leave prison.  <em>Id.</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  And respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Christian sponsors testified he was like a son to them and had been a positive influence on their own son.  They also indicated he had participated in various activities at their church.  <em>Id.</em>, at 99\xe2\x80\x93103, 110\xe2\x80\x93114.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After respondent presented his mitigating evidence, the parties made closing arguments discussing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence and how the jury should consider it.  Respondent was also allowed to provide his own statement.  The trial judge included in his instructions the disputed factor (k) language, an instruction that has since been amended, see Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k) (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In two earlier cases this Court considered a constitutional challenge to the factor (k) instruction.  See <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Payton,</em> <em>supra;</em> <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a> (1990).  In <em>Boyde</em>, the Court rejected a claim that factor (k), with its focus on circumstances \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d precluded consideration of mitigating evidence unrelated to the crime, such as evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background and character.  <em>Id.,</em> at 377\xe2\x80\x93378, 386.  The \xe2\x80\x9cproper inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 380.  Since the defendant in <em>Boyde</em> \xe2\x80\x9chad an opportunity through factor (k) to argue that his background and character \xe2\x80\x98extenuated\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98excused\xe2\x80\x99 the seriousness of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court saw \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to believe that reasonable jurors would resist the view, \xe2\x80\x98long held by society,\xe2\x80\x99 that in an appropriate case such evidence would counsel imposition of a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 382 (citing <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a>, 319 (1989)).  During the sentencing phase in <em>Boyde</em>, moreover, the defense had presented extensive evidence regarding background and character, so construing factor (k) to preclude consideration of that evidence would have required the jurors not only to believe that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions transformed all of this \xe2\x80\x98favorable testimony into a virtual charade,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 494 U. S., at 383 (quoting <em>California</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/index.html">479 U. S. 538</a>, 542 (1987)), but also to disregard another instruction requiring the jury to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>consider all of the evidence</em> which has been received during any part of the trial of this case,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 494 U. S., at 383.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Payton, </em>the Court again evaluated arguments that factor (k) barred consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence\xe2\x80\x94this time, evidence relating to postcrime rehabilitation, rather than precrime background and character.  See 544 U. S., at 135\xe2\x80\x93136.  <em>Payton</em> did not come to this Court, as had <em>Boyde</em>, on direct review, but rather by federal habeas petition subject to AEDPA.  Relief was available only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of the claim \xe2\x80\x98resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Payton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 141 (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)).  Although the prosecutor in <em>Payton</em> had argued to the jury\xe2\x80\x94incorrectly\xe2\x80\x94that factor (k) did not permit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence, this Court concluded that the California Supreme Court reasonably applied <em>Boyde</em> in finding no Eighth Amendment violation.  544 U. S., at 142, 146\xe2\x80\x93147.  Accepting the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s reading would have required \xe2\x80\x9cthe surprising conclusion that remorse could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 142.  Furthermore, countering any misimpression created by the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the defense in <em>Payton</em> had presented extensive evidence and argument regarding a postcrime religious conversion and other good behavior.  The trial court had instructed the jury to consider all evidence admitted \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the prosecution itself \xe2\x80\x9cdevoted substantial attention to discounting [the postcrime evidence\xe2\x80\x99s] importance as compared to the aggravating factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 145\xe2\x80\x93146.  Hence, the state court in <em>Payton</em> could reasonably have concluded that, as in <em>Boyde</em>, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to preclude consideration of the postcrime mitigation evidence it had heard.  544 U. S., at 147.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court directed in <em>Boyde</em>, we inquire \xe2\x80\x9cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 380.  Here, as in <em>Payton</em>, respondent argues that factor (k) prevented the jury from giving effect to his forward-looking evidence.  And, as in <em>Payton</em>, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case comes to this Court in federal habeas proceedings collaterally attacking the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  Unlike in <em>Payton</em>, however, the federal petition in this case was filed before AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  AEDPA and its deferential standards of review are thus inapplicable.  See <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Garceau, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/202/index.html">538 U. S. 202</a>, 210 (2003).  The Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Payton</em> on this ground.  See 414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1101\xe2\x80\x931102.  It was mistaken, however, to find a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury did not consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1138.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred by adopting a narrow and, we conclude, an unrealistic interpretation of factor (k).  \xe2\x80\x9cMost naturally read,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cthis instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1134.  As both <em>Boyde</em> and <em>Payton</em> explain, however, this interpretation is too confined.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe instruction did not \xe2\x80\xa6 limit the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration to \xe2\x80\x98any other circumstance <em>of the crime</em> which extenuates the gravity of the crime.\xe2\x80\x99  The jury was directed to consider <em>any other circumstance</em> that might excuse the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyde</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 382; see also <em>Payton</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 141\xe2\x80\x93142.  And just as precrime background and character <em>(Boyde)</em> and postcrime rehabilitation <em>(Payton)</em> may \xe2\x80\x9cextenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d so may some likelihood of future good conduct count as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less deserving of the death penalty.  Cf. <em>Skipper</em>, 476 U. S., at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (explaining that while inferences regarding future conduct do not \xe2\x80\x9crelate specifically to [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] culpability for the crime he committed,\xe2\x80\x9d those inferences are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mitigating\xe2\x80\x99 in the sense that they might serve \xe2\x80\x98as a basis for a sentence less than death\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U.

S.,<em> </em>at 142.  So, too, would it be counterintuitive if a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to redeem himself through good works could not extenuate his offense and render him less deserving of a death sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, since respondent sought to extrapolate future behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation theory was more analogous to the good-character evidence examined in <em>Boyde</em> and held to fall within factor (k)\xe2\x80\x99s purview.  See 494 U. S., at 381 (describing the evidence at issue as including evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrength of character\xe2\x80\x9d).  Both types of evidence suggest the crime stemmed more from adverse circumstances than from an irredeemable character.

Each of these will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals recognized, future-conduct evidence was central to the mitigation case presented by the defense.  See 414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1134.  Indeed, although the defense also adduced evidence of a troubled upbringing, respondent testified that he could not use his difficult life \xe2\x80\x9cas a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m here now because of that.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 40.  Given this assertion, and considering the extensive forward-looking evidence presented at sentencing\xe2\x80\x94evidence including testimony from two prison chaplains, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s church sponsors, and respondent himself\xe2\x80\x94the jurors could have disregarded respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential only if they drew the unlikely inference that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions transformed all of this \xe2\x80\x98favorable testimony into a virtual charade,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Boyde</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 383 (quoting <em>Brown,</em> 479 U. S., at 542).  It is improbable the jurors believed that the parties were engaging in an exercise in futility when respondent presented (and both counsel later discussed) his mitigating evidence in open court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arguments by the prosecution and the defense assumed the evidence was relevant.  The prosecutor initially discussed the various factors that were to guide the jury.  He referred to factor (k) as \xe2\x80\x9ca catchall.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 153.  He then discussed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious experience in some detail.  With respect to whether this experience fit within factor (k), he indicated: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it really fits in there.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it really fits in any of them.  But I think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 154.  These seemingly contradictory statements are explained by the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s following comments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor suggested (quite understandably on the record) that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious evidence was weak.  He stated: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that the evidence upon which the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s religious experience rests is somewhat shaky.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  He also opined that the experience had to be taken \xe2\x80\x9cwith a grain of salt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 155.  The jury would have realized that, when the prosecutor suggested respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious experience did not fit within factor (k), he was discussing the persuasiveness of the evidence, not the jury\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consider it.  After all, he thought religion was \xe2\x80\x9ca proper subject of consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 154.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor then discussed how the jury should weigh respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creligious awakening\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can say it would be appropriate because\xe2\x80\x94in this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later.  You recall the people talking about how he would have the opportunity to work with other prisoners in prison.  And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in.  There\xe2\x80\x99s something to that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, the fact that someone has religion as opposed to someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t should be no grounds for either giving or withholding life.  I mean let\xe2\x80\x99s turn it around and look at the other side of the coin.  Suppose someone said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to a church and didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to a minister.  Would that man deserve to die merely because of that?  So if he says he has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that should be an influencing factor at all in that respect.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the law contemplates that and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 155.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These remarks confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential, his future \xe2\x80\x9cvalue to the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This is what respondent himself wanted it to do.  And while the prosecutor commented that the law did not contemplate jury consideration of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious conversion, respondent did not argue that the jury should consider the mere fact that he had discovered religion.  Rather, as manifested by his arguments on appeal, respondent wanted to use this religious evidence to demonstrate his future \xe2\x80\x9cvalue to the community,\xe2\x80\x9d not to illustrate his past religious awakening.  Nothing the prosecutor said would have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from even considering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious conversion, though surely the jury could discount it; and nothing the prosecutor said would have led the jury to think it could not consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential, especially since he indicated that this is exactly what the jury had \xe2\x80\x9cto weigh\xe2\x80\x9d in its deliberation.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the prosecutor concluded his arguments, the trial judge allowed respondent to speak on his own behalf.  Respondent, while not showing any remorse, suggested that life imprisonment offered \xe2\x80\x9can opportunity to achieve goals and try to better yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 163.  He also stated: \xe2\x80\x9cI myself would really like to have my life and try to improve myself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 164.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s personal pleas were consistent with a trial in which the jury would assess his future prospects in determining what sentence to impose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing arguments confirm this analysis.  To be sure, commenting on the mitigating evidence, he initially indicated: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here.  That is not the reason I asked these people to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 166.  Read in context defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s remarks did not imply the jury should ignore the mitigating evidence.  Rather, conforming to the dichotomy within factor (k) itself, his remarks merely distinguished between a legal excuse and an extenuating circumstance.  Cf. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3(k) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That defense counsel did, in fact, want the jury to take into account respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential became manifest near the end of his argument.  He suggested that the \xe2\x80\x9cpeople who came in here [and] told you about [respondent]\xe2\x80\x9d provided the jury with \xe2\x80\x9ca game plan\xe2\x80\x9d for what respondent could do with his life.  App. 170.  He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just suggesting the tip of the iceberg because who knows in 20, 30, 40, 50 years what sorts of things he can do, as he fits into the system, as he learns to set his goals, to contribute something in whatever way he can.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This would have left the jury believing it could and should contemplate respondent\xe2\x80\x99s potential.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other instructions from the trial court make it quite implausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed from considering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s full case in mitigation.  Before enumerating specific factors for consideration\xe2\x80\x94factors including the circumstances of the crime, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he presence or absence of any prior felony conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 184, as well as the factor (k) catchall\xe2\x80\x94the judge told the jury: \xe2\x80\x9cIn determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 183.  After listing the factors, he indicated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAfter having heard all of the evidence and after having heard and considered the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf you conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of death.  However, if you determine that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, you shall impose a sentence of confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 185.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge then gave a supplemental instruction regarding aggravating and mitigating factors:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI have previously read to you the list of aggravating circumstances which the law permits you to consider if you find that any of them is established by the evidence.  These are the only aggravating circumstances that you may consider.  You are not allowed to take account of any other facts or circumstances as the basis for deciding that the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr. Belmontes.  You should pay careful attention to each of these factors.  Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 185\xe2\x80\x93186.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the evidence and arguments presented to the jury, these instructions eliminate any reasonable likelihood that a juror would consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future prospects to be beyond the bounds of proper consideration.  The judge told the jury to consider \xe2\x80\x9call of the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d included respondent\xe2\x80\x99s forward-looking mitigation case.  While the judge did end his broad command to appraise all the evidence with the qualifier \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as you may be hereafter instructed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 183, he did not later instruct the jury that it should disregard respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future potential in prison.  The jury could not fairly read the limitation in the instruction to apply to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s central mitigation theory.  By contrast, in response to a juror\xe2\x80\x99s question, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury not to consider whether respondent could receive psychiatric treatment while in prison.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sharp contrast between the court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction on aggravation (that only enumerated factors could be considered) and its instruction on mitigation (that listed factors were \xe2\x80\x9cmerely \xe2\x80\xa6 examples,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 186) made it clear that the jury was to take a broad view of mitigating evidence.  Coming back to back, the instructions conveyed the message that the jury should weigh the finite aggravators against the potentially infinite mitigators.  That the trial judge told the jury to \xe2\x80\x9cpay careful attention\xe2\x80\x9d to the listed mitigating factors, <em>ibid.,</em> moreover, did not compel the jury to give them sole consideration.  For this to be the case, the jury would have had to fail to take the judge at his word.  The judge did not advise the jury to pay exclusive attention to the listed mitigating circumstances, and he had told the jury that these circumstances were simply examples.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is implausible that the jury supposed that past deeds pointing to a constructive future could not \xe2\x80\x9cextenuat[e] the gravity of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d as required by factor (k), much less that such evidence could not be considered at all.  <em>Boyde</em> concludes that in jury deliberations \xe2\x80\x9ccommonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial [is] likely to prevail over technical hairsplitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 381.  Here, far from encouraging the jury to ignore the defense\xe2\x80\x99s central evidence, the instructions supported giving it due weight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals cited queries from some of the jurors as evidence of confusion.  Although the jury\xe2\x80\x99s initial question is not in the record, it appeared to ask the judge about the consequences of failing to reach a unanimous verdict.  Cf. 414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1135.  In response, the judge reread portions of the instructions and stated that \xe2\x80\x9call 12 jurors must agree, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 190.  Before the judge sent the jury back for further deliberation, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: That is right.

Mr. Meyer?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR MEYER: A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: No.  It is not that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR MEYER: It is an either/or situation?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Exactly.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it is permissible.  Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 191.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court of Appeals decided Juror Hern\xe2\x80\x99s questions indicated she thought (incorrectly) that only listed mitigating factors were on the table\xe2\x80\x94an error, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, that should have prompted a clarifying instruction confirming that all the mitigating evidence was relevant.  414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1136.  The Court of Appeals further supposed the response to Juror Hailstone\xe2\x80\x99s question compounded the problem, since psychiatric treatment presumably would be necessary only in aid of future rehabilitation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 analysis is flawed.  To begin with, attributing to Juror Hern a dilemma over the scope of mitigation is only one way to interpret her questions, and, as the California Supreme Court observed on direct review, it is not necessarily the correct one, see <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d, at 804, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 344.  It is at least as likely that the juror was simply asking for clarification about California\xe2\x80\x99s overall balancing process, which requires juries to consider and balance enumerated factors (such as age and criminal history) that are labeled neither as mitigating nor as aggravating.  As Juror Hern surmised (but sought to clarify), the jury itself must determine the side of the balance on which each listed factor falls.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3 (providing that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account\xe2\x80\x9d any relevant listed factors); see generally <em>Tuilaepa</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/967/index.html">512 U. S. 967</a>, 978\xe2\x80\x93979 (1994) (noting that the \xc2\xa7190.3 sentencing factors \xe2\x80\x9cdo not instruct the sentencer how to weigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted Juror Hern\xe2\x80\x99s questions, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presupposes what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evidence could not fall within factor (k).  As discussed earlier, nothing barred the jury from viewing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future prospects as \xe2\x80\x9cextenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d so nothing barred it from considering such evidence under the rubric of the \xe2\x80\x9clisting.\xe2\x80\x9d  As for Juror Hailstone\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatric-care question, this inquiry shows that, if anything, the jurors were considering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s potential.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s response, far from implying a broad prohibition on forward-looking inferences, was readily explicable by the absence of any evidence in the record regarding psychiatric care.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In view of our analysis and disposition in this case it is unnecessary to address an argument for reversing the Court of Appeals based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/350/index.html"></a><a href="/us/509/350/index.html">509 U.

S. 586</a> (1978), the Court set aside Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty statute as unconstitutional because it unduly restricted the mitigating evidence that a jury could consider in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.  In his opinion announcing the judgment, Chief Justice Burger wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death.  But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty.  When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 605 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The respondent here, Fernando Belmontes, was sentenced to death in 1982, a scant four years after <em>Lockett</em>.  See <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d 310 (1988).  Yet at the time of his sentencing, there remained significant residual confusion as to whether the Constitution obligated States to permit juries to consider evidence that, while not extenuating the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for the crime, might nevertheless call for a sentence less than death.  Cf.<em> People </em>v. <em>Easley</em>, 34 Cal. 3d 858, 875\xe2\x80\x93880, 671 P.\xc2\xa02d 813, 823\xe2\x80\x93827 (1983) (noting arguments on both sides).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California death penalty statute in effect in 1982 quite plainly rested on the assumption that California could preclude the consideration of such evidence.  The statute commanded that the jury \xe2\x80\x9cshall impose\xe2\x80\x9d a death sentence if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, and limited the jury\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry to 11 discrete categories of evidence.  See Cal. Penal Code \xc2\xa7190.3 (West 1988).  Other than factors relating to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age and prior criminal record, every one of those categories relate to the severity of the crime of which the defendant was convicted.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  And while the eleventh catch-all \xe2\x80\x9cfactor (k)\xe2\x80\x9d authorized consideration of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.3(k), factor (k)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive language sent the unmistakable message that California juries could properly give no mitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the severity of the crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just a year after respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing the California Supreme Court evinced considerable discomfort with factor (k).  In <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley</em>, after discussing the possible unconstitutionality of the penalty phase instructions, the court inserted a critical footnote effectively amending factor (k) and expanding the evidence that a California jury could properly consider in deciding whether to impose a death sentence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to avoid potential misunderstanding in the future, trial courts\xe2\x80\x94in instructing on [factor (k)]\xe2\x80\x94should inform the jury that it may consider as a mitigating factor \xe2\x80\x98any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime\xe2\x80\x99 and <em>any other </em>\xe2\x80\x98<em>aspect of [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or record </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 <em>that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than </em>death.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  34 Cal. 3d, at 878, n.\xc2\xa010, 671 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 826, n. 10 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Easley</em> came too late to help respondent, the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s evident concern that capital juries must be permitted to consider evidence beyond that which \xe2\x80\x9cextenuates the gravity of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d proved prescient.  In <em>Skipper </em>v. <em>South Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/476/1/index.html">476 U. S. 1</a> (1986)\xe2\x80\x94decided two years before the California Supreme Court affirmed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and therefore fully applicable here, see <em>Griffith</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>, 322\xe2\x80\x93323 (1987)\xe2\x80\x94we expressly rejected the argument, presented in Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion, that the States retained the authority to determine what mitigating evidence is relevant \xe2\x80\x9cas long as they do not foreclose consideration of factors that may tend to reduce the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for his crime,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Skipper</em>, 476 U. S., at 11 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Apart from the traditional sentencing factors such as \xe2\x80\x9c[e]vidence concerning the degree of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the crime, or his age and emotional history,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Powell would have held that States could properly exclude evidence during a capital sentencing proceeding.  <em>Id</em>., at 13.  The majority, however, took a more expansive view.  Although it recognized that the probative force of Skipper\xe2\x80\x99s excluded evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould not relate specifically to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s culpability <em>for the crime he committed</em>, [there was] no question but that such inferences would be \xe2\x80\x98mitigating\xe2\x80\x99 in the sense that they might serve \xe2\x80\x98as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (quoting <em>Lockett</em>, 438 U. S., at 604; emphasis added).  After <em>Skipper</em>, then, the law was clear: A capital jury must be allowed to consider a broader category of mitigating evidence than normally relevant in noncapital proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was sentenced, however, before <em>Easley</em> rewrote factor (k) and before <em>Skipper</em> resolved the confusion over whether States had the constitutional latitude to restrict evidence that did not \xe2\x80\x9ctend to reduce the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for his crime,\xe2\x80\x9d 476 U. S., at 11 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  As the following review of the record will underscore, that confusion pervaded every aspect of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing hearing.  It addled the trial judge, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and\xe2\x80\x94inevitably\xe2\x80\x94the jurors themselves.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the sentencing  hearing, after the prosecution put on its case\xe2\x80\x94which consisted mainly of evidence of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s previous conduct, see <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d, at 795, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 338\xe2\x80\x93339\xe2\x80\x94respondent countered with testimony from his grandfather and his mother.  That testimony focused almost entirely on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s background: His father drank to excess and savagely beat his wife; his parents were divorced when he was 9 or 10 years old; his mother remarried, but again divorced when respondent was 14 or 15 years old; at this point respondent became difficult to control, and, in 1979, he was sent to the California Youth Authority (Youth Authority); after his release, respondent did not live with his mother, although he kept in touch with her by telephone and was very close with his 15-year-old sister.  See generally App. 5\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the jury heard testimony from Robert Martinez and his wife Darlene, both of whom testified that they were close friends with respondent but admitted that they had seen him only once after he was released from the Youth Authority.  <em>Id.,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 35.  Robert further testified that respondent was the best man at his wedding and that, prior to his wedding, the two of them would spend a lot of time together, working on Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s car, drinking beer, and smoking marijuana.  <em>Id.,</em> at  25, 28.  The focus of Darlene\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was that she was a born-again Christian, and that, when respondent visited Darlene and her husband after his release from the Youth Authority, he told her that he was also a born-again Christian.  <em>Id.,</em> at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent then testified on his own behalf.  When asked about his childhood, respondent answered that he \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t use it as a crutch to say I am in a situation right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m here now because of that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 40.  He went on to describe his relationships with his father and grandfather and to relate his experience at the Youth Authority.  <em>Id.,</em> at 41\xe2\x80\x9345.  Respondent testified that, while at the Youth Authority, he became involved in a Christian program and developed a relationship with his sponsors in that program, Beverly and Fred Haro.  <em>Id.,</em> at 46\xe2\x80\x9348.  Upon his release, however, respondent started having problems and abandoned his religious commitment, something he had not yet regained fully at the time of the sentencing hearing.  <em>Id.,</em> at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  Respondent then described his life in prison and stated that, were he given a life sentence, he would attempt to make a positive contribution to society.  <em>Id.,</em> at 55\xe2\x80\x9358.  On cross-examination, most of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s questions focused on the sincerity of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious commitment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 58\xe2\x80\x9365.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following day, respondent presented testimony from Reverend Dale Barrett and Don Miller, both ministers who worked at the Youth Authority location where respondent was held.  Reverend Barrett described the Youth Authority\xe2\x80\x99s M\xe2\x80\x932 program through which respondent was matched with the Haros.  <em>Id.,</em> at 74\xe2\x80\x9376.  He then testified about respondent\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with the church and the M\xe2\x80\x932 program, and how his interactions with respondent led him to believe that he was \xe2\x80\x9csalvageable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 76\xe2\x80\x9382.  Miller similarly testified about respondent\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the program and his belief that respondent would be adept at speaking with other prisoners about accepting religion.  <em>Id</em>., at 92, 95\xe2\x80\x9396; see also <em>id.,</em> at 96 (testifying that respondent would \xe2\x80\x9c[d]efinitely \xe2\x80\xa6 be used in the prison system for this sort of activity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the jury heard testimony from respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors in the M\xe2\x80\x932 program, Fred and Beverly Haro.  The Haros described meeting respondent and their experiences with him.  See generally <em>id.,</em> at 99\xe2\x80\x93104; 110\xe2\x80\x93112.  They also testified about how close they had grown to respondent and about respondent\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of religion.  <em>Id.,</em> at 101\xe2\x80\x93102; 112\xe2\x80\x93113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taken as a whole, the sentencing testimony supports three conclusions: first, excepting questions concerning the sincerity of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious convictions, there was no significant dispute about the credibility of the witnesses; second, little if any of the testimony extenuated the severity of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s crime; and third, the testimony afforded the jury a principled basis for imposing a sentence other than death.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor began his closing argument at the penalty phase by describing \xe2\x80\x9cth[e] listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d and instructing the jury that it must \xe2\x80\x9cweigh one against the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 148.  While he observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a proper place for sympathy and passion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., the prosecutor emphasized that the jury could only consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of sympathy the instruction tells you to consider [<em>i.e.</em>, sympathy that] naturally arises or properly arises <em>from the factors in aggravation and mitigation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 149 (emphasis added).  He repeated to the jury that its duty was to \xe2\x80\x9csimpl[y] weig[h]\xe2\x80\x9d certain factors that the judge \xe2\x80\x9cwill tell you that you may take into account,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 150\xe2\x80\x93151, and he went through those listed factors one by one, carefully discussing the evidence that supported each factor, <em>id.,</em> at 151\xe2\x80\x93157.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the prosecutor turned to factor (k), he directly addressed the theory \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s religious experience is within that catchall that relates to the defendant at the time he committed the crime, extenuates the gravity of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 154.  The prosecutor expressed doubt that the jury could consider the evidence at all, stating \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it really fits in there.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it really fits in any of them.  But I think it appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And again, after discussing the evidence supporting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious experience, the prosecutor questioned: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]s a religious awakening a basis for determining penalty?  That\xe2\x80\x99s really the issue, how much does that weigh, or does it weigh on one side or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 155.  Ultimately, the prosecutor concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can say it would be appropriate because\xe2\x80\x94in this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in.  There\xe2\x80\x99s something to that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But immediately thereafter, the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, the fact that someone has religion as opposed to someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t should be no grounds for either giving or withholding life\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. So if he says he has religion, does he deserve the other penalty, life?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that should be an influencing factor at all in that respect.  <em>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the law contemplates that and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s right</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn conclusion, the prosecutor described the circumstances of the crime and asserted that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] dreadful crime requires a dreadful penalty \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 160.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument, the trial judge allowed respondent to address the jury directly.  Respondent again stated that he could not use his childhood as a crutch to explain his mistakes, and he said that his Christianity, too, could not be used as a crutch.  <em>Id.,</em> at 162.  Respondent then asked to keep his life, explaining that he understood that he had to pay for the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death, but that he wanted the opportunity to try to improve himself in the future.  <em>Id.,</em> at 163.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, John Schick, then addressed the jury.  He made no effort to persuade the jurors that the mitigating evidence somehow extenuated the severity of the crime.  On the contrary, he said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here.  That is not the reason I asked these people to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 166.  Instead, he argued that respondent might be able to make a positive contribution in a prison environment.  He spoke about the way that respondent improved after he met Beverly and Fred Haro and about the way that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religion shaped him, observing that religion plays a \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very vital function \xe2\x80\xa6 in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But Schick took care to emphasize that religion \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not excuse\xe2\x80\x9d the murder; rather, the point of that mitigating evidence was to let the jury \xe2\x80\x9cknow something about the man.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 167, 166.  He admitted that respondent \xe2\x80\x9ccannot make it on the outside,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 167, recognized that respondent needed to be punished, and asked that the jury impose life in prison, a punishment \xe2\x80\x9cthat has meaning, that has teeth in it \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 169.  Critically, Schick contended that life in prison was an appropriate sentence because respondent could, if given the chance, \xe2\x80\x9ccontribute something in whatever way he can.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 170.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, both counsel agreed that <em>none </em>of the mitigating evidence could detract from the gravity of the crime, and defense counsel even insisted that it would \xe2\x80\x9cinsult\xe2\x80\x9d the jury to suggest that the mitigating evidence \xe2\x80\x9cexcuses in any way what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 166.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a conference on jury instructions with the two counsel, the trial judge plainly indicated that he believed that factor (k) circumscribed the mitigating evidence the jury could consider.  The judge lifted the principal jury instructions verbatim from 7 of the 11 traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute, App. 184, but he refused defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s request to give the jury a separate list of potential mitigating factors, <em>id.,</em> at 142.  Among those requested were two that specifically instructed the jury to consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform constructive work in prison and to live in confinement without acts of violence.  See Brief for Respondent 5, n.\xc2\xa01.  Those instructions would have been entirely proper\xe2\x80\x94indeed, probably mandated\xe2\x80\x94under our holding in <em>Skipper</em>.  But the prosecutor, not having the benefit of <em>Skipper</em>, argued to the judge that \xe2\x80\x9cnone [of the proposed mitigating instructions] here \xe2\x80\xa6 relates to circumstances concerning the crime.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t conceal the fact that I think that is the determinative factor in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 142.  Agreeing, the judge refused to include the mitigating instructions, making the astonishing statement that the instructions already \xe2\x80\x9cseem to be a little over-laden with the factors in mitigation rather than in aggravation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of particular importance, the judge modified defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s request that the jury be told that the instructions did not contain an exhaustive list of mitigating factors.  Id.,</em> at 141.  While he did give such an instruction, <em>ante</em>, at 12, he refused to include the following requested reference to nonstatutory factors:  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98You may also consider any other circumstances [relating to the case or the defendant, Mr. Belmontes,] as reasons for not imposing the death sentence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 25\xe2\x80\x9326; contra App. 186.  The judge thus expressly <em>declined</em> to invite the jury to weigh \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially infinite mitigators,\xe2\x80\x9d contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption today, see <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 13.  A more accurate summary of his rulings is that the jury could weigh nonstatutory circumstances\xe2\x80\x94but only if they extenuated the severity of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s offense.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next morning, the trial judge gave the jurors their instructions.  He opened with the unyielding admonition that \xe2\x80\x9c[y]ou must accept and follow the rules of law as I state them to you,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 175, and explained that he was required to read the instructions aloud even though they would have a written copy available during their deliberations, <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After reading a set of boilerplate instructions, id.,</em> at 176\xe2\x80\x93183, the judge turned to the subject of \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 183.  He told the jury to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider all of the evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>except as you may be hereafter instructed</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>. (emphasis added), and then stated: \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall consider, take into account and be guided by the following factors, if applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 183\xe2\x80\x93184.  He then proceeded to repeat verbatim 7 of the 11 factors set forth in the statute.  <em>Id.,</em> at 184.

The last of them, the factor (k) instruction, focused the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention on any circumstance that \xe2\x80\x9cextenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  No factor permitted the jury to consider \xe2\x80\x9cany other \xe2\x80\x98aspect of [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or record \xe2\x80\xa6 that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Easley</em>, 34 Cal. 3d, at 878, n.\xc2\xa010, 671 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 826, n. 10 (citing <em>Lockett</em>, 438 U. S., at 604).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Emphasizing the importance of the listing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the judge next instructed the jury that it \xe2\x80\x9cshall consider, take into account and be guided <em>by the applicable factors</em> of aggravating and mitigating circumstances <em>upon which you have been instructed</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 185 (emphasis added).  In other words, in reaching its decision, the jury was to consider each of the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable factors\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here, the seven factors the judge just finished reading\xe2\x80\x94and no others.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court points out, <em>ante</em>, at\xc2\xa013, the judge did tell the jury that \xe2\x80\x9cthe mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose \xe2\x80\xa6 a death sentence \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.<em> </em>186.  But immediately afterwards, he instructed the jury to \xe2\x80\x9cpay careful attention to each of <em>these factors</em>.  Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  Since none of \xe2\x80\x9cthese factors\xe2\x80\x9d (save for the age of the defendant) encompassed any mitigating circumstance unrelated to the severity of the crime, the most natural reading of the instruction is that any mitigating factor <em>that lessens the severity of the offense</em> may support a sentence other than death.  On this view, any other mitigating circumstance is simply irrelevant to (in the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s words) the \xe2\x80\x9csimple weighing\xe2\x80\x9d the jury was tasked with performing.  <em>Id.,</em> at 150.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Questions asked by at least six different jurors during almost two full days of deliberation gave the judge an ample opportunity to clarify that the testimony offered on behalf of respondent, if credited by the jury, provided a permissible basis for imposing a sentence other than death.  Far from eliminating their obvious confusion, his responses cemented the impression that the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 lone duty was to weigh specified, limited statutory factors against each other.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a lunch break, the judge reconvened the jury to answer a question that does not appear in the record; in response, the judge merely reread instructions telling the jury that it \xe2\x80\x9cmust agree, if [it] can\xe2\x80\x9d and that it \xe2\x80\x9cshall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances <em>upon which you have been instructed</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 185, 188\xe2\x80\x93189 (emphasis added).  Because all of those factors were traditional sentencing factors, and because none of them permitted consideration of <em>Skipper</em>-type mitigating evidence, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s response was the functional equivalent of yet another admonition to disregard most of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a colloquy between the judge and four different jurors (Hailstone, Wilson, Norton, and Huckabay) about the likelihood of reaching a unanimous verdict,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] other jurors asked the judge a series of questions reflecting a concern about whether it was proper to consider aggravating or mitigating circumstances other than those specifically listed in his instructions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR HERN:  The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT:  That was the listing, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR HERN:  Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT:  That is right.  It is a balancing process.  Mr. Meyer?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR MEYER:  A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT:  No. It is not that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR MEYER:  It is an either/or situation?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT:  Exactly. If you can make that either/or decision.  If you cannot, then I will discharge you.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJUROR HAILSTONE:  Could I ask a question?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it is permissible.  Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time? </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 191.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge\xe2\x80\x99s responses strongly suggest that the \xe2\x80\x9clisting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the listed statutory factors\xe2\x80\x94was all that the jury could properly consider when \xe2\x80\x9cbalanc[ing] the sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d  See<em> </em>n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.  But it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how evidence relating to future conduct even arguably \xe2\x80\x9cextenuate[d] the gravity of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] under factor (k), and none of those listed factors gave the jury the chance to consider whether the respondent might redeem himself in prison.  Cf. <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Payton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/133/index.html">544 U. S. 133</a>, 157 (2005) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be more than a stretch to say that the seriousness of the crime itself is affected by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent experience\xe2\x80\x9d).  And rather than inviting an open-ended review of mitigating factors that would include consideration of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possible future behavior in prison, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s answers emphasized the constraints on the \xe2\x80\x9ceither/or\xe2\x80\x9d decision the jurors had to make.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The arguments of counsel, the actual instructions to the jury, and this colloquy all support the conclusion that the jurors understood their task was to run through the listed statutory factors and weigh them against each other to determine whether respondent should be sentenced to death.  Very little of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, however, even arguably \xe2\x80\x9cextenuate[d] the gravity of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my judgment, it is for that reason much more likely than not that the jury believed that the law forbade it from giving that evidence any weight at all.  The Court of Appeals therefore correctly set aside respondent\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence.  See <em>Boyde </em>v.<em> California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a>, 380 (1990) (plurality opinion) (requiring that a defendant show only that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Boyde</em> upsets my view that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence cannot stand.  Over the dissent of four Justices, the Court in <em>Boyde</em> both adopted a new \xe2\x80\x9clegal standard for reviewing jury instructions claimed to restrict impermissibly a jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of relevant evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d 494 U. S., at 378, and approved a blatantly atextual interpretation of the unadorned factor (k) instruction, <em>id</em>., at 382, and n.\xc2\xa05.  Applying its new standard and its dubious reading of factor (k), the Court held that there was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a reasonable likelihood that Boyde\xe2\x80\x99s jurors interpreted the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to prevent consideration of mitigating evidence of background and character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 381.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court rejected Boyde\xe2\x80\x99s argument that factor (k) made it impossible for the jury to consider testimony that Boyde had won a prize for dance choreography while in prison, which Boyde argued was <em>Skipper</em>-type<em> </em>evidence relating to whether \xe2\x80\x9che could lead a useful life behind bars,\xe2\x80\x9d 494 U. S., at 382, n.\xc2\xa05.  But the Court did not hold or suggest that factor (k) allowed for the consideration of <em>Skipper</em>-type evidence.  Instead, the Court found that the evidence of his dance choreography talents was presented as part of his \xe2\x80\x9coverall strategy to portray himself <em>as less culpable</em> than other defendants due to his disadvantaged background and his character strengths,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added), and therefore fell within the ambit of factor (k).  Thus, although the <em>Boyde</em> opinion does not state so explicitly, it assumes that the factor (k) instruction would not permit the jury to consider <em>Skipper</em>-type \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of postcrime good prison behavior to show that [a defendant] would not pose a danger to the prison community if sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>Skipper</em>, 476 U. S., at 4 (recognizing that inferences regarding a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprobable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison . . . would not relate specifically to [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] culpability for the crime he committed\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Payton</em>, 544 U. S., at 164 (Souter, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Boyde</em> did not purport to hold that factor (k) naturally called\nfor consideration of postcrime changes of fundamental views\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, respondent contends that there is a reasonable likelihood that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions prevented the jury from considering precrime, forward-looking mitigation evidence regarding the possibility that he would lead a constructive life in a prison setting.  Not only does the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Boyde</em> fail to support the improbable argument that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence falls within factor (k)\xe2\x80\x99s purview, but its reasoning is entirely consistent with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 contrary conclusion. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision in <em>Payton</em> has little bearing here.  In <em>Payton</em>, we granted certiorari to decide whether the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of habeas relief \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to the limits on federal habeas review imposed by 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72254(d).\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 136.  In concluding that it was, the Court relied heavily on the deferential standard of habeas review established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.  See 544 U. S., at 141.  And Justice Breyer specifically stated that he only joined the five-Justice majority because \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a case in which Congress\xe2\x80\x99 instruction to defer to the reasonable conclusions of state-court judges makes a critical difference,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 148 (concurring opinion), explaining that, were he a California state judge, he \xe2\x80\x9cwould likely hold that Payton\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase proceedings violated the Eighth Amendment [because] there might well have been a reasonable likelihood that Payton\xe2\x80\x99s jury interpreted factor (k) in a way that prevented it from considering constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x94namely, evidence of his postcrime religious conversion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted).  The fact that <em>Payton</em> was a case about deference under AEDPA, rather than about a proper understanding of the scope of factor (k), is cause enough to conclude that it does not mandate any specific outcome here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, given that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial occurred the same year and involved the same jury instructions as Payton\xe2\x80\x99s, compare 544 U. S., at 156 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[Y]ou shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) (Souter, J., dissenting), with App. 183 (same), and because AEDPA does not apply to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case, there are persuasive reasons for concluding that Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s powerful reasoning in <em>Payton</em>, rather than the majority\xe2\x80\x99s deferential review of a California court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, should guide our decision.  In his dissenting opinion, Justice Souter pointed out that Payton\xe2\x80\x99s trial had occurred both before the California Supreme Court had directed trial judges to supplement the factor (k) instruction and before the legislature had amended it.  See 544 U. S., at 158.  Without those changes, he correctly concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cany claim that factor (k) called for consideration of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s personal development in the wake of his crime was simply at odds with common attitudes and the English language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 158\xe2\x80\x93159.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, <em>Payton</em> did not deal with a record that discloses actual confusion among jurors, as this record does.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9315. <em> </em>Nor did it involve a defense attorney who, bolstering the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s claim that factor (k) did not allow the jury to consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious conversion, refused to \xe2\x80\x9cinsult\xe2\x80\x9d the jury \xe2\x80\x9cby telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 166.  Therefore, even ignoring its significantly different procedural posture, <em>Payton</em>, like <em>Boyde</em>, falls far short of compelling the result that the Court reaches today.</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of accepting that lay jurors would almost certainly give the words \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d their ordinary meaning, the Court insists that they would have disregarded their instructions and considered evidence that had nothing whatsoever to do with the crime.  This conclusion seems to me to rest on an assumption that the jury had an uncanny ability to predict that future opinions would interpret factor (k) to mean something that neither the judge nor the lawyers thought it meant.  Surely the more natural inference is that the jury followed its instructions.  See <em>Greer</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/756/index.html">483 U. S. 756</a>, 766, n.\xc2\xa08 (1987) (plurality opinion) (describing our \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d that juries follow instructions).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s highly technical parsing of factor (k) depends on linguistic distinctions which would only occur to trained lawyers.  See, <em>e.g., ante</em>, at 11 (calling attention to the \xe2\x80\x9cdichotomy within factor (k) \xe2\x80\xa6 between a legal excuse and an extenuating circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d).  And even the lawyers are confused.  The prosecutor in <em>Payton </em>believed that \xe2\x80\x9cfactor (k) d[oes] not permit consideration of postcrime rehabilitation evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  While the majority now blithely characterizes this view as \xe2\x80\x9cincorrec[t],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, it is the natural reading of factor (k), and one that jurors would have been likely to accept.  Similarly, present-day counsel for the State of California expressed confusion at oral argument as to whether it would have been constitutional for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could not consider any mitigating evidence unless it extenuated the gravity of the crime, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (retreating from the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would appear not to be\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional).  The Court cannot seriously insist that a group of 12 laypersons had such command of constitutional law that, anticipating <em>Skipper</em>, they took into account evidence outside the ambit of their jury instructions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also apparently believes that when the prosecutor in this case suggested that factor (k) meant exactly what it said, <em>supra</em>, at 8, the jury would have taken that as merely a comment on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, <em>ante, </em>at 9.  But this rests on a clear misreading of the record.  Although the prosecutor did argue that respondent lacked sincere religious convictions, he <em>also</em> suggested quite powerfully that the law did not permit the jury to consider those convictions, however sincerely held.  See App. 155 (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the law contemplates that <em>and</em> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Nor is there any support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s surprising and inherently contradictory view that while the prosecutor here \xe2\x80\x9ccommented that the law did not contemplate jury consideration of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious conversion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[n]othing the prosecutor said</em> would have convinced the jury that it was forbidden from even considering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious conversion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>. (emphasis added). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Admittedly, as the Court points out, there is a distinction between limiting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration \xe2\x80\x9cto circumstances <em>of the crime</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that extenuate its severity, and limiting that consideration to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any other circumstance</em> that might excuse the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 7.  It is highly unlikely, however, that jurors would note that subtle distinction, and even more unlikely that they would consider it significant.  Both interpretations of the phrase focus the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the crime, and neither includes the evidence at issue in <em>Skipper</em>, which \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lmost by definition \xe2\x80\xa6 neither excuses the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime nor reduces his responsibility for its commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 12 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  Read however generously, the factor (k) limitation remains unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes a similarly unpersuasive argument based on the dubious premise that a juror would understand \xe2\x80\x9cremorse\xe2\x80\x9d to be a species of postcrime evidence that serves to lessen or excuse the crime itself.  Even if that were true, it would not follow that jurors could somehow divine that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of a capacity to redeem himself would both \xe2\x80\x9cextenuate his offense and render him less deserving of a death sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 7.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">VIII</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unless the jurors who imposed the death sentence somehow guessed at the breadth of the rule first announced in <em>Lockett, </em>that sentence was the product of an unconstitutional proceeding.  Ironically, both Chief Justice Burger (who wrote the plurality opinion in <em>Lockett</em>)<em> </em>and Justice Powell (who joined it) understood the <em>Lockett </em>rule to extend only to evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat lessens the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skipper</em>, 476 U. S., at 12 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  Given that the authors of <em>Lockett</em> themselves disagreed as to its scope, I am not as sanguine as the Court that the lay members of the jury somehow knew, notwithstanding clear jury instructions, that the testimony presented at the sentencing phase of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial could be part of the \xe2\x80\x9csimple weighing\xe2\x80\x9d the jury was supposed to undertake.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the trial judge told the jurors to consider all the evidence \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as you may be hereinafter instructed,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 183, he directed them to limit their consideration to the traditional sentencing factors set forth in the statute.  When the prosecutor told the jurors that \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the law contemplates\xe2\x80\x9d that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religion lessened the seriousness of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s offense, <em>id.,</em> at 155, he reinforced the impression that the jury should confine its deliberations to the listing.  And once defense counsel <em>agreed</em> with the prosecutor, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to insult you by telling you I think [the mitigating evidence] excuses in any way what happened here,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 166, surely at least some of the jurors would have doubted the propriety of speculating about respondent\xe2\x80\x99s future conduct in prison as a basis for imposing a sentence less than death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today heaps speculation on speculation to reach the strange conclusion, out of step with our case law, that a properly instructed jury disregarded its instructions and considered evidence that fell outside the narrow confines of factor (k).  Holding to the contrary, the Court insists, would reduce two days of sentencing testimony to \xe2\x80\x9ca virtual charade,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94but in so concluding the Court necessarily finds that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions were themselves such a \xe2\x80\x9ccharade\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury paid them no heed.  I simply cannot believe that the jurors took it upon themselves to consider testimony they were all but told they were forbidden from considering; in my view, they must at the very least have been confused as to whether the evidence could appropriately be considered.  That confusion has created a risk of error sufficient to warrant relief for a man who has spent more than half his life on death row.  Cf. <em>Lackey </em>v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1045/index.html">514 U.
