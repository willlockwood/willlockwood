Because the District Court misapplied the standard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher v.

We have since explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cas nearly as is practicable\xe2\x80\x9d standard does not require that congressional districts be drawn with \xe2\x80\x9cprecise mathematical equality,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead that the State justify population differences between districts that could have been avoided by \xe2\x80\x9ca good-faith effort to achieve absolute equality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Karcher, supra, at 730 (quoting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, \n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 526\n\xe2\x80\x93531 (1969); internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKarcher set out a two-prong test to determine whether a State\xe2\x80\x99s congressional redistricting plan meets this standard.  First, the parties challenging the plan bear the burden of proving the existence of population differences that \xe2\x80\x9ccould practicably be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 734.  If they do so, the burden shifts to the State to \xe2\x80\x9cshow with some specificity\xe2\x80\x9d that the population differences \xe2\x80\x9cwere necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 741, 740.  This burden is a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible\xe2\x80\x9d one, which \xe2\x80\x9cdepend[s] on the size of the deviations, the importance of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alterna- tives that might substantially vindicate those interests yet approximate population equality more closely.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 741.  As we recently reaffirmed, redistricting \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perry v. Perez, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4).  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are willing to defer to [such] state legislative policies, so long as they are consistent with constitutional norms, even if they require small differences in the population of congressional districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Karcher, supra, at 740.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, plaintiffs claim that West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting plan, adopted following the 2010 decennial United States census, violates Article\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, of the United States Constitution and, separately, the West Virginia Constitution.  The 2010 census did not alter West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of three congressional seats.  But due to popula- tion shifts within the State, West Virginia nonetheless began redistricting to comply with the requirements in our precedents.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn August 2011, the West Virginia Legislature convened an extraordinary session, and the State Senate formed a 17-member Select Committee on Redistricting.  The committee first considered a redistricting plan championed by its chair, Majority Leader John Unger, and dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cthe Perfect Plan\xe2\x80\x9d because it achieved a population difference of a single person between the largest and smallest districts.  That appears, however, to have been the only perfect aspect of the Perfect Plan.  State legislators expressed concern that the plan contravened the State\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding rule against splitting counties, placed two incumbents\xe2\x80\x99 residences in the same district, and moved one-third of the State\xe2\x80\x99s population from one district to another.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe following day, members of the Redistricting Committee introduced seven additional plans.  The committee eventually reported to the full Senate the eighth proposal, referred to as S. B. 1008.  The full Senate rejected a ninth proposal offered as an amendment on the floor and adopted S. B. 1008 by a vote of 27 to 4.  The House of Delegates approved the bill without debate by a vote of 90 to 5.  Governor Earl Tomblin signed the bill into law on August 18, 2011.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tS. B. 1008, codified at W.\xc2\xa0Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x933 (Lexis 2012 Supp.), does not split county lines, redistrict incumbents into the same district, or require dramatic shifts in the population of the current districts.  Indeed, S. B. 1008\xe2\x80\x99s chief selling point was that it required very little change to the existing districts: It moved just one county, representing 1.5% of the State\xe2\x80\x99s population, from one district to another.  This was the smallest shift of any plan considered by the legislature.  S. B. 1008, however, has a population variance of 0.79%, the second highest variance of the plans the legislature considered.  That is, the population difference between the largest and smallest districts in S. B. 1008 equals 0.79% of the population of the average district.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Jefferson County Commission and two of its county commissioners sued to enjoin the State from implementing S. B. 1008.  At trial, the State conceded that it could have adopted a plan with lower population variations.  The State argued, however, that legitimate state policies justified the slightly higher variances in S. B. 1008, citing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement from Karcher that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, making districts com- pact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 740.  The State noted Karcher\xe2\x80\x99s approving reference to a District Court opinion upholding a previous West Virginia redistricting plan with a population variance of 0.78%\xe2\x80\x94virtually identical to the variance in S. B. 1008.  See id., at 740\xe2\x80\x93741 (citing West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v. Rockefeller, 336 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 395 (SD W.\xc2\xa0Va. 1972)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court nonetheless granted the injunction, holding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted objectives did not justify the population variance.  With respect to the objective of not splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged that West Virginia had never in its history divided a county between two or more congressional districts.  The court speculated, however, that the practice of other States dividing counties between districts \xe2\x80\x9cmay portend the eventual deletion\xe2\x80\x9d of respecting such boundaries as a potentially legitimate justification for population variances.  App. to Juris. Statement 15, n.\xc2\xa06.  The court also faulted the West Virginia Legislature for failing \xe2\x80\x9cto create a contemporaneous record sufficient to show that S. B. 1008\xe2\x80\x99s entire 4,871-person variance\xe2\x80\x94or even a discrete, numerically precise portion thereof\xe2\x80\x94was attributable\xe2\x80\x9d to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in respecting county boundaries and noted that several other plans under consideration also did not split counties.  Id., at 15, 16.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe court further questioned the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that S. B. 1008 best preserved the core of existing districts.  Preserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, involved respecting the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests common to the population of the area,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, 207 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1280, 1286 (Kan. 2002)), not a \xe2\x80\x9cdogged insistence that change be minimized for the benefit of the delicate citi- zenry,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Juris. Statement 20.  The District Court concluded that although acclimating to a new congressional district and Congressperson \xe2\x80\x9cmay give rise to a modicum of anxiety and inconvenience, avoiding constituent discomfort at the margins is not among those policies recognized in Karcher as capable of legitimizing a variance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith respect to preventing contests between incumbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for failing to build a record \xe2\x80\x9clinking all or a specific part of the variance\xe2\x80\x9d to that asserted interest.  Id., at 22.  And the District Court found that although 0.79% was a minor variation when Karcher was decided, the feasibility of achieving smaller variances due to improved technology meant that the same variance must now be considered major.  Because the District Court concluded that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional under Article\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, it did not reach plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenges under the West Virginia Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tChief Judge Bailey dissented.  He argued that the record demonstrated the legitimacy of the State\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, and that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well as S. B. 1008.  He also took issue with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s disregard for Karcher\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of 0.78% as an acceptable disparity.  App. to Juris. Statement 39.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe stayed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order pending appeal to this Court, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), and now reverse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven the State\xe2\x80\x99s concession that it could achieve smaller population variations, the remaining question under Kar- cher is whether the State can demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9cthe population deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 740.  Considering, as Karcher instructs, \xe2\x80\x9cthe size of the deviations, the importance of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alternatives that might substan- tially vindicate those interests,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 741, it is clear that West Virginia has carried its burden.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs an initial matter, the District Court erred in concluding that improved technology has converted a \xe2\x80\x9cminor\xe2\x80\x9d variation in Karcher into a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor\xe2\x80\x9d variation today.  Nothing about technological advances in redistricting and mapping software has, for example, decreased population variations between a State\xe2\x80\x99s counties.  See id., at 733, n.\xc2\xa05.  Thus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will inevitably have population variations between districts reflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un- evenly populated counties.  Despite technological advances, a variance of 0.79% results in no more (or less) vote dilution today than in 1983, when this Court said that such a minor harm could be justified by legitimate state objectives.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding contests between incumbents and not splitting political subdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies.  See, e.g., id., at 740.  The majority cited no precedent for requiring legislative findings on the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete, numerically precise portion\xe2\x80\x9d of the variance attributable to each factor, and we are aware of none.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court dismissed the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in limiting the shift of population between old and new districts as \xe2\x80\x9cham-handed,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 19, because the State considered only \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete bounds of geography,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests common to the population of the area.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Id., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, supra, at 1286).  According to the District Court, that did not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cpreserving the cores of prior districts\xe2\x80\x9d under Karcher, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 740\xe2\x80\x93741.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRegardless of how to read that language from Karcher, however, our opinion made clear that its list of possible justifications for population variations was not exclusive.  See id., at 740 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, . . .\xe2\x80\x9d).  The desire to minimize population shifts between districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy.  See, e.g., Turner v. Arkansas, 784 F. Supp. 585, 588\xe2\x80\x93589 (ED Ark. 1991), summarily aff\xe2\x80\x99d, \n\n504 U. S. 952 (1992)\n.  S.\xc2\xa0B. 1008 achieves significantly lower population shifts than the alternative plans\xe2\x80\x94more than four times lower than the closest alternative, and more than 25 times lower than others.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNone of the alternative plans came close to vindicating all three of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate objectives while achieving a lower variance.  All other plans failed to serve at least one objective as well as S. B. 1008 does; several were worse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan failed as to all three of the State\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  See App. to Juris. Statement 43\xe2\x80\x9345.  This is not to say that anytime a State must choose between serving an additional le- gitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may choose the former.  But here, given the small \xe2\x80\x9csize of the deviations,\xe2\x80\x9d as balanced against \xe2\x80\x9cthe importance of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lack of available \xe2\x80\x9calternatives that might substantially vindicate those in- terests yet approximate population equality more closely,\xe2\x80\x9d Karcher, supra, at 741, S.
