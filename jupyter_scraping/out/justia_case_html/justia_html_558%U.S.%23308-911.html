S. 1</a>, ___.  Federal-court review of administrative decisions denying motions to reopen removal proceedings dates back to at least 1916, with the courts employing a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review.  While the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s regulation in point, 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(a), places the reopening decision within the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, the statute does not codify that prescription or otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cspecif[y]\xe2\x80\x9d that such decisions are in the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.

She comprehends \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cauthority \xe2\x80\xa6 specified under this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d to mean, <em>e.g., </em>\xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csubordinate to.\xe2\x80\x9d  Administrative regulations count for \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, because they are issued \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to,\xe2\x80\x9d and are measures \xe2\x80\x9csubordinate to,\xe2\x80\x9d the legislation they serve to implement.  On that reading, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an executive regulation places within the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, including the decision to deny a motion to reopen.  The parties, on the other hand, read the statutory language to mean \xe2\x80\x9cspecified in,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cspecified by,\xe2\x80\x9d the subchapter.  On their reading, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary character of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chas many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ardestani</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/index.html">502 U. S. 129</a>, 135.  Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 position stands on firmer ground.  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far from IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s only jurisdictional limitation.  It is sandwiched between two subsections, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(A) and \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(C), both dependent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their scope.  Given \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory placement, one would expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review category \xe2\x80\x9cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\xe2\x80\x9d  Each of the referenced statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is entrusted to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  Clause (i) does not refer to any regulatory provision.  The proximity of clause (i) and the clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cany other decision\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre, <em>i.e.</em>, those made discretionary by legislation.  Read harmoniously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary authority in the statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0Also significant is the character of the decisions insulated from judicial review in \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(i).  The listed determinations are substantive decisions the Executive makes involving whether or not aliens can stay in the country.  Other decisions specified by statute \xe2\x80\x9cto be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore shielded from court oversight by \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71157(c)(1).  Decisions on reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings.  A court decision reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and concerns only the question whether the alien\xe2\x80\x99s claims have been accorded a reasonable hearing.  Had Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regulation as well as by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have said so, as it did in provisions enacted simultaneously with \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  See, <em>e.g., </em>IIRIRA, \xc2\xa7213, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93572.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(5)\xc2\xa0The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates this determination.  Attorney General regulations have long addressed reopening requests.  In enacting IIRIRA, Congress simultaneously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding removal.  But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the BIA discretion to grant or deny reopening motions.  This legislative silence indicates that Congress left the matter where it was pre-IIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney General, \xe2\x80\x9cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(a), but courts retain jurisdiction to review the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  It is unsurprising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this \xe2\x80\x9cimportant [procedural] safeguard,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dada</em>, 554 U. S., at ___, where, as here, the alien\xe2\x80\x99s underlying asylum claim would itself be reviewable.  The REAL ID Act of 2005, which further amended the INA by adding or reformulating provisions on asylum, protection from removal, and even judicial review, did not disturb the unbroken line of decisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions to reopen.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Any lingering doubt about \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s proper interpretation would be dispelled by a familiar statutory construction principle: the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.  When a statute is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably susceptible to divergent interpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court adopts the reading \xe2\x80\x9cthat executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gutierrez de Martinez</em> v. <em>Lamagno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/417/index.html">515 U. S. 417</a>, 434.  The Court has consistently applied this interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and particularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/43/index.html">509 U. S. 43</a>, 63\xe2\x80\x9364.  Because this presumption is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98well-settled,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>the Court assumes that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress legislates with knowledge of\xe2\x80\x9d it, <em>McNary</em> v. <em>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/479/index.html">498 U. S. 479</a>, 496.  It therefore takes \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to dislodge the presumption.  <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc.,</em> 509 U. S., at 64.  There is no such evidence here.  Finally, reading \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would ignore Congress\xe2\x80\x99 design to retain for itself control over federal-court jurisdiction.  The Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction would free the Executive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such an extraordinary delegation of authority cannot be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the motion, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) sustained the IJ\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the administrative determination.  For that conclusion, the court relied on a provision added to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA or Act), 66 Stat. 166, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq</em>., by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93546.  The provision found dispositive by the Seventh Circuit, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B), states that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any action of the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority for which is <em>specified under this subchapter</em> to be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to decide whether the proscription of judicial review stated in \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B) applies not only to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute, but also to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation.  We hold that the key words \xe2\x80\x9cspecified under this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d refer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications.  We so rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial review of administrative rulings on reopening motions, the text and context of \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B), and the history of the relevant statutory provisions.  We take account, as well, of the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to] allow judicial review of administrative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/509/43/index.html">509 U.

Congress also prescribed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(C)(i).

Alleging that he would be persecuted based on his political beliefs if returned to Albania, Kucana applied for asylum and withholding of removal in 1996.  An IJ determined that Kucana was removable and scheduled a hearing to evaluate his eligibility for asylum.  When Kucana failed to appear for the hearing, the IJ immediately ordered his removal <em>in absentia</em>.  Kucana filed a motion to reopen, explaining that he had missed his hearing because he had overslept.  The IJ denied the motion, and the BIA affirmed in 2002.  Kucana did not seek judicial review, nor did he leave the United States.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kucana filed a second motion to reopen his removal proceedings in 2006, contending that conditions in Albania had worsened.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The BIA denied relief; it concluded that conditions in Albania had actually improved since 1997.

The word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is chameleon; it \xe2\x80\x9chas many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ardestani</em>, 502 U.

See <em>Dada</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn reading a statute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but consider in connection with it the whole statute.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/index.html">489 U.

Section 1252(a)(2), titled \xe2\x80\x9cMatters not subject to judicial review,\xe2\x80\x9d lists a variety of agency determinations the federal courts lack jurisdiction to review.  Those determinations divide into three categories.  The first, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(A), concerns immigration officers\xe2\x80\x99 determinations whether aliens applying for admission are admissible.  Next in statutory order is the provision before us, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B), which involves denials of discretionary relief.  The last category, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(C), concerns final orders of removal entered against criminal aliens.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(A) and \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(C) depend on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their scope.  The latter provision, the criminal alien bar, precludes judicial review of \xe2\x80\x9cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71182(a)(2), \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), or certain offenses covered in \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(ii).  All the defining references are statutory; none invokes a regulation.  The same holds for the admissibility bar in \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(A).  Given \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory placement, sandwiched between subsections (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(C), one would expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Focusing on \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B), we note the lead line serving to introduce both of the subparagraph\xe2\x80\x99s two clauses: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clause (i) then places within the no-judicial-review category \xe2\x80\x9cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\xe2\x80\x9d  Each of the statutory provisions referenced in clause (i) addresses a different form of discretionary relief from removal, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa02, and each contains language indicating that the decision is entrusted to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71182(h) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive [inadmissibility based on certain criminal offenses].\xe2\x80\x9d).  Clause (i) does not refer to any regulatory provision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the clause (i) enumeration of administrative judgments that are insulated from judicial review, Congress added in clause (ii) a catchall provision covering \xe2\x80\x9cany other decision \xe2\x80\xa6 the authority for which is specified under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  The proximity of clauses (i) and (ii), and the words linking them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cany other decision\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre, <em>i.e.</em>, those made discretionary by legislation.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The clause (i) enumeration, we find, is instructive in determining the meaning of the clause (ii) catchall.  Read harmoniously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary authority in the statute.  See <em>Hall Street Associates, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.</em> v. <em>Mattel, Inc.</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also find significant the character of the decisions Congress enumerated in \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(i), thereby insulating them from judicial review.  As the Government explained at oral argument, the determinations there listed are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive decisions \xe2\x80\xa6 made by the Executive in the immigration context as a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens can stay in the country or not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  They include waivers of inadmissibility based on certain criminal offenses, \xc2\xa71182(h), or based on fraud or misrepresentation, \xc2\xa71182(i); cancellation of removal, \xc2\xa71229b; permission for voluntary departure, \xc2\xa71229c; and adjustment of status, \xc2\xa71255.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other decisions specified by statute \xe2\x80\x9cto be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore shielded from court oversight by \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71157(c)(1) (discretion to admit refugees \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71181(b) (discretion to waive requirement of documentation for readmission); \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(D)(iv) (discretion to waive, in certain cases, inadmissibility of aliens who have affiliated with a totalitarian party).  Decisions on reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings: The motion to reopen is a procedural device serving to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cthat aliens [a]re getting a fair chance to have their claims heard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.  A court decision reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and concerns only the question whether the alien\xe2\x80\x99s claims have been accorded a reasonable hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regulation along with those made discretionary by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have said so.  In other provisions enacted simultaneously with \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress expressed precisely that meaning.  See IIRIRA, \xc2\xa7213, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93572 (\xe2\x80\x9cimmigration benefits pursuant to this Act; or the regulations promulgated thereunder\xe2\x80\x9d), codified at 8 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a)(10).  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates our determination that \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not proscribe judicial review of denials of motions to reopen.  Attorney General regulations have long addressed reopening requests.  See 6 Fed. Reg. 71\xe2\x80\x9372 (1941).  The current regulations, adopted in 1996, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904\xe2\x80\x9318906, derive from rules published in 1958, see 23 Fed. Reg. 9118\xe2\x80\x939119; <em>Dada</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Enacting IIRIRA in 1996, Congress \xe2\x80\x9ctransform[ed] the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 12).  IIRIRA largely codified the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s directions on filing reopening motions.  See \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) (guaranteeing right to file one motion, prescribing contents, and setting deadlines).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the same legislation, Congress amended the INA aggressively to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal basis to remain in the United States.  See <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/471/index.html">525 U. S. 471</a>, 475 (1999).  Among IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s several proscriptions of judicial review is the one here at issue, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), barring review of administrative decisions Congress placed within the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress thus simultaneously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding removal.  But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the BIA discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(a) (reopening may be entertained not only on application; Board \xe2\x80\x9cmay at any time reopen \xe2\x80\xa6 on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision\xe2\x80\x9d).  Had Congress elected to insulate denials of motions to reopen from judicial review, it could have so specified together with its codification of directions on filing reopening motions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s silence on the discretion of the Attorney General (or his delegate, the Board) over reopening motions, see <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa010, we take it that Congress left the matter where it was pre-IIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney General, \xe2\x80\x9cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(a), but courts retain jurisdiction to review, with due respect, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  It is unsurprising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this \xe2\x80\x9cimportant [procedural] safeguard\xe2\x80\x9d designed \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure a proper and lawful disposition\xe2\x80\x9d of immigration proceedings, <em>Dada</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316), where, as here, the alien\xe2\x80\x99s underlying claim (for asylum) would itself be reviewable.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the REAL ID Act, Congress further amended the INA.  By 2005, two Courts of Appeals had already ruled that 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not preclude them from reviewing denials of motions to reopen, see <em>Infanzon</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 386 F.\xc2\xa03d 1359, 1361\xe2\x80\x931362 (CA10 2004); <em>Medina-Morales</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 371 F.\xc2\xa03d 520, 528\xe2\x80\x93529 (CA9 2004), and no court had reached a contrary result.  Although adding or reformulating provisions on asylum, \xc2\xa7101(a), (b), 119 Stat. 302\xe2\x80\x93303, protection from removal, \xc2\xa7101(c), (d), <em>id., </em>at 303\xe2\x80\x93305, even judicial review, \xc2\xa7106, <em>id., </em>at 310\xe2\x80\x93311, the REAL ID Act did not disturb the unbroken line of decisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions to reopen.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; <em>supra</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa01.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any lingering doubt about the proper interpretation of 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be dispelled by a familiar principle of statutory construction: the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.  When a statute is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably susceptible to divergent interpretation, we adopt the reading that accords with traditional understandings and basic principles: that executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gutierrez de Martinez</em> v. <em>Lamagno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/417/index.html">515 U. S. 417</a>, 434 (1995).  We have consistently applied that interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and particularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 298 (2001); <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc.</em>, 509 U. S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364; <em>McNary</em>, 498 U. S., at 496.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to] allow judicial review of administrative action\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cwell-settled,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc.</em>, 509 U. S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364 (quoting <em>McNary</em>, 498 U. S., at 496), the Court assumes that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress legislates with knowledge of\xe2\x80\x9d the presumption, <em>id.,</em> at 496.  It therefore takes \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d to dislodge the presumption.  <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc.,</em> 509 U. S., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted).  There is no such evidence here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we stress a paramount factor in the decision we render today.  By defining the various jurisdictional bars by reference to other provisions in the INA itself, Congress ensured that it, and only it, would limit the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  To read \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters where discretion is conferred on the Board by regulation, rather than on the Attorney General by statute, would ignore that congressional design.  If the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) were to prevail, the Executive would have a free hand to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such an extraordinary delegation of authority cannot be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A statute affecting federal jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cmust be construed both with precision and with fidelity to the terms by which Congress has expressed its wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cheng Fan Kwok</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/206/index.html">392 U.

The controlling statutory provision, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), states that \xe2\x80\x9cno court shall have jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\xa6 any \xe2\x80\xa6 decision \xe2\x80\xa6 of the Attorney General \xe2\x80\xa6 the authority for which is specified <em>under this subchapter</em> to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d refers to Subchapter II of Chapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71151\xe2\x80\x931381, see<em> ante</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa03, and, as the Court notes, no provision of Subchapter II confers discretionary authority on the Attorney General to decide motions to reopen.  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938, 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  The Court of Appeals, however, held that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case was unreviewable because a regulation, 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(a) (2009), made that decision discretionary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If this regulation had been promulgated pursuant to authority conferred by a provision of Subchapter II, we would have to confront the question that the opinion of the Court addresses.  But it seems clear that 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2, at least insofar as it gave the Attorney General the discretionary authority that he exercised in this case, is grounded on authority conferred under <em>Subchapter I</em> of Chapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101\xe2\x80\x931107.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a) (1994 ed.)

Code]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>amicus curiae</em> whom we appointed to defend the decision of the Court of Appeals has attempted to link 8 CFR<em> </em>\xc2\xa71003.2 to Subchapter II.  She notes that the Attorney General, in promulgating that regulation, cited not only 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a), but also a provision of Subchapter II, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252b (1994 ed.).  See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900, 18904 (1996).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  This latter statutory provision[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] conferred the authority to reopen a narrow set of deportation orders, <em>i.e.</em>, those issued after the alien failed to appear at the deportation hearing.  Although this statutory provision does not apply to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen, <em>amicus</em> argues that \xe2\x80\x9cthe section\xe2\x80\x99s brief allusion to motions to reopen clearly presupposed that the Attorney General had in place a more general procedure for reviewing all motions to reopen removal proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Court-Appointed <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in Support of Judgment Below 41\xe2\x80\x9342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em> </em>argument is ingenious but ultimately unpersuasive.  At most, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252b (1994 ed.) may be read as implicitly authorizing the promulgation of a regulation giving the Attorney General the discretion to reopen certain deportation orders that were issued in absentia.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second motion to reopen, however, seeks reopening on grounds outside of \xc2\xa71252b, and therefore 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2, insofar as it applies to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case, was not issued pursuant to Subchapter II and does not implement any provision of that Subchapter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, this case can and should be decided on the narrow ground that, even if some regulations can render a decision of the Attorney General unreviewable, the regulation at issue in this case does not have that effect.  </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Two other provisions in Subchapter II refer to motions to reopen, but both were enacted after the implementation of 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2 (2009), and therefore that regulation cannot be said to implement these provisions.

As the Government notes, this provision does not apply in this case because petitioner challenges the denial of his second motion to reopen, which the parties agree is governed by \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7).
