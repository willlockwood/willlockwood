Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstop and identify\xe2\x80\x9d statute requires a person detained by an officer under suspicious circumstances to identify himself.  The state intermediate appellate court affirmed, rejecting Hiibel\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the state law\xe2\x80\x99s application to his case violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction does not violate his Fourth Amendment rights or the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on self-incrimination.

They vary from State to State, but all permit an officer to ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity.  In <em>Papachristou</em> v. <em>Jacksonville,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/156/index.html">405 U. S. 156</a>, 167\xe2\x80\x93171, this Court invalidated a traditional vagrancy law for vagueness because of its broad scope and imprecise terms.  The Court recognized similar constitutional limitations in <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/47/index.html">443 U. S. 47</a>, 52, where it invalidated a conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statute on Fourth Amendment grounds, and in <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/index.html">461 U. S. 352</a>, where it invalidated on vagueness grounds California\xe2\x80\x99s modified stop and identify statute that required a suspect to give an officer \xe2\x80\x9ccredible and reliable\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d identification when asked to identify himself, <em>id., </em>at 360.  This case begins where those cases left off.  Here, the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in <em>Brown</em>.  Further, Hiibel has not alleged that the Nevada statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in <em>Kolender</em>.  This statute is narrower and more precise.  In contrast to the \xe2\x80\x9ccredible and reliable\xe2\x80\x9d identification requirement in <em>Kolender,</em> the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted the instant statute to require only that a suspect disclose his name.  It apparently does not require him to produce a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or any other document.  If he chooses either to state his name or communicate it to the officer by other means, the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs<em>.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct did not violate Hiibel\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights.  Ordinarily, an investigating officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Amendment.  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Delgado,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/210/index.html">466 U. S. 210</a>, 216.  Beginning with <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a>, the Court has recognized that an officer\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable suspicion that a person may be involved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop the person for a brief time and take additional steps to investigate further.  Although it is well established that an officer may ask a suspect to identify himself during a <em>Terry</em> stop, see, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Hensley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/221/index.html">469 U. S. 221</a>, 229, it has been an open question whether the suspect can be arrested and prosecuted for refusal to answer, see <em>Brown, supra</em>, at 53, n.\xc2\xa03.  The Court is now of the view that <em>Terry</em> principles permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a <em>Terry</em> stop.  <em>Terry, supra,</em> at 34.  The Nevada statute is consistent with Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures because it properly balances the intrusion on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s interests against the promotion of legitimate government interests.  See <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Prouse,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/index.html">440 U. S. 648</a>, 654.  An identity request has an immediate relation to the <em>Terry</em> stop\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, rationale, and practical demands, and the threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request does not become a legal nullity.  On the other hand, the statute does not alter the nature of the stop itself, changing neither its duration nor its location.  Hiibel argues unpersuasively that the statute circumvents the probable-cause requirement by allowing an officer to arrest a person for being suspicious, thereby creating an impermissible risk of arbitrary police conduct.  These familiar concerns underlay <em>Kolender,</em> <em>Brown</em>, and <em>Papachristou.  </em>They are met by the requirement that a <em>Terry</em> stop be justified at its inception and be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified\xe2\x80\x9d the initial stop.  <em>Terry</em>, 392 U. S., at 20.  Under those principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identify himself if the identification request is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop.  Cf. <em>Hayes</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/811/index.html">470 U. S. 811</a>, 817.  The request in this case was a commonsense inquiry, not an effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after a <em>Terry</em> stop yielded insufficient evidence.  The stop, the request, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of a response did not contravene the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Hiibel\xe2\x80\x99s contention that his conviction violates the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on self-incrimination fails because disclosure of his name and identity presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.  The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimony that is incriminating, see <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Walker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/161/591/index.html">161 U. S. 591</a>, 598, and protects only against disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used, <em>Kastigar</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/index.html">406 U. S. 441</a>, 445.  Hiibel\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to disclose was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it would furnish evidence needed to prosecute him.  <em>Hoffman</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/341/479/index.html">341 U. S. 479</a>, 486.  It appears he refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s business.  While the Court recognizes his strong belief that he should not have to disclose his identity, the Fifth Amendment does not override the Nevada Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that the disclosure would tend to incriminate him.  Answering a request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant as to be incriminating only in unusual circumstances.  See, <em>e.g., Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs.</em> v. <em>Bouknight,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/index.html">493 U. S. 549</a>, 555.  If a case arises where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense, the court can then consider whether the Fifth Amendment privilege applies, whether it has been violated, and what remedy must follow.  Those questions need not be resolved here.  10\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">118 Nev. 868, 59 P. 2d 1201, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Scalia,<em> </em>and Thomas, JJ., joined.

S. 1</a> (1968).  He challenges his conviction under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department in Humboldt County, Nevada, received an afternoon telephone call reporting an assault.  The caller reported seeing a man assault a woman in a red and silver GMC truck on Grass Valley Road.  Deputy Sheriff Lee Dove was dispatched to investigate.  When the officer arrived at the scene, he found the truck parked on the side of the road.  A man was standing by the truck, and a young woman was sitting inside it.  The officer observed skid marks in the gravel behind the vehicle, leading him to believe it had come to a sudden stop.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officer approached the man and explained that he was investigating a report of a fight.  The man appeared to be intoxicated.  The officer asked him if he had \xe2\x80\x9cany identification on [him],\xe2\x80\x9d which we understand as a request to produce a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or some other form of written identification.  The man refused and asked why the officer wanted to see identification.  The officer responded that he was conducting an investigation and needed to see some identification.  The unidentified man became agitated and insisted he had done nothing wrong.  The officer explained that he wanted to find out who the man was and what he was doing there.  After continued refusals to comply with the officer\xe2\x80\x99s request for identification, the man began to taunt the officer by placing his hands behind his back and telling the officer to arrest him and take him to jail.  This routine kept up for several minutes: the officer asked for identification 11 times and was refused each time.  After warning the man that he would be arrested if he continued to refuse to comply, the officer placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now know that the man arrested on Grass Valley Road is Larry Dudley Hiibel.  Hiibel was charged with \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully resist[ing], delay[ing], or obstruct[ing] a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) \xc2\xa7199.280 (2003).  The government reasoned that Hiibel had obstructed the officer in carrying out his duties under \xc2\xa7171.123, a Nevada statute that defines the legal rights and duties of a police officer in the context of an investigative stop.  Section 171.123 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c1. Any peace officer may detain any person whom the officer encounters under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime.</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c3. The officer may detain the person pursuant to this section only to ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad.  Any person so detained shall identify himself, but may not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of any peace officer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hiibel was tried in the Justice Court of Union Township.  The court agreed that Hiibel\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to identify himself as required by \xc2\xa7171.123 \xe2\x80\x9cobstructed and delayed Dove as a public officer in attempting to discharge his duty\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of \xc2\xa7199.280.  App. 5.  Hiibel was convicted and fined $250.  The Sixth Judicial District Court affirmed, rejecting Hiibel\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the application of \xc2\xa7171.123 to his case violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  On review the Supreme Court of Nevada rejected the Fourth Amendment challenge in a divided opinion.  118 Nev. 868, 59 P.\xc2\xa03d 1201 (2002).  Hiibel petitioned for rehearing, seeking explicit resolution of his Fifth Amendment challenge.  The petition was denied without opinion.

The statutes vary from State to State, but all permit an officer to ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity.  A few States model their statutes on the Uniform Arrest Act, a model code that permits an officer to stop a person reasonably suspected of committing a crime and \xe2\x80\x9cdemand of him his name, address, business abroad and whither he is going.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warner, The Uniform Arrest Act, 28 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 315, 344 (1942).  Other statutes are based on the text proposed by the American Law Institute as part of the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Model Penal Code.  See ALI, Model Penal Code, \xc2\xa7250.6, Comment 4, pp. 392\xe2\x80\x93393 (1980).  The provision, originally designated \xc2\xa7250.12, provides that a person who is loitering \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime commits a violation if he refuses the request of a peace officer that he identify himself and give a reasonably credible account of the lawfulness of his conduct and purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7250.12 (Tentative Draft No. 13) (1961).  In some States, a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to identify himself is a misdemeanor offense or civil violation; in others, it is a factor to be considered in whether the suspect has violated loitering laws.  In other States, a suspect may decline to identify himself without penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stop and identify statutes have their roots in early English vagrancy laws that required suspected vagrants to face arrest unless they gave \xe2\x80\x9ca good Account of themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d 15 Geo. 2, ch.\xc2\xa05, \xc2\xa72 (1744), a power that itself reflected common-law rights of private persons to \xe2\x80\x9carrest any suspicious night-walker, and detain him till he give a good account of himself \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch.\xc2\xa013, \xc2\xa76, p.\xc2\xa0130. (6th ed. 1787).  In recent decades, the Court has found constitutional infirmity in traditional vagrancy laws.  In <em>Papachristou</em> v. <em>Jacksonville,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/156/index.html">405 U. S. 156</a> (1972), the Court held that a traditional vagrancy law was void for vagueness.  Its broad scope and imprecise terms denied proper notice to potential offenders and permitted police officers to exercise unfettered discretion in the enforcement of the law.  See<em> id</em>., at 167\xe2\x80\x93171.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has recognized similar constitutional limitations on the scope and operation of stop and identify statutes.  In <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/47/index.html">443 U. S. 47</a>, 52 (1979), the Court invalidated a conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statute on Fourth Amendment grounds.  The Court ruled that the initial stop was not based on specific, objective facts establishing reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect was involved in criminal activity.  See<em> id</em>., at 51\xe2\x80\x9352.  Absent that factual basis for detaining the defendant, the Court held, the risk of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and abusive police practices\xe2\x80\x9d was too great and the stop was impermissible.  <em>Id</em>., at 52.  Four Terms later, the Court invalidated a modified stop and identify statute on vagueness grounds.  See <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/index.html">461 U. S. 352</a> (1983).  The California law in <em>Kolender</em> required a suspect to give an officer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98credible and reliable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d identification when asked to identify himself.  <em>Id., </em>at 360.  The Court held that the statute was void because it provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply with it, resulting in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 360 (quoting <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>New Orleans,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/index.html">415 U. S. 130</a>, 135 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring in result)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case begins where our prior cases left off.  Here there is no question that the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in <em>Brown</em>.  Further, the petitioner has not alleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in <em>Kolender</em>.  Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise.  The statute in <em>Kolender</em> had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer \xe2\x80\x9ccredible and reliable\xe2\x80\x9d identification.  In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted NRS \xc2\xa7171.123(3) to require only that a suspect disclose his name.  See 118 Nev., at ___, 59 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1206 (opinion of Young, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe suspect is not required to provide private details about his background, but merely to state his name to an officer when reasonable suspicion exists\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we understand it, the statute does not require a suspect to give the officer a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license or any other document.  Provided that the suspect either states his name or communicates it to the officer by other means\xe2\x80\x94a choice, we assume, that the suspect may make\xe2\x80\x94the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs<em>.  </em>See<em> id.,</em> at ___, 59 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1206\xe2\x80\x931207.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hiibel argues that his conviction cannot stand because the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

S. 1</a> (1968), the Court has recognized that a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable suspicion that a person may be involved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop the person for a brief time and take additional steps to investigate further.  <em>Delgado</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 216; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/873/index.html">422 U. S. 873</a>, 881 (1975).  To ensure that the resulting seizure is constitutionally reasonable, a <em>Terry </em>stop must be limited.  The officer\xe2\x80\x99s action must be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified at its inception, and \xe2\x80\xa6 reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sharpe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/index.html">470 U. S. 675</a>, 682 (1985) (quoting <em>Terry</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 20).  For example, the seizure cannot continue for an excessive period of time, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Place,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/index.html">462 U. S. 696</a>, 709 (1983), or resemble a traditional arrest, see <em>Dunaway</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/index.html">442 U. S. 200</a>, 212 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decisions make clear that questions concerning a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s identity are a routine and accepted part of many <em>Terry </em>stops.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hensley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/221/index.html">469 U. S. 221</a>, 229 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he ability to briefly stop [a suspect], ask questions, or check identification in the absence of probable cause promotes the strong government interest in solving crimes and bringing offenders to justice\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Hayes</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/811/index.html">470 U. S. 811</a>, 816 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f there are articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a criminal offense, that person may be stopped in order to identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly while attempting to obtain additional information\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Adams</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/143/index.html">407 U. S. 143</a>, 146 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9cA brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obtaining a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s name in the course of a <em>Terry</em> stop serves important government interests.  Knowledge of identity may inform an officer that a suspect is wanted for another offense, or has a record of violence or mental disorder.  On the other hand, knowing identity may help clear a suspect and allow the police to concentrate their efforts elsewhere.  Identity may prove particularly important in cases such as this, where the police are investigating what appears to be a domestic assault.  Officers called to investigate domestic disputes need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although it is well established that an officer may ask a suspect to identify himself in the course of a <em>Terry</em> stop, it has been an open question whether the suspect can be arrested and prosecuted for refusal to answer.  See <em>Brown</em>, 443 U. S., at 53, n.\xc2\xa03.  Petitioner draws our attention to statements in prior opinions that, according to him, answer the question in his favor.  In <em>Terry</em>, Justice White stated in a concurring opinion that a person detained in an investigative stop can be questioned but is \xe2\x80\x9cnot obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 34.  The Court cited this opinion in dicta in <em>Berkemer</em> v. <em>McCarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/index.html">468 U. S. 420</a>, 439 (1984), a decision holding that a routine traffic stop is not a custodial stop requiring the protections of <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966).  In the course of explaining why <em>Terry</em> stops have not been subject to <em>Miranda</em>, the Court suggested reasons why <em>Terry</em> stops have a \xe2\x80\x9cnonthreatening character,\xe2\x80\x9d among them the fact that a suspect detained during a <em>Terry</em> stop \xe2\x80\x9cis not obliged to respond\xe2\x80\x9d to questions.  See <em>Berkemer</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 439, 440.  According to petitioner, these statements establish a right to refuse to answer questions during a <em>Terry</em> stop.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not read these statements as controlling.  The passages recognize that the Fourth Amendment does not impose obligations on the citizen but instead provides rights against the government.  As a result, the Fourth Amendment itself cannot require a suspect to answer questions.  This case concerns a different issue, however.  Here, the source of the legal obligation arises from Nevada state law, not the Fourth Amendment.  Further, the statutory obligation does not go beyond answering an officer\xe2\x80\x99s request to disclose a name.  See NRS \xc2\xa7171.123(3) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny person so detained shall identify himself, but may not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of any peace officer\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a result, we cannot view the dicta in <em>Berkemer</em> or Justice White\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in <em>Terry</em> as answering the question whether a State can compel a suspect to disclose his name during a <em>Terry</em> stop.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principles of <em>Terry</em> permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a <em>Terry</em> stop.  The reasonableness of a seizure under the Fourth Amendment is determined \xe2\x80\x9cby balancing its intrusion on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate government interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Prouse,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/index.html">440 U. S. 648</a>, 654 (1979).  The Nevada statute satisfies that standard.  The request for identity has an immediate relation to the purpose, rationale, and practical demands of a <em>Terry</em> stop.  The threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request for identity does not become a legal nullity.  On the other hand, the Nevada statute does not alter the nature of the stop itself: it does not change its duration, <em>Place</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 709, or its location, <em>Dunaway</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 212.  A state law requiring a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a valid <em>Terry</em> stop is consistent with Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the Nevada statute circumvents the probable cause requirement, in effect allowing an officer to arrest a person for being suspicious.  According to petitioner, this creates a risk of arbitrary police conduct that the Fourth Amendment does not permit.  Brief for Petitioner 28\xe2\x80\x9333.  These are familiar concerns; they were central to the opinion in <em>Papachristou, </em>and also to the decisions limiting the operation of stop and identify statutes in <em>Kolender</em> and <em>Brown</em>. <em> </em>Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concerns are met by the requirement that a <em>Terry</em> stop must be justified at its inception and \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified\xe2\x80\x9d the initial stop.  392 U. S., at 20.  Under these principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identify himself if the request for identification is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop.  The Court noted a similar limitation in <em>Hayes</em>, where it suggested that <em>Terry</em> may permit an officer to determine a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s identity by compelling the suspect to submit to fingerprinting only if there is \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable basis for believing that fingerprinting will establish or negate the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s connection with that crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U. S., at 817.  It is clear in this case that the request for identification was \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified\xe2\x80\x9d the stop.  <em>Terry</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 20.  The officer\xe2\x80\x99s request was a commonsense inquiry, not an effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after a <em>Terry</em> stop yielded insufficient evidence.  The stop, the request, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of a response did not contravene the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner further contends that his conviction violates the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on compelled self-incrimination.  The Fifth Amendment states that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  To qualify for the Fifth Amendment privilege, a communication must be testimonial, incriminating, and compelled.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hubbell, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/27/index.html">530 U. S. 27</a>, 34\xe2\x80\x9338 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents urge us to hold that the statements NRS \xc2\xa7171.123(3) requires are nontestimonial, and so outside the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  We decline to resolve the case on that basis.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o be testimonial, an accused\xe2\x80\x99s communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Doe</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/index.html">487 U. S. 201</a>, 210 (1988).  See also <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U. S., at 35.  Stating one\xe2\x80\x99s name may qualify as an assertion of fact relating to identity.  Production of identity documents might meet the definition as well.  As we noted in <em>Hubbell</em>, acts of production may yield testimony establishing \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence, authenticity, and custody of items [the police seek].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 41.  Even if these required actions are testimonial, however, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenge must fail because in this case disclosure of his name presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimony that is incriminating.  See <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Walker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/161/591/index.html">161 U. S. 591</a>, 598 (1896) (noting that where \xe2\x80\x9cthe answer of the witness will not directly show his infamy, but only <em>tend</em> to disgrace him, he is bound to answer\xe2\x80\x9d).  A claim of Fifth Amendment privilege must establish</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the witness from his being compelled to answer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]he danger to be apprehended must be real and appreciable, with reference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of things,\xe2\x80\x94not a danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial character, having reference to some extraordinary and barely possible contingency, so improbable that no reasonable man would suffer it to influence his conduct.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 599\xe2\x80\x93600 (quoting <em>Queen</em> v. <em>Boyes</em>, 1 Best &amp; S. 311, 321 (1861) (Cockburn, C.\xc2\xa0J.)).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs we stated in <em>Kastigar</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/index.html">406 U. S. 441</a>, 445 (1972), the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination \xe2\x80\x9cprotects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\xe2\x80\x9d  Suspects who have been granted immunity from prosecution may, therefore, be compelled to answer; with the threat of prosecution removed, there can be no reasonable belief that the evidence will be used against them.  See<em> id.,</em> at 453.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to disclose his name was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute\xe2\x80\x9d him.  <em>Hoffman</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/341/479/index.html">341 U. S. 479</a>, 486 (1951).  As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s business.  Even today, petitioner does not explain how the disclosure of his name could have been used against him in a criminal case.  While we recognize petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s strong belief that he should not have to disclose his identity, the Fifth Amendment does not override the Nevada Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that the disclosure would tend to incriminate him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The narrow scope of the disclosure requirement is also important.  One\xe2\x80\x99s identity is, by definition, unique; yet it is, in another sense, a universal characteristic.  Answering a request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant in the scheme of things as to be incriminating only in unusual circumstances.  See <em>Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs.</em> v. <em>Bouknight,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/index.html">493 U. S. 549</a>, 555 (1990) (suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9cfact[s] the State could readily establish\xe2\x80\x9d may render \xe2\x80\x9cany testimony regarding existence or authenticity [of them] insufficiently incriminating\xe2\x80\x9d); Cf. <em>California</em> v. <em>Byers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/index.html">402 U. S. 424</a>, 432 (1971) (opinion of Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  In every criminal case, it is known and must be known who has been arrested and who is being tried.  Cf. <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Muniz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/index.html">496 U. S. 582</a>, 601\xe2\x80\x93602 (1990) (opinion of Brennan, J.).  Even witnesses who plan to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege answer when their names are called to take the stand.  Still, a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense.  In that case, the court can then consider whether the privilege applies, and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy must follow.  We need not resolve those questions here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961666">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nHIIBEL V.

The class includes only those persons detained by a police officer \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances which reasonably indicate that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]\xe2\x80\x94persons who are, in other words, targets of a criminal investigation.  The statute therefore is directed not \xe2\x80\x9cat the public at large,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cat a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Albertson</em> v. <em>Subversive Activities Control Bd.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/70/index.html">382 U. S. 70</a>, 79 (1965).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Nevada law, a member of the targeted class \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be compelled to answer\xe2\x80\x9d any inquiry except a command that he \xe2\x80\x9cidentify himself.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Refusal to identify oneself upon request is punishable as a crime.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Presumably the statute does not require the detainee to answer any other question because the Nevada Legislature realized that the Fifth Amendment prohibits compelling the target of a criminal investigation to make any other statement.  In my judgment, the broad constitutional right to remain silent, which derives from the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] is not as circumscribed as the Court suggests, and does not admit even of the narrow exception defined by the Nevada statute. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, 467 (1966).  It is a \xe2\x80\x9csettled principle\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe police have the right to request citizens to answer voluntarily questions concerning unsolved crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthey have no right to compel them to answer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Mississipi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/721/index.html">394 U. S. 721</a>, 727, n.\xc2\xa06 (1969).  The protections of the Fifth Amendment are directed squarely toward those who are the focus of the government\xe2\x80\x99s investigative and prosecutorial powers.  In a criminal trial, the indicted defendant has an unqualified right to refuse to testify and may not be punished for invoking that right.  See <em>Carter</em> v. <em>Kentucky,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/288/index.html">450 U. S. 288</a>, 299\xe2\x80\x93300 (1981).  The unindicted target of a grand jury investigation enjoys the same constitutional protection even if he has been served with a subpoena.  See <em>Chavez</em> v. <em>Martinez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/760/index.html">538 U. S. 760</a>, 767\xe2\x80\x93768 (2003).  So does an arrested suspect during custodial interrogation in a police station.  <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U. S., at 467.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reason why the subject of police interrogation based on mere suspicion, rather than probable cause, should have any lesser protection.  Indeed, we have said that the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections apply with equal force in the context of <em>Terry</em> stops, see <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a> (1968), where an officer\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cmust be \xe2\x80\x98reasonably related in scope to the justification for [the stop\xe2\x80\x99s] initiation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Berkemer</em> v. <em>McCarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/index.html">468 U. S. 420</a>, 439 (1984) (some internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cTypically, this means that the officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions.  But the detainee is not obliged to respond.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  See also <em>Terry,</em> 392 U. S., at 34 (White, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for arrest, although it may alert the officer to the need for continued observation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given our statements to the effect that citizens are not required to respond to police officers\xe2\x80\x99 questions during a <em>Terry</em> stop, it is no surprise that petitioner assumed, as have we, that he had a right not to disclose his identity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court correctly observes that a communication does not enjoy the Fifth Amendment privilege unless it is testimonial.  Although the Court declines to resolve this question, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, I think it clear that this case concerns a testimonial communication.  Recognizing that whether a communication is testimonial is sometimes a \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Doe</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/index.html"></a><a href="/us/487/201/index.html">487 U. S. 201</a>, 214\xe2\x80\x93215 (1988), we have stated generally that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the \xe2\x80\x98extortion of information from the accused,\xe2\x80\x99 the attempt to force him \xe2\x80\x98to disclose the contents of his own mind,\xe2\x80\x99 that implicates the Self-Incrimination Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 211 (citations omitted).  While \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he vast majority of verbal statements thus will be testimonial and, to that extent at least, will fall within the privilege,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 213\xe2\x80\x93214, certain acts and physical evidence fall outside the privilege.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In\nall instances, we have afforded Fifth Amendment protec-\ntion if the disclosure in question was being admitted because of its content rather than some other aspect of the communication.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Considered in light of these precedents, the compelled statement at issue in this case is clearly testimonial.  It is significant that the communication must be made in response to a question posed by a police officer.  As we recently explained, albeit in the different context of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever else the term [\xe2\x80\x98testimonial\xe2\x80\x99] covers, it applies at a minimum \xe2\x80\xa6 to police interrogations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> 541 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 33).  Surely police questioning during a <em>Terry</em> stop qualifies as an interrogation, and it follows that responses to such questions are testimonial in nature.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than determining whether the communication at issue is testimonial, the Court instead concludes that the State can compel the disclosure of one\xe2\x80\x99s identity because it is not \xe2\x80\x9cincriminating.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But our cases have afforded Fifth Amendment protection to statements that are \xe2\x80\x9cincriminating\xe2\x80\x9d in a much broader sense than the Court suggests.  It has \xe2\x80\x9clong been settled that [the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s] protection encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence even though the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not introduced into evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hubbell, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/27/index.html">530 U. S. 27</a>, 37 (2000).  By \xe2\x80\x9cincriminating\xe2\x80\x9d we have meant disclosures that \xe2\x80\x9ccould be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kastigar</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/index.html">406 U. S. 441</a>, 445 (1972)\xe2\x80\x94communications, in other words, that \xe2\x80\x9cwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hoffman</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/341/479/index.html">341 U. S. 479</a>, 486 (1951).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompelled testimony that communicates information that may \xe2\x80\x98lead to incriminating evidence\xe2\x80\x99 is privileged even if the information itself is not inculpatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hubbell</em>, 530 U. S., at 38 (citing <em>Doe</em>, 487 U. S., at 208, n.\xc2\xa06).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given a proper understanding of the category of \xe2\x80\x9cincriminating\xe2\x80\x9d communications that fall within the Fifth Amendment privilege, it is clear that the disclosure of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s identity is protected.  The Court reasons that we should not assume that the disclosure of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s name would be used to incriminate him or that it would furnish a link in a chain of evidence needed to prosecute him.  <em>Ante,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But why else would an officer ask for it?  And why else would the Nevada Legislature require its disclosure only when circumstances \xe2\x80\x9creasonably indicate that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime\xe2\x80\x9d?[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  If the Court is correct, then petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A person\xe2\x80\x99s identity obviously bears informational and incriminating worth, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the [name] itself is not inculpatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hubbell</em>, 530 U. S., at 38.  A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.  And that information, in turn, can be tremendously useful in a criminal prosecution.  It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence \xe2\x80\x9conly in unusual circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officer in this case told petitioner, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s words, that \xe2\x80\x9che was conducting an investigation and needed to see some identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  As the target of that investigation, petitioner, in my view, acted well within his rights when he opted to stand mute.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Nev. Rev.

And one of those limits invalidates laws that compel responses to police questioning. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a> (1968), the Court considered whether police, in the absence of probable cause, can stop, question, or frisk an individual at all.  The Court recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 9 (quoting <em>Union Pacific R. Co.</em> v. <em>Botsford,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/141/250/index.html">141 U. S. 250</a>, 251 (1891)).  At the same time, it recognized that in certain circumstances, public safety might require a limited \xe2\x80\x9cseizure,\xe2\x80\x9d or stop, of an individual against his will.  The Court consequently set forth conditions circumscribing when and how the police might conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop.  They include what has become known as the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable suspicion\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  392 U. S.<em>,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  Justice White, in a separate concurring opinion, set forth further conditions.  Justice White wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest, although it may alert the officer to the need for continued observation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 34.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About 10 years later, the Court, in <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/47/index.html">443 U. S. 47</a> (1979), held that police lacked \xe2\x80\x9cany reasonable suspicion\xe2\x80\x9d to detain the particular petitioner and require him to identify himself.  <em>Id., </em>at 53.  The Court noted that the trial judge had asked the following: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure [officers conducting a <em>Terry</em> stop] should ask everything they possibly could find out.  <em>What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is what\xe2\x80\x99s the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in putting a man in jail because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to answer </em>. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 54 (Appendix to opinion of the Court) (emphasis in original).  The Court referred to Justice White\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Terry </em>concurrence.  443 U. S.<em>, </em>at 53, n.\xc2\xa03.  And it said that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not decide\xe2\x80\x9d the matter.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then, five years later, the Court wrote that an \xe2\x80\x9cofficer may ask the <em>[Terry] </em>detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions.  <em>But the detainee is not obliged to respond.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/index.html">468 U.

And that law has remained undisturbed for more than 20 years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no good reason now to reject this generation-old statement of the law.  There are sound reasons rooted in Fifth Amendment considerations for adhering to this Fourth Amendment legal condition circumscribing police authority to stop an individual against his will.  See <em>ante, </em>at 1\xe2\x80\x936 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Administrative considerations also militate against change.  Can a State, in addition to requiring a stopped individual to answer \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d also require an answer to \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your license number?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d  Can a police officer, who must know how to make a <em>Terry </em>stop, keep track of the constitutional answers?  After all, answers to any of these questions may, or may not, incriminate, depending upon the circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, as the majority points out, a name itself\xe2\x80\x94even if it is not \xe2\x80\x9cKiller Bill\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cRough \xe2\x80\x99em up Harry\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94will sometimes provide the police with \xe2\x80\x9ca link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The majority reserves judgment about whether compulsion is permissible in such instances.  <em>Ante, </em>at 13.  How then is a police officer in the midst of a <em>Terry </em>stop to distinguish between the majority\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary case and this special case where the majority reserves judgment?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority presents no evidence that the rule enunciated by Justice White and then by the <em>Berkemer </em>Court, which for nearly a generation has set forth a settled <em>Terry-\n</em>stop condition, has significantly interfered with law enforcement.  Nor has the majority presented any other convincing justification for change.  I would not begin to erode a clear rule with special exceptions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I consequently dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
