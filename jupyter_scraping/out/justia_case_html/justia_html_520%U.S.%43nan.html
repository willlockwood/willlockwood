Argued December 4, 1996-Decided March 3,1997</p><p>Maria-Kelly F. Yniguez, an Arizona state employee at the time, sued the State and its Governor, Attorney General, and Director of the Department of Administration under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983, alleging that State Constitution Article XXVIII-key provisions of which declare English "the official language of the State," require the State to "act in English and in no other language," and authorize state residents and businesses "to bring [state-court] suitEs] to enforce thEe] Article"-violated, <i>inter alia, </i>the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Yniguez used both English and Spanish in her work and feared that Article XXVIII, if read broadly, would require her to face discharge or other discipline if she did not refrain from speaking Spanish while serving the State. She requested injunctive and declaratory relief, counsel fees, and "all other relief that the Court deems just and proper." During the early phases of the suit, the State Attorney General released an opinion expressing his view that Article XXVIII is constitutional in that, although it requires the expression of "official acts" in English, it allows government employees to use other languages to facilitate the delivery of governmental services. The Federal District Court heard testimony and, among its rulings, determined that only the Governor, in her official capacity, was a proper defendant. The court, at the same time, dismissed the State because of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State Attorney General because he had no authority to enforce Article XXVIII against state employees, and the Director because there was no showing that she had undertaken or threatened any action adverse to Yniguez; rejected the Attorney General\'s interpretation of the Article on the ground that it conflicted with the measure\'s plain language; declared the Article fatally overbroad after reading it to impose a sweeping ban on the use of any language other than English by all of Arizona officialdom; and declined to allow the Arizona courts the initial opportunity to determine the scope of Article XXVIII. Following the Governor\'s announcement that she would not appeal, the District Court denied the State Attorney General\'s request to certify the pivotal statelaw question-the Article\'s correct construction-to the Arizona Supreme Court. The District Court also denied the State Attorney Gen-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="44">44</a></p><p>eral\'s motion to intervene on behalf of the State, under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b), to contest on appeal the court\'s holding that the Article is unconstitutional. In addition, the court denied the motion of newcomers Arizonans for Official English Committee (AOE) and its Chairman Park, sponsors of the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII, to intervene to support the Article\'s constitutionality. The day after AOE, Park, and the State Attorney General filed their notices of appeal, Yniguez resigned from state employment to accept a job in the private sector. The Ninth Circuit then concluded that AOE and Park met standing requirements under Article III of the Federal Constitution and could proceed as party appellants, and that the Attorney General, having successfully obtained dismissal below, could not reenter as a party, but could present an argument, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 2403(b), regarding the constitutionality of Article XXVIII. Thereafter, the State Attorney General informed the Ninth Circuit of Yniguez\'s resignation and suggested that, for lack of a viable plaintiff, the case was moot. The court disagreed, holding that a plea for nominal damages could be read into the complaint\'s "all other relief" clause to save the case. The en banc Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed the District Court\'s ruling that Article XXVIII was unconstitutional, and announced that Yniguez was entitled to nominal damages from the State. Finding the Article\'s "plain language" dispositive, and noting that the State Attorney General had never conceded that the Article would be unconstitutional if construed as Yniguez asserted it should be, the Court of Appeals also rejected the Attorney General\'s limiting construction of the Article and declined to certify the matter to the State Supreme Court. Finally, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged a state-court challenge to Article XXVIII\'s constitutionality, <i>Ruiz </i>v. <i>State, </i>but found that litigation no cause to stay the federal proceedings.</p><p><i>Held: </i>Because the case was moot and should not have been retained for adjudication on the merits, the Court vacates the Ninth Circuit\'s judgment and remands the case with directions that the action be dismissed by the District Court.

Standing to defend on appeal in the place of an original defendant demands that the litigant possess "a direct stake in the outcome." <i>Diamond </i>v. <i>Charles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/54/case.html">476 U. S. 54</a>, 62. Petitioners\' primary argument-that, as initiative proponents, they have a quasi-legislative</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="45">45</a></p><p>interest in defending the measure they successfully sponsored-is dubious because they are not elected state legislators, authorized by state law to represent the State\'s interests, see <i>Karcher </i>v. <i>May, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/72/case.html">484 U. S. 72</a>, 82. Furthermore, this Court has never identified initiative proponents as Article-Ill-qualified defenders. Cf. <i>Don\'t Bankrnpt Washington Committee </i>v. <i>Continental Ill. Nat. Bank </i>&amp; <i>Trust Co. of Chicago, 460 </i>U. S. 1077. Their assertion of representational or associational standing is also problematic, absent the concrete injury that would confer standing upon AOE members in their own right, see, <i>e. g., Food and Commercial Workers </i>v. <i>Brown Group, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/544/case.html">517 U. S. 544</a>, 551-553, and absent anything in Article XXVIII\'s state-court citizen-suit provision that could support standing for Arizona residents in general, or AOE in particular, to defend the Article\'s constitutionality in federal court. Nevertheless, this Court need not definitively resolve the standing of AOE and Park to proceed as they did, but assumes such standing <i>arguendo </i>in order to analyze the question of mootness occasioned by originating plaintiff Yniguez\'s departure from state employment. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Burke </i>v. <i>Barnes, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/361/case.html">479 U. S. 361</a>,363,364, n. Pp.64-67.</p><p>(b) Because Yniguez no longer satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement, this case is moot. To qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed. <i>E. g., Preiser </i>v. <i>Newkirk, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/395/case.html">422 U. S. 395</a>, 401. Although Yniguez had a viable claim at the outset of this litigation, her resignation from public sector employment to pursue work in the private sector, where her speech was not governed by Article XXVIII, mooted the case stated in her complaint. Cf. <i>Boyle </i>v. <i>Landry, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/77/case.html">401 U. S. 77</a>, 78, 80-81. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\'s ruling, her implied plea for nominal damages, which the Ninth Circuit approved as against the State of Arizona, could not revive the case, as \xc2\xa7 1983 actions do not lie against a State, <i>Will </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html">491 U. S. 58</a>, 71; Arizona was permitted to participate in the appeal only as an intervenor, through its Attorney General, not as a party subject to an obligation to pay damages; and the State\'s cooperation with Yniguez in waiving Eleventh Amendment immunity did not recreate a live case or controversy fit for federal-court adjudication, cf., <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Johnson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/302/case.html">319 U. S. 302</a>, 304. Pp. 67-71.</p><p>(c) When a civil case becomes moot pending appellate adjudication, the established practice in the federal system is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Munsingwear, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/case.html">340 U. S. 36</a>, 39. This Court is not disarmed from that course by the State Attorney General\'s failure to petition for certiorari. The Court has an obligation to inquire not only into its own</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="46">46</a></p><p>authority to decide the questions presented, but to consider also the authority of the lower courts to proceed, even though the parties are prepared to concede it. <i>E. </i><i>g., </i><i>Bender </i>v. <i>Williamsport Area School Dist., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/case.html">475 U. S. 534</a>,541. Because the Ninth Circuit refused to stop the adjudication when it learned of the mooting event-Yniguez\'s departure from public employment-its unwarranted en banc judgment must be set aside. Nor is the District Court\'s judgment saved by its entry before the occurrence of the mooting event or by the Governor\'s refusal to appeal from it. AOE and Park had an arguable basis for seeking appellate review; moreover, the State Attorney General\'s renewed certification plea and his motion to intervene in this litigation demonstrate that he was pursuing his \xc2\xa7 2403(b) right to defend Article XXVIII\'s constitutionality when the mooting event occurred. His disclosure of that event to the Ninth Circuit warranted a mootness disposition, which would have stopped his \xc2\xa7 2403(b) endeavor and justified vacation of the District Court\'s judgment. The extraordinary course of this litigation and the federalism concern next considered lead to the conclusion that vacatur down the line is the equitable solution. pp. 71-75.</p><p>(d) Taking into account the novelty of the question of Article XXVIII\'s meaning, its potential importance to the conduct of Arizona\'s business, the State Attorney General\'s views on the subject, and the at-least-partial agreement with those views by the Article\'s sponsors, more respectful consideration should have been given to the Attorney General\'s requests to seek, through certification, an authoritative construction of the Article from the State Supreme Court. When anticipatory relief is sought in federal court against a state statute, respect for the place of the States in our federal system calls for close consideration of the question whether conflict is avoidable. Federal courts are not well equipped to rule on a state statute\'s constitutionality without a controlling interpretation of the statute\'s meaning and effect by the state courts. See, <i>e. g., Poe </i>v. <i>Ullman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a>, 526 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Certification saves time, energy, and resources and helps build a cooperative judicial federalism. See, <i>e. g., Lehman Brothers </i>v. <i>Schein, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/386/case.html">416 U. S. 386</a>, 391. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\'s suggestion, this Court\'s decisions do not require as a condition precedent to certification a concession by the Attorney General that Article XXVIII would be unconstitutional if construed as Yniguez contended it should be. Moreover, that court improperly blended abstention with certification when it found that "unique circumstances," rather than simply a novel or unsettled state-law question, are necessary before federal courts may employ certification. The Arizona Supreme Court has before it, in <i>Ruiz </i>v. <i>State, </i>the question: What does Article XXVIII mean? Once that court has spoken, adjudication of any remaining federal constitu-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="47">47</a></p><p>tional question may be "greatly simplifie[d]."

Federal courts lack competence to rule definitively on the meaning of state legislation, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Reetz </i>v. <i>Bozanich, 397 </i>U. S. 82, 86-87 (1970), nor may they adjudicate challenges to state measures absent a showing of actual impact on the challenger, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Golden </i>v. <i>Zwickler, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/103/case.html">394 U. S. 103</a>, 110 (1969). The Ninth Circuit, in the case at hand, lost sight of these limitations. The initiating plaintiff, Maria-Kelly F. Yniguez, sought federal-court resolution of a novel question: the compatibility with the Federal Constitution of a 1988 amendment to Arizona\'s Constitution declaring English "the official language of the State of Arizona"-"the language of ... all government functions and actions." Ariz. Const., Art. XXVIII, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1(1), 1(2). Participants in the federallitigation, proceeding without benefit of the views of the Arizona Supreme Court, expressed diverse opinions on the meaning of the amendment.</p><p>Yniguez commenced and maintained her suit as an individual, not as a class representative. A state employee at the time she filed her complaint, Yniguez voluntarily left the State\'s employ in 1990 and did not allege she would seek to return to a public post. Her departure for a position in the private sector made her claim for prospective relief moot. Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit held that a plea for nominal damages could be read into Yniguez\'s complaint to save the case, and therefore pressed on to an ultimate decision. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals declared Article XXVIII unconstitutional in 1994, and a divided en banc court, in 1995, adhered to the panel\'s position.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit had no warrant to proceed as it did.</p><p>The case had lost the essential elements of a justiciable controversy and should not have been retained for adjudication on the merits by the Court of Appeals.

We express no view on the correct interpretation of Article XXVIII or on the measure\'s constitutionality.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>A 1988 Arizona ballot initiative established English as the official language of the State. Passed on November 8, 1988, by a margin of one percentage point,l the measure became effective on December 5 as Arizona State Constitution Article XXVIII. Among key provisions, the Article declares that, with specified exceptions, the State "shall act in English and in no other language." Ariz. Const., Art. XXVIII, \xc2\xa7 3(1)(a). The enumerated exceptions concern compliance with federal laws, participation in certain educational programs, protection of the rights of criminal defendants and crime victims, and protection of public health or safety. <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 3(2). In a final provision, Article XXVIII grants standing to any person residing or doing business in the State "to bring suit to enforce thee] Article" in state court, under such "reasonable limitations" as "[t]he Legislature may enact." <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa74.2</p><p>Federal-court litigation challenging the constitutionality of Article XXVIII commenced two days after the ballot initiative passed. On November 10, 1988, Maria-Kelly F. Yniguez, then an insurance claims manager in the Arizona Department of Administration\'s Risk Management Division, sued the State of Arizona in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Yniguez invoked 42 U. S. C.</p><p>1 The measure, opposed by the Governor as "sadly misdirected," App. 38, drew the affirmative votes of 50.5% of Arizonans casting ballots in the election, see <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Arizonans for Official English, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/69/920/">69 F.3d 920</a>, 924 <i>(CA91995).</i></p><p>2 Article XXVIII, titled "English as the Official Language," is set out in full in an appendix to this opinion.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="50">50</a></p><p>\xc2\xa7 1983 as the basis for her suit.3 Soon after the lawsuit commenced, Yniguez added as defendants, in their individual and official capacities, Arizona Governor Rose Mofford, Arizona Attorney General Robert K. Corbin, and the Director of Arizona\'s Department of Administration, Catherine Eden. Yniguez brought suit as an individual and never sought designation as a class representative.</p><p>Fluent in English and Spanish, Yniguez was engaged primarily in handling medical malpractice claims against the State. In her daily service to the public, she spoke English to persons who spoke only that language, Spanish to persons who spoke only that language, and a combination of English and Spanish to persons able to communicate in both languages. Record, Doc. No. 62, "8, 13 (Statement of Stipulated Facts, filed Feb. 9, 1989). Yniguez feared that Article XXVIII\'s instruction to "act in English," \xc2\xa7 3(1)(a), if read broadly, would govern her job performance "every time she [did] something." See Record, Doc. No. 62, , 10. She believed she would lose her job or face other sanctions if she did not immediately refrain from speaking Spanish while serving the State. See App. 58, , 19 (Second Amended Complaint). Yniguez asserted that Article XXVIII violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000d. She requested injunctive and declaratory relief, counsel fees, and "all other relief that the</p><p>3 Derived from \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev.

App.60.</p><p>All defendants named in Yniguez\'s complaint moved to dismiss all claims asserted against them.4 The State of Arizona asserted immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The individual defendants asserted the absence of a case or controversy because "none of [them] ha[d] threatened [Yniguez] concerning her use of Spanish in the performance of her job duties [or had] ever told her not to use Spanish [at work]." Record, Doc. No. 30, p. 1. The defendants further urged that novel state-law questions concerning the meaning and application of Article XXVIII should be tendered first to the state courts. See <i>id., </i>at 2.5</p><p>Trial on the merits of Yniguez\'s complaint, the parties agreed, would be combined with the hearing on her motion for a preliminary injunction.6 Before the trial occurred, the State Attorney General, on January 24, 1989, released an opinion, No. 189-009, construing Article XXVIII and explaining why he found the measure constitutional. App. 61-76.</p><p>4 Under Arizona law, the State Attorney General represents the State in federal court. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 41-193(A)(3) (1992). Throughout these proceedings, the State and all state officials have been represented by the State Attorney General, or law department members under his supervision.

App. 61. While Article XXVIII requires the performance of "official acts of government" in English, it was the Attorney General\'s view that government employees remained free to use other languages "to facilitate the delivery of governmental services." <i>Id., </i>at 62. Construction of the word "act," as used in Article XXVIII, to mean more than an "official ac[t] of government," the Attorney General asserted, "would raise serious questions" of compatibility with federal and state equal protection guarantees and federal civil rights legislation. <i>Id., </i>at 65-66.7</p><p>On February 9, 1989, two weeks after release of the Attorney General\'s opinion, the parties filed a statement of stipulated facts, which reported Governor Mofford\'s opposition to the ballot initiative, her intention nevertheless "to comply with Article XXVIII," and her expectation that "State service employees [would] comply" with the measure. See Record, Doc. No. 62, "35, 36, 39. The stipulation confirmed the view of all parties that "[t]he efficient operation [and administration] of the State is enhanced by permitting State service employees to communicate with citizens of the State in languages other than English where the citizens are not proficient in English." <i>Id.," </i>16, 17. In particular, the parties recognized that "Y niguez\'[s] use of a language other</p><p>7 Specifically addressing "[t]he handling of customer inquiries or complaints involving state or local government services," the Attorney General elaborated:</p><p>"All official documents that are governmental acts must be in English, but translation services and accommodating communications are permissible, and may be required if reasonably necessary to the fair and effective delivery of services, or required by specific federal regulation. Communications between elected and other governmental employees with the public at large may be in a language other than English on the same principles." App.74.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="53">53</a></p><p>than English in the course of her performing government business contributes to the efficient operation ... and ... administration of the State." <i>Id.,\' </i>15. The stipulation referred to the Attorney General\'s January 24, 1989, opinion, <i>id., , </i>46, and further recounted that since the passage of Article XXVIII, "none of [Yniguez\'s] supervisors ha[d] ever told her to change or cease her prior use of Spanish in the performance of her duties," <i>id., , </i>48.8</p><p>The District Court heard testimony on two days in February and April 1989, and disposed of the case in an opinion and judgment filed February 6, 1990. <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Mofford, </i>730 F. Supp. 309. Prior to that final decision, the court had dismissed the State of Arizona as a defendant, accepting the State\'s plea of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See <i>id., </i>at 311. Yniguez\'s second amended complaint, filed February 23, 1989, accordingly named as defendants only the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Department of Administration. See App. 55.9</p><p>The District Court determined first that, among the named defendants, only the Governor, in her official capacity, was a proper party. The Attorney General, the District Court found, had no authority under Arizona law to enforce provisions like Article XXVIII against state employees. 730 F. Supp., at 311-312. The Director and the Governor,</p><p>8 Supplementing their pleas to dismiss for want of a case or controversy, the defendants urged that Attorney General Opinion No. 189-009 "puts to rest any claim that [Yniguez] will be penalized by the State for using Spanish in her work." Record, Doc. No. 51, p. 4, n. 1.</p><p>9 The second amended complaint added another plaintiff, Arizona State Senator Jaime Gutierrez. Senator Gutierrez alleged that Article XXVIII interfered with his rights to communicate freely with persons, including residents of his Senate district, who spoke languages other than English. App. 58-59. The District Court dismissed Gutierrez\'s claim on the ground that the defendants, all executive branch officials, lacked authority to take enforcement action against elected legislative branch officials. <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Mofford, </i>730 F. Supp. 309, 311 (Ariz. 1990). Gutierrez is no longer a participant in these proceedings.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="54">54</a></p><p>on the other hand, did have authority to enforce state laws and rules against state service employees. <i>Id., </i>at 311. But nothing in the record, the District Court said, showed that the Director had undertaken or threatened to undertake any action adverse to Yniguez. <i>Id., </i>at 313. That left Governor Mofford.</p><p>The Attorney General "ha[d] formally interpreted Article XXVIII as not imposing any restrictions on Yniguez\'s continued use of Spanish during the course of her official duties," <i>id., </i>at 312, and indeed all three named defendantsMofford as well as Corbin and Eden, see <i>supra, </i>at 50-"ha[d] stated on the record that Yniguez may continue to speak Spanish without fear of official retribution." 730 F. Supp., at 312. Governor Mofford therefore reiterated that Yniguez faced no actual or threatened injury attributable to any Arizona executive branch officer, and hence presented no genuine case or controversy. See <i>ibid. </i>But the District Court singled out the stipulations that "Governor Mofford intends to comply with Article XXVIII," and "expects State service employees to comply with Article XXVII!." Record, Doc. No. 62, " 35, 36; see 730 F. Supp., at 312. If Yniguez proved right and the Governor wrong about the breadth of Article XXVIII, the District Court concluded, then Yniguez would be vulnerable to the Governor\'s pledge to enforce compliance with the Article. See <i>ibid.</i></p><p>Proceeding to the merits, the District Court found Article XXVIII fatally overbroad. The measure, as the District Court read it, was not merely a direction that all official acts be in English, as the Attorney General\'s opinion maintained; instead, according to the District Court, Article XXVIII imposed a sweeping ban on the use of any language other than English by all of Arizona officialdom, with only limited exceptions. <i>Id., </i>at 314. The District Court adverted to the Attorney General\'s confining construction, but found it unpersuasive. Opinion No. 189-009, the District Court observed, is "merely ... advisory," not binding on any</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="55">55</a></p><p>court. 730 F. Supp., at 315. "More importantly," the District Court concluded, "the Attorney General\'s interpretation ... is simply at odds with Article XXVIII\'s plain language." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The view that Article XXVIII\'s text left no room for a moderate and restrained interpretation led the District Court to decline "to allow the Arizona courts the initial opportunity to determine the scope of Article XXVII!." <i>Id., </i>at 316. The District Court ultimately dismissed all parties save Yniguez and Governor Mofford in her official capacity, then declared Article XXVIII unconstitutional as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but denied Yniguez\'s request for an injunction because "she ha[d] not established an enforcement threat sufficient to warrant [such] relief." <i>Id., </i>at 316-317.</p><p>Post judgment motions followed, sparked by Governor Mofford\'s announcement that she would not pursue an appeal. See App. 98. The Attorney General renewed his request to certify the pivotal state-law question-the correct construction of Article XXVIII-to the Arizona Supreme Court. See Record, Doc. No. 82. He also moved to intervene on behalf of the State, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b),lO in order to contest on appeal the District Court\'s declaration that a provision of Arizona\'s Constitution violated the Federal Constitution. Record, Doc. Nos. 92, 93.</p><p>10 Title 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b) provides:</p><p>"In any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of the United States to which a State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party, wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that State affecting the public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such fact to the attorney general of the State, and shall permit the State to intervene for presentation of evidence, if evidence is otherwise admissible in the case, and for argument on the question of constitutionality. The State shall, subject to the applicable provisions of law, have all the rights of a party and be subject to all liabilities of a party as to court costs to the extent necessary for a proper presentation of the facts and law relating to the question of constitutionality."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="56">56</a></p><p>Two newcomers also appeared in the District Court after judgment: the Arizonans for Official English Committee (AOE) and Robert D. Park, Chairman of AOE. Invoking Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, AOE and Park moved to intervene as defendants in order to urge on appeal the constitutionality of Article XXVIII. App. 94102. AOE, an unincorporated association, was principal sponsor of the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII. AOE and Park alleged in support of their intervention motion the interest of AOE members in enforcement of Article XXVIII and Governor Mofford\'s unwillingness to defend the measure on appeal. Responding to the AOE/Park motion, Governor Mofford confirmed that she did not wish to appeal, but would have no objection to the Attorney General\'s intervention to pursue an appeal as the State\'s representative, or to the pursuit of an appeal by any other party. See Record, Doc. No. 94.</p><p>Yniguez expressed reservations about proceeding further.</p><p>"She ha[d] won [her] suit against her employer" and had "obtained her relief," her counsel noted. Record, Doc. No. 114, p. 18 (Tr. of Proceeding on Motion to Intervene and Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, Mar. 26, 1990). If the litigation "goes forward," Yniguez\'s counsel told the District Court, "I guess we do, too," but, counsel added, it might be in Yniguez\'s "best interest ... if we stopped it right here." <i>Ibid. </i>The District Court agreed.</p><p>In an opinion filed April 3, 1990, the District Court denied all three post judgment motions. <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Mofford, 130 </i>F. R. D. 410. Certification was inappropriate, the District Court ruled, in light of the court\'s prior rejection of the Attorney General\'s narrow reading of Article XXVIII. See <i>id., </i>at 412. As to the Attorney General\'s intervention application, the District Court observed that \xc2\xa7 2403(b) addresses only actions "\'to which the State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party.\'" See <i>id., </i>at 413 (quoting \xc2\xa7 2403(b)).

Governor Mofford remained a party throughout the District Court proceedings. If the State lost the opportunity to defend the constitutionality of Article XXVIII on appeal, the District Court reasoned, it was "only because Governor Mofford determine[d] that the state\'s sovereign interests would be best served by foregoing an appeal." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Turning to the AOE/Park intervention motion, the District Court observed first that the movants had failed to file a pleading "setting forth the[ir] claim or defense," as required by Rule 24(c). <i>Ibid. </i>But that deficiency was not critical, the District Court said. <i>Ibid. </i>The insurmountable hurdle was Article III standing. The labor and resources AOE spent to promote the ballot initiative did not suffice to establish standing to sue or defend in a federal tribunal, the District Court held. <i>Id., </i>at 414-415. Nor did Park or any other AOE member qualify for party status, the District Court ruled, for the interests of voters who favored the initiative were too general to meet traditional standing criteria. <i>Id., </i>at 415.</p><p>In addition, the District Court was satisfied that AOE and Park could not tenably assert practical impairment of their interests stemming from the precedential force of the decision. As nonparticipants in the federal litigation, they would face no issue preclusion. And a lower federal-court judgment is not binding on state courts, the District Court noted. Thus, AOE and Park would not be precluded by the federal declaration from pursuing "any future state court proceeding [based on] Article XXVII!." <i>Id., </i>at 415-416.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>The Ninth Circuit viewed the matter of standing to appeal differently. In an opinion released July 19, 1991, <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/939/727/">939 F.2d 727</a>, the Court of Appeals reached these</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="58">58</a></p><p>conclusions: AOE and Park met Article III requirements and could proceed as appellants; Arizona\'s Attorney General, however, having successfully moved in the District Court for his dismissal as a defendant, could not reenter as a party, but would be permitted to present argument regarding the constitutionality of Article XXVIII. <i>Id., </i>at 738-740. The Ninth Circuit reported it would retain jurisdiction over the District Court\'s decision on the merits, <i>id., </i>at 740, but did not then address the question whether Article XXVIII\'s meaning should be certified for definitive resolution by the Arizona Supreme Court.</p><p>Concerning AOE\'s standing, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the Arizona Legislature would have standing to defend the constitutionality of a state statute; by analogy, the Ninth Circuit maintained, AOE, as principal sponsor of the ballot initiative, qualified to defend Article XXVIII on appeal. <i>Id., </i>at 732-733; see also <i>id., </i>at 734, n. 5 ("[WJe hold that AOE has standing in the same way that a legislature might."). AOE Chairman Park also had standing to appeal, according to the Ninth Circuit, because Yniguez "could have had a reasonable expectation that Park (and possibly AOE as well) would bring an enforcement action against her" under \xc2\xa7 4 of Article XXVIII, which authorizes any person residing in Arizona to sue in state court to enforce the Article. <i>Id., </i>at 734, and n. 5.11</p><p>11 In a remarkable passage, the Ninth Circuit addressed Yniguez\'s argument, opposing intervention by AOE and Park, that the District Court\'s judgment was no impediment to any state-court proceeding AOE and Park might wish to bring, because that judgment is not a binding precedent on Arizona\'s judiciary. See 939 F. 2d, at 735-736. The Court of Appeals questioned the wisdom of the view expressed "in the academic literature," "by some state courts," and by "several individual justices" that state courts are "coordinate and coequal with the lower federal courts on matters of federal law." <i>Id., </i>at 736 (footnote omitted). The Ninth Circuit acknowledged "there may be valid reasons not to bind the state courts to a decision of a single federal district judge-which is not even binding on the same judge in a subsequent action." <i>Id., </i>at 736-737. However, the appellate panel added, those reasons "are inapplicable to</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="59">59</a></p><p>Having allowed AOE and Park to serve as appellants, the Court of Appeals held Arizona\'s Attorney General "judicial[ly] estoppe[d]" from again appearing as a party. <i>Id., </i>at 738-739; see also <i>id., </i>at 740 ("[H]aving asked the district court to dismiss him as a party, [the Attorney General] cannot now become one again.").12 With Governor Mofford choosing not to seek Court of Appeals review, the appeal became one to which neither "[the] State [n]or any agency, officer, or employee thereof [was] a party," the Ninth Circuit observed, so the State\'s Attorney General could appear pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b). See 939 F. 2d, at <i>739.13 </i>But, the Ninth Circuit added, \xc2\xa7 2403(b) "confers only a <i>limited </i>right," a right pendent to the AOE/Park appeal, "to make an argument on the question of [Article XXVIII\'s] constitutionality." <i>Id., </i>at 739-740.</p><p>Prior to the Ninth Circuit\'s July 1991 opinion, indeed the very day after AOE, Park, and the Arizona Attorney General filed their notices of appeal, a development of prime importance occurred.

The Court of Appeals assumed, however, that "whenever the constitutionality of a provision of state law is called into question, the state government will have a sufficient interest [to satisfy] Article IlL" <i>Id., </i>at 733, n. 4.

Suggestion of Mootness in Nos. 90-15546 and 90-15581 (CA9), Affidavit and Exh. A.</p><p>One year later, on September 16, 1992, the Ninth Circuit rejected the mootness suggestion. <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/975/646/">975 F.2d 646</a>. The court\'s ruling adopted in large part Yniguez\'s argument opposing a mootness disposition. See App. 194-204 (Appellee Yniguez\'s Response Regarding Mootness Considerations). "[T]he plaintiff may no longer be affected by the English only provision," the Court of Appeals acknowledged. 975 F. 2d, at 647. Nevertheless, the court continued, "[her] constitutional claims may entitle her to an award of nominal damages." <i>Ibid. </i>Her complaint did "not expressly request nominal damages," the Ninth Circuit noted, but "it did request \'all other relief that the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 647, n. 1; see <i>supra, </i>at 50-51. Thus, the Court of Appeals reasoned, one could regard the District Court\'s judgment as including an "implicit denial" of nominal damages. 975</p><p>To permit Yniguez and AOE to clarify their positions, the Ninth Circuit determined to return the case to the District Court. There, with the Ninth Circuit\'s permission, AOE\'s Chairman Park could file a notice of appeal from the District Court\'s judgment, following up the Circuit\'s decision 14 months earlier allowing AOE and Park to intervene. <i>Id., </i>at 647.14 And next, Yniguez could cross-appeal to place before</p><p>14 In their original notice of appeal, filed April 9, 1990, AOE and Park targeted the District Court\'s denial of their motion to intervene.

After argument, on June 21, 1994, the Ninth Circuit allowed Arizonans Against Constitutional Tampering (AACT) and Thomas Espinosa, Chairman of AACT, to intervene as plaintiffs-appellees.

AACT was the principal opponent of the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII. <i>Id., </i>at 1224. In permitting this late intervention, the Court of Appeals noted that "it d[id] not rely on [AACT\'s] standing as a party." <i>Ibid. </i>The standing of the preargument participants, in the Ninth Circuit\'s view, sufficed to support a determination on the merits.

See 975 F. 2d, at 647-648. No state employee later intervened to substitute for Yniguez, nor did Yniguez endeavor to show that others had not sued because they had relied on her suit.</p><p>16 On March 16, 1993, the District Court awarded Yniguez nearly $100,000 in attorney\'s fees.

Petitioners argue primarily that, as initiative proponents, they have a quasilegislative interest in defending the constitutionality of the measure they successfully sponsored. AOE and Park stress the funds and effort they expended to achieve adoption of Article XXVIII. We have recognized that state legislators have standing to contest a decision holding a state statute unconstitutional if state law authorizes legislators to represent the State\'s interests. See <i>Karcher </i>v. <i>May, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/72/case.html">484 U. S. 72</a>, 82 (1987).20 AOE and its members, however, are not elected representatives, and we are aware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State. Nor has this Court ever identified initiative proponents as Article-Ill-qualified defenders of the measures they advocated. Cf. <i>Don\'t Bankrupt Washington Committee </i>v. <i>Continental Ill. Nat. Bank </i><i>&amp; </i><i>Trust Co. of Chicago, </i>460 U.

The requisite concrete injury to AOE members is not apparent. As nonparties in the District Court, AOE\'s members were not bound by the judgment for Yniguez. That judgment had slim precedential effect, see <i>supra, </i>at 58-59, n. 11,21 and it left AOE entirely free to invoke Article XXVIII, \xc2\xa7 4, the citizen suit provision, in state court, where AOE could pursue whatever relief state law authorized. Nor do we discern anything flowing from Article XXVIII\'s citizen suit provision-which authorizes suits to enforce Article XXVIII in state court-that could support standing for Arizona residents in general, or AOE in particular, to defend the Article\'s constitutionality in federal court.</p><p>We thus have grave doubts whether AOE and Park have standing under Article III to pursue appellate review. Nevertheless, we need not definitively resolve the issue. Rather, we will follow a path we have taken before and inquire, as a primary matter, whether originating plaintiff Yniguez still has a case to pursue. See <i>Burke </i>v. <i>Barnes, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/361/case.html">479 U. S. 361</a>, 363, 364, n. (1987) (leaving unresolved question of congressional standing because Court determined case was moot). For purposes of that inquiry, we will assume, <i>arguendo, </i>that AOE and Park had standing to place this case before an appellate tribunal. See <i>id., </i>at 366 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (Court properly assumed standing, even though that matter raised a serious question, in order to analyze mootness issue). We may resolve the question whether</p><p>21 As the District Court observed, the <i>stare decisis </i>effect of that court\'s ruling was distinctly limited. The judgment was "not binding on the Arizona state courts [and did] not foreclose any rights of [AOE] or Park in any future state-court proceeding arising out of Article XXVII!." <i>Yniguez </i>v. <i>Mofford, </i>130 F.

As a state employee subject to Article XXVIII, Yniguez had a viable claim at the outset of the litigation in late 1988. We need not consider whether her case lost vitality in January 1989 when the Attorney General released Opinion No. 189-009. That opinion construed Article XXVIII to require the expression of "official acts" in English, but to leave government employees free to use other languages "if reasonably necessary to the fair and effective delivery of services" to the public. See App. 71, 74; <i>supra, </i>at 52-53, 54; see also <i>Marston\'s Inc. </i>v. <i>Roman Catholic Church of Phoenix, </i>132 Ariz. 90, 94, 644 P. 2d 244, 248 (1982) ("Attorney General opinions are advisory only and are not binding on the court .... This does not mean, however, that citizens may not rely in good faith on Attorney General opinions until the courts have spoken."). Yniguez left her state job in April 1990 to take up employment in the private sector, where her speech was not governed by Article XXVIII. At that point, it became plain that she lacked a still vital claim for prospective relief. Cf. <i>Boyle </i>v. <i>Landry, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/77/case.html">401 U.

See <i>supra, </i>at 60-61.23 It was not dispositive, the court said, that Yniguez "may no longer be affected by the English only provision," 975 F. 2d, at 647, for Yniguez had raised in response to the mootness suggestion "[t]he possibility that [she] may seek nominal damages," <i>ibid.; </i>see App. 197-200 (Appellee Yniguez\'s Response Regarding Mootness Considerations). At that stage of the litigation, however, Yniguez\'s plea for nominal damages was not the possibility the Ninth Circuit imagined.</p><p>Yniguez\'s complaint rested on 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983. See <i>supra, </i>at 49-50, and n. 3.

See App. 7. It was not until September 1991 that the State\'s Attorney General notified the Ninth Circuit of the plaintiff\'s changed circumstances. See <i>id., </i>at 187. Yniguez\'s counsel offered a laconic explanation for this lapse: First, "legal research disclosed that this case was not moot"; second, counsel for the State of Arizona knew of the resignation and "agreed this appeal should proceed." App. 196, n. 2 (Appellee Yniguez\'s Response Regarding Mootness Considerations). The explanation was unsatisfactory. It is the duty of counsel to bring to the federal tribunal\'s attention, <i>"without delay," </i>facts that may raise a question of mootness. See <i>Board of License Comm\'rs of Tiverton </i>v. <i>Pastore, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/238/case.html">469 U. S. 238</a>, 240 (1985) <i>(per curiam). </i>Nor is a change in circumstances bearing on the vitality of a case a matter opposing counsel may withhold from a federal court based on counsels\' agreement that the case should proceed to judgment and not be treated as moot. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Alaska </i>S. S. <i>Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/113/case.html">253 U. S. 113</a>, 116 (1920); R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, &amp; K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 721-722 (7th ed. 1993).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="69">69</a></p><p>District Court\'s February 1990 declaratory judgment ran, see <i>supra, </i>at 55, the Ninth Circuit held the State answerable for the nominal damages Yniguez requested on appeal. See 69 F. 3d, at 948-949 (declaring Yniguez "entitled to nominal damages for prevailing in an action under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983" and noting that "[t]he State of Arizona expressly waived its right to assert the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to the award of nominal damages"). We have held, however, that \xc2\xa7 1983 actions do not lie against a State. <i>Will </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html">491 U. S. 58</a>, 71 (1989). Thus, the claim for relief the Ninth Circuit found sufficient to overcome mootness was nonexistent. The barrier was not, as the Ninth Circuit supposed, Eleventh Amendment immunity, which the State could waive. The stopper was that \xc2\xa7 1983 creates no remedy against a State.24</p><p>Furthermore, under the Ninth Circuit\'s ruling on intervention, the State of Arizona was permitted to participate in the appeal, but not as a party. 939 F. 3d, at 738-740. The Court of Appeals never revised that ruling. To recapitulate,</p><p>24 State officers in their official capacities, like States themselves, are not amenable to suit for damages under \xc2\xa7 1983. See <i>Will </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </i>491 U. S., at 71, and n. 10. State officers are subject to \xc2\xa7 1983 liability for damages in their personal capacities, however, even when the conduct in question relates to their official duties. <i>Hafer </i>v. <i>Melo, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/21/case.html">502 U. S. 21</a>, 25-31 (1991). At no point after the nominal damages solution to mootness surfaced in this case did the Ninth Circuit identify Governor Mofford as a party whose conduct could be the predicate for retrospective relief. That is hardly surprising, for Mofford never participated in any effort to enforce Article XXVIII against Yniguez. Moreover, she opposed the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII, see <i>supra, </i>at 49, n. 1, associated herself with the Attorney General\'s restrained interpretation of the provision, see <i>supra, </i>at 52-53, and was unwilling to appeal from the District Court\'s judgment declaring the Article unconstitutional, see <i>supra, </i>at 56. In this Court, Yniguez raised the possibility of Governor Mofford\'s individual liability under the doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908). See Brief for Respondent Yniguez 21-22. That doctrine, however, permits only prospective relief, not retrospective monetary awards. See <i>Edelman </i>v. <i>Jordan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/case.html">415 U. S. 651</a>, 664 (1974).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="70">70</a></p><p>in July 1991, two months prior to the Attorney General\'s suggestion of mootness, the Court of Appeals rejected the Attorney General\'s plea for party status, as representative of the State. <i>Ibid. </i>The Ninth Circuit accorded the Attorney General the "right [under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b)] to argue the constitutionality of Article XXVIII ... contingent upon AOE and Park\'s bringing the appeal." <i>Id., </i>at 740; see <i>supra, </i>at 59. But see <i>Maine </i>v. <i>Taylor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/case.html">477 U. S. 131</a>, 136-137 (1986) (State\'s \xc2\xa7 2403(b) right to urge on appeal the constitutionality of its laws is not contingent on participation of other appellants). AOE and Park, however, were the sole participants recognized by the Ninth Circuit as defendants-appellants. The Attorney General "ha[d] asked the district court to dismiss him as a party," the Court of Appeals noted, hence he "cannot now become one again." 939 F. 2d, at 740. While we do not rule on the propriety of the Ninth Circuit\'s exclusion of the State as a party, we note this lapse in that court\'s accounting for its decision: The Ninth Circuit did not explain how it arrived at the conclusion that an intervenor the court had designated a nonparty could be subject, nevertheless, to an obligation to pay damages.</p><p>True, Yniguez and the Attorney General took the steps the Ninth Circuit prescribed: Yniguez filed a cross-appeal notice, see <i>supra, </i>at 61; the Attorney General waived the State\'s right to assert the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to an award of nominal damages, see 69 F. 3d, at 948-949. But the earlier, emphatic Court of Appeals ruling remained in place: The State\'s intervention, although proper under \xc2\xa7 2403(b), the Ninth Circuit maintained, gave Arizona no status as a party in the lawsuit. See 939 F. 2d, at 738-740.25</p><p>25 Section 2403(b) by its terms subjects an intervenor "to all liabilities of a party as to <i>court costs" </i>required "for a proper presentation of the facts and law relating to the question of constitutionality." 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b) (emphasis added). It does not subject an intervenor to liability for damages available against a party defendant.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="71">71</a></p><p>In advancing cooperation between Yniguez and the Attorney General regarding the request for and agreement to pay nominal damages, the Ninth Circuit did not home in on the federal courts\' lack of authority to act in friendly or feigned proceedings. Cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Johnson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/302/case.html">319 U. S. 302</a>, 304 (1943) <i>(per curiam) </i>(absent "a genuine adversary issue between ... parties," federal court "may not safely proceed to judgment"). It should have been clear to the Court of Appeals that a claim for nominal damages, extracted late in the day from Yniguez\'s general prayer for relief and asserted solely to avoid otherwise certain mootness, bore close inspection. Cf. <i>Fox </i>v. <i>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of </i>N. <i>Y., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/42/135/">42 F.3d 135</a>, 141-142 (CA2 1994) (rejecting claim for nominal damages proffered to save case from mootness years after litigation began where defendants could have asserted qualified immunity had plaintiffs\' complaint specifically requested monetary relief). On such inspection, the Ninth Circuit might have perceived that Yniguez\'s plea for nominal damages could not genuinely revive the case.26</p><p>When a civil case becomes moot pending appellate adjudication, "[t]he established practice ... in the federal system ... is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Munsingwear, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/case.html">340 U. S. 36</a>, 39 (1950). Vacatur "clears the path for future relitigation" by eliminating a judgment the loser was stopped from opposing on direct review. <i>Id., </i>at 40. Vacatur is in order when mootness occurs through happenstance-circumstances not attributable to the parties-or,</p><p>26 Endeavoring to meet the live case requirement, petitioners AOE and Park posited in this Court several "controversies remaining between the parties." Reply Brief for Petitioners 18-19. Tellingly, none of the asserted controversies involved Yniguez, sole plaintiff and prevailing party in the District Court. See <i>ibid. </i>(describing AOE and Park as adverse to intervenor Arizonans Against Constitution Tampering (AACT), see <i>supra, </i>at 61, AACT as adverse to the State, AOE and Park as adverse to the State).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="72">72</a></p><p>relevant here, the "unilateral action of the party who prevailed in the lower court." <i>U. </i>S. <i>Bancorp Mortgage Co., 513 </i>U.

Yniguez urges that vacatur ought not occur here. She maintains that the State acquiesced in the Ninth Circuit\'s judgment and that, in any event, the District Court judgment should not be upset because it was entered before the mooting event occurred and was not properly appealed. See Brief for Respondent Yniguez 23-25.</p><p>Concerning the Ninth Circuit\'s judgment, Yniguez argues that the State\'s Attorney General effectively acquiesced in that court\'s dispositions when he did not petition for this Court\'s review.

And if that plea failed, he asked, in his motion to intervene, "to be joined as a defendant so that he may participate in all post-judgment proceedings." Record, Doc. No. 93, p. 2. Although denied party status, the Attorney General had, at a minimum, a right secured by Congress, a right to present argument on appeal "on the question of constitutionality." See 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2403(b). He was in the process of pursuing that right when the mooting event occurred.</p><p>We have already recounted the course of proceedings thereafter. First, Yniguez did not tell the Court of Appeals that she had left the State\'s employ. See <i>supra, </i>at 68, n. 23. When that fact was disclosed to the court by the Attorney General, a dismissal for mootness was suggested, and rejected. A mootness disposition at that point was in order, we have just explained. Such a dismissal would have stopped in midstream the Attorney General\'s endeavor, premised on \xc2\xa7 2403(b), to defend the State\'s law against a declaration of unconstitutionality, and so would have warranted a path-clearing vacatur decree.</p><p>The State urges that its current plea for vacatur is compelling in view of the extraordinary course of this litigation.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="75">75</a></p><p>See Brief for Respondents State of Arizona et al. 34 ("It would certainly be a strange doctrine that would permit a plaintiff to obtain a favorable judgment, take voluntary action [that] moot[s] the dispute, and then retain the [benefit of the] judgment."). We agree. The "exceptional circumstances" that abound in this case, see <i>U. </i>S. <i>Bancorp M ortgage Co., </i>513 U. S., at 29, and the federalism concern we next consider, lead us to conclude that vacatur down the line is the equitable solution.</p><p align="center">\nv</p><p>In litigation generally, and in constitutional litigation most prominently, courts in the United States characteristically pause to ask: Is this conflict really necessary? 29 When anticipatory relief is sought in federal court against a state statute, respect for the place of the States in our federal system calls for close consideration of that core question. See, <i>e. g., Poe </i>v. <i>Ullman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a>, 526 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("[N]ormally this Court ought not to consider the Constitutionality of a state statute in the absence of a controlling interpretation of its meaning and effect by the state courts."); <i>Rescue Army </i>v. <i>Municipal Court of Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/549/case.html">331 U. S. 549</a>, 573-574 (1947); Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543, 580-585 (1985).</p><p>Arizona\'s Attorney General, in addition to releasing his own opinion on the meaning of Article XXVIII, see <i>supra, </i>at 52, asked both the District Court and the Court of Appeals to pause before proceeding to judgment; specifically, he asked both federal courts to seek, through the State\'s certification process, an authoritative construction of the new measure from the Arizona Supreme Court. See <i>supra, </i>at 51, and n. 5, 55, 62-63, and nn. 17, 18.</p><p>Certification today covers territory once dominated by a deferral device called <i>"Pullman </i>abstention," after the gen-</p><p>29 The phrasing is borrowed from Traynor, Is This Conflict Really Necessary?, 37 Texas L.

S. 496 (1941). Designed to avoid federal-court error in deciding state-law questions antecedent to federal constitutional issues, the <i>Pullman </i>mechanism remitted parties to the state courts for adjudication of the unsettled state-law issues. If settlement of the state-law question did not prove dispositive of the case, the parties could return to the federal court for decision of the federal issues. Attractive in theory because it placed state-law questions in courts equipped to rule authoritatively on them, <i>Pullman </i>abstention proved protracted and expensive in practice, for it entailed a full round of litigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in federal court. See generally 17 A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4242, 4243 (2d ed. 1988 and Supp. 1996).</p><p>Certification procedure, in contrast, allows a federal court faced with a novel state-law question to put the question directly to the State\'s highest court, reducing the delay, cutting the cost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response. See Note, Federal Courts-Certification Before Facial Invalidation: A Return to Federalism, 12 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 217 (1990). Most States have adopted certification procedures. See generally 17 A Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 4248. Arizona\'s statute, set out <i>supra, </i>at 51, n. 5, permits the State\'s highest court to consider questions certified to it by federal district courts, as well as courts of appeals and this Court.</p><p>Both lower federal courts in this case refused to invite the aid of the Arizona Supreme Court because they found the language of Article XXVIII "plain," and the Attorney General\'s limiting construction unpersuasive. See 730 F. Supp., at 315-316; 69 F. 3d, at 928-931.30 Furthermore, the Ninth</p><p>30 But cf. <i>Huggins </i>v. <i>Isenbarger, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/798/203/">798 F.2d 203</a>, 207-210 <i>(CA71986) </i>(Easterbrook, J., concurring) (reasoned opinion of State Attorney General should be accorded respectful consideration; federal courts should hesitate</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="77">77</a></p><p>Circuit suggested as a proper price for certification a concession by the Attorney General that Article XXVIII "would be unconstitutional if construed as [plaintiff Yniguez] contended it should be." <i>Id., </i>at 930; see <i>id., </i>at 931, and n. 14. Finally, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged the pendency of a case similar to Yniguez\'s in the Arizona court system, but found that litigation no cause for a stay of the federal-court proceedings. See <i>id., </i>at 931; <i>supra, </i>at 62-63, and n. 18 (describing the <i>Ruiz </i>litigation).</p><p>A more cautious approach was in order. Through certification of novel or unsettled questions of state law for authoritative answers by a State\'s highest court, a federal court may save "time, energy, and resources and hel[p] build a cooperative judicial federalism." <i>Lehman Brothers </i>v. <i>Schein, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/386/case.html">416 U. S. 386</a>, 391 (1974); see also <i>Bellotti </i>v. <i>Baird, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html">428 U. S. 132</a>, 148 (1976) (to warrant district court certification, "[i]t is sufficient that the statute is susceptible of ... an interpretation [that] would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge to the statute"). It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, 69 F. 3d, at 930, that in our decision certifying questions in <i>Virginia </i>v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/383/case.html">484 U. S. 383</a> (1988), we noted the State\'s concession that the statute there challenged would be unconstitutional if construed as plaintiffs contended it should be, <i>id., </i>at 393-396. But neither in that case nor in any other did we declare such a concession a condition precedent to certification.</p><p>The District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled out certification primarily because they believed Article XXVIII was not fairly subject to a limiting construction. See 730 F. Supp., at 316 (citing <i>Houston </i>v. <i>Hill, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html">482 U. S. 451</a>, 467 (1987)); 69 F. 3d, at 930. The assurance with which the lower courts reached that judgment is all the more puzzling</p><p>to conclude that "[a State\'s] Executive Branch does not understand state law").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="78">78</a></p><p>in view of the position the initiative sponsors advanced before this Court on the meaning of Article XXVIII.</p><p>At oral argument on December 4, 1996, counsel for petitioners AOE and Park informed the Court that, in petitioners\' view, the Attorney General\'s reading of the Article was "the correct interpretation." Tr. of Oral Arg. 6; see <i>id., </i>at 5 (in response to the Court\'s inquiry, counsel for petitioners stated: "[W]e agree with the Attorney General\'s opinion as to [the] construction of Article XXVIII on [constitutional] grounds."). The Ninth Circuit found AOE\'s "explanations as to the initiative\'s scope ... confused and selfcontradictory," 69 F. 3d, at 928, n. 12, and we agree that AOE wavered in its statements of position, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Brief for Petitioners 15 (AOE may "protect its political and statutory rights against the State and government employees"), 32-39 (Article XXVIII regulates Yniguez\'s "language on the job"), 44 ("AOE might ... sue the State for limiting Art. XXVIII"). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals understood that the ballot initiative proponents themselves at least "partially endorsed the Attorney General\'s reading." 69 F. 3d, at 928, n. 12. Given the novelty of the question and its potential importance to the conduct of Arizona\'s business, plus the views of the Attorney General and those of Article XXVIII\'s sponsors, the certification requests merited more respectful consideration than they received in the proceedings below.</p><p>Federal courts, when confronting a challenge to the constitutionality of a federal statute, follow a "cardinal principle":</p><p>They "will first ascertain whether a construction ... is fairly possible" that will contain the statute within constitutional bounds. See <i>Ashwander </i>v. <i>TV A, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html">297 U.

State courts, when interpreting state statutes, are similarly equipped to apply that cardinal principle.

See <i>Rescue Army, </i>331 U. S., at 573-574. "Speculation by a federal court about the meaning of a state statute in the absence of prior state court adjudication is particularly gratuitous when ... the state courts stand willing to address questions of state law on certification from a federal court." <i>Brockett </i>v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/case.html">472 U. S. 491</a>, 510 (1985) (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring).</p><p>Blending abstention with certification, the Ninth Circuit found "no unique circumstances in this case militating in favor of certification." 69 F. 3d, at 931. Novel, unsettled questions of state law, however, not "unique circumstances," are necessary before federal courts may avail themselves of state certification procedures.31 Those procedures do not entail the delays, expense, and procedural complexity that generally attend abstention decisions. See <i>supra, </i>at 76. Taking advantage of certification made available by a State may "greatly simplif[y]" an ultimate adjudication in federal court. See <i>Bellotti, </i>428 U. S., at 151.</p><p>The course of Yniguez\'s case was complex. The complexity might have been avoided had the District Court, more than eight years ago, accepted the certification suggestion made by Arizona\'s Attorney General. The Arizona Supreme Court was not asked by the District Court or the Court of Appeals to say what Article XXVIII means. But the State\'s highest court has that very question before it in</p><p>31 Arizona itself requires no "unique circumstances." It permits certification to the State\'s highest court of matters "which may be determinative of the cause," and as to which "no controlling precedent" is apparent to the certifying court. Ariz. Rev.

In <i>Ruiz, </i>which has been stayed pending our decision in this case, see <i>supra, </i>at 63, n. 18, the Arizona Supreme Court may now rule definitively on the proper construction of Article XXVIII. Once that court has spoken, adjudication of any remaining federal constitutional question may indeed become greatly simplified.</p><p>***</p><p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court with directions that the action be dismissed by the District Court.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT ARTICLE XXVIII.
