Counsel\'s reason for not speaking to the officer was that, "I personally don\'t like the man." Record, Vol. VI, p. 35.

One such example is the statement of petitioner\'s former teacher and athletic coach at Butler High School: </p><ul>"To understand what an exceptional person Billy Mitchell was at that time, one must understand that, while a comprehensive high school, Butler at the time was a segregated school in the middle of a very impoverished area-what might be called today a ghetto. In that locale and setting, Billy Mitchell was a rarity because of the exceptional character he displayed at Butler." Record 958-959.</ul> <p> Acquaintances and professionals described petitioner as "the type of person people naturally got along with," id., at 967; "the kind of person you could depend on for assistance in everything," id., at 956; "a hard worker who devoted a lot of time to school activities, especially activities involving younger kids," id.; "a fine student and athlete," id., at 980; a person of "character and personality . . . so atypical for someone convicted of a serious crime," id., at 1001; "not . . . the type of person that should be executed and given no further chance to live out a meaningful life," id., at 967. Petitioner\'s sisters explained that petitioner took care of his eleven brothers and sisters while his mother worked, id., at 953, and that petitioner took a job in the eighth grade to help support his family, id., at 941. </p><p> An account of what happened to this well-adjusted young person was also readily available to anyone who took the time to ask. When petitioner was 16 years old, his parents were divorced, and soon thereafter petitioner got into trouble. He and two friends were arrested for attempted robbery. Petitioner professed his innocence, but was persuaded by his father to plead guilty, id., at 948, because "things would go easier for him," id., at 963. The charges against the two friends were dropped. Petitioner was sentenced to six months in prison, where he was subjected to repeated violent homosexual attacks, experienced severe depression, and lost 30 pounds. Id., at 996-997. When he was re- [1029 </p><p>leased, he continued to be highly depressed, and eventually committed the crime for which he received a sentence of death. </p><h3><p> II </p></h3> <p> Counsel\'s explanation for his total lack of preparation for the sentencing hearing is that he carried an "ace in the hole." Id., at 43. His sole strategy for representing his client\'s interest rested on his belief that, under Georgia law, the State would not be permitted to introduce any evidence of aggravating circumstances of which the defense had not been notified in writing. Prior to sentencing, the State had provided petitioner\'s counsel with oral notice of the aggravating circumstances upon which it would rely, but had not furnished written notice. Although the state statute upon which counsel\'s theory relied did not mention written notice, and no court decision had ever required that such notice be in writing, counsel was content to rest his entire defense, and the fate of his client, on an untried legal theory. At sentencing, counsel took the first opportunity to object to the admission of aggravating evidence of which he had not received prior written notice; the court promptly overruled his objection, and the "ace in the hole" was gone. Record 198. Even if counsel had been correct in his interpretation of state law, of course, the State could have provided the requisite written notice at any time before the hearing, which would have left petitioner equally defenseless. </p><p> At the habeas corpus hearing, petitioner\'s attorney also claimed that he had not wished to present any mitigating character evidence because that would have opened the door to the State\'s introduction of petitioner\'s prior conviction. Record, Vol. V, p. 16. Under some circumstances, such a decision might be considered a reasonable strategy. In this case, however, it was patently unreasonable. Counsel conceded, at the habeas proceeding, that he had known nothing of the facts and circumstances of the prior conviction, other than that it was a felony. Record, Vol. VI, p. 47. If he had made an inquiry, and if he had acquainted himself at all with what type of mitigating character evidence was available, he might have been in a position to make a professional judgment as to whether the substantial mitigating evidence would be outweighed by the prejudice resulting from the introduction of petitioner\'s guilty plea to attempted robbery at the age of 16, the two alleged accomplices to which had been released. Further, he might have decided to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1030">Page 483 U.S. 1026 , 1030</a></p><p> emphasize to the court that the prior conviction was intimately connected to the entire sequence of events that formed a compelling case for mitigation. But no such balancing was made, for counsel had no information to place on either side of the scales. Moreover, under state law, the prior conviction would have been admissible even though the defense put on no evidence. See 762 F.2d, at 890. If counsel in this case made any decisions at all, they were barren of even minimal supporting information or knowledge. </p><p> Counsel\'s final excuse for conducting no defense is a vague perception that the client was reluctant to have the attorney probe into his background, for reasons counsel did not know and did not attempt to find out. Record, Vol. VI, p. 63. Counsel felt that petitioner, who had finished two years in a junior college, was intelligent and capable of making his own decisions. There is no indication, however, that counsel took any steps to inform his client of the consequences of the various alternatives. Although counsel explained to petitioner his "ace in the hole" strategy for the sentencing hearing, ibid., it is not clear that he warned petitioner that the strategy might fail, or that petitioner stood a good chance of being sentenced to death. Nor is there any indication that the attorney explained the importance of mitigating evidence at a sentencing proceeding, or the potential value of petitioner\'s taking the stand himself. Counsel has not alleged that petitioner insisted on any particular line of defense or on any particular conduct by counsel. Rather, he provided no services on behalf of his client because he felt that the client was reluctant to involve his family and friends, perhaps out of a "sense of embarrassment." Ibid. </p><p> Our decisions have recognized that attorneys must have a wide degree of latitude to make strategic decisions on the basis of their knowledge of the law. We have stressed that the judgment of an attorney should not be second-guessed, as long as it falls within the sphere of professional reasonableness. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S., at 689. Nevertheless, an attorney\'s decision to advance a defense that is wholly unfounded in law, combined with a failure to investigate the merit of accepted and persuasive defenses, cannot be characterized as "sound trial strategy." See Michel v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/91/case.html#101">350 U.S. 91, 101</a>, 164 (1955). Indeed, such a decision is not strategic at all ; it is incompetent. "The failure of an attorney to inform his client of the relevant law clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analysis . . ." Hill v. Lockhart, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1031">Page 483 U.S. 1026 , 1031</a></p><p> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/case.html">474 U.S. 52</a>, ___, 372 (1985) (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). In this case, that failure was aggravated by the additional failure to discover what meritorious defenses were available before rejecting them in favor of a frivolous technical defense. This conduct is professionally unreasonable. </p><p> As a result of counsel\'s nonfeasance, no one argued to the sentencing judge that petitioner should not die. The judge heard only a technical argument regarding the admissibility of aggravating circumstances without prior written notice, which he consistently rejected, in addition to a reference to petitioner\'s youth. These arguments were hardly an effective rebuttal to the testimony of the victim\'s mother and the police officers. Prejudice to the defendant\'s case is obvious when not even a suggestion that petitioner\'s life had some value, that his crime was aberrational, or that he was suffering from severe depression reached the ears and the conscience of the sentencing judge. See Burger v. Kemp, --- U.S., at ___ - ___ (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). The judge heard not even a plea for mercy. </p><h3><p> III </p></h3> <p> This Court has repeatedly insisted that unfettered consideration of mitigating evidence is an essential aspect of the process by which the States adjudicate the appropriateness of putting a person to death. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 2722d ___ (1987), slip op. at 12; Eddings v. Oklahoma, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/case.html#112">455 U.S. 104, 112</a>, 875 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#605">438 U.S. 586, 605</a>, 2965 (1978); Woodson v. North Carolina, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#303">428 U.S. 280, 303</a>, 2990 (1976). Accordingly, we have not permitted a State to insulate the capital sentencer from considerations favorable to the defendant. The reliability of the process depends upon the sentencer\'s consideration of both tangibles and intangibles, see Caldwell v. Mississippi, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/320/case.html#330">472 U.S. 320, 330</a>, 2640 (1985), in evaluating the individual character of the defendant and his acts. In light of the importance that this Court has placed upon the role of mitigating evidence in capital sentencing decisions, I cannot believe that Strickland was intended to permit a defendant to be sentenced to death solely on the basis of the State\'s evidence, when a powerful defense easily could have been marshaled on his behalf. Any reasonable standard of professionalism governing the conduct of a capital defense must impose upon the attorney, at a minimum, the obligation to explore the aspects of his client\'s character that might persuade the sentencer to spare his life. Without even this effort by the defense, the adversarial process breaks down. [1032 </p><p> By denying certiorari in this compelling case, the Court has refused to apply Strickland in a manner that gives meaning to the constitutional values from which it was derived. I dissent.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
