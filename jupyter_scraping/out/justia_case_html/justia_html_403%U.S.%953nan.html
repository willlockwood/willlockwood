Petitioner was sentenced to death for murder. Six items of exonerating evidence were not disclosed to him at trial. The court below affirmed on the ground that the prosecution\'s duty to disclose exonerating evidence depends upon a request; that the prosecutor had shown his entire file to defense counsel at trial and no further request for disclosure was made. None of the exonerating items was contained in said file. Trial defense counsel were ignorant of the existence of the suppressed information.</ul> <ul>\'Questions presented are: \'(a) Whether a request is an indispensable prerequisite to disclosure of exonerating evidence by the State? \'(b) Whether material evidence favorable to an accused should be disclosed by the State without a request where such evidence is not recorded? \'(c) Whether denial of due process of law is contingent upon a request where a State knowingly permits false testimony to remain uncorrected? \'(d) Where a prosecutor shows his entire file to defense counsel at trial, but none of the exonerating items of evidence are contained in said file, does that satisfy the prosecution\'s duty of disclosure? \'(e) Whether nondisclosure of the prosecuting police department is imputable to the prosecution?</ul> <ul>\'3.
