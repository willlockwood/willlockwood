By reason whereof, &amp;c.\' </p><p> It appeared, on the trial of the cause, that the oath in question was voluntarily taken by the plaintiff, in order to satisfy the defendant upon a controverted fact, involved in the suit depending before the Justice, and in which the situation of the present parties was reversed: Mitchell, being then the plaintiff, and Rue, the defendant. There was a verdict for the plaintiff, with damages; but the cause was again brought before the Court, on a motion in arrest of judgment, which was founded on two grounds: 1st. That the words charged in the declaration, did not import perjury, in a legal acceptation of their meaning; and therefore did not, in themselves, independent of any injurious consequence to the plaintiff, render the speaker liable to an action at law. And, 2nd. That the oath does not appear, in the declaration, to have been of a nature, that by taking it the party could commit the legal crime of perjury. </p><p> I. M\'Kean. J. B. in support of the motion, observed, that actions of slander ought not to be encouraged; and that they had hitherto been strictly confined to cases, which endanger a man in law; which exclude him from society; which impair the exercise and benefit of his trade or profession; or, which may affect magistrates, or other persons, employed in public trusts.

But, in the next place, the oath must appear to have been a lawful one, administered in the course of a judicial proceeding, upon a matter material to the issue on trial. 2 Bulst. 150. The oath, in question, was merely a voluntary affidavit; and that, too, taken by a man in his own cause; which can never judicially be allowed: The Justice could not have compelled him, and ought not to have permitted him, to take it. I Hawk. P. C. 174-5. 4 Bac. Abr. 484. For that cause alone, the judgments of Justices have often been reversed in the Supreme Court; and the act of taking, or administering, voluntary affidavits, is highly censured by Sir William Blackstone, 4 Bl.
