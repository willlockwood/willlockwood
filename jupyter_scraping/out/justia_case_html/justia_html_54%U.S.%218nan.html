JUSTICE CATRON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The only question this case presents that we deem worthy of notice is whether the paper sued on is a negotiable instrument; it is as follows:</p>\n<p>"No. 959.  Mississippi Union Bank, Jackson, Miss Feb. 8, 1840.  I hereby certify, that Hugh Short has deposited in this bank, payable twelve months from 1 May, 1839, with 5 percent interest till due, fifteen hundred dollars, for the use of Henry Miller, and payable only to his order upon the return of this certificate. $1,500.  Wm. P. Grayson, Cashier."</p>\n<p>The suit was by the last endorsee against his immediate endorser, and brought in Ohio.  The statute of that state declares all promissory notes, drawn for a sum certain, payable to any person or order or to any person or his assigns negotiable by endorsement.</p>\n<p>The established doctrine is that a promise to deliver or to be accountable for, so much money is a good bill or note.  Here the sum is certain, and the promise direct.  Every reason exists </p><p><a class="page-number" name="229">Page 54 U. S. 229</a></p><p> why the endorser of this paper should be held responsible to his endorsee that can prevail in cases where the paper endorsed is in the ordinary form of a promissory note, and as such note, the state courts generally have treated certificates of deposit payable to order, and the principles adopted by the state courts in coming to this conclusion are fully sustained by the writers of treatises on bills and notes.  Being of opinion that the circuit court properly held the paper endorsed negotiable, it is ordered that the judgment be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Ohio and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed with costs and damages at the rate of six percentum per annum.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
