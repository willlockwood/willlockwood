Respondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, filed suit in federal court, challenging Proposition 8 under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the \n \nFourteenth Amendment, and naming as defendants California\xe2\x80\x99s Governor and other state and local officials responsible for enforcing California\xe2\x80\x99s marriage laws.  The officials refused to defend the law, so the District Court allowed petitioners\xe2\x80\x94the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s official proponents\xe2\x80\x94to intervene to defend it.  After a bench trial, the court declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional and enjoined the public officials named as defendants from enforcing the law.  Those officials elected not to appeal, but petitioners did.  The Ninth Circuit certified a question to the California Supreme Court: whether official proponents of a ballot initiative have authority to assert the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in defending the constitutionality of the initiative when public officials refuse to do so.  After the California Supreme Court answered in the affirmative, the Ninth Circuit concluded that petitioners had standing under federal law to defend Proposition 8\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  On the merits, the court affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Petitioners did not have standing to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72.  One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so.  In other words, the litigant must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible harm.  Although most standing cases consider whether a plaintiff has satisfied the requirement when filing suit, Article III demands that an \xe2\x80\x9cactual controversy\xe2\x80\x9d persist throughout all stages of litigation.  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Standing \xe2\x80\x9cmust be met by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43\n.  The parties do not contest that respondents had standing to initiate this case against the California officials responsible for enforcing Proposition 8.  But once the District Court issued its order, respondents no longer had any injury to redress, and the state officials chose not to appeal.  The only individuals who sought to appeal were petitioners, who had intervened in the District Court, but they had not been ordered to do or refrain from doing anything.  Their only interest was to vindicate the constitutional validity of a generally applicable California law.  As this Court has repeatedly held, such a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralized grievance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94no matter how sincere\xe2\x80\x94is insufficient to confer standing.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555\n\xe2\x80\x93574.  Petitioners claim that the California Constitution and election laws give them a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unique,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98special,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98distinct\xe2\x80\x99 role in the initiative process,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 5, but that is only true during the process of enacting the law.  Once Proposition 8 was approved, it became a duly enacted constitutional amendment.  Petitioners have no role\xe2\x80\x94special or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94in its enforcement.  They therefore have no \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal stake\xe2\x80\x9d in defending its enforcement that is distinguishable from the general interest of every California citizen.  No matter how deeply committed petitioners may be to upholding Proposition 8, that is not a particularized interest sufficient to create a case or controversy under Article III.

May, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 72 (1987)\n.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 6.  But far from supporting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 standing, Karcher is compelling precedent against it.  In that case, after the New Jersey attorney general refused to defend the constitutionality of a state law, leaders of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature were permitted to appear, in their official capacities, in the District Court and Court of Appeals to defend the law.  What is significant about Karcher, however, is what happened after the Court of Appeals decision.  The legislators lost their leadership positions, but nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court.  The Court held that they could not do so.  Although they could participate in the lawsuit in their official capacities as presiding officers of the legislature, as soon as they lost that capacity, they lost standing.  Id., at 81.  Petitioners here hold no office and have always participated in this litigation solely as private parties.

Arizona, supra.  There, in expressing \xe2\x80\x9cgrave doubts\xe2\x80\x9d about the standing of ballot initiative sponsors to defend the constitutionality of an Arizona initiative, the Court noted that it was \xe2\x80\x9caware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 65.  Petitioners argue that, by virtue of the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, they are authorized to act as \xe2\x80\x9cagents of the people of California.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 15.  But that Court never described petitioners as \xe2\x80\x9cagents of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  All the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision stands for is that, so far as California is concerned, petitioners may \xe2\x80\x9cassert legal arguments in defense of the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the validity of the initiative measure\xe2\x80\x9d in federal court.  628 F.\xc2\xa03d 1191, 1193.  That interest is by definition a generalized one, and it is precisely because proponents assert such an interest that they lack standing under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Petitioners are also plainly not agents of the State.  As an initial matter, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with their representations to the District Court, where they claimed to represent their own interests as official proponents.  More to the point, the basic features of an agency relationship are missing here: Petitioners are not subject to the control of any principal, and they owe no fiduciary obligation to anyone.  As one amicus puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe proponents apparently have an unelected appointment for an unspecified period of time as defenders of the initiative, however and to whatever extent they choose to defend it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Walter Dellinger 23.

But standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law.  No matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this Court\xe2\x80\x99s settled law to the contrary.  Article III\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of the Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers.  States cannot alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.

That question has also given rise to litigation.

Respondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, view the issue in somewhat different terms: For them, it is whether California\xe2\x80\x94having previously recognized the right of same-sex couples to marry\xe2\x80\x94may reverse that decision through a referendum.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFederal courts have authority under the Constitution to answer such questions only if necessary to do so in the course of deciding an actual \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  As used in the Constitution, those words do not include every sort of dispute, but only those \xe2\x80\x9chistorically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Flast v.

In\xc2\xa0re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757, 183 P.\xc2\xa03d 384.  Later that year, California voters passed the ballot initiative at the center of this dispute, known as Proposition 8.  That proposition amended the California Constitution to provide that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Const., Art.

Id., at 388, 207 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 61.  Under California law, same-sex couples have a right to enter into relationships recognized by the State as \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic partnerships,\xe2\x80\x9d which carry \xe2\x80\x9cthe same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal.

Those officials refused to defend the law, although they have continued to enforce it throughout this litigation.  The District Court allowed petitioners\xe2\x80\x94the official proponents of the initiative, see Cal. Elec. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7342 (West 2003)\xe2\x80\x94to intervene to defend it.  After a 12-day bench trial, the District Court declared Proposition 8 uncon-stitutional, permanently enjoining the California officials named as defendants from enforcing the law, and \xe2\x80\x9cdirecting the official defendants that all persons under their control or supervision\xe2\x80\x9d shall not enforce it.

Without addressing whether the proponents have a particularized interest of their own in an initiative\xe2\x80\x99s validity, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a postelection challenge to a voter-approved initiative measure, the official proponents of the initiative are authorized under California law to appear and assert the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s validity and to appeal a judgment invalidating the measure when the public officials who ordinarily defend the measure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perry v.

Charles, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 54, \n62 (1986)\n).  \xe2\x80\x9cAll a federal court need determine is that the state has suffered a harm sufficient to confer standing and that the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the court is authorized by the state to represent its interest in remedying that harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  671 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1072.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the merits, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court.  The court held the Proposition unconstitutional under the rationale of our decision in Romer v. Evans, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 620 (1996)\n.  671 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1076, 1095.  In the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, Romer stands for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Equal Protection Clause requires the state to have a legitimate reason for withdrawing a right or benefit from one group but not others, whether or not it was required to confer that right or benefit in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d  671 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1083\xe2\x80\x931084.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ctaking away the official designation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d from same-sex couples, while continuing to afford those couples all the rights and obligations of marriage, did not further any legitimate interest of the State.  Id., at 1095.  Proposition 8, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, violated the Equal Protection Clause because it served no purpose \xe2\x80\x9cbut to impose on gays and lesbians, through the public law, a majority\xe2\x80\x99s private disapproval of them and their relationships.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari to review that determination, and directed that the parties also brief and argue \xe2\x80\x9cWhether petitioners have standing under Article III, \xc2\xa72, of the Constitution in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArticle III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72.  One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so.  This requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555\n\xe2\x80\x93561 (1992).  In other words, for a federal court to have authority under the Constitution to settle a dispute, the party before it must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible harm.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe presence of a disagreement, however sharp and acrimonious it may be, is insufficient by itself to meet Art.

Instead, the principal sponsor of the ballot initiative\xe2\x80\x94the Arizonans for Official English Committee\xe2\x80\x94sought to defend the measure in the Ninth Circuit.  Id., at 55\xe2\x80\x9356, 58.  Analogizing the sponsors to the Arizona Legislature, the Ninth Circuit held that the Committee was \xe2\x80\x9cqualified to defend [the initiative] on appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d and affirmed the District Court.

Id., at 66.  We reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tanding to defend on appeal in the place of an original defendant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. demands that the litigant possess \xe2\x80\x98a direct stake in the outcome.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 64 (quoting Diamond, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 62).  We recognized that a legislator authorized by state law to represent the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest may satisfy standing requirements, as in Karcher, supra, at 82, but noted that the Arizona committee and its members were \xe2\x80\x9cnot elected representatives, and we [we]re aware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arizonans for Official English, supra, at 65.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners argue that, by virtue of the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, they are authorized to act \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as agents of the people\xe2\x80\x99 of California.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 15 (quoting Arizonans for Official English, supra, at 65).

The Ninth Circuit asked\xe2\x80\x94and the California Supreme Court answered\xe2\x80\x94only whether petitioners had \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority to assert the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  628 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1193; 52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1005.  All that the California Supreme Court decision stands for is that, so far as California is concerned, petitioners may argue in defense of Proposition 8.  This \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not mean that the proponents become de\xc2\xa0facto public officials\xe2\x80\x9d; the authority they enjoy is \xe2\x80\x9csimply the authority to participate as parties in a court action and to assert legal arguments in defense of the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the validity of the initiative measure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1159, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1029.  That interest is by definition a generalized one, and it is precisely because proponents assert such an interest that they lack standing under our precedents.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd petitioners are plainly not agents of the State\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cformal\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise, see post, at 7.  As an initial matter, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with their representations to the District Court.  When the proponents sought to intervene in this case, they did not purport to be agents of California.  They argued instead that \xe2\x80\x9cno other party in this case w[ould] adequately rep-resent their interests as official proponents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Motion to Intervene in No. 09\xe2\x80\x932292 (ND Cal.), p. 6 (emphasis  added).  It was their \xe2\x80\x9cunique legal status\xe2\x80\x9d as official  proponents\xe2\x80\x94not an agency relationship with the people of California\xe2\x80\x94that petitioners claimed \xe2\x80\x9cendow[ed] them with a significantly protectable interest\xe2\x80\x9d in ensuring that the District Court not \xe2\x80\x9cundo[ ] all that they ha[d] done in obtaining .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. enactment\xe2\x80\x9d of Proposition 8.

Agency requires more than mere authorization to assert a particular interest.  \xe2\x80\x9cAn essential element of agency is the principal\xe2\x80\x99s right to control the agent\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Restatement (Third) of Agency \xc2\xa71.01, Comment f (2005) (hereinafter Restatement).  Yet petitioners answer to no one; they decide for themselves, with no review, what arguments to make and how to make them.  Unlike California\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, they are not elected at regular intervals\xe2\x80\x94or elected at all.  See Cal. Const., Art. V, \xc2\xa711.  No provision provides for their removal.  As one amicus explains, \xe2\x80\x9cthe proponents apparently have an unelected appointment for an unspecified period of time as defenders of the initiative, however and to whatever extent they choose to defend it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Walter Dellinger 23.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf the relationship between two persons is one of agency .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , the agent owes a fiduciary obligation to the principal.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Restatement \xc2\xa71.01, Comment e.  But petitioners owe nothing of the sort to the people of California.  Unlike California\xe2\x80\x99s elected officials, they have taken no oath of office.  E.g., Cal. Const., Art. XX, \xc2\xa73 (prescribing the oath for \xe2\x80\x9call public officers and employees, executive, legislative, and judicial\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the California Supreme Court explained, petitioners are bound simply by \xe2\x80\x9cthe same ethical constraints that apply to all other parties in a legal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Cal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1029.  They are free to pursue a purely ideological commit- ment to the law\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality without the need to take cognizance of resource constraints, changes in  public opinion, or potential ramifications for other state priorities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the California Supreme Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question of who should bear responsibility for any attorney fee award .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is entirely distinct from the question\xe2\x80\x9d before it.

Nor do we question California\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign right to maintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to defend their initiatives in California courts, where Article III does not apply.  But as the dissent acknowledges, see post, at 1, standing in federal court is a question of federal law, not state law.  And no matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override our settled law to the contrary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Article III requirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of the Judiciary in our system of separated powers.  \xe2\x80\x9cRefusing to entertain generalized grievances ensures that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courts exercise power that is judicial in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d Lance, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 441, and ensures that the Federal Judiciary respects \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper\xe2\x80\x94and properly limited\xe2\x80\x94role of the courts in a democratic society,\xe2\x80\x9d  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v.

Proper resolution of the justiciability question requires, in this case, a threshold determination of state law.  The state-law question is how California defines and elaborates the status and authority of an initiative\xe2\x80\x99s proponents who seek to intervene in court to defend the initiative after its adoption by the electorate.  Those state-law issues have been addressed in a metic- ulous and unanimous opinion by the Supreme Court of California.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder California law, a proponent has the authority to appear in court and assert the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in defending an enacted initiative when the public officials charged with that duty refuse to do so.  The State deems such an appearance essential to the integrity of its initiative process.  Yet the Court today concludes that this state-defined status and this state-conferred right fall short of meeting federal requirements because the proponents cannot point to a formal delegation of authority that tracks the requirements of the Restatement of Agency.  But the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition of proponents\xe2\x80\x99 powers is binding on this Court.  And that definition is fully sufficient to establish the standing and adversity that are requisites for justiciability under Article III of the United States Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view Article III does not require California, when deciding who may appear in court to defend an initiative on its behalf, to comply with the Restatement of Agency or with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of how a State should make its laws or structure its government.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning does not take into account the fundamental principles or the practical dynamics of the initiative system in California, which uses this mechanism to control and to bypass pub- lic officials\xe2\x80\x94the same officials who would not defend the initiative, an injury the Court now leaves unremedied.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision also has implications for the 26 other States that use an initiative or popular referendum system and which, like California, may choose to have initiative proponents stand in for the State when public officials decline to defend an initiative in litigation.  See M. Waters, Initiative and Referendum Almanac 12 (2003).  In my sub- mission, the Article III requirement for a justiciable case or controversy does not prevent proponents from having their day in court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese are the premises for this respectful dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court explains, the State of California sustained a concrete injury, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III, when a United States District Court nullified a portion of its State Constitution.  See ante, at 11 (citing Maine v. Taylor, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 131, \n137 (1986)\n).  To determine whether justiciability continues in appellate proceedings after the State Executive acquiesced in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s adverse judgment, it is necessary to ascertain what persons, if any, have \xe2\x80\x9cauthority under state law to represent the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests\xe2\x80\x9d in federal court.  Karcher v. May, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 72, \n82 (1987)\n; see also Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43, \n65 (1997)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court notes, the California Elections Code does not on its face prescribe in express terms the duties or rights of proponents once the initiative becomes law.  Ante, at 8.  If that were the end of the matter, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis would have somewhat more force.  But it is not the end of the matter.  It is for California, not this Court, to determine whether and to what extent the Elections Code provisions are instructive and relevant in determining the authority of proponents to assert the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in postenactment judicial proceedings.  And it is likewise not for this Court to say that a State must determine the substance and meaning of its laws by statute, or by judicial decision, or by a combination of the two.  See Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n\n354 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, \n255 (1957)\n (plurality opinion); Dreyer v. Illinois, \n\n187 U.\xc2\xa0S. 71, \n84 (1902)\n.  That, too, is for the State to decide.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court, in determining the substance of state law, is \xe2\x80\x9cbound by a state court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a state statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wisconsin v. Mitchell, \n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476, \n483 (1993)\n.  And the Supreme Court of California, in response to the certified question submitted to it in this case, has determined that State Elections Code provisions directed to initiative proponents do inform and instruct state law respecting the rights and status of proponents in postelection judicial proceedings.  Here, in reliance on these statutes and the California Constitution, the State Supreme Court has held that proponents do have authority \xe2\x80\x9cunder California law to appear and assert the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s validity and appeal a judgment invalidating the measure when the public officials who ordinarily defend the measure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perry v. Brown, 52 Cal. 4th 1116, 1127, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d 1002, 1007 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reasons the Supreme Court of California gave for its holding have special relevance in the context of determining whether proponents have the authority to seek a federal-court remedy for the State\xe2\x80\x99s concrete, substantial, and continuing injury.  As a class, official proponents are a small, identifiable group.  See Cal. Elec. Code Ann. \xc2\xa79001(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2013).  Because many of their decisions must be unanimous, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79001(b)(1), 9002(b), they are necessarily few in number.  Their identities are public.  \xc2\xa79001(b)(2).  Their commitment is substantial.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79607\xe2\x80\x939609 (West Cum. Supp. 2013) (obtaining pe- tition signatures); \xc2\xa79001(c) (monetary fee); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79065(d), 9067, 9069 (West 2003) (drafting arguments for official ballot pamphlet).  They know and understand the purpose and operation of the proposed law, an important requisite in defending initiatives on complex matters such as taxation and insurance.  Having gone to great lengths to convince voters to enact an initiative, they have a stake in the outcome and the necessary commitment to provide zealous advocacy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, in California, proponents play a \xe2\x80\x9cunique role .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the initiative process.\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Cal. 4th, at 1152, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1024.  They \xe2\x80\x9chave a unique relationship to the voter-approved measure that makes them especially likely to be reliable and vigorous advocates for the measure and to be so viewed by those whose votes secured the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s enactment into law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see also id., at 1160, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1030 (because of \xe2\x80\x9ctheir special relationship to the ini- tiative measure,\xe2\x80\x9d proponents are \xe2\x80\x9cthe most obvious and logical private individuals to ably and vigorously defend the validity of the challenged measure on behalf of the interests of the voters who adopted the initiative into law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Proponents\xe2\x80\x99 authority under state law is not a contrivance.  It is not a fictional construct.  It is the product of the California Constitution and the California Elections Code.  There is no basis for this Court to set aside the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of state law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Court of California explained that its holding was consistent with recent decisions from other States.  Id., at 1161\xe2\x80\x931165, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1031\xe2\x80\x931033.  In Sportsmen for I\xe2\x80\x93143 v. Fifteenth Jud. Ct.,  2002 MT 18, 308 Mont. 189, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d 400, the Montana Supreme Court unanimously held that because initiative sponsors \xe2\x80\x9cmay be in the best position to defend their interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the initiative and had a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect, substantial, legally protectable interest in\xe2\x80\x9d the lawsuit challenging that interpretation, they were \xe2\x80\x9centitled to intervene as a matter of right.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 194\xe2\x80\x93195, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 403.  The Alaska Supreme Court reached a similar unanimous result in Alaskans for a Common Language Inc., v. Kritz, 3 P.\xc2\xa03d 906 (2000).  It noted that, except in extraordinary cases, \xe2\x80\x9ca sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s direct interest in legislation enacted through the initiative process and the concomitant need to avoid the appearance of [a conflict of interest] will ordinarily preclude courts from denying intervention as of right to a sponsoring group.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 914.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these and other reasons, the Supreme Court of California held that the California Elections Code and Article II, \xc2\xa78, of the California Constitution afford proponents \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to assert the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the validity of the initiative\xe2\x80\x9d when State officials decline to do so.  52 Cal. 4th, at 1152, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1024.

It notes that they \xe2\x80\x9care not elected,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9canswer to no one,\xe2\x80\x9d and lack \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a fiduciary obligation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the State.  Ante, at 15 (quoting 1 Restatement (Third) of Agency \xc2\xa71.01, Comments e, f (2005)).  But what the Court deems deficiencies in the proponents\xe2\x80\x99 connection to the State government, the State Supreme Court saw as essential qualifications to defend the initiative system.  The very object of the initiative system is to establish a lawmaking process that does not depend upon state officials.  In California, the popular initiative is necessary to implement \xe2\x80\x9cthe theory that all power of government ultimately resides in the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Cal. 4th, at 1140, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1016 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The right to adopt initiatives has been described by the California courts as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most precious rights of [the State\xe2\x80\x99s] democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  That historic role for the initiative system \xe2\x80\x9cgrew out of dissatisfaction with the then governing public officials and a widespread belief that the people had lost control of the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The initiative\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d then, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to afford the people the ability to propose and to adopt constitutional amendments or statutory provisions that their elected public officials had refused or declined to adopt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe California Supreme Court has determined that this purpose is undermined if the very officials the initiative process seeks to circumvent are the only parties who can defend an enacted initiative when it is challenged in a legal proceeding.  See id., at 1160, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1030; cf. Alaskans for a Common Language, supra, at 914 (noting that proponents must be allowed to defend an enacted initiative in order to avoid the perception, correct or not, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the interests of [the proponents] were not being defended vigorously by the executive branch\xe2\x80\x9d).  Giving the Governor and attorney general this de\xc2\xa0facto veto will erode one of the cornerstones of the State\xe2\x80\x99s governmental structure.  See 52 Cal. 4th, at 1126\xe2\x80\x931128, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1006\xe2\x80\x931007.  And in light of the frequency with which initiatives\xe2\x80\x99 opponents resort to litigation, the impact of that veto could be substantial.  K. Miller, Direct Democracy and the Courts 106 (2009) (185 of the 455 initiatives approved in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington between 1900 and 2008 were challenged in court).  As a consequence, California finds it necessary to vest the re- sponsibility and right to defend a voter-approved initiative in the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s proponents when the State Executive declines to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet today the Court demands that the State follow the Restatement of Agency.  See ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  There are reasons, however, why California might conclude that a conventional agency relationship is inconsistent with the history, design, and purpose of the initiative process.  The State may not wish to associate itself with proponents or their views outside of the \xe2\x80\x9cextremely narrow and limited\xe2\x80\x9d context of this litigation, 52 Cal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1029, or to bear the cost of proponents\xe2\x80\x99 legal fees.  The State may also wish to avoid the odd conflict of having a formal agent of the State (the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s proponent) arguing in favor of a law\xe2\x80\x99s validity while state officials (e.g., the attorney general) contend in the same proceeding that it should be found invalid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurthermore, it is not clear who the principal in an agency relationship would be.  It would make little sense if it were the Governor or attorney general, for that would frustrate the initiative system\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of circumventing elected officials who fail or refuse to effect the public will.  Id., at 1139\xe2\x80\x931140, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1016.  If there is to be a principal, then, it must be the people of California, as the ultimate sovereign in the State.  See ibid., 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1015\xe2\x80\x931016 (quoting Cal. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa71) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98All political power is inherent in the people\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Restatement may offer no workable example of an agent representing a principal composed of nearly 40 million residents of a State.  Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency, p.\xc2\xa02, Scope Note (1957) (noting that the Restatement \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not state the special rules applicable to public officers\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 Restatement (First) of Agency, p.\xc2\xa04, Scope Note (1933) (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern is that the proponents are unaccountable, that fear is neither well founded nor suf- ficient to overcome the contrary judgment of the State Supreme Court.  It must be remembered that both elected officials and initiative proponents receive their authority to speak for the State of California directly from the people.  The Court apparently believes that elected officials are acceptable \xe2\x80\x9cagents\xe2\x80\x9d of the State, see ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, but they are no more subject to ongoing supervision of their principal\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the people of the State\xe2\x80\x94than are initiative proponents.  At most, a Governor or attorney general can be recalled or voted out of office in a subsequent election, but proponents, too, can have their authority terminated or their initiative overridden by a subsequent ballot measure.  Finally, proponents and their attor- neys, like all other litigants and counsel who appear before a federal court, are subject to duties of candor, deco- rum, and respect for the tribunal and co-parties alike, all of which guard against the possibility that initiative proponents will somehow fall short of the appropriate stan- dards for federal litigation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents do not indicate that a formal agency relationship is necessary.  In Karcher v. May, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 72 (1987)\n, the Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly (Karcher) and President of the New Jersey Senate (Orechio) intervened in support of a school moment-of-silence law that the State\xe2\x80\x99s Governor and attorney general declined to defend in court.  In considering the question of standing, the Court looked to New Jersey law to determine whether Karcher and Orechio \xe2\x80\x9chad authority under state law to represent the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in both the District Court and Court of Appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 82.  The Court concluded that they did.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cNew Jersey Supreme Court ha[d] granted applications of the Speaker of the General Assembly and the President of the Senate to intervene as parties-respondent on behalf of the legislature in defense of a legislative enactment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Karcher Court held that standing had been proper in the District Court and Court of Appeals.  Ibid.  By the time the case arrived in this Court, Karcher and Orechio had lost their presiding legislative offices, without which they lacked the authority to represent the State under New Jersey law.  This, the Court held, deprived them of standing.  Id., at 81.  Here, by contrast, proponents\xe2\x80\x99 authority under California law is not contingent on officeholder status, so their standing is unaffected by the fact that they \xe2\x80\x9chold no office\xe2\x80\x9d in California\xe2\x80\x99s Government.  Ante, at 12.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43 (1997)\n, is consistent with the premises of this dissent, not with the rationale of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  See ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  There, the Court noted its serious doubts as to the aspiring defenders\xe2\x80\x99 standing because there was \xe2\x80\x9cno Ari- zona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 65.  The Court did use the word \xe2\x80\x9cagents\xe2\x80\x9d; but, read in context, it is evident that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s intention was not to demand a formal agency relationship in compliance with the Restatement.  Rather, the Court used the term as shorthand for a party whom \xe2\x80\x9cstate law authorizes\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crepresent the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests\xe2\x80\x9d in court.

The state court, noting the importance of Arizonans for Official English, expressed its understanding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe high court\xe2\x80\x99s doubts as to the official initiative proponents\xe2\x80\x99 standing in that case were based, at least in substantial part, on the fact that the court was not aware of any \xe2\x80\x98Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to defend .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Cal. 4th, at 1136\xe2\x80\x931137, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1013\xe2\x80\x931014 (quoting 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 65).  Based on this passage, it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in [Arizonans for Official English] indicates that if a state\xe2\x80\x99s law does authorize the official proponents of an initiative to assert the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the validity of a challenged state initiative when the public officials who ordinarily assert that interest have declined to do so, the proponents would not have standing to assert the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s validity in a federal lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1137, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1014.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals, too, was mindful of this requirement.  Perry v. Brown, 671 F.\xc2\xa03d 1052, 1072\xe2\x80\x931073 (CA9 2012).  Although that panel divided on the proper resolution of the merits of this case, it was unanimous in concluding that proponents satisfy the requirements of Article III.  Compare id., at 1070\xe2\x80\x931075 (majority opinion), with id., at 1096\xe2\x80\x931097 (N.\xc2\xa0R. Smith, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Its central premise, ignored by the Court today, was that the \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s highest court [had] held that California law provides precisely what the Arizonans Court found lacking in Arizona law: it confers on the official proponents of an initiative the authority to assert the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests in defending the constitutionality of that initiative, where state officials who would ordinarily assume that responsibility choose not to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1072 (majority opinion).  The Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court did not ignore Arizonans for Official English; they were faithful to it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach in this case is also in tension with other cases in which the Court has permitted individuals to assert claims on behalf of the government or others.  For instance, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(a)(2) allows a court to appoint a private attorney to investigate and prosecute potential instances of criminal contempt.  Under the Rule, this special prosecutor is not the agent of the appointing judge; indeed, the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination of which persons should be targets of the investigation, what methods of investigation should be used, what information will be sought as evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d whom to charge, and other \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. critical to the conduct of a prosecution, are all made outside the supervision of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787, \n807 (1987)\n.  Also, just as proponents have been authorized to represent the State of California, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]rivate attorneys appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt action represent the United States,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Providence Journal Co., \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 693, \n700 (1988)\n.  They are \xe2\x80\x9cappointed solely to pursue the public interest in vindication of the court\xe2\x80\x99s authority,\xe2\x80\x9d Young, supra, at 804, an interest that\xe2\x80\x94like California\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the validity of its laws\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cunique to the sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d Providence Journal Co., supra, at 700.  And, although the Court dismisses the proponents\xe2\x80\x99 standing claim because initiative proponents \xe2\x80\x9care not elected\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdecide for themselves, with no review, what arguments to make and how to make them\xe2\x80\x9d in defense of the enacted initiative, ante, at 15, those same charges could be leveled with equal if not greater force at the special prosecutors just discussed.  See Young, supra, at 807.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilar questions might also arise regarding qui\xc2\xa0tam actions, see, e.g., Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765\n\xe2\x80\x93778 (2000); suits involving \xe2\x80\x9cnext friends\xe2\x80\x9d litigating on behalf of a real party in interest, see, e.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149\n\xe2\x80\x93166 (1990); or shareholder-derivative suits, see, e.g., Gollust v. Mendell, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115\n\xe2\x80\x93126 (1991).  There is no more of an agency relationship in any of these settings than in the instant case, yet the Court has nonetheless permitted a party to assert the interests of another.  That qui\xc2\xa0tam actions and \xe2\x80\x9cnext friend\xe2\x80\x9d litigation may have a longer historical pedigree than the initiative process, see ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, is no basis for finding Article III\xe2\x80\x99s standing requirement met in those cases but lacking here.  In short, the Court today unsettles its longtime understanding of the basis for jurisdiction in representative-party litigation, leaving the law unclear and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, and its accompanying state- wide injunction, effectively immune from appellate review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is much irony in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to justiciability in this case.  A prime purpose of justiciability is to ensure vigorous advocacy, yet the Court insists upon litigation conducted by state officials whose preference is to lose the case.  The doctrine is meant to ensure that courts are responsible and constrained in their power, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today means that a single district court can make a decision with far-reaching effects that cannot be reviewed.  And rather than honor the principle that justiciability exists to allow disputes of public policy to be resolved by the political process rather than the courts, see, e.g., Allen v. Wright, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737\n\xe2\x80\x93752 (1984), here the Court refuses to allow a State\xe2\x80\x99s authorized representatives to defend the outcome of a democratic election.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion disrespects and disparages both the political process in California and the well-stated opinion of the California Supreme Court in this case.  The California Supreme Court, not this Court, expresses concern for vigorous representation; the California Supreme Court, not this Court, recognizes the necessity to avoid conflicts of interest; the California Supreme Court, not this Court, comprehends the real interest at stake in this litigation and identifies the most proper party to defend that interest.  The California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reflects a better understanding of the dynamics and principles of Article III than does this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, the Court must be cautious before entering a realm of controversy where the legal community and society at large are still formulating ideas and approaches to a most difficult subject.  But it is shortsighted to misconstrue principles of justiciability to avoid that subject.  As the California Supreme Court recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question before us involves a fundamental procedural issue that may arise with respect to any initiative measure, without regard to its subject matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1005 (emphasis in original).  If a federal court must rule on a constitutional point that either confirms or rejects the will of the people expressed in an initiative, that is when it is most necessary, not least necessary, to insist on rules that ensure the most committed and vigorous adversary arguments to inform the rulings of the courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, what the Court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process.  And it is this.  The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government, not the other way around.  Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government.  The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century.  \xe2\x80\x9cThrough the structure of its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority, a State defines itself as sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452, \n460 (1991)\n.  In California and the 26 other States that permit initiatives and popular referendums, the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves.  The Court today frustrates that choice by nullifying, for failure to comply with the Restatement of Agency, a State Supreme Court decision holding that state law authorizes an enacted initiative\xe2\x80\x99s proponents to defend the law if and when the State\xe2\x80\x99s usual legal advocates decline to do so.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion fails to abide by precedent and misapplies basic principles of justiciability.  Those errors necessitate this respectful dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
