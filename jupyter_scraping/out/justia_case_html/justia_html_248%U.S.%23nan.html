But the court below expressly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 248 U. S. 24</a></p><p> found that such land was not included in the contract, hence the sole basis for the asserted federal question disappears.</p>\n<p>And this result is not changed by considering, to the extent that it is our duty to do so, the question of fact upon which the existence of the alleged federal question depends.  <em>Northern Pac.

We so conclude because the result of discharging that duty leaves us convinced that the finding below was adequately sustained -- indeed, that the record makes it clear that the alleged ground for the federal question was a mere afterthought.
