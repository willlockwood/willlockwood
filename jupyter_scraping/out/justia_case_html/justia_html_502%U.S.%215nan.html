The hospital stresses that "leave" as used in subsection (d) is to be enjoyed by an "employee," whose status as such implies that the employment relationship continues during the absence. Accordingly, employees protected under subsection (d) are "returned" to their positions after military service is over, while reservists protected by other subsections of \xc2\xa7 2024 are "restored" to theirs,s the difference in language attesting that the former remain employees, while the latter cease to be such during their time away. The hospital argues that the very notion of such a continuing relationship is incompatible with absences as lengthy as King\'s, and finds that conclusion supported by the provisions speaking to the actual mechanics for resuming employment. While the reservists subject to other subsections must reapply for employment, those protected by subsection (d) are allowed, and indeed required, to "report for work at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled working period" after the tour of military duty expires. The hospital posits the impracticality of expecting an employee to report for work immediately after a 3-year absence, "to take his apron off the peg," as the hospital\'s counsel put it, and go back to work as if nothing had happened. It also makes much of the difficulties of filling responsible positions that would follow if their incumbents could be turned out so abruptly after serving for so long, upon the prior incumbent\'s equally abrupt return.</p><p>8 Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (g) identify other classes of reservists, enlistees, and those called to active duty, and make applicable to those classes the reemployment protection offered inductees pursuant to 38 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2021(a)(2)(A)(i), namely, "restor[ation]" to the formerly held position "or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="220">220</a></p><p>To these arguments, and others like them that we do not set out at length, two replies are in order. We may grant that the congressionally mandated leave of absence can be an ungainly perquisite of military service, when the tour of duty lasts as long as King\'s promises to do, and if we were free to tinker with the statutory scheme we could reasonably accord some significance to the burdens imposed on both employers and workers when long leaves of absence are the chosen means of guaranteeing eventual reemployment to military personnel.</p><p>But to grant all this is not to find equivocation in the statute\'s silence, so as to render it susceptible to interpretive choice. On the contrary, the verbal distinctions underlying the hospital\'s arguments become pallid in the light of a textual difference far more glaring than any of them: while, as noted, subsection (d) is utterly silent about any durational limit on the protection it provides, other subsections of \xc2\xa7 2024, protecting other classes of full-time service personnel, expressly limit the periods of their protection. Thus, \xc2\xa7 2024(a) currently gives enlistees at least four years of reemployment protection, with the possibility of an extension to five years and even longer. Again, for example, \xc2\xa7 2024(b)(1) extends protection to those entering active duty (except for "the purpose of determining physical fitness [or] for training") for at least four years, with the possibility of a further extension beyond that.9 Given the examples of affirmative</p><p>9 As a counterexample, St. Vincent\'s might cite \xc2\xa7 2024(g), providing reservists ordered to active duty for not more than 90 days with a guarantee of reemployment extending through their period of duty. Standing alone with subsection (d), this provision might suggest that a guarantee extending through the duration of a reservist\'s tour of active duty must be express; but the examples of specific durationallimitations described in the text above show that Congress knew how to provide limits on its benefits when that was the intent. Even if the express examples unsettled the significance of subsection (d)\'s drafting, however, we would ultimately read the provision in King\'s favor under the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries\'</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="221">221</a></p><p>limitations on reemployment benefits conferred by neighboring provisions, we infer that the simplicity of subsection (d) was deliberate, consistent with a plain meaning to provide its benefit without conditions on length of service.</p><p>In so concluding we do nothing more, of course, than follow the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole, see <i>Massachusetts </i>v. <i>Morash, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/107/case.html">490 U. S. 107</a>, 115 (1989), since the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context. See, <i>e. g., Shell Oil Co. </i>v. <i>Iowa Dept. of Revenue, 488 </i>U. S. 19, 26 (1988). "Words are not pebbles in alien juxtaposition; they have only a communal existence; and not only does the meaning of each interpenetrate the other, but all in their aggregate take their purport from the setting in which they are used .... " <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>Federbush Co., </i>121 F.2d 954, 957 (CA2 1941) (L. Hand, J.) (quoted in <i>Shell Oil, supra, </i>at 25, n. 6).10</p><p>St. Vincent\'s itself embraces the same principle (though, we think, by way of misapplication) by countering the preceding textual analysis with a structural analysis of its own, in which it purports to discern a significant hierarchy of reemployment rights in the statutory scheme. As the hospital reads \xc2\xa7 2024 together with its companion provisions, the most generous protection goes to inductees, whose reemployment rights are unqualified by any reference to duration of service.ll Enlistees and those entering active duty in response to an order or call come next with protection so long</p><p>favor. <i>Fishgold </i>v. <i>Sullivan Drydock </i>&amp; <i>Repair Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/275/case.html">328 U.

We will presume congressional understanding of such interpretive principles, <i>e. g., McNary </i>v. <i>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/479/case.html">498 U. S. 479</a>,496 (1991) ("It is presumable that Congress legislates with knowledge of our basic rules of statutory construction").</p><p>10 See also <i>United States </i>v. <i>Hartwell, </i>6 Wall. 385, 396 (1868) (in construing statute court should adopt that sense of words which best harmonizes with context and promotes policy and objectives of legislature); see generally 2A C.

While it invokes the significance of context, its conclusion rests on quite circular reasoning. There are, as we have just pointed out, differences of treatment among the various classes of service people protected by various provisions of the statute. But differences do not necessarily make hierarchies, and the differences revealed by the hospital\'s examples do not point inexorably downward without assuming the point at issue, that the reservists subject to training duty within the meaning of subsection (d) really do get less protection than inductees, enlistees, and so on, covered by other provisions. Without such an assumption there are simply differences of treatment, to be respected by limiting protection where the text contains a limit and leaving textually unlimited protection just where the Congress apparently chose to leave it. Because the text of \xc2\xa7 2024(d) places no limit on the length of a tour after which King may enforce his reemployment rights against St. Vincent\'s, we hold it plain that no limit was implied. 14</p><p>12 See 38 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2024(a), 2024(b)(1). The basic limit here is four years, with an additional year of protection if the Government requests additional service.</p><p>13 The hospital claims to find additional support for this declension in the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 2024(d), relying heavily on excerpts from the House and Senate Reports on the 1960 bill that eventuated in the current statute. Brief for Respondent 17-18, and n. 31.</p><p>14 "When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except in rare and exceptional circumstances." <i>Rubin </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/424/case.html">449 U.

Such circumstances are not present here; as we indicate below, the hospital\'s invocation of legislative history does not make its case.</p><p>The hospital relies heavily on 1960 Senate and House Reports citing short-term leaves as covered by \xc2\xa72024. See S. Rep. No. 1672, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 2; H. R. Rep. No. 1263, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 6; see also Brief for Respondent 17, n. 31. While this history may demonstrate that in 1960 \xc2\xa7 2024(d) applied to short leaves, the significance of this is surely blunted by Congress\' undoubted intention 20 years later to apply the subsection to long leaves when it brought AGR participants under \xc2\xa72024(d). See Veterans\' Rehabilitation and Education Amendments of 1980, \xc2\xa7 511 (b), 94 Stat. 2207.</p><p>The inference that Congress intended no such limits as the hospital espouses is buttressed by a joint House-Senate Conference Committee\'s disapproval of a shift in the position taken by the Department of Labor on this issue. Before 1981 the Department took the position we adopt. See United States Department of Labor, Veterans\' Reemployment Rights Handbook 111 (1970). Mter Lee v. Pensacola, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/634/886/">634 F.2d 886</a> (CA5 1981), the Department adopted the different view that \xc2\xa7 2024(d) protection applied only to leaves of 90 days or less. See H. R. Rep. No. 97-782, p. 8 (1982). Subsequently, a joint House-Senate Conference Committee Report announced that the House and Senate Veterans\' Mfairs Committees "d[id] not believe that the 90-day limit [was] well-founded either as legislative interpretation or application of the pertinent case law." 128 Congo Rec. 25513 (1982). Coming as it did in the aftermath of Congress\' decision to place AGR participants under the coverage of \xc2\xa72024(d), this statement is decidedly at odds with the hospital\'s position, and confirms the conclusion that enactment of the AGR program was not intended to modify the ostensibly unconditional application of \xc2\xa7 2024(d).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
