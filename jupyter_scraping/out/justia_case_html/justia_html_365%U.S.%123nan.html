The refusal of the Court of Appeals to enforce that order because the Boards notices of election contained a minor and unconfusing mistake in the employer\'s corporate name was plain error.  It was well within the Board\'s province to find, as it did, upon the record before it that this occurrence had not affected the fairness of the representation election, particularly in the absence of any contrary showing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 365 U. S. 124</a></p><p> by the employer, upon whom the burden of proof rested in this respect.  That finding should have been accepted by the Court of Appeals.  In the absence of proof by the employer that there has been prejudice to the fairness of the election, such trivial irregularities of administrative procedure do not afford a basis for denying enforcement to an otherwise valid Board order.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
