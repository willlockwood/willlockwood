After considering the project\'s economic feasibility and environmental consequences, FERC set an interim "minimum flow rate" of water that must remain in the bypassed section of the stream and thus remains unavailable to drive the generators.  The State Water Resources Control Board (WRCB) issued a state water permit that conformed to FERC\'s interim minimum requirements, but reserved the right to set different permanent ones.  When WRCB later considered a draft order requiring permanent minimum flow rates well in excess of the FERC rates, the licensee petitioned FERC for a declaration that FERC possessed exclusive jurisdiction to determine the project\'s minimum flow rates.  FERC ordered the licensee to comply with the federal permit\'s rates, concluding that the task of setting such rates rested within its exclusive jurisdiction.  It reasoned that setting the rates was integral to its planning and licensing process under the FPA, and that giving effect to competing state requirements would interfere with its balancing of competing considerations in licensing and would vest in States a veto power over federal projects inconsistent with the FPA, as interpreted in <em>First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative v. FPC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html">328 U. S. 152</a></span>.  WRCB adopted the higher flow requirements and intervened seeking a rehearing of FERC\'s order.  FERC denied the request, concluded that the State sought to impose conflicting license requirements, and reaffirmed its conclusion that it had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rates.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that FPA \xc2\xa7 27 -- which saves from supersedure state</p>\n<p>"laws . . . relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal <em>or other uses,</em> or any vested right acquired therein"</p>\n<p>-- as construed in <em>First Iowa,</em> did not preserve the State\'s right to regulate minimum flow rates, and that the FPA preempted WRCB\'s minimum flow rate requirements. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 495 U.

However, First Iowa has previously construed \xc2\xa7 27, holding that it is limited to laws relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water in irrigation or for municipal <em>or other uses of the same nature,</em> and has primary, if not exclusive, reference to such <em>proprietary rights.</em>  Such rights are not implicated in the instant case.  California\'s request that First Iowa\'s interpretation be repudiated misconceives the deference the Court must accord to longstanding and well-entrenched decisions, especially those interpreting statutes that underlie complex regulatory regimes.  There has been no sufficient intervening change in the law, or indication that <em>First Iowa</em> has proved unworkable or has fostered confusion and inconsistency in the law, that warrants a departure from established precedent.  <em>First Iowa\'s</em> limited reading of \xc2\xa7 27 has been endorsed, <em>see FPC v.

In interpreting the Reclamation Act, the Court did not advert to or purport to interpret the FPA, and held simply that \xc2\xa7 8 requires the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state laws governing the use of water employed in federal reclamation projects.  The purpose, structure, and legislative history of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 495 U.

Even if the two savings clauses were properly viewed in isolation from the remainder of their respective Acts, \xc2\xa7 8 explicitly directs that the Secretary "shall proceed in conformity with such [state] laws," language which has no counterpart in \xc2\xa7 27 and which was crucial to the Court\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 8.

California seeks to ensure that the project\'s operators maintain water flowing in the stream sufficient, in the State\'s judgment, to protect the stream\'s fish.  The Federal Government claims the exclusive authority to set the minimum stream flows that the federally licensed power plant must maintain.  Each side argues that its position is consistent with the Federal Power Act, ch. 285, 41 Stat. 1063, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 495 U. S. 494</a></p><p> amended, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 791a <em>et seq.</em> (1982 ed.), and, in particular, with \xc2\xa7 27 of that Act.  We granted certiorari to resolve these competing claims.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Rock Creek hydroelectric project lies near the confluence of the South Fork American River and one of the river\'s tributaries, Rock Creek.  Rock Creek runs through federally managed land located within California.  The project draws water from Rock Creek to drive its generators and then releases the water near the confluence of the stream and river, slightly less than one mile from where it is drawn.  The state and federal requirements at issue govern the "minimum flow rate" of water that must remain in the bypassed section of the stream and that thus remains unavailable to drive the generators.</p>\n<p>In 1983, pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA or Act), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a license authorizing the operation of the Rock Creek project.  <em>Keating,</em> 23 FERC \xef\xbf\xbd 62,137.  Section 4(e) of the FPA empowers FERC to issue licenses for projects</p>\n<p>"necessary or convenient . . . for the development, transmission, and utilization of power across, along, from, or in any of the streams . . . over which Congress has jurisdiction."</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 797(e) (1982 ed.).  Section 10(a) of the Act also authorizes FERC to issue licenses subject to the conditions that FERC deems best suited for power development and other public uses of the waters.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 803(a) (1982 ed.).  Congress\' subsequent amendments to those provisions expressly direct that FERC consider a project\'s effect on fish and wildlife as well as "power and development purposes."  Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-495, 100 Stat. 1243, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 797(e), 803(a)(1).  FERC issued the 1983 license and set minimum flow rates after considering the project\'s economic feasibility and environmental consequences.  In part to protect trout in the stream, the license </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 495 U. S. 495</a></p><p> required that the project maintain interim minimum flow rates of 11 cubic feet per second (cfs) during May through September and 15 cfs during the remainder of the year.  23 FERC \xef\xbf\xbd 62,137, at 63,204.  The license also required the licensee to submit studies recommending a permanent minimum flow rate, after consulting with federal and state fish and wildlife protection agencies.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In 1985, the licensee submitted a report recommending that FERC adopt the interim flow rates as permanent rates.  The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) recommended that FERC require significantly higher minimum flow rates.</p>\n<p>The licensee had also applied for state water permits, and, in 1984, the State Water Resources Control Board (WRCB) issued a permit that conformed to FERC\'s interim minimum flow requirements but reserved the right to set different permanent minimum flow rates.  App. 65-67.  When the WRCB in 1987 considered a draft order requiring permanent minimum flow rates of 60 cfs from March through June and 30 cfs during the remainder of the year, the licensee petitioned FERC for a declaration that FERC possessed exclusive jurisdiction to determine the project\'s minimum flow requirements.  <em>Rock Creek Limited Partnership,</em> 38 FERC \xef\xbf\xbd 61,240, p. 61,772 (1987).  The licensee, by then respondent Rock Creek Limited Partnership, also claimed that the higher minimum flow rates sought by the WRCB would render the project economically infeasible.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>In March, 1987, FERC issued an order directing the licensee to comply with the minimum flow requirements of the federal permit.  In that order, FERC concluded that the task of setting minimum flows rested within its exclusive jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em> at 61,774.  The Commission reasoned that setting minimum flow requirements was integral to its planning and licensing process under FPA \xc2\xa7 10(a); giving effect to competing state requirements "would interfere with the Commission\'s balancing of competing considerations in licensing" and would vest in States a veto power over federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 495 U.

FERC also directed an Administrative Law Judge to hold a hearing to determine the appropriate permanent minimum flow rates for the project.  <em>Id.</em> at 61,774.  After considering proposals and arguments of the licensee, the CDFG, and FERC staff, the Administrative Law Judge set the minimum flow rate for the project at 20 cfs during the entire year.  <em>Rock Creek Limited Partnership,</em> 41 FERC \xef\xbf\xbd 63,019 (1987).  Four days after FERC\'s declaratory order, the WRCB issued an order directing the licensee to comply with the higher minimum flow requirements contained in its draft order.  App. 73.  The WRCB also intervened to seek a rehearing of FERC\'s order.  FERG denied the rehearing request, concluded that the State sought to impose conflicting license requirements, and reaffirmed its conclusion that the FPA, as interpreted in <em>First Iowa,</em> provided FERC with exclusive jurisdiction to determine minimum flow rates.  <em>Rock Creek Limited Partnership,</em> 41 FERC 61, 198 (1987).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed FERC\'s order denying rehearing.  <em>California ex rel. State Water Resources Board v. FERC,</em> 877 F.2d 743 (1989).  That court, too, concluded that <em>First Iowa</em> governed the case; that FPA \xc2\xa7 27, as construed in <em>First Iowa,</em> did not preserve California\'s right to regulate minimum flow rates; and that the FPA preempted WRCB\'s minimum flow rate requirements.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari, 493 U.S. 991 (1989), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the Federal Power Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 863, Congress clearly intended a broad federal role in the development and licensing of hydroelectric power.  That broad delegation of power to the predecessor of FERC, however, hardly determines the extent to which Congress intended to have the Federal Government exercise exclusive powers, or intended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 495 U. S. 497</a></p><p> to preempt concurrent state regulation of matters affecting federally licensed hydroelectric projects.  The parties\' dispute regarding the latter issue turns principally on the meaning of \xc2\xa7 27 of the FPA, which provides the clearest indication of how Congress intended to allocate the regulatory authority of the States and the Federal Government.  That section provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective States relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein."</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 821 (1982 ed.).  Were this a case of first impression, petitioner\'s argument based on the statute\'s language could be said to present a close question.  As petitioner argues, California\'s minimum stream flow requirement might plausibly be thought to "relat[e] to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used . . . for . . . other uses," namely the generation of power or the protection of fish.  This interpretation would accord with the "presumption against finding preemption of state law in areas traditionally regulated by the States" and</p>\n<p>"\'with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\'"</p>\n<p><em>California v.

Just as courts may not find state measures preempted in the absence of clear evidence that Congress so intended, so must they give full effect to evidence that Congress considered, and sought to preserve, the States\' coordinate regulatory role in our federal scheme.</p>\n<p>But the meaning of \xc2\xa7 27 and the preemptive effect of the FPA are not matters of first impression.  Forty-four </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 495 U.

The Court interpreted \xc2\xa7 27 as follows:</p>\n<p>"The effect of \xc2\xa7 27, in protecting state laws from supersedure, is limited to laws as to the control, appropriation, use or distribution of water in irrigation or for municipal or other uses <em>of the same nature.</em>  It therefore has primary, if not exclusive, reference to such <em>proprietary rights.</em>  The phrase \'any vested right acquired therein\' further emphasizes the application of the section to property rights.

Like this case, <em>First Iowa</em> involved a state permit requirement that related to the control of water for particular uses but that did not relate to or establish proprietary rights.  Iowa had required as one condition of securing a state permit that diverted water be</p>\n<p>"returned . . . at the nearest practicable place without being materially diminished in quantity or polluted or rendered deleterious to fish life,"</p>\n<p>Iowa Code \xc2\xa7 7771 (1939), a provision the Court found to conflict with the federal requirements and to "strik[e] at the heart of the present project."  <em>First Iowa,</em> 328 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#166">328 U.

The Court reasoned that, absent an express congressional command, \xc2\xa7 9(b) could not be read to require compliance with, and thus to preserve, state laws that conflicted with and were otherwise preempted by the federal requirements.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#166">328 U. S. 166</a></span>-167 ("If a state permit is not required, there is no justification for requiring the petitioner, as a condition of securing its federal permit, to present evidence of the petitioner\'s compliance with the requirements of the State Code for a state permit"); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#177">328 U.

Had \xc2\xa7 27 been given the broader meaning that Iowa sought, it would have "saved" the state requirements at issue, made the state permit one that could be issued, and supported the interpretation of \xc2\xa7 9(b) as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 495 U. S. 502</a></p><p> requiring evidence of compliance with those state requirements, rather than compliance only with those requirements consistent with the federal license.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s related, but more general, rationale for its reading of \xc2\xa7 9(b) in <em>First Iowa</em> also necessarily rested on its narrow construction of \xc2\xa7 27.  The Court framed the issue as whether the Act allowed the States to regulate through permit requirements such as Iowa\'s "the very requirements of the project that Congress has placed in the discretion of the Federal Power Commission."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#165">328 U.

Section 9 reflected the operation of this exclusive federal authority.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#167">328 U.

S. 168</a></span> ("Where the Federal Government supersedes the state government there is no suggestion that the two agencies both shall have final authority").  In accord with this view, the Court interpreted \xc2\xa7 9(b) as requiring compliance only with state measures relevant to federal requirements, rather than, as would exist under a system of concurrent jurisdiction, compliance with the state requirements necessary to secure the state permit.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#167">328 U.

S. 175</a></span>-178.  That is, the Court rejected an interpretation of \xc2\xa7 9(b) that would have "saved" or accommodated the state permit system and its underlying requirements.  To reach its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 9(b), however, the Court had to interpret \xc2\xa7 27 consistently with the limited state regulatory sphere and in a manner that did not, by "saving" the Iowa requirements, establish "divided authority over any one subject."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#174">328 U.

S. 503</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 27 to encompass only laws relating to proprietary rights, and thus leaving the permit requirements at issue to the federal sphere, accomplished that goal.  The Court\'s discussion immediately after its extended discussion of \xc2\xa7 27 illustrates the relation between the sections.  Before distinguishing \xc2\xa7 27\'s role in saving state law from \xc2\xa7 9(b)\'s role in the sphere of exclusive federal regulation, the Court concluded:</p>\n<p>"[Section 27] is therefore thoroughly consistent with the integration, rather than the duplication, of federal and state jurisdictions under the Federal Power Act.

The Court\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 9(b), of course, rested on that supersedure, and required that the remaining field "saved" to the States by \xc2\xa7 27 be limited correspondingly.</p>\n<p>Petitioner also argues that our decision in <em>California v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/case.html">438 U. S. 645</a></span> (1978), construing \xc2\xa7 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] requires that we abandon <em>First Iowa\'s</em> interpretation of \xc2\xa7 27 and the FPA.  Petitioner reasons that \xc2\xa7 8 is similar to, and served as a model for, FPA \xc2\xa7 27, that this Court in <em>California v. United States</em> interpreted \xc2\xa7 8 in a manner inconsistent with <em>First Iowa\'s</em> reading of \xc2\xa7 27, and that that reading of \xc2\xa7 8, subsequent to <em>First Iowa,</em> in some manner overrules or repudiates <em>First Iowa\'s</em> understanding of \xc2\xa7 27.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 495 U.

United States</em> is cast in broad terms, and embodies a conception of the States\' regulatory powers in some tension with that set forth in <em>First Iowa,</em> but that decision bears quite indirectly, at best, upon interpretation of the FPA.  The Court in <em>California v. United States</em> interpreted the Reclamation Act of 1902; it did not advert to, or purport to interpret, the FPA, and held simply that \xc2\xa7 8 requires the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state laws, not inconsistent with congressional directives, governing use of water employed in federal reclamation projects.  <em>California v. United States, supra.</em>  Also, as in <em>First Iowa,</em> the Court in <em>California v. United States</em> examined the purpose, structure, and legislative history of the entire statute before it, and employed those sources to construe the statute\'s saving clause.  <em>See</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/case.html#649">438 U.

S. 663</a></span>-670.</p>\n<p>Even if the two saving clauses were properly viewed in isolation from the remainder of their respective Acts and resulting regulatory schemes, significant differences exist between them.  Section 8 of the Reclamation Act, after referring to state water laws relating to water used in irrigation and preserved by the Act, contains an explicit direction that "the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out the provisions of this Act, shall proceed in conformity with such [state] laws."  43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 383 (1982 ed.).  This language has no counterpart in \xc2\xa7 27 of the FPA, and was crucial to the Court\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 8.  <em>See California v. United States,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/case.html#650">438 U.

United States</em> and <em>First Iowa</em> accord different effect to laws relating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 495 U. S. 505</a></p><p> to water uses, this difference stems in part from the different roles assumed by the federal actor in each case, as reflected in \xc2\xa7 8\'s explicit directive to the Secretary.  The Secretary, in executing a particular reclamation project, is in a position analogous to a licensee under the FPA, and need not comply with state laws conflicting with congressional directives respecting particular reclamation projects, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/case.html#672">438 U. S. 672</a></span>-674; similarly, a federal licensee under the FPA need not comply with state requirements that conflict with the federal license provisions established pursuant to the FPA\'s directives.  An additional textual difference is that \xc2\xa7 8 refers only to "water used in irrigation," and contains no counterpart to \xc2\xa7 27\'s reference to "other uses," the provision essential to petitioner\'s argument.  Laws controlling water used in irrigation relate to proprietary rights, as the <em>First Iowa</em> Court indicated, 328 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#176">328 U. S. 176</a></span>, and n. 20, and \xc2\xa7 8 does not indicate the appropriate treatment of laws relating to other water uses that do not implicate proprietary rights.</p>\n<p>Given these differences between the statutes and saving provisions, it should come as no surprise that <em>California v. United States</em> did not refer either to \xc2\xa7 27 or to <em>First Iowa.</em>  Since the Court decided <em>California v. United States,</em> we have continued to cite <em>First Iowa</em> with approval.  <em>See, e.g., Escondido Mut.

We do not believe that <em>California v. United States</em> requires that we disavow <em>First Iowa</em> in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, petitioner argues that \xc2\xa7 27\'s legislative history requires us to abandon <em>First Iowa\'s</em> interpretation of that section.  Whatever the usefulness of legislative history for statutory interpretation in the usual case, that source provides petitioner with no aid.  If a quite natural reading of the statutory language fails to displace an intervening decision providing a contrary interpretation, legislative history supporting that reading and, by definition, before the Court that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 495 U.

Indeed, <em>First Iowa</em> expressly considered the legislative history of the FPA, and of \xc2\xa7 27 in particular, and found that source to support its interpretation of both.  <em>First Iowa, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/152/case.html#171">328 U.

As Congress directed in FPA \xc2\xa7 10(a), FERC set the conditions of the license, including the minimum stream flow, after considering which requirements would best protect wildlife and ensure that the project would be economically feasible, and thus further power development.  <em>See Rock Creek Limited Partnership,</em> 41 FERC 63,019 (1987); <em>Keating,</em> 23 FERC 62, 137 (1983); <em>see also Rock Creek Limited Partnership,</em> 41 FERC 61,198 (1987).  Allowing California to impose significantly higher minimum stream flow requirements would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in that considered federal agency determination.
