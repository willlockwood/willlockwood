But, as the transcript stands, there is no case before us in which we can exercise a power of amendment.  We can do nothing more than dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>But if the plaintiff desires it, he may, in order to save expense, withdraw the transcript, and use it in connection with the proper and legal process to bring the case here, and if withdrawn, a receipt for it must be left with the clerk.</p>\n<p>But as it now stands, it must be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
