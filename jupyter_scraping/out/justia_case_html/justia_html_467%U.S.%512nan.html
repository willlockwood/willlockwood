STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Appellant, the Franchise Tax Board of California, determined that four employees of appellee United States Postal Service were delinquent in the payment of their state income taxes.  The Board served process on the Postal Service directing it to withhold the amounts of the delinquencies from the employees\' wages, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 18817 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, which authorizes the Board to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 467 U. S. 514</a></p><p> require any employer to withhold delinquent taxes from an employee\'s salary and transfer those funds to the Board. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]   The question presented is whether the Postal Service was obligated to honor these "orders to withhold."</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>When the Postal Service refused to comply with the four orders to withhold, the Board filed this action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting that the Service was liable under the Revenue and Taxation Code for failing to honor the orders, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and invoking federal jurisdiction pursuant to 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 409(a) and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1339. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The District Court entered summary judgment for the Postal Service.  It held that 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5517, which authorized the agreement that California and the United States had made regarding the withholding of state income taxes from the pay of federal employees, applies only to withholding of anticipated tax liabilities, and not to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 467 U. S. 515</a></p><p> delinquent liabilities. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5517 excused the Service from complying with the orders.  <em>Employment Development Department v. United States Postal Service,</em> 698 F.2d 1029 (CA9 1983). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court of Appeals rejected the Board\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 5517 did not prohibit issuance of the orders, and also rejected the argument that the provision in 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401(1) declaring that the Postal Service may "sue and be sued in its official name" had waived any sovereign immunity that the Service might possess. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This appeal followed. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>In this Court, the Postal Service does not argue that 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5517 and the agreement pursuant thereto between the United State and California prohibit the issuance of an order to withhold against the Postal Service with respect to delinquent tax liabilities of its employees. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  To the contrary, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 467 U. S. 516</a></p><p> the Postal Service expressly concedes that it is amenable to judicial process and could be required to honor a garnishment order requiring it to withhold the salary of a federal employee in order to satisfy a delinquent tax liability if issued by a state court. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Instead, the Postal Service contends that, although it must obey a judicial order, it retains sovereign immunity with respect to state administrative tax levies.  It argues that, while the provision that the Postal Service can "sue and be sued in its official name" waives immunity from suit, it does not apply to administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Board does not dispute the proposition that, unless waived, sovereign immunity prevents the creditor of a federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 467 U. S. 517</a></p><p> employee from collecting a debt through a judicial order requiring the United States to garnishee the employee\'s salary.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/45/20/case.html">Buchanan v. Alexander,</a></span></em> 4 How. 20 (1845).  Rather, it places its primary reliance on 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401(1), which indicates that the Postal Service may "sue and be sued."  Thus, the question in this case is whether this statutory waiver of sovereign immunity extends to the Board\'s orders to withhold.</p>\n<p>This Court construed a statute providing that an agency created by Congress -- the Federal Housing Authority -- was empowered "to sue and be sued," in <em>FHA v. Burr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/242/case.html">309 U. S. 242</a></span> (1940).  In <em>Burr,</em> the question presented was whether the agency had to honor a garnishment order issued by a state court.  The Court began by observing:</p>\n<p>"Since consent to \'sue and be sued\' has been given by Congress, the problem here merely involves a determination of whether or not garnishment comes within the scope of that authorization."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/242/case.html#244">309 U. S. 244</a></span>.  It continued:</p>\n<p>"[W]e start from the premise that such waivers by Congress of governmental immunity in case of such federal instrumentalities should be liberally construed.  This policy is in line with the current disfavor of the doctrine of governmental immunity from suit, as evidenced by the increasing tendency of Congress to waive the immunity where federal governmental corporations are concerned. . . .  Hence, when Congress establishes such an agency, authorizes it to engage in commercial and business transactions with the public, and permits it to \'sue and be sued,\' it cannot be lightly assumed that restrictions on that authority are to be implied.  Rather, if the general authority to \'sue and be sued\' is to be delimited by implied exceptions, it must be clearly shown that certain types of suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme, that an implied restriction of the general authority is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function, or that, for other reasons, it was plainly the purpose of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 467 U. S. 518</a></p><p> Congress to use the \'sue and be sued\' clause in a narrow sense.  In the absence of such showing, it must be presumed that, when Congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial world and endowed it with authority to \'sue or be sued,\' that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/242/case.html#245">309 U. S. 245</a></span> (footnote omitted). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court then explained why garnishment orders fell within the scope of the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity:</p>\n<p>"Clearly, the words \'sue and be sued,\' in their normal connotation, embrace all civil process incident to the commencement or continuance of legal proceedings.  Garnishment and attachment commonly are part and parcel of the process, provided by statute, for the collection of debt. . . .  [H]owever it may be denominated, whether legal or equitable, and whenever it may be available, whether prior to or after final judgment, garnishment is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 467 U. S. 519</a></p><p> a well-known remedy available to suitors.  To say that Congress did not intend to include such civil process in the words \'sue and be sued\' would in general deprive suits of some of their efficacy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/242/case.html#245">309 U. S. 245</a></span>-246 (footnotes and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>If anything, the waiver of sovereign immunity is broader here than it was in <em>Burr.</em>  In passing the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 719, Congress not only indicated that the Postal Service could "sue and be sued," 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401(1), but also that it had the power "to settle and compromise claims by or against it," \xc2\xa7 401(8), and that</p>\n<p>"[t]he provisions of chapter 171 and all other provisions of title 28 relating to tort claims shall apply to tort claims arising out of activities of the Postal Service."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 409(c). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Neither of these provisions would have been necessary had Congress intended to preserve sovereign immunity with respect to the Postal Service. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Congress also indicated that it wished the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 467 U. S. 520</a></p><p> Postal Service to be run more like a business than had its predecessor, the Post Office Department. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Here, the Board has employed the same "well-known" remedy that was held to be within the scope of a sue-and-be-sued clause in <em>Burr.</em>  Moreover, as was true of the agency involved in <em>Burr,</em> Congress has "launched [the Postal Service] into the commercial world"; hence, under <em>Burr,</em> not only must we liberally construe the sue-and-be-sued clause, but also we must presume that the Service\'s liability is the same as that of any other business.  No showing has been made to overcome that presumption.  Since an order to withhold cannot issue unless the Postal Service owes the employee wages, the Service is nothing but a stakeholder; the order to withhold has precisely the same effect on its ability to operate efficiently as it does on that of any other employer subject to the California statute.  It creates no greater inconvenience than did the garnishment order that this Court held could issue against a federal agency in <em>Burr.</em> [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Indeed, the Board\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 467 U. S. 521</a></p><p> order to withhold contains the same direction as did the writ of garnishment served on the FHA in <em>Burr.</em></p>\n<p>The Postal Service attempts to distinguish <em>Burr</em> by observing that the waiver of sovereign immunity in \xc2\xa7 401(1) is limited to cases in which it has been "sued," and then arguing that, because the process that has issued here is that of an administrative agency, rather than a court, the Service has not been "sued" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 401(1).  This crabbed construction of the statute overlooks our admonition that waiver of sovereign immunity is accomplished not by "a ritualistic formula"; rather intent to waive immunity and the scope of such a waiver can only be ascertained by reference to underlying congressional policy.  <em>Keifer &amp; Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/381/case.html">306 U. S. 381</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/381/case.html#389">306 U. S. 389</a></span> (1939). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 467 U. S. 522</a></p><p> case, at the level of policy and practicality, it is illogical to conclude that Congress would have differentiated between process issued by the Board and that of a court, for even if a court issued the orders to withhold, neither the Postal Service nor its employees would be in a materially different position.</p>\n<p>The operation of California\'s tax collection process makes it clear that there is no meaningful difference between an order to withhold issued by the Board and a garnishment order issued by a court.  Under state law, an assessment that has been validly made against a taxpayer [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] operates to impose an absolute liability for the tax that may not be contested except in an action seeking refund of amounts already paid.  Indeed state law is unequivocal in requiring employers to honor orders to withhold -- no defense is permitted. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Thus, a California </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 467 U. S. 523</a></p><p> tax assessment, like a federal tax assessment, operates in a way that is functionally indistinguishable from the judgment of a court of law; it creates an absolute legal obligation to make payment by a date certain:</p>\n<p>"Once the tax is assessed, the taxpayer will owe the sovereign the amount when the date fixed by law for payment arrives.  Default in meeting the obligations calls for some procedure whereby payment can be enforced.  The statute might remit the Government to an action at law wherein the taxpayer could offer such defense as he had.  A judgment against him might be collected by the levy of an execution.  But taxes are the life-blood of government, and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need.  Time out of mind, therefore, the sovereign has resorted to more drastic means of collection.  The assessment is given the force of a judgment, and if the amount assessed is not paid when due, administrative officials may seize the debtor\'s property to satisfy the debt."</p>\n<p><em>Bull v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/247/case.html">295 U.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, in operation and effect, the Board\'s orders to withhold are identical to the judgment of a court.  They give rise to a binding legal obligation to pay the assessed amounts; the taxpayer may no more dispute this liability than the liability under any other judgment.  Neither the Postal Service nor its employees would obtain any additional protections from a requirement that such orders be issued by a court, since the liability cannot be contested until after the tax has been paid </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 467 U. S. 524</a></p><p> and a refund action brought. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  At the same time, construing the statute to require the issuance of judicial process before the Postal Service need honor an order to withhold would create unwarranted disruption of the State\'s machinery for collection of delinquent taxes, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] while simultaneously depriving the orders of "some of their efficacy" -- a result inconsistent with <em>Burr.</em></p>\n<p>There is thus no reason to believe that Congress intended to impose a meaningless procedural requirement that an order to withhold be issued by a court.  To distinguish between administrative and judicial process would be to take an approach to sovereign immunity that this Court rejected more than 40 years ago --</p>\n<p>"to impute to Congress a desire for incoherence in a body of affiliated enactments and for drastic legal differentiation where policy justifies none."</p>\n<p><em>Keifer &amp; Keifer,</em> 306 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/381/case.html#394">306 U.

But always the question is:  has it done so?  This is our present problem.  Has Congress endowed Regional with immunity in the circumstances which enveloped its creation?  It is not a textual problem, for Congress has not expressed its will in words.  Congress may not even have had any consciousness of intention.  The Congressional will must be divined, and by a process of interpretation which, in effect, is the ascertainment of policy immanent not merely in the single statute from which flow the rights and responsibilities of Regional, but in a series of statutes utilizing corporations for governmental purposes and drawing significance from dominant contemporaneous opinion regarding the immunity of government agencies from suit."</p>\n<p>306 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/381/case.html#388">306 U.

However, nothing in that statute, which permits States to use the summary collection procedures of the Internal Revenue Service, limits the power of States to use any other available procedure.  The Postal Service also argues that, when Congress enacted 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5520 in 1974, providing for the United States to enter withholding agreements for city and county income taxes, it must have assumed that the Service retained its sovereign immunity.  Section 5520 is, however, no more relevant to this case than \xc2\xa7 5517; both provide the Secretary of the Treasury with explicit authority to enter into withholding agreements which he might not otherwise be able to make; neither addresses the scope of the Service\'s sovereign immunity.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em>  Moreover, the Postal Service\'s position that Congress intended use of only \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5517, 5520, and the piggyback provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to collect state taxes is inconsistent with the Service\'s position that it has no immunity from a judicial garnishment order.  In light of our disposition, we need not reach the Board\'s contention that the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 105-110, requires the Postal Service to honor the orders to withhold.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
