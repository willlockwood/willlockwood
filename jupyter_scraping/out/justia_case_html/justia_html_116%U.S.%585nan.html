After stating the facts in the language reported above, he continued:</p>\n<p>The right of the plaintiff in error to pay his license tax as a lawyer in coupons receivable for taxes, as described in his petition, is affirmed by the opinion and judgment in the case of <em>Royall v. State, ante,</em> just decided,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/572/case.html">116 U. S. 572</a></span>.  His remedy to have them received for verification and to recover back the money paid for his license is secured to him by the terms of the Act of January 4, 1882, which, for such purposes, was upheld by this Court as a valid enactment in <em>Antoni v. Greenhow,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/107/769/case.html">107 U. S. 769</a></span>.  On the authority of these decisions,</p>\n<p><em>The judgments of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia and of the Circuit Court of Fauquier County, Virginia, are reversed and the cause is remanded to said circuit court with instructions to take further proceedings according to law and in conformity with this opinion.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
