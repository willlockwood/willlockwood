As relevant here, after his acquittal, Alvarez sued the United States for false arrest under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which waives sovereign immunity in suits \xe2\x80\x9cfor \xe2\x80\xa6 personal injury \xe2\x80\xa6 caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any [Government] employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U.

The District Court dismissed the FTCA claim, but awarded Alvarez summary judgment and damages on the ATS claim.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k), bars claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The exception on its face seems plainly applicable to the facts of this case.  Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest was said to be \xe2\x80\x9cfalse,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus tortious, only because, and only to the extent that, it took place and endured in Mexico.  Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit allowed the action to proceed under what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cheadquarters doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d concluding that, because Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s abduction was the direct result of wrongful planning and direction by DEA agents in California, his claim did not \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] in\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign country.  Because it will virtually always be possible to assert negligent activity occurring in the United States, such analysis must be viewed with skepticism.  Two considerations confirm this Court\xe2\x80\x99s skepticism and lead it to reject the headquarters doctrine.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The first consideration applies to cases like this one, where harm was arguably caused both by action in the foreign country and planning in the United States.  Proximate cause is necessary to connect the domestic breach of duty with the action in the foreign country, for the headquarters\xe2\x80\x99 behavior must be sufficiently close to the ultimate injury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make it reasonable to follow liability back to that behavior.  A proximate cause connection is not itself sufficient to bar the foreign country exception\xe2\x80\x99s application, since a given proximate cause may not be the harm\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive proximate cause.  Here, for example, assuming the DEA officials\xe2\x80\x99 direction was a proximate cause of the abduction, so were the actions of Sosa and others in Mexico.  Thus, at most, recognition of additional domestic causation leaves an open question whether the exception applies to Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The second consideration is rooted in the fact that the harm occurred on foreign soil.  There is good reason to think that Congress understood a claim \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign country to be a claim for injury or harm occurring in that country.  This was the common usage of \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in contemporary state borrowing statutes used to determine which State\xe2\x80\x99s limitations statute applied in cases with transjurisdictional facts.  And such language was interpreted in tort cases in just the same way that the Court reads the FTCA today.  Moreover, there is specific reason to believe that using \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to place of harm was central to the foreign country exception\xe2\x80\x99s object.  When the FTCA was passed, courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred in tort cases, which would have been foreign law for a plaintiff injured in a foreign country.  However, application of foreign substantive law was what Congress intended to avoid by the foreign country exception.  Applying the headquarters doctrine would thus have thwarted the exception\xe2\x80\x99s object by recasting foreign injury claims as claims not arising in a foreign country because of some domestic planning or negligence.  Nor has the headquarters doctrine outgrown its tension with the exception.  The traditional approach to choice of substantive tort law has lost favor, but many States still use that analysis.  And, in at least some cases the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach would treat as arising at headquarters, even the later methodologies of choice point to the application of foreign law.  There is also no merit to an argument that the headquarters doctrine should be permitted when a State\xe2\x80\x99s choice of law approach would not apply the foreign law of the place of injury.  Congress did not write the exception to apply when foreign law would be applied.  Rather, the exception was written at a time when \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d meant where the harm occurred; and the odds are that Congress meant simply that when it used the phrase.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Alvarez is not entitled to recover damages from Sosa under the ATS.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law cum</em> common law claims understood in 1789 is not authority to recognize the ATS right of action Alvarez asserts here.  Contrary to Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action.  This does not mean, as Sosa contends, that the ATS was stillborn because any claim for relief required a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action.  Rather, the reasonable inference from history and practice is that the ATS was intended to have practical effect the moment it became law, on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations thought to carry personal liability at the time: offenses against ambassadors, violation of safe conducts, and piracy.  Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s objections to this view are unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0While it is correct to assume that the First Congress understood that district courts would recognize private causes of action for certain torts in violation of the law of nations and that no development of law in the last two centuries has categorically precluded federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element of common law, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court should exercise in considering such a new cause of action.  In deriving a standard for assessing Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s particular claim, it suffices to look to the historical antecedents, which persuade this Court that federal courts should not recognize claims under federal common law for violations of any international law norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the 18th-century paradigms familiar when \xc2\xa71350 was enacted.  Pp. 30\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Several reasons argue for great caution in adapting the law of nations to private rights.  First, the prevailing conception of the common law has changed since 1790.  When \xc2\xa71350 was enacted, the accepted conception was that the common law was found or discovered, but now it is understood, in most cases where a court is asked to state or formulate a common law principle in a new context, as made or created.  Hence, a judge deciding in reliance on an international norm will find a substantial element of discretionary judgment in the decision.  Second, along with, and in part driven by, this conceptual development has come an equally significant rethinking of the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 role in making common law.  In <em>Erie R. Co.</em> v. <em>Tompkins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html">304 U. S. 64</a>, 78, this Court denied the existence of any federal \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d common law, which largely withdrew to havens of specialty, with the general practice being to look for legislative guidance before exercising innovative authority over substantive law.  Third, a decision to create a private right of action is better left to legislative judgment in most cases.  <em>E.g., Correctional Services Corp.</em> v. <em>Malesko,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/61/index.html">534 U. S. 61</a>, 68.  Fourth, the potential implications for the foreign relations of the United States of recognizing private causes of action for violating international law should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.  Fifth, this Court has no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations, and modern indications of congressional understanding of the judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encouraged greater judicial creativity.  Pp. 30\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The limit on judicial recognition adopted here is fatal to Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Alvarez contends that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has attained the status of binding customary international law and that his arrest was arbitrary because no applicable law authorized it.  He thus invokes a general prohibition of arbitrary detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic law of some government.  However, he cites little authority that a rule so broad has the status of a binding customary norm today.  He certainly cites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his rule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implications would be breathtaking.  It would create a cause of action for any seizure of an alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplanting the actions under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 and <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, that now provide damages for such violations.  And it would create a federal action for arrests by state officers who simply exceed their authority under state law.  Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s failure to marshal support for his rule is underscored by the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, which refers to prolonged arbitrary detention, not relatively brief detention in excess of positive authority.  Whatever may be said for his broad principle, it expresses an aspiration exceeding any binding customary rule with the specificity this Court requires.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72671\xe2\x80\x932680, and whether he may recover under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.  We hold that he is not entitled to a remedy under either statute.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have considered the underlying facts before, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Machain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/655/index.html">504 U. S. 655</a> (1992).  In 1985, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Enrique Camarena-Salazar, was captured on assignment in Mexico and taken to a house in Guadalajara, where he was tortured over the course of a 2-day interrogation, then murdered.  Based in part on eyewitness testimony, DEA officials in the United States came to believe that respondent Humberto Alvarez-Machain (Alvarez), a Mexican physician, was present at the house and acted to prolong the agent\xe2\x80\x99s life in order to extend the interrogation and torture.  <em>Id</em>., at 657.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1990, a federal grand jury indicted Alvarez for the torture and murder of Camarena-Salazar, and the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a warrant for his arrest.  331 F.\xc2\xa03d 604, 609 (CA9 2003) (en banc).  The DEA asked the Mexican Government for help in getting Alvarez into the United States, but when the requests and negotiations proved fruitless, the DEA approved a plan to hire Mexican nationals to seize Alvarez and bring him to the United States for trial.  As so planned, a group of Mexicans, including petitioner Jose Francisco Sosa, abducted Alvarez from his house, held him overnight in a motel, and brought him by private plane to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested by federal officers.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once in American custody, Alvarez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his seizure was \xe2\x80\x9coutrageous governmental conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alvarez-Machain,</em> 504 U. S., at 658, and violated the extradition treaty between the United States and Mexico.  The District Court agreed, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, and we reversed, <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>670, holding that the fact of Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s forcible seizure did not affect the jurisdiction of a federal court.  The case was tried in 1992, and ended at the close of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case, when the District Court granted Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1993, after returning to Mexico, Alvarez began the civil action before us here.  He sued Sosa, Mexican citizen and DEA operative Antonio Garate-Bustamante, five unnamed Mexican civilians, the United States, and four DEA agents.  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 610.  So far as it matters here, Alvarez sought damages from the United States under the FTCA, alleging false arrest, and from Sosa under the ATS, for a violation of the law of nations.  The former statute authorizes suit \xe2\x80\x9cfor \xe2\x80\xa6 personal injury \xe2\x80\xa6 caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  The latter provides<f f="Times New Roman"> <f f="Century Schoolbook">in its entirety that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71350.</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the FTCA claim, but awarded summary judgment and $25,000 in damages to Alvarez on the ATS claim.  A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit then affirmed the ATS judgment, but reversed the dismissal of the FTCA claim.  266 F.\xc2\xa03d 1045 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided en banc court came to the same conclusion.  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 641.  As for the ATS claim, the court called on its own precedent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat [the ATS] not only provides federal courts with subject matter jurisdiction, but also creates a cause of action for an alleged violation of the law of nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 612.  The Circuit then relied upon what it called the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and universally recognized norm prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 620, to support the conclusion that Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest amounted to a tort in violation of international law.  On the FTCA claim, the Ninth Circuit held that, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe DEA had no authority to effect Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and detention in Mexico,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 608, the United States was liable to him under California law for the tort of false arrest, <em>id.</em>, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari in these companion cases to clarify the scope of both the FTCA and the ATS.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1045/index.html">540 U. S. 1045</a> (2003).  We now reverse in each.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government seeks reversal of the judgment of liability under the FTCA on two principal grounds.  It argues that the arrest could not have been tortious, because it was authorized by 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7878, setting out the arrest authority of the DEA, and it says that in any event the liability asserted here falls within the FTCA exception to waiver of sovereign immunity for claims \xe2\x80\x9carising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k).  We think the exception applies and decide on that ground.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cwas designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the United States from suits in tort and, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Government liable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Richards</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/369/1/index.html">369 U. S. 1</a>, 6 (1962); see also 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72674.  The Act accordingly gives federal district courts jurisdiction over claims against the United States for injury \xe2\x80\x9ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  But the Act also limits its waiver of sovereign immunity in a number of ways.

In the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, once Alvarez was within the borders of the United States, his detention was not tortious, see 331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 636\xe2\x80\x93637; the appellate court suggested that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s liability to Alvarez rested solely upon a false arrest claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641.  Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, however, was said to be \xe2\x80\x9cfalse,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus tortious, only because, and only to the extent that, it took place and endured in Mexico.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The actions in Mexico are thus most naturally understood as the kernel of a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d and barred from suit under the exception to the waiver of immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the straightforward language of the foreign country exception, the Ninth Circuit allowed the action to proceed under what has come to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cheadquarters doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some Courts of Appeals, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he entire scheme of the FTCA focuses on the place where the negligent or wrongful act or omission of the government employee occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sami</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 617 F.\xc2\xa02d 755, 761 (CADC 1979), have concluded that the foreign country exception does not exempt the United States from suit \xe2\x80\x9cfor acts or omissions occurring here which have their operative effect in another country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 762 (refusing to apply \xc2\xa72680(k) where a communiqu\xc3\xa9 sent from the United States by a federal law enforcement officer resulted in plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s wrongful detention in Germany).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Headquarters claims \xe2\x80\x9ctypically involve allegations of negligent guidance in an office within the United States of employees who cause damage while in a foreign country, or of activities which take place within a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cominotto</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 802 F.\xc2\xa02d 1127, 1130 (CA9 1986).  In such instances, these courts have concluded that \xc2\xa72680(k) does not bar suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasoning of the Ninth Circuit here was that, since Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s abduction in Mexico was the direct result of wrongful acts of planning and direction by DEA agents located in California, \xe2\x80\x9cAlvarez\xe2\x80\x99s abduction fits the headquarters doctrine like a glove.\xe2\x80\x9d  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 638.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWorking out of DEA offices in Los Angeles, [DEA agents] made the decision to kidnap Alvarez and \xe2\x80\xa6 gave [their Mexican intermediary] precise instructions on whom to recruit, how to seize Alvarez, and how he should be treated during the trip to the United States.  DEA officials in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., approved the details of the operation.  After Alvarez was abducted according to plan, DEA agents supervised his transportation into the United States, telling the arrest team where to land the plane and obtaining clearance in El Paso for landing.  The United States, and California in particular, served as command central for the operation carried out in Mexico.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 638\xe2\x80\x93639.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, the Ninth Circuit held that Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s claim did not \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] in\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign country.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The potential effect of this sort of headquarters analysis flashes the yellow caution light.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t will virtually always be possible to assert that the negligent activity that injured the plaintiff [abroad] was the consequence of faulty training, selection or supervision\xe2\x80\x94or even less than that, lack of careful training, selection or supervision\xe2\x80\x94in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beattie</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 756 F.\xc2\xa02d 91, 119 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Legal malpractice claims, <em>Knisley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 817 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 680, 691\xe2\x80\x93\n693 (SD Ohio 1993), allegations of negligent medical care, <em>Newborn</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 238 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 145, 148\xe2\x80\x93149 (DC 2002), and even slip-and-fall cases, <em>Eaglin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <em>Dept. of Army, </em>794 F.\xc2\xa02d 981, 983\xe2\x80\x93984 (CA5 1986), can all be repackaged as headquarters claims based on a failure to train, a failure to warn, the offering of bad advice, or the adoption of a negligent policy.  If we were to approve the headquarters exception to the foreign country exception, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98headquarters claim\xe2\x80\x99 [would] become a standard part of FTCA litigation\xe2\x80\x9d in cases potentially implicating the foreign country exception.  <em>Beattie</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 119 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The headquarters doctrine threatens to swallow the foreign country exception whole, certainly at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The need for skepticism is borne out by two considerations.  One of them is pertinent to cases like this one, where harm was arguably caused both by individual action in a foreign country as well as by planning in the United States; the other is suggested simply because the harm occurred on foreign soil.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although not every headquarters case is rested on an explicit analysis of proximate causation, this notion of cause is necessary to connect the domestic breach of duty (at headquarters) with the action in the foreign country (in a case like this) producing the foreign harm or injury.  It is necessary, in other words, to conclude that the act or omission at home headquarters was sufficiently close to the ultimate injury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make it reasonable to follow liability back to the headquarters behavior.  Only in this way could the behavior at headquarters properly be seen as the act or omission on which all FTCA liability must rest under \xc2\xa72675.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Cominotto</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 1130 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] headquarters claim exists where negligent acts in the United States proximately cause harm in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Eaglin</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 983 (noting that headquarters cases require \xe2\x80\x9ca plausible proximate nexus or connection between acts or omissions in the United States and the resulting damage or injury in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing this connection of proximate cause between domestic behavior and foreign harm or injury is not, however, sufficient of itself to bar application of the foreign country exception to a claim resting on that same foreign consequence.  Proximate cause is causation substantial enough and close enough to the harm to be recognized by law, but a given proximate cause need not be, and frequently is not, the exclusive proximate cause of harm.  See, <em>e.g</em>., 57A Am. Jur. 2d \xc2\xa7529 (2004) (discussing proper jury instructions in cases involving multiple proximate causes); <em>Beattie</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 121 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the ordinary case there may be <em>several</em> points along the chain of causality\xe2\x80\x9d pertinent to the enquiry).  Here, for example, assuming that the direction by DEA officials in California was a proximate cause of the abduction, the actions of Sosa and others in Mexico were just as surely proximate causes, as well.  Thus, understanding that California planning was a legal cause of the harm in no way eliminates the conclusion that the claim here arose from harm proximately caused by acts in Mexico.  At most, recognition of additional domestic causation under the headquarters doctrine leaves an open question whether the exception applies to the claim.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only does domestic proximate causation under the headquarters doctrine fail to eliminate application of the foreign country exception, but there is good reason to think that Congress understood a claim \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign country in such a way as to bar application of the headquarters doctrine.  There is good reason, that is, to conclude that Congress understood a claim \xe2\x80\x9carising in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d to be a claim for injury or harm occurring in a foreign country.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k).  This sense of \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d was the common usage in state borrowing statutes contemporary with the Act, which operated to determine which State\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations should apply in cases involving transjurisdictional facts.  When the FTCA was passed, the general rule, as set out in various state statutes, was that \xe2\x80\x9ca cause of action arising in another jurisdiction, which is barred by the laws of that jurisdiction, will [also] be barred in the domestic courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  41 A.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. 4th 1025, 1029, \xc2\xa72 (1985).  These borrowing statutes were typically restricted by express terms to situations where a cause of action was time barred in the State <em>\xe2\x80\x9cwhere [the]</em> <em>cause of action arose, or accrued, or originated.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  75 A.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. 203, 211 (1931) (emphasis in original).  Critically for present purposes, these variations on the theme of \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d were interpreted in tort cases in just the same way that we read the FTCA today.  A commentator noted in 1962 that, for the purposes of these borrowing statutes, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he courts unanimously hold that a cause of action sounding in tort arises in the jurisdiction where the last act necessary to establish liability occurred\xe2\x80\x9d; <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction in which injury was received.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ester, Borrowing Statutes of Limitation and Conflict of Laws, 15 U.\xc2\xa0Fla. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 33, 47.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, moreover, specific reason to believe that using \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d as referring to place of harm was central to the object of the foreign country exception.  Any tort action in a court of the United States based on the acts of a Government employee causing harm outside the State of the district court in which the action is filed requires a determination of the source of the substantive law that will govern liability.  When the FTCA was passed, the dominant principle in choice of law analysis for tort cases was <em>lex loci delicti: </em>courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred.  See <em>Richards</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 369 U. S., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe general conflict-of-laws rule, followed by a vast majority of the States, is to apply the law of the place of injury to the substantive rights of the parties\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)); see also Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7379 (1934) (defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability determined by \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of the place of wrong\xe2\x80\x9d);[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7377, Note 1 (place of wrong for torts involving bodily harm is <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe place where the harmful force</em> <em>takes effect</em> <em>upon the body\xe2\x80\x9d </em>(emphasis in original)); <em>ibid.</em> (same principle for torts of fraud and torts involving harm to property).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  For a plaintiff injured in a foreign country, then, the presumptive choice in American courts under the traditional rule would have been to apply foreign law to determine the tortfeasor\xe2\x80\x99s liability.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Day &amp; Zimmermann, Inc.</em> v. <em>Challoner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/3/index.html">423 U.

In 1942, the House Committee on the Judiciary considered an early draft of the FTCA that would have exempted all claims \xe2\x80\x9carising in a foreign country in behalf of an alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. 5373, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7303(12).  The bill was then revised, at the suggestion of the Attorney General, to omit the last five words.  In explaining the amendment to the House Committee on the Judiciary, Assistant Attorney General Shea said that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[c]laims arising in a foreign country have been exempted from this bill, H.\xc2\xa0R. 6463, whether or not the claimant is an alien.  Since liability is to be determined by the law of the situs of the wrongful act or omission it is wise to restrict the bill to claims arising in this country.  This seems desirable because the law of the particular State is being applied.  Otherwise, it will lead I think to a good deal of difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearings on H.\xc2\xa0R. 5373 et\xc2\xa0al. before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1942).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe amended version, which was enacted into law and constitutes the current text of the foreign country exception, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k), thus codified Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunwilling[ness] to subject the United States to liabilities depending upon the laws of a foreign power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spelar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/217/index.html">338 U. S. 217</a>, 221 (1949).  See also <em>Sami</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 617 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 762 (noting <em>Spelar</em>\xe2\x80\x99s explanation but attempting to recast the object behind the foreign country exception); <em>Leaf </em>v. <em>United States,</em> 588 F.\xc2\xa02d 733, 736, n.\xc2\xa03 (CA9 1978).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The object being to avoid application of substantive foreign law, Congress evidently used the modifier \xe2\x80\x9carising in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to claims based on foreign harm or injury, the fact that would trigger application of foreign law to determine liability.  That object, addressed by the quoted phrase, would obviously have been thwarted, however, by applying the headquarters doctrine, for that doctrine would have displaced the exception by recasting claims of foreign injury as claims not arising in a foreign country because some planning or negligence at domestic headquarters was their cause.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And that, in turn, would have resulted in applying foreign law of the place of injury, in accordance with the choice-of-law rule of the headquarters jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor, as a practical matter, can it be said that the headquarters doctrine has outgrown its tension with the exception.  It is true that the traditional approach to choice of substantive tort law has lost favor, Simson, The Choice-of-Law Revolution in the United States: Notes on Rereading Von Mehren, 36 Cornell Int\xe2\x80\x99l L.\xc2\xa0J. 125, 125 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe traditional methodology of place of wrong \xe2\x80\xa6 has receded in importance, and new approaches and concepts such as governmental interest analysis, most significant relationship, and better rule of law have taken center stage\xe2\x80\x9d (footnotes omitted)).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  But a good many States still employ essentially the same choice of law analysis in tort cases that the First Restatement exemplified.  Symeonides, Choice of Law in the American Courts, 51 Am. J. Comp. L. 1, 4\xe2\x80\x935 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cTen states continue to adhere to the traditional method in tort conflicts\xe2\x80\x9d); see, <em>e.g., Raskin</em> v. <em>Allison</em>, 30 Kan.

The Second Restatement itself, encouraging the general shift towards using flexible balancing analysis to inform choice of law,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] includes a default rule for tort cases rooted in the traditional approach: \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n an action for a personal injury, the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties, unless \xe2\x80\xa6 some other state has a more significant relationship \xe2\x80\xa6 to the occurrence and the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7146 (1969); see also <em>id.</em>, Comment <em>e</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cOn occasion, conduct and personal injury will occur in different states.  In such instances, the local law of the state of injury will usually be applied to determine most issues involving the tort\xe2\x80\x9d).  In practice, then, the new dispensation frequently leads to the traditional application of the law of the jurisdiction of injury.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dorman</em> v. <em>Emerson Elec. Co.</em>, 23 F.\xc2\xa03d 1354 (CA8 1994) (applying Canadian law where negligent saw design in Missouri caused injury in Canada); <em>Bing</em> v. <em>Halstead</em>, 495 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 517 (SDNY 1980) (applying Costa Rican law where letter written and mailed in Arizona caused mental distress in Costa Rica); <em>McKinnon</em> v. <em>F.\xc2\xa0H. Morgan &amp; Co.</em>, 170 Vt. 422, 750 A.\xc2\xa02d 1026 (2000) (applying Canadian law where a defective bicycle sold in Vermont caused injuries in Quebec).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, current flexibility in choice of law methodology gives no assurance against applying foreign substantive law if federal courts follow headquarters doctrine to assume jurisdiction over tort claims against the Government for foreign harm.  Based on the experience just noted, the expectation is that application of the headquarters doctrine would in fact result in a substantial number of cases applying the very foreign law the foreign country exception was meant to avoid.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before concluding that headquarters analysis should have no part in applying the foreign country exception, however, a word is needed to answer an argument for selective application of headquarters doctrine, that it ought to be permitted when a State\xe2\x80\x99s choice of law approach would not apply the foreign law of place of injury.  See<em> In\xc2\xa0re \xe2\x80\x9cAgent Orange\xe2\x80\x9d Product Liability Litigation</em>, 580 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1242, 1254 (EDNY 1984) (noting that the purpose of the exception did not apply to the litigation at hand because foreign law was not implicated).  The point would be well taken, of course, if Congress had written the exception to apply when foreign law would be applied.  But that is not what Congress said.  Its provision of an exception when a claim arises in a foreign country was written at a time when the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d was used in state statutes to express the position that a claim arises where the harm occurs; and the odds are that Congress meant simply this when it used the \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d language.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Finally, even if it were not a stretch to equate \xe2\x80\x9carising in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cimplicating foreign law,\xe2\x80\x9d the result of accepting headquarters analysis for foreign injury cases in which no application of foreign law would ensue would be a scheme of federal jurisdiction that would vary from State to State, benefiting or penalizing plaintiffs accordingly.  The idea that Congress would have intended any such jurisdictional variety is too implausible to drive the analysis to the point of grafting even a selective headquarters exception onto the foreign country exception itself.  We therefore hold that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s foreign country exception bars all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alvarez has also brought an action under the ATS against petitioner, Sosa, who argues (as does the United States supporting him) that there is no relief under the ATS because the statute does no more than vest federal courts with jurisdiction, neither creating nor authorizing the courts to recognize any particular right of action without further congressional action.  Although we agree the statute is in terms only jurisdictional, we think that at the time of enactment the jurisdiction enabled federal courts to hear claims in a very limited category defined by the law of nations and recognized at common law.  We do not believe, however, that the limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law <em>cum</em> common law claims understood in 1789 should be taken as authority to recognize the right of action asserted by Alvarez here.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Friendly called the ATS a \xe2\x80\x9clegal Lohengrin,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>IIT</em> v. <em>Vencap, Ltd.,</em> 519 F. 2d 1001, 1015 (CA2 1975); \xe2\x80\x9cno one seems to know whence it came,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and for over 170 years after its enactment it provided jurisdiction in only one case.  The first Congress passed it as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, in providing that the new federal district courts \xe2\x80\x9cshall also have cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, or the circuit courts, as the case may be, of all causes where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch.\xc2\xa020, \xc2\xa79<em>(b),</em> 1 Stat. 79.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties and <em>amici </em>here advance radically different historical interpretations of this terse provision.  Alvarez says that the ATS was intended not simply as a jurisdictional grant, but as authority for the creation of a new cause of action for torts in violation of international law.  We think that reading is implausible.  As enacted in 1789, the ATS gave the district courts \xe2\x80\x9ccognizance\xe2\x80\x9d of certain causes of action, and the term bespoke a grant of jurisdiction, not power to mold substantive law.  See, <em>e.g</em>., The Federalist No. 81, pp.\xc2\xa0447, 451 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (using \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably with \xe2\x80\x9ccognizance\xe2\x80\x9d).  The fact that the ATS was placed in \xc2\xa79 of the Judiciary Act, a statute otherwise exclusively concerned with federal-court jurisdiction, is itself support for its strictly jurisdictional nature.  Nor would the distinction between jurisdiction and cause of action have been elided by the drafters of the Act or those who voted on it.  As Fisher Ames put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a substantial difference between the jurisdiction of courts and rules of decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Cong. 807 (Gales ed. 1834).  It is unsurprising, then, that an authority on the historical origins of the ATS has written that \xe2\x80\x9csection 1350 clearly does not create a statutory cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the contrary suggestion is \xe2\x80\x9csimply frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Casto, The Federal Courts\xe2\x80\x99 Protective Jurisdiction Over Torts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Conn. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 467, 479, 480 (1986) (hereinafter Casto, Law of Nations); Cf. Dodge, The Constitutionality of the Alien Tort Statute: Some Observations on Text and Context, 42 Va. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 687, 689 (2002).  In sum, we think the statute was intended as jurisdictional in the sense of addressing the power of the courts to entertain cases concerned with a certain subject.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But holding the ATS jurisdictional raises a new question, this one about the interaction between the ATS at the time of its enactment and the ambient law of the era.  Sosa would have it that the ATS was stillborn because there could be no claim for relief without a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action.  <em>Amici </em>professors of federal jurisdiction and legal history take a different tack, that federal courts could entertain claims once the jurisdictional grant was on the books, because torts in violation of the law of nations would have been recognized within the common law of the time.  Brief for Vikram Amar et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae.  </em>We think history and practice give the edge to this latter position.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the <em>United States</em> declared their independence, they were bound to receive the law of nations, in its modern state of purity and refinement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ware</em> v. <em>Hylton,</em> 3 Dall. 199, 281 (1796) (Wilson, J.).  In the years of the early Republic, this law of nations comprised two principal elements, the first covering the general norms governing the behavior of national states with each other: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe science</em> <em>which teaches the rights subsisting between nations or</em> <em>states, and the obligations correspondent to those rights,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations, Preliminaries \xc2\xa73 (J.\xc2\xa0Chitty et\xc2\xa0al. transl. and ed. 1883) (hereinafter Vattel) (footnote omitted), or \xe2\x80\x9cthat code of public instruction which defines the rights and prescribes the duties of nations, in their intercourse with each other,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 James Kent Commentaries *1<font b="1">.  This aspect of the law of nations thus occupied the executive and legislative domains, not the judicial.  See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 68 (1769) (hereinafter Commentaries) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ffenses against\xe2\x80\x9d the law of nations are \xe2\x80\x9cprincipally incident to whole states or nations\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law of nations included a second, more pedestrian element, however, that did fall within the judicial sphere, as a body of judge-made law regulating the conduct of individuals situated outside domestic boundaries and consequently carrying an international savor.  To Blackstone, the law of nations in this sense was implicated \xe2\x80\x9cin mercantile questions, such as bills of exchange and the like; in all marine causes, relating to freight, average, demurrage, insurances, bottomry \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0; [and] in all disputes relating to prizes, to shipwrecks, to hostages, and ransom bills.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 67.  The law merchant emerged from the customary practices of international traders and admiralty required its own transnational regulation.  And it was the law of nations in this sense that our precursors spoke about when the Court explained the status of coast fishing vessels in wartime grew from \xe2\x80\x9cancient usage among civilized nations, beginning centuries ago, and gradually ripening into a rule of international law \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Paquete Habana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/175/677/index.html">175 U. S. 677</a>, 686 (1900).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was, finally, a sphere in which these rules binding individuals for the benefit of other individuals overlapped with the norms of state relationships.  Blackstone referred to it when he mentioned three specific offenses against the law of nations addressed by the criminal law of England: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.  4 Commentaries 68.  An assault against an ambassador, for example, impinged upon the sovereignty of the foreign nation and if not adequately redressed could rise to an issue of war.  See Vattel 463\xe2\x80\x93464.  It was this narrow set of violations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial remedy and at the same time threatening serious consequences in international affairs, that was probably on minds of the men who drafted the ATS with its reference to tort.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before there was any ATS, a distinctly American preoccupation with these hybrid international norms had taken shape owing to the distribution of political power from independence through the period of confederation.  The Continental Congress was hamstrung by its inability to \xe2\x80\x9ccause infractions of treaties, or of the law of nations to be punished,\xe2\x80\x9d J. Madison, Journal of the Constitutional Convention 60 (E. Scott ed. 1893), and in 1781 the Congress implored the States to vindicate rights under the law of nations.  In words that echo Blackstone, the congressional resolution called upon state legislatures to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide expeditious, exemplary, and adequate punishment\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation of safe conducts or passports, \xe2\x80\xa6 of hostility against such as are in amity, \xe2\x80\xa6 with the United States, \xe2\x80\xa6 infractions of the immunities of ambassadors and other public ministers \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] \xe2\x80\x9cinfractions of treaties and conventions to which the United States are a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 Journals of the Continental Congress 1136\xe2\x80\x931137 (G. Hunt ed. 1912) (hereinafter Journals of the Continental Congress).  The resolution recommended that the States \xe2\x80\x9cauthorise suits \xe2\x80\xa6 for damages by the party injured, and for compensation to the United States for damage sustained by them from an injury done to a foreign power by a citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1137; cf. Vattel 463\xe2\x80\x93464 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever offends \xe2\x80\xa6 a public minister \xe2\x80\xa6 should be punished \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, and \xe2\x80\xa6 the state should, at the expense of the delinquent, give full satisfaction to the sovereign who has been offended in the person of his minister\xe2\x80\x9d).  Apparently only one State acted upon the recommendation, see First Laws of the State of Connecticut 82, 83 (J. Cushing ed. 1982) (1784 compilation; exact date of Act unknown), but Congress had done what it could to signal a commitment to enforce the law of nations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appreciation of the Continental Congress\xe2\x80\x99s incapacity to deal with this class of cases was intensified by the so-called Marbois incident of May 1784, in which a French adventurer, Longchamps, verbally and physically assaulted the Secretary of the French Legion in Philadelphia.  See <em>Respublica</em> v. <em>De Longchamps,</em> 1 Dall. 111 (O.\xc2\xa0T. Phila. 1784).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Congress called again for state legislation addressing such matters, and concern over the inadequate vindication of the law of nations persisted through the time of the constitutional convention.  See 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p.\xc2\xa025 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (speech of J. Randolph).  During the Convention itself, in fact, a New York City constable produced a reprise of the Marbois affair and Secretary Jay reported to Congress on the Dutch Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s protest, with the explanation that \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal government does not appear \xe2\x80\xa6 to be vested with any judicial Powers competent to the Cognizance and Judgment of such Cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Casto, Law of Nations 494, and n.\xc2\xa0152.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Framers responded by vesting the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9call Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and Consuls.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72, and the First Congress followed through.  The Judiciary Act reinforced this Court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction over suits brought by diplomats, see 1 Stat. 80, ch. 20, \xc2\xa713, created alienage jurisdiction, \xc2\xa711 and, of course, included the ATS, \xc2\xa79.  See generally Randall, Federal Jurisdiction over International Law Claims: Inquiries into the Alien Tort Statute, 18 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. &amp; Pol. 1, 15\xe2\x80\x9321 (1985) (discussing foreign affairs implications of the Judiciary Act); W. Casto, The Supreme Court in the Early Republic 27\xe2\x80\x9353 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Congress modified the draft of what became the Judiciary Act, see generally Warren, New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 49 (1923), it made hardly any changes to the provisions on aliens, including what became the ATS, see Casto, Law of Nations 498.  There is no record of congressional discussion about private actions that might be subject to the jurisdictional provision, or about any need for further legislation to create private remedies; there is no record even of debate on the section.  Given the poverty of drafting history, modern commentators have necessarily concentrated on the text, remarking on the innovative use of the word \xe2\x80\x9ctort,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g</em>., Sweeney, A Tort only in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Hastings Int\xe2\x80\x99l &amp; Comp. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 445 (1995) (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9ctort\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the law of prize), and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s mixture of terms expansive (\xe2\x80\x9call suits\xe2\x80\x9d), see, <em>e.g</em>., Casto, Law of Nations 500, and restrictive (\xe2\x80\x9cfor a tort only\xe2\x80\x9d), see, <em>e.g</em>., Randall, <em>supra, </em>at 28\xe2\x80\x9331 (limiting suits to torts, as opposed to commercial actions, especially by British plaintiffs).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The historical scholarship has also placed the ATS within the competition between federalist and antifederalist forces over the national role in foreign relations.  <em>Id</em>., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (nonexclusiveness of federal jurisdiction under the ATS may reflect compromise).  But despite considerable scholarly attention, it is fair to say that a consensus understanding of what Congress intended has proven elusive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, the history does tend to support two propositions.  First, there is every reason to suppose that the First Congress did not pass the ATS as a jurisdictional convenience to be placed on the shelf for use by a future Congress or state legislature that might, some day, authorize the creation of causes of action or itself decide to make some element of the law of nations actionable for the benefit of foreigners.  The anxieties of the preconstitutional period cannot be ignored easily enough to think that the statute was not meant to have a practical effect.  Consider that the principal draftsman of the ATS was apparently Oliver Ellsworth,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] previously a member of the Continental Congress that had passed the 1781 resolution and a member of the Connecticut Legislature that made good on that congressional request.  See generally W. Brown, The Life of Oliver Ellsworth (1905).  Consider, too, that the First Congress was attentive enough to the law of nations to recognize certain offenses expressly as criminal, including the three mentioned by Blackstone.  See An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes Against the United States, \xc2\xa78, 1 Stat. 113\xe2\x80\x93114 (murder or robbery, or other capital crimes, punishable as piracy if committed on the high seas), and \xc2\xa728, <em>id., </em>at 118 (violation of safe conducts and assaults against ambassadors punished by imprisonment and fines described as \xe2\x80\x9cinfract[ions of] the law of nations\xe2\x80\x9d).  It would have been passing strange for Ellsworth and this very Congress to vest federal courts expressly with jurisdiction to entertain civil causes brought by aliens alleging violations of the law of nations, but to no effect whatever until the Congress should take further action.  There is too much in the historical record to believe that Congress would have enacted the ATS only to leave it lying fallow indefinitely.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second inference to be drawn from the history is that Congress intended the ATS to furnish jurisdiction for a relatively modest set of actions alleging violations of the law of nations.  Uppermost in the legislative mind appears to have been offenses against ambassadors, see <em>id., </em>at 118; violations of safe conduct were probably understood to be actionable, <em>ibid</em>., and individual actions arising out of prize captures and piracy may well have also been contemplated.  <em>Id</em>., at 113\xe2\x80\x93114.  But the common law appears to have understood only those three of the hybrid variety as definite and actionable, or at any rate, to have assumed only a very limited set of claims.  As Blackstone had put it, \xe2\x80\x9coffences against this law [of nations] are principally incident to whole states or nations,\xe2\x80\x9d and not individuals seeking relief in court.  4 Commentaries 68.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sparse contemporaneous cases and legal materials referring to the ATS tend to confirm both inferences, that some, but few, torts in violation of the law of nations were understood to be within the common law.  In <em>Bolchos </em>v<em>. Darrel</em>, 3 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 810 (No. 1,607) (S.\xc2\xa0C. 1795), the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s doubt about admiralty jurisdiction over a suit for damages brought by a French privateer against the mortgagee of a British slave ship was assuaged by assuming that the ATS was a jurisdictional basis for the court\xe2\x80\x99s action.  Nor is <em>Moxon </em>v<em>. The Fanny</em>, 17 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 942 (No. 9, 895) (Pa. 1793), to the contrary, a case in which the owners of a British ship sought damages for its seizure in United States waters by a French privateer.  The District Court said in dictum that the ATS was not the proper vehicle for suit because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t cannot be called a suit for a tort only, when the property, as well as damages for the supposed trespass, are sought for.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 948.  But the judge gave no intimation that further legislation would have been needed to give the District Court jurisdiction over a suit limited to damages.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then there was the 1795 opinion of Attorney General William Bradford, who was asked whether criminal prosecution was available against Americans who had taken part in the French plunder of a British slave colony in Sierra Leone.  1 Op. Atty. Gen. 57.  Bradford was uncertain, but he made it clear that a federal court was open for the prosecution of a tort action growing out of the episode:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cBut there can be no doubt that the company or individuals who have been injured by these acts of hostility have a remedy by a <em>civil</em> suit in the courts of the United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of the United States\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 59.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although it is conceivable that Bradford (who had prosecuted in the Marbois incident, see Casto, Law of Nations 503, n.\xc2\xa0201) assumed that there had been a violation of a treaty, 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 58, that is certainly not obvious, and it appears likely that Bradford understood the ATS to provide jurisdiction over what must have amounted to common law causes of action.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against these indications that the ATS was meant to underwrite litigation of a narrow set of common law actions derived from the law of nations, Sosa raises two main objections.  First, he claims that this conclusion makes no sense in view of the Continental Congress\xe2\x80\x99s 1781 recommendation to state legislatures to pass laws authorizing such suits.  Sosa thinks state legislation would have been \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioner Sosa 5, if common law remedies had been available.  Second, Sosa juxtaposes Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s treatise mentioning violations of the law of nations as occasions for criminal remedies, against the statute\xe2\x80\x99s innovative reference to \xe2\x80\x9ctort,\xe2\x80\x9d as evidence that there was no familiar set of legal actions for exercise of jurisdiction under the ATS.  Neither argument is\nconvincing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The notion that it would have been absurd for the Continental Congress to recommend that States pass positive law to duplicate remedies already available at common law rests on a misunderstanding of the relationship between common law and positive law in the late 18th century, when positive law was frequently relied upon to reinforce and give standard expression to the \xe2\x80\x9cbrooding omnipresence\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] of the common law then thought discoverable by reason.  As Blackstone clarified the relation between positive law and the law of nations, \xe2\x80\x9cthose acts of parliament, which have from time to time been made to enforce this universal law, or to facilitate the execution of [its] decisions, are not to be considered as introductive of any new rule, but merely as declaratory of the old fundamental constitutions of the kingdom; without which it must cease to be a part of the civilized world.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Commentaries 67.  Indeed, Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s argument is undermined by the 1781 resolution on which he principally relies.  Notwithstanding the undisputed fact (per Blackstone) that the common law afforded criminal law remedies for violations of the law of nations, the Continental Congress encouraged state legislatures to pass criminal statutes to the same effect, and the first Congress did the same, <em>supra,</em> at 23.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we convinced by Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s argument that legislation conferring a right of action is needed because Blackstone treated international law offenses under the rubric of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic wrongs,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the ATS uses a word, \xe2\x80\x9ctort,\xe2\x80\x9d that was relatively uncommon in the legal vernacular of the day.  It is true that Blackstone did refer to what he deemed the three principal offenses against the law of nations in the course of discussing criminal sanctions, observing that it was in the interest of sovereigns \xe2\x80\x9cto animadvert upon them with a becoming severity, that the peace of the world may be maintained,\xe2\x80\x9d 4 Commentaries 68.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  But Vattel explicitly linked the criminal sanction for offenses against ambassadors with the requirement that the state, \xe2\x80\x9cat the expense of the delinquent, give full satisfaction to the sovereign who has been offended in the person of his minister.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vattel 463\xe2\x80\x93464.  Cf. Stephens, Individuals Enforcing International Law: The Comparative and Historical Context, 52 DePaul L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 433, 444 (2002) (observing that a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed approach to international law violations, encompassing both criminal prosecution \xe2\x80\xa6 and compensation to those injured through a civil suit, would have been familiar to the founding generation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The 1781 resolution goes a step further in showing that a private remedy was thought necessary for diplomatic offenses under the law of nations.  And the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Letter of 1795, as well as the two early federal precedents discussing the ATS, point to a prevalent assumption that Congress did not intend the ATS to sit on the shelf until some future time when it might enact further legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, although the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action, the reasonable inference from the historical materials is that the statute was intended to have practical effect the moment it became law.  The jurisdictional grant is best read as having been enacted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it is correct, then, to assume that the First Congress understood that the district courts would recognize private causes of action for certain torts in violation of the law of nations, though we have found no basis to suspect Congress had any examples in mind beyond those torts corresponding to Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s three primary offenses: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.  We assume, too, that no development in the two centuries from the enactment of \xc2\xa71350 to the birth of the modern line of cases beginning with <em>Filartiga </em>v<em>. Pena-Irala</em>, 630 F.\xc2\xa02d 876 (CA2 1980), has categorically precluded federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element of common law; Congress has not in any relevant way amended \xc2\xa71350 or limited civil common law power by another statute.  Still, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court should exercise in considering a new cause of action of this kind.  Accordingly, we think courts should require any claim based on the present-day law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms we have recognized.  This requirement is fatal to Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s claim.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A series of reasons argue for judicial caution when considering the kinds of individual claims that might implement the jurisdiction conferred by the early statute.  First, the prevailing conception of the common law has changed since 1789 in a way that counsels restraint in judicially applying internationally generated norms.  When \xc2\xa71350 was enacted, the accepted conception was of the common law as \xe2\x80\x9ca transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Black and White Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co.</em> v. <em>Brown and Yellow Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/276/518/index.html">276 U. S. 518</a>, 533 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  Now, however, in most cases where a court is asked to state or formulate a common law principle in a new context, there is a general understanding that the law is not so much found or discovered as it is either made or created.  Holmes explained famously in 1881 that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cin substance the growth of the law is legislative \xe2\x80\xa6 [because t]he very considerations which judges most rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life.  I mean, of course, considerations of what is expedient for the community concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Common Law 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (Howe ed. 1963).</p>\n<p align="left">\nOne need not accept the Holmesian view as far as its ultimate implications to acknowledge that a judge deciding in reliance on an international norm will find a substantial element of discretionary judgment in the decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, along with, and in part driven by, that conceptual development in understanding common law has come an equally significant rethinking of the role of the federal courts in making it.  <em>Erie R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Tompkins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html"></a><a href="/us/304/64/index.html">304 U. S. 64</a> (1938), was the watershed in which we denied the existence of any federal \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d common law, <em>id.</em>, at 78, which largely withdrew to havens of specialty, some of them defined by express congressional authorization to devise a body of law directly, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Textile Workers</em> v. <em>Lincoln Mills of Ala.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/index.html">353 U. S. 448</a> (1957) (interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements); Fed. Rule Evid. 501 (evidentiary privileges in federal-question cases).  Elsewhere, this Court has thought it was in order to create federal common law rules in interstitial areas of particular federal interest.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kimbell Foods, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/715/index.html">440 U. S. 715</a>, 726\xe2\x80\x93727 (1979).[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  And although we have even assumed competence to make judicial rules of decision of particular importance to foreign relations, such as the act of state doctrine, see <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba</em> v. <em>Sabbatino</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/398/index.html">376 U. S. 398</a>, 427 (1964), the general practice has been to look for legislative guidance before exercising innovative authority over substantive law.  It would be remarkable\nto take a more aggressive role in exercising a jurisdiction that remained largely in shadow for much of the prior two centuries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, this Court has recently and repeatedly said that a decision to create a private right of action is one better left to legislative judgment in the great majority of cases.  <em>Correctional Services Corp.</em> v. <em>Malesko,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/61/index.html">534 U. S. 61</a>, 68 (2001); <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 286\xe2\x80\x93287 (2001).  The creation of a private right of action raises issues beyond the mere consideration whether underlying primary conduct should be allowed or not, entailing, for example, a decision to permit enforcement without the check imposed by prosecutorial discretion.  Accordingly, even when Congress has made it clear by statute that a rule applies to purely domestic conduct, we are reluctant to infer intent to provide a private cause of action where the statute does not supply one expressly.  While the absence of congressional action addressing private rights of action under an international norm is more equivocal than its failure to provide such a right when it creates a statute, the possible collateral consequences of making international rules privately actionable argue for judicial caution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the subject of those collateral consequences is itself a reason for a high bar to new private causes of action for violating international law, for the potential implications for the foreign relations of the United States of recognizing such causes should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.  It is one thing for American courts to enforce constitutional limits on our own State and Federal Governments\xe2\x80\x99 power, but quite another to consider suits under rules that would go so far as to claim a limit on the power of foreign governments over their own citizens, and to hold that a foreign government or its agent has transgressed those limits.  Cf. <em>Sabbatino</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 431\xe2\x80\x93432.  Yet modern international law is very much concerned with just such questions, and apt to stimulate calls for vindicating private interests in \xc2\xa71350 cases.  Since many attempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the violation of new norms of international law would raise risks of adverse foreign policy consequences, they should be undertaken, if at all, with great caution.  Cf. <em>Tel-Oren</em> v. <em>Libyan Arab Republic</em>, 726 F.\xc2\xa02d 774, 813 (CADC 1984) (Bork, J., concurring) (expressing doubt that \xc2\xa71350 should be read to require \xe2\x80\x9cour courts [to] sit in judgment of the conduct of foreign officials in their own countries with respect to their own citizens\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fifth reason is particularly important in light of the first four.  We have no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations, and modern indications of congressional understanding of the judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encouraged greater judicial creativity.  It is true that a clear mandate appears in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, providing authority that \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[es] an unambiguous and modern basis for\xe2\x80\x9d federal claims of torture and extrajudicial killing, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x93367, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa03 (1991).  But that affirmative authority is confined to specific subject matter, and although the legislative history includes the remark that \xc2\xa71350 should \xe2\x80\x9cremain intact to permit suits based on other norms that already exist or may ripen in the future into rules of customary international law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 4, Congress as a body has done nothing to promote such suits.  Several times, indeed, the Senate has expressly declined to give the federal courts the task of interpreting and applying international human rights law, as when its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declared that the substantive provisions of the document were not self-executing.  138 Cong. Rec. 8071 (1992).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These reasons argue for great caution in adapting the law of nations to private rights.  Justice Scalia, <em>post</em>, p.\xc2\xa01 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) concludes that caution is too hospitable, and a word is in order to summarize where we have come so far and to focus our difference with him on whether some norms of today\xe2\x80\x99s law of nations may ever be recognized legitimately by federal courts in the absence of congressional action beyond \xc2\xa71350.  All Members of the Court agree that \xc2\xa71350 is only jurisdictional.  We also agree, or at least Justice Scalia does not dispute, <em>post</em>, at 2, 7, that the jurisdiction was originally understood to be available to enforce a small number of international norms that a federal court could properly recognize as within the common law enforceable without further statutory authority.  Justice Scalia concludes, however, that two subsequent developments should be understood to preclude federal courts from recognizing any further international norms as judicially enforceable today, absent further congressional action.  As described before, we now tend to understand common law not as a discoverable reflection of universal reason but, in a positivistic way, as a product of human choice.  And we now adhere to a conception of limited judicial power first expressed in reorienting federal diversity jurisdiction, see <em>Erie</em> <em>R.\xc2\xa0Co. </em>v<em>. Tompkins, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html"></a><a href="/us/304/64/index.html">304 U. S. 64</a> (1938), that federal courts have no authority to derive \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d common law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whereas Justice Scalia sees these developments as sufficient to close the door to further independent judicial recognition of actionable international norms, other considerations persuade us that the judicial power should be exercised on the understanding that the door is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping, and thus open to a narrow class of international norms today.  <em>Erie</em> did not in terms bar any judicial recognition of new substantive rules, no matter what the circumstances, and post-<em>Erie</em> understanding has identified limited enclaves in which federal courts may derive some substantive law in a common law way.  For two centuries we have affirmed that the domestic law of the United States recognizes the law of nations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Sabbatino</em>, 376 U. S., at 423 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is, of course, true that United States courts apply international law as a part of our own in appropriate circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d);[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] <em>The Paquete Habana,</em> 175 U. S., at 700 (\xe2\x80\x9cInternational law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>The Nereide,</em> 9 Cranch 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court is bound by the law of nations which is a part of the law of the land\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Texas Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/630/index.html">451 U. S. 630</a>, 641 (1981) (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cinternational disputes implicating \xe2\x80\xa6 our relations with foreign nations\xe2\x80\x9d are one of the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow areas\xe2\x80\x9d in which \xe2\x80\x9cfederal common law\xe2\x80\x9d continues to exist).  It would take some explaining to say now that federal courts must avert their gaze entirely from any international norm intended to protect individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think an attempt to justify such a position would be particularly unconvincing in light of what we know about congressional understanding bearing on this issue lying at the intersection of the judicial and legislative powers.  The First Congress, which reflected the understanding of the framing generation and included some of the Framers, assumed that federal courts could properly identify some international norms as enforceable in the exercise of \xc2\xa71350 jurisdiction.  We think it would be unreasonable to assume that the First Congress would have expected federal courts to lose all capacity to recognize enforceable international norms simply because the common law might lose some metaphysical cachet on the road to modern realism.  Later Congresses seem to have shared our view.  The position we take today has been assumed by some federal courts for 24 years, ever since the Second Circuit decided <em>Filartiga</em> v. <em>Pena-Irala,</em> 630 F.\xc2\xa02d 876 (CA2 1980), and for practical purposes the point of today\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement has been focused since the exchange between Judge Edwards and Judge Bork in <em>Tel-Oren </em>v.<em> Libyan Arab Republic, </em>726 F.\xc2\xa02d 774 (CADC 1984), Congress, however, has not only expressed no disagreement with our view of the proper exercise of the judicial power, but has responded to its most notable instance by enacting legislation supplementing the judicial determination in some detail.  See <em>supra</em>, at 34 (discussing the Torture Victim Protection Act).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While we agree with Justice Scalia to the point that we would welcome any congressional guidance in exercising jurisdiction with such obvious potential to affect foreign relations, nothing Congress has done is a reason for us to shut the door to the law of nations entirely.  It is enough to say that Congress may do that at any time (explicitly, or implicitly by treaties or statutes that occupy the field) just as it may modify or cancel any judicial decision so far as it rests on recognizing an international norm as such.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must still, however, derive a standard or set of standards for assessing the particular claim Alvarez raises, and for this case it suffices to look to the historical antecedents.  Whatever the ultimate criteria for accepting a cause of action subject to jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71350, we are persuaded that federal courts should not recognize private claims under federal common law for violations of any international law norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the historical paradigms familiar when \xc2\xa71350 was enacted.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> 5 Wheat. 153, 163\xe2\x80\x93180, n.\xc2\xa0<em>a</em> (1820) (illustrating the specificity with which the law of nations defined piracy). <em> </em>This limit upon judicial recognition is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of the courts and judges who faced the issue before it reached this Court.  See <em>Filartiga</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 890 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become\xe2\x80\x94like the pirate and slave trader before him\xe2\x80\x94<em>hostis humani generis</em>, an enemy of all mankind\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Tel-Oren</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 781 (Edwards, J., concurring) (suggesting that the \xe2\x80\x9climits of section 1350\xe2\x80\x99s reach\xe2\x80\x9d be defined by \xe2\x80\x9ca handful of heinous actions\xe2\x80\x94each of which violates definable, universal and obligatory norms\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Estate of Marcos Human Rights Litigation</em>, 25 F.\xc2\xa03d 1467, 1475 (CA9 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cActionable violations of international law must be of a norm that is specific, universal, and obligatory\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the determination whether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause of action[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] should (and, indeed, inevitably must) involve an element of judgment about the practical consequences of making that cause available to litigants in the federal courts.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s detention claim must be gauged against the current state of international law, looking to those sources we have long, albeit cautiously, recognized.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here there is no treaty, and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to the customs and usages of civilized nations; and, as evidence of these, to the works of jurists and commentators, who by years of labor, research and experience, have made themselves peculiarly well acquainted with the subjects of which they treat.  Such works are resorted to by judicial tribunals, not for the speculations of their authors concerning what the law ought to be, but for trustworthy evidence of what the law really is.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Paquete Habana,</em> 175 U. S., at 700.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, Alvarez cites two well-known international agreements that, despite their moral authority, have little utility under the standard set out in this opinion.  He says that his abduction by Sosa was an \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary arrest\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Declaration), G.\xc2\xa0A. Res. 217A (III), U.\xc2\xa0N. Doc. A/810 (1948).  And he traces the rule against arbitrary arrest not only to the Declaration, but also to article nine of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Covenant), Dec. 19, 1996, 999 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 171,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] to which the United States is a party, and to various other conventions to which it is not.  But the Declaration does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.  See Humphrey, The UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in The International Protection of Human Rights 39, 50 (E. Luard ed. 1967) (quoting Eleanor Roosevelt calling the Declaration \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a statement of principles \xe2\x80\xa6 setting up a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not a treaty or international agreement \xe2\x80\xa6 impos[ing] legal obligations\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  And, although the Covenant does bind the United States as a matter of international law, the United States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding that it was not self-executing and so did not itself create obligations enforceable in the federal courts.  See <em>supra</em>, at 33.  Accordingly, Alvarez cannot say that the Declaration and Covenant themselves establish the relevant and applicable rule of international law.  He instead attempts to show that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has attained the status of binding customary international law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, it is useful to examine Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s complaint in greater detail.  As he presently argues it, the claim does not rest on the cross-border feature of his abduction.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Although the District Court granted relief in part on finding a violation of international law in taking Alvarez across the border from Mexico to the United States, the Court of Appeals rejected that ground of liability for failure to identify a norm of requisite force prohibiting a forcible abduction across a border.  Instead, it relied on the conclusion that the law of the United States did not authorize Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, because the DEA lacked extraterritorial authority under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7878, and because Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4(d)(2) limited the warrant for Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest to \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  It is this position that Alvarez takes now: that his arrest was arbitrary and as such forbidden by international law not because it infringed the prerogatives of Mexico, but because no applicable law authorized it.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alvarez thus invokes a general prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic law of some government, regardless of the circumstances.  Whether or not this is an accurate reading of the Covenant, Alvarez cites little authority that a rule so broad has the status of a binding customary norm today.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  He certainly cites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his broad rule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implications would be breathtaking.  His rule would support a cause of action in federal court for any arrest, anywhere in the world, unauthorized by the law of the jurisdiction in which it took place, and would create a cause of action for any seizure of an alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplanting the actions under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 and <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971), that now provide damages remedies for such violations.  It would create an action in federal court for arrests by state officers who simply exceed their authority; and for the violation of any limit that the law of any country might place on the authority of its own officers to arrest.  And all of this assumes that Alvarez could establish that Sosa was acting on behalf of a government when he made the arrest, for otherwise he would need a rule broader still.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s failure to marshal support for his proposed rule is underscored by the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987), which says in its discussion of customary international human rights law that a \xe2\x80\x9cstate violates international law if, as a matter of state policy, it practices, encourages, or condones \xe2\x80\xa6 prolonged arbitrary detention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>\xc2\xa7702.  Although the Restatement does not explain its requirements of a \xe2\x80\x9cstate policy\xe2\x80\x9d and of \xe2\x80\x9cprolonged\xe2\x80\x9d detention, the implication is clear.  Any credible invocation of a principle against arbitrary detention that the civilized world accepts as binding customary international law requires a factual basis beyond relatively brief detention in excess of positive authority.  Even the Restatement\xe2\x80\x99s limits are only the beginning of the enquiry, because although it is easy to say that some policies of prolonged arbitrary detentions are so bad that those who enforce them become enemies of the human race, it may be harder to say which policies cross that line with the certainty afforded by Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s three common law offenses.  In any event, the label would never fit the reckless policeman who botches his warrant, even though that same officer might pay damages under municipal law.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Groh</em> v. <em>Ramirez,</em> 540 U. S. ___ (2004).[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever may be said for the broad principle Alvarez advances, in the present, imperfect world, it expresses an aspiration that exceeds any binding customary rule having the specificity we require.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Creating a private cause of action to further that aspiration would go beyond any residual common law discretion we think it appropriate to exercise.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  It is enough to hold that a single illegal detention of less than a day, followed by the transfer of custody to lawful authorities and a prompt arraignment, violates no norm of customary international law so well defined as to support the creation of a federal remedy.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left"><right><em>Reversed.</em></right></p><em>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a></casctfnt></em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0In the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, it was critical that \xe2\x80\x9cDEA agents had no authority under federal law to execute an extraterritorial arrest of a suspect indicted in federal court in Los Angeles.\xe2\x80\x9d  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 640.

Section 1350 was enacted on the congressional understanding that courts would exercise jurisdiction by entertaining some common law claims derived from the law of nations; and we know of no reason to think that federal-question jurisdiction was extended subject to any comparable congressional assumption.  Further, our holding today is consistent with the division of responsibilities between federal and state courts after <em>Erie</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 32, 35\xe2\x80\x9336, as a more expansive common law power related to 28 U.

For example, the European Commission argues as <em>amicus curiae</em> that basic principles of international law require that before asserting a claim in a foreign forum, the claimant must have exhausted any remedies available in the domestic legal system, and perhaps in other fora such as international claims tribunals.  See Brief for European Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 24, n.\xc2\xa054 (citing I. Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law 472\xe2\x80\x93481 (6th ed. 2003)); cf.

We would certainly consider this requirement in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p>\n\nAnother possible limitation that we need not apply here is a policy of case-specific deference to the political branches.  For example, there are now pending in federal district court several class actions seeking damages from various corporations alleged to have participated in, or abetted, the regime of apartheid that formerly controlled South Africa.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re South African Apartheid Litigation</em>, 238 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 1379 (JPML 2002) (granting a motion to transfer the cases to the Southern District of New York).

None of these suffice.  The Bassiouni survey does show that many nations recognize a norm against arbitrary detention, but that consensus is at a high level of generality.  The <em>Iran</em> case, in which the United States sought relief for the taking of its diplomatic and consular staff as hostages, involved a different set of international norms and mentioned the problem of arbitrary detention only in passing; the detention in that case was, moreover, far longer and harsher than Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s.

Alvarez asserted such a claim, but the District Court concluded that the applicable law was the law of California, and that under California law Sosa had been privileged to make a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s arrest in Mexico.  Whether this was correct is not now before us, though we discern tension between the court\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous conclusions that the detention so lacked any legal basis as to violate international law, yet was privileged by state law against ordinary tort recovery.</p>\n<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is not that violations of a rule logically foreclose the existence of that rule as international law.

Nevertheless, that a rule as stated is as far from full realization as the one Alvarez urges is evidence against its status as binding law; and an even clearer point against the creation by judges of a private cause of action to enforce the aspiration behind the rule claimed.</p>\n<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Alvarez also cites, Brief for Respondent Alvarez-Machain 49\xe2\x80\x9350, a finding by a United Nations working group that his detention was arbitrary under the Declaration, the Covenant, and customary international law.

Unlike the general common law that preceded it, however, federal common law was self-consciously \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovered,\xe2\x80\x9d by judges who sought to avoid falling under the sway of (in Holmes\xe2\x80\x99s hyperbolic language) \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fallacy and illusion\xe2\x80\x9d that there exists \xe2\x80\x9ca transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Black and White Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co.</em> v. <em>Brown and Yellow Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/276/518/index.html">276 U. S. 518</a>, 533 (1928) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because post-<em>Erie</em> federal common law is made, not discovered, federal courts must possess some federal-common-law-making authority before undertaking to craft it.  \xe2\x80\x9cFederal courts, unlike state courts, are not general common-law courts and do not possess a general power to develop and apply their own rules of decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milwaukee</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/index.html">451 U. S. 304</a>, 312 (1981).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The general rule as formulated in <em>Texas Industries</em>, 451 U. S., at 640\xe2\x80\x93641,<em> </em>is that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he vesting of jurisdiction in the federal courts does not in and of itself give rise to authority to formulate federal common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  This rule applies not only to applications of federal common law that would displace a state rule, but also to applications that simply create a private cause of action under a federal statute.  Indeed, <em>Texas Industries</em> itself involved the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s unsuccessful request for an application of the latter sort\xe2\x80\x94creation of a right of contribution to damages assessed under the antitrust laws.  See <em>id.</em>, at 639\xe2\x80\x93646.  See also <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Transport Workers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/77/index.html">451 U. S. 77</a>, 99 (1981) (declining to create a federal-common-law right of contribution to damages assessed under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule against finding a delegation of substantive lawmaking power in a grant of jurisdiction is subject to exceptions, some better established than others.  The most firmly entrenched is admiralty law, derived from the grant of admiralty jurisdiction in Article III, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa03, of the Constitution.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction federal courts develop and apply a body of general maritime law, \xe2\x80\x9cthe well-known and well-developed venerable law of the sea which arose from the custom among seafaring men.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>R.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>M.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>S. Titanic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Haver</em>, 171 F.\xc2\xa03d 943, 960 (CA4 1999) (Niemeyer, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).  At the other extreme is <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971), which created a private damages cause of action against federal officials for violation of the Fourth Amendment.  We have said that the authority to create this cause of action was derived from \xe2\x80\x9cour general jurisdiction to decide all cases \xe2\x80\x98arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Correctional Services Corp.</em> v. <em>Malesko,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/61/index.html">534 U. S. 61</a>, 66 (2001) (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331).  While <em>Bivens</em> stands, the ground supporting it has eroded.  For the past 25 years, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have consistently refused to extend <em>Bivens</em> liability to any new context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Correctional Services Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 68.  <em>Bivens</em> is \xe2\x80\x9ca relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  534 U. S., at 75 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these general principles in mind, I turn to the question presented.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s detailed exegesis of the ATS conclusively establishes that it is \xe2\x80\x9ca jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 30.  The Court provides a persuasive explanation of why respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ATS was intended not simply as a jurisdictional grant, but as authority for the creation of a new cause of action for torts in violation of international law,\xe2\x80\x9d is wrong.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Indeed, the Court properly endorses the views of one scholar that this interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98simply frivolous.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting Casto, The Federal Courts\xe2\x80\x99 Protective Jurisdiction Over Torts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Conn. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 467, 479, 480 (1986)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These conclusions are alone enough to dispose of the present case in favor of petitioner Sosa.  None of the exceptions to the general rule against finding substantive lawmaking power in a jurisdictional grant apply.  <em>Bivens</em> provides perhaps the closest analogy.  That is shaky authority at best, but at least it can be said that <em>Bivens</em> sought to enforce a command of our <em>own</em> law\xe2\x80\x94the <em>United States</em> Constitution.  In modern international human rights litigation of the sort that has proliferated since <em>Filartiga </em>v. <em>Pena-Irala</em>, 630 F. 2d 876 (CA2 1980), a federal court must first <em>create </em>the underlying federal command.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that a rule has been recognized as [customary international law], by itself, is not an adequate basis for viewing that rule as part of federal common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Meltzer, Customary International Law, Foreign Affairs, and Federal Common Law, 42 Va. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 513, 519 (2002).  In Benthamite terms, creating a federal command (federal common law) out of \xe2\x80\x9cinternational norms,\xe2\x80\x9d and then constructing a cause of action to enforce that command through the purely jurisdictional grant of the ATS, is nonsense upon stilts.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The analysis in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion departs from my own in this respect: After concluding in Part III that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 30, the Court addresses at length in Part IV the \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons for a restrained conception of the <em>discretion</em> a federal court should exercise in considering a new cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d under the ATS.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  By framing the issue as one of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court skips over the antecedent question of authority.  This neglects the \xe2\x80\x9clesson of <em>Erie</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cgrants of jurisdiction alone\xe2\x80\x9d (which the Court has acknowledged the ATS to be) \xe2\x80\x9care not themselves grants of law-making authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Meltzer, <em>supra</em>, at 541.  On this point, the Court observes only that no development between the enactment of the ATS (in 1789) and the birth of modern international human rights litigation under that statute (in 1980) \xe2\x80\x9chas categorically <em>precluded</em> federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element of common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 30 (emphasis added).  This turns our jurisprudence regarding federal common law on its head.  The question is not what case or congressional action <em>prevents</em> federal courts from applying the law of nations as part of the general common law; it is what <em>authorizes</em> that peculiar exception from <em>Erie</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental holding that a general common law <em>does not exist</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court would apparently find authorization in the understanding of the Congress that enacted the ATS, that \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict courts would recognize private causes of action for certain torts in violation of the law of nations.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante, </em>at 30.  But as discussed above, that understanding rested upon a notion of general common law that has been repudiated by <em>Erie</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court recognizes that <em>Erie</em> was a \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d decision heralding an avulsive change, wrought by \xe2\x80\x9cconceptual development in understanding common law \xe2\x80\xa6 [and accompanied by an] equally significant rethinking of the role of the federal courts in making it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, does not follow through on this insight, interchangeably using the unadorned phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccommon law\xe2\x80\x9d in Parts III and IV to refer to pre-<em>Erie</em> general common law and post-<em>Erie</em> federal common law.  This lapse is crucial, because the creation of post-<em>Erie</em> federal common law is rooted in a positivist mindset utterly foreign to the American common-law tradition of the late 18th century.  Post-<em>Erie</em> federal common lawmaking (all that is left to the federal courts) is so far removed from that general-common-law adjudication which applied the \xe2\x80\x9claw of nations\xe2\x80\x9d that it would be anachronistic to find authorization to do the former in a statutory grant of jurisdiction that was thought to enable the latter.*<footcall num="*">  Yet that is precisely what the discretion-only analysis in Part IV suggests.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because today\xe2\x80\x99s federal common law is not our Framers\xe2\x80\x99 general common law, the question presented by the suggestion of discretionary authority to enforce the law of nations is not whether to extend old-school general-common-law adjudication.  Rather, it is whether to create new federal common law.  The Court masks the novelty of its approach when it suggests that the difference between us is that we would \xe2\x80\x9cclose the door to further independent judicial recognition of actionable international norms,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the Court would permit the exercise of judicial power \xe2\x80\x9con the understanding that the door is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 35.  The general common law was the old door.  We do not close that door today, for the deed was done in <em>Erie</em>.  <em>Supra</em>, at 3.  Federal common law is a <em>new</em> door.  The question is not whether that door will be left ajar, but whether this Court will open it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I fundamentally disagree with the discretion-based framework employed by the Court, we seem to be in accord that creating a new federal common law of international human rights is a questionable enterprise.  We agree that:</p>\n<p align="left"><left><f f="Symbol">\n</f></left></p></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961653">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF BREYER, J.<br/>\nSOSA V.

The Court says that to qualify for recognition under the ATS a norm of international law must have a content as definite as, and an acceptance as widespread as, those that characterized 18th-century international norms prohibiting piracy.  <em>Ante,</em> at 38.  The norm must extend liability to the type of perpetrator (<em>e.g.,</em> a private actor) the plaintiff seeks to sue.  <em>Ante</em>, at 38, n. 20.  And Congress can make clear that courts should not recognize any such norm, through a direct or indirect command or by occupying the field. <em> </em>See<em> ante</em>, at 37.  The Court also suggests that principles of exhaustion might apply, and that courts should give \xe2\x80\x9cserious weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s view of the impact on foreign policy that permitting an ATS suit will likely have in a given case or type of case.  <em>Ante</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339, n. 21.  I believe all of these conditions are important.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would add one further consideration.  Since enforcement of an international norm by one nation\xe2\x80\x99s courts implies that other nations\xe2\x80\x99 courts may do the same, I would ask whether the exercise of jurisdiction under the ATS is consistent with those notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the sovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of its laws and their enforcement.  In applying those principles, courts help assure that \xe2\x80\x9cthe potentially conflicting laws of different nations\xe2\x80\x9d will \xe2\x80\x9cwork together in harmony,\xe2\x80\x9d a matter of increasing importance in an ever more interdependent world.  <em>F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. </em>v.<em> Empagran S.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at _ (slip. op., at 8); cf. <em>Murray </em>v.<em> Schooner Charming Betsy</em>, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804).  Such consideration is necessary to ensure that ATS litigation does not undermine the very harmony that it was intended to promote.  See <em>ante</em>, 20\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These comity concerns normally do not arise (or at least are mitigated) if the conduct in question takes place in the country that provides the cause of action or if that conduct involves that country\xe2\x80\x99s own national\xe2\x80\x94where, say, an American assaults a foreign diplomat and the diplomat brings suit in an American court.  See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7402(1), (2) (1986) (hereinafter Restatement) (describing traditional bases of territorial and nationality jurisdiction).  They do arise, however, when foreign persons injured abroad bring suit in the United States under the ATS, asking the courts to recognize a claim that a certain kind of foreign conduct violates an international norm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since different courts in different nations will not necessarily apply even similar substantive laws similarly, workable harmony, in practice, depends upon more than substantive uniformity among the laws of those nations.  That is to say, substantive uniformity does not <em>automatically</em> mean that universal jurisdiction is appropriate.  Thus, in the 18th century, nations reached consensus not only on the substantive principle that acts of piracy were universally wrong but also on the jurisdictional principle that any nation that found a pirate could prosecute him.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>United States </em>v.<em> Smith</em>, 5 Wheat. 153, 162 (1820) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe general practice of all nations in punishing all persons, whether natives or foreigners, who have committed [piracy] against any persons whatsoever, with whom they are in amity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today international law will sometimes similarly reflect not only substantive agreement as to certain universally condemned behavior but also procedural agreement that universal jurisdiction exists to prosecute a subset of that behavior.  See Restatement \xc2\xa7404, and Comment <em>a;</em> International Law Association, Final Report on the Exercise of Universal Jurisdiction in Respect of Gross Human Rights Offences 2 (2000).  That subset includes torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  See <em>id</em>., at 5\xe2\x80\x938; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Prosecutor </em>v.<em> Furundzija</em>, Case No. IT\xe2\x80\x9395\xe2\x80\x9317/1\xe2\x80\x93T, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;155\xe2\x80\x93156 (International Tribunal for Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in Territory of Former Yugoslavia since 1991, Dec. 10, 1998); <em>Attorney Gen. of Israel </em>v.<em> Eichmann</em>, 36 I. L.\xc2\xa0R. 277 (Sup. Ct. Israel 1962).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that this procedural consensus exists suggests that recognition of universal jurisdiction in respect to a limited set of norms is consistent with principles of international comity.  That is, allowing every nation\xe2\x80\x99s courts to adjudicate foreign conduct involving foreign parties in such cases will not significantly threaten the practical harmony that comity principles seek to protect.  That consensus concerns criminal jurisdiction, but consensus as to universal criminal jurisdiction itself suggests that universal tort jurisdiction would be no more threatening.  Cf. Restatement \xc2\xa7404, Comment <em>b</em>.  That is because the criminal courts of many nations combine civil and criminal proceedings, allowing those injured by criminal conduct to be represented, and to recover damages, in the criminal proceeding itself.  Brief for European Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21, n. 48 (citing 3 Y. Donzallaz, La Convention de Lugano du 16 septembre 1998 concernant la competence judiciaire et l\xe2\x80\x99execution des decisions en matiere civile et commerciale, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;5203\xe2\x80\x935272 (1998); EC Council Regulation Art. 5, \xc2\xa74, 44/2001, 2001 O. J. (L 12/1) (Jan. 16, 2001)).  Thus, universal criminal jurisdiction necessarily contemplates a significant degree of civil tort recovery as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking these matters into account, as I believe courts should, I can find no similar procedural consensus supporting the exercise of jurisdiction in this case.  That lack of consensus provides additional support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the ATS does not recognize the claim at issue here\xe2\x80\x94where the underlying substantive claim concerns arbitrary arrest, outside the United States, of a citizen of one foreign country by another.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961652">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF GINSBURG, J.<br/>\nSOSA V.

As to Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act) claim, see <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x9317, although I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result and much of its reasoning, I take a different path and would adopt a different construction of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(k).  Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s case against the Government does not call for any comparison of old versus newer choice-of-law methodologies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  See generally Kay, Theory into Practice: Choice of Law in the Courts, 34 Mercer L. Rev. 521, 525\xe2\x80\x93584 (1983).  In particular, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of developments in choice of law after the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment hardly illuminates the meaning of that statute, and risks giving undue prominence to a jurisdiction-selecting approach the vast majority of States have long abandoned.  See Symeonides, Choice of Law in the American Courts in 2002: Sixteenth Annual Survey, 51 Am. J. Comp. L. 1, 5\xe2\x80\x936 (2003) (<em>lex loci delicti</em> rule has been abandoned in 42 States).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FTCA renders the United States liable for tort claims \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72674.  The Act gives federal district courts \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages \xe2\x80\xa6 for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  Congress included in the FTCA a series of exceptions to that sovereign-immunity waiver.  Relevant to this case, the Act expressly excepts \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(k).  I agree with the Court, see <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x9317, that this provision, the foreign-country exception, applies here, and bars Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s tort claim against the United States.  But I would read the words \xe2\x80\x9carising in,\xe2\x80\x9d as they appear in \xc2\xa72680(k), to signal \xe2\x80\x9cplace where the act or omission occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71346(b)(1), not \xe2\x80\x9cplace of injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12, 16\xe2\x80\x9317, and n.\xc2\xa09.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its face, the foreign-country exception appears to cover this case.

Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in Mexico, implicating questions of Mexican law, is, as the Court notes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe kernel\xe2\x80\x9d of Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  Once Alvarez was inside United States borders, the Ninth Circuit observed, no activity regarding his detention was tortious.  See 331 F.\xc2\xa03d 604, 636\xe2\x80\x93637 (2003).

Just as Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s arrest was \xe2\x80\x9cfalse,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus tortious, only because, and only to the extent that,<em> </em>it took place and endured in Mexico, so damages accrued only while the alleged wrongful conduct continued abroad.  <em>Id.</em>, at 636\xe2\x80\x93637.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Critical in the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cDEA agents had no authority under federal law to execute an extraterritorial arrest of a suspect indicted in federal court in Los Angeles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 640; see <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa01.

While the Court of Appeals focused on whether United States law furnished authority to seize Alvarez in Mexican territory, see 331 F. 3d, at 626\xe2\x80\x93631, Mexican law equally could have provided\xe2\x80\x94or denied\xe2\x80\x94authority for such an arrest.  Had Sosa and the arrest team been Mexican law enforcement officers, authorized by Mexican law to arrest Alvarez and to hand him over to United States authorities, for example, no false-arrest claim would have been tenable.  Similarly, there would have been no viable false-arrest claim if Mexican law authorized a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s arrest in the circumstances presented here.  Indeed, Mexican and Honduran agents seized other suspects indicted along with Alvarez, respectively in Mexico and Honduras; \xe2\x80\x9cAlvarez\xe2\x80\x99s abduction was unique in that it involved neither the cooperation of local police nor the consent of a foreign government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 623, n.\xc2\xa023.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interpretation of the FTCA adopted by the Ninth Circuit, in short, yielded liability based on acts occurring in Mexico that entangled questions of foreign law.

The legislative history of the FTCA suggests that Congress viewed cases in which the relevant <em>act or omission</em> occurred in a foreign country as entailing too great a risk of foreign-law application.  Thus, Assistant Attorney General Francis M. Shea, in explaining the finally enacted version of the foreign-country exception to the House Committee on the Judiciary, emphasized that, when an <em>act or omission</em> occurred in a foreign country, \xc2\xa71346(b) would direct a court toward the law of that country: \xe2\x80\x9cSince liability is to be determined by <em>the law of the situs of the wrongful act or omission</em> <em>it is wise to restrict the bill to claims arising in this country</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearings on H.\xc2\xa0R. 5373 et\xc2\xa0al. before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1942) (emphasis added); see <em>ante</em>, at 12.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In the enacting Congress\xe2\x80\x99 view, it thus appears, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346(b) and 2680(k) were aligned so as to block the United States\xe2\x80\x99 waiver of sovereign immunity when the relevant act or omission took place overseas.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, the Court has read <em>renvoi</em> into \xc2\xa71346(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the law of.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Richards</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/1/index.html">369 U.

It is one thing to apply <em>renvoi</em> to determine which State, within the United States, supplies the governing law, quite another to suppose that Congress meant United States courts to explore what choice of law a foreign court would make.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1948, when the FTCA was enacted, it is also true, Congress reasonably might have anticipated that the then prevailing choice-of-law methodology, reflected in the Restatement (First) of Conflicts, would lead mechanically to the law of the place of injury.  See Restatement (First) of Conflicts \xc2\xa7377 (1934) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe place of wrong is in the state where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Richards</em>, 369 U.

In cases involving acts or omissions in several states, the question is which acts count.  \xe2\x80\x9cNeither the text of the FTCA nor <em>Richards</em> provides any guidance \xe2\x80\xa6 when the alleged acts or omissions occur in more than one state.  Moreover, the legislative history of the FTCA sheds no light on this problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gould Electronics Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 220 F.\xc2\xa03d 169, 181 (CA3 2000); see <em>Raflo</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 157 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1, 9 (DC 2001) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts of appeals have adopted varying approaches to this question.

Eschewing \xe2\x80\x9cvague and overlapping\xe2\x80\x9d approaches that yielded \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminate\xe2\x80\x9d results, Judge Becker \xe2\x80\x9cappl[ied] [under \xc2\xa71346(b)(1)] the choice-of-law regime of the jurisdiction in which the last significant act or omission occurred.  This has the salutary effect of avoiding the selection of a jurisdiction based on a completely incidental \xe2\x80\x98last contact,\xe2\x80\x99 while also avoiding the conjecture that [alternative] inquires often entail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  I agree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A \xe2\x80\x9clast significant act or omission\xe2\x80\x9d rule applied under \xc2\xa72680(k) would close the door to the headquarters doctrine as applied by the Ninth Circuit in this case.  By directing attention to the place where the last significant act or omission occurred, rather than to a United States location where some authorization, support, or planning may have taken place, the clear rule advanced by Judge Becker preserves \xc2\xa72680(k) as the genuine limitation Congress intended it to be.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9clast significant act or omission\xe2\x80\x9d rule works in this case to identify Mexico, not California, as the place where the instant case arose.  I would apply that rule here to hold that Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s tort claim for false arrest under the FTCA is barred under the foreign-country exception.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and concur in Parts I, III, and IV of its opinion.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In common with \xc2\xa72680(k), most of the exceptions listed in \xc2\xa72680 use the \xe2\x80\x9cclaim arising\xe2\x80\x9d formulation.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72680(b), (c), (e), (h), (j), <em>(l),</em> (m), and (n).  Only two use the \xe2\x80\x9cact or omission\xe2\x80\x9d terminology.  See \xc2\xa72680(a) (exception for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation \xe2\x80\xa6 or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72680(e) (no liability for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering [certain provisions concerning war and national defense]\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is hardly apparent, however, that Congress intended only \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72680(a) and (e) to be interpreted in accord with \xc2\xa71346(b).  Congress used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising out of\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa72680 exceptions that focus on a governmental act or omission.  See \xc2\xa72680(b) (exception for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72680(h) (no liability for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contractual rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that usage, and in light of the legislative history of \xc2\xa72680(k), omission of a reference to an \xe2\x80\x9cact or omission of any employee\xe2\x80\x9d from that provision may reflect only Congress\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to use the least complex statutory language feasible.
