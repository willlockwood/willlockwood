XXII, \xc2\xa714.</p><p>In 2000, Arizona voters adopted Proposition 106, an initiative aimed at the problem of gerrymandering.  Proposition 106 amended Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, removing redistricting authority from the Arizona Legislature and vesting it in an independent commission, the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC).  After the 2010 census, as after the 2000 census, the AIRC adopted redistricting maps for congressional as well as state legislative districts.  The Arizona Legislature challenged the map the Commission adopted in 2012 for congressional districts, arguing that the AIRC and its map violated the \xe2\x80\x9cElections Clause\xe2\x80\x9d of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Constitution, which provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d means the State\xe2\x80\x99s representative assembly, the Arizona Legislature contended, the Clause precludes resort to an independent commission, created by initiative, to accomplish redistricting.  A three-judge District Court held that the Arizona Legislature had standing to sue, but rejected its complaint on the merits.</p><p><i>Held</i>:</p><p>1.\xc2\xa0The Arizona Legislature has standing to bring this suit.  In claiming that Proposition 106 stripped it of its alleged constitutional prerogative to engage in redistricting and that its injury would be remedied by a court order enjoining the proposition\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement, the Legislature has shown injury that is \xe2\x80\x98concrete and particularized\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98actual or imminent,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona, </i>520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43, \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable to the challenged action,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9credressable by a favorable ruling,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Clapper</i> v. <i>Amnesty Int\xe2\x80\x99l USA</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.

While exercise of the initiative was not at issue in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions, there is no constitutional barrier to a State\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment of its people by embracing that form of lawmaking.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p><p>(b)\xc2\xa0Title2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72a(c)\xe2\x80\x94which provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment,\xe2\x80\x9d it must follow federally prescribed redistricting procedures\xe2\x80\x94permits redistricting in accord with Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s initiative.  From 1862 through 1901, apportionment Acts required a State to follow federal procedures unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe [state] legislature\xe2\x80\x9d drew district lines.  In 1911, Congress, recognizing that States had supplemented the representative legislature mode of lawmaking with a direct lawmaking role for the people, replaced the reference to redistricting by the state \xe2\x80\x9clegislature\xe2\x80\x9d with a reference to redistricting of a State \xe2\x80\x9cin the manner provided by the laws thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74,37Stat.14.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history \xe2\x80\x9cleaves no .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hildebrant</i>, 241 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568, that the change was made to safeguard to \xe2\x80\x9ceach state full authority to employ in the creation of congressional districts its own laws and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  47 Cong. Rec. 3437.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf they include the initiative, it is included.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 3508.  Congress used virtually identical language in enacting \xc2\xa72a(c) in 1941.  This provision also accords full respect to the redistricting procedures adopted by the States.  Thus, so long as a State has \xe2\x80\x9credistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as Arizona did by utilizing the independent commission procedure in its Constitution\xe2\x80\x94the resulting redistricting plan becomes the presumptively governing map.</p><p>Though four of \xc2\xa72a(c)\xe2\x80\x99s five default redistricting procedures\xe2\x80\x94operative only when a State is not \xe2\x80\x9credistricted in the manner provided by [state] law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94have become obsolete as a result of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions embracing the one-person, one-vote principle, this infirmity does not bear on the question whether a State has been \xe2\x80\x9credistricted in the manner provided by [state] law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9323.</p><p>(c) \xc2\xa0The Elections Clause permits the people of Arizona to provide for redistricting by independent commission.  The history and purpose of the Clause weigh heavily against precluding the people of Arizona from creating a commission operating independently of the state legislature to establish congressional districts.  Such preclusion would also run up against the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s animating principle that the people themselves are the originating source of all the powers of government.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9335.</p><p>(1)\xc2\xa0The dominant purpose of the Elections Clause, the historical record bears out, was to empower Congress to override state election rules, not to restrict the way States enact legislation.  See <i>Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., </i>570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Ratification arguments in support of congressional oversight focused on potential abuses by state politicians, but the legislative processes by which the States could exercise their initiating role in regulating congressional elections occasioned no debate.  Pp. 25\xe2\x80\x9327.</p><p>(2)\xc2\xa0There is no suggestion that the Election Clause, by specifying \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d required assignment of congressional redistricting authority to the State\xe2\x80\x99s representative body.  It is characteristic of the federal system that States retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes free from incursion by the Federal Government.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Alden</i> v. <i>Maine</i>,527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 706.  \xe2\x80\x9cThrough the structure of its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority, a State defines itself as a sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452.  Arizona engaged in definition of that kind when its people placed both the initiative power and the AIRC\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting authority in the portion of the Arizona Constitution delineating the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative authority, Ariz. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0IV.  The Elections Clause should not be read to single out federal elections as the one area in which States may not use citizen initiatives as an alternative legislative process.  And reading the Clause to permit the use of the initiative to control state and local elections but not federal elections would \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive several States of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government\xe2\x80\x9d held at the same times and places, and in the same manner.  The Federalist No. 61, p. 374 (Hamilton).  Pp.\xc2\xa027\xe2\x80\x9330.</p><p>(3)\xc2\xa0The Framers may not have imagined the modern initiative process in which the people\xe2\x80\x99s legislative power is coextensive with the state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s authority, but the invention of the initiative was in full harmony with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s conception of the people as the font of governmental power.  It would thus be perverse to interpret \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause to exclude lawmaking by the people, particularly when such lawmaking is intended to advance the prospect that Members of Congress will in fact be \xe2\x80\x9cchosen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by the People of the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72.  Pp. 30\xe2\x80\x9333.</p><p>(4)\xc2\xa0Banning lawmaking by initiative to direct a State\xe2\x80\x99s method of apportioning congressional districts would not just stymie attempts to curb gerrymandering.  It would also cast doubt on numerous other time, place, and manner regulations governing federal elections that States have adopted by the initiative method.  As well, it could endanger election provisions in state constitutions adopted by conventions and ratified by voters at the ballot box, without involvement or approval by \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9335.</p><p>997 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1047, affirmed.</p><p>Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

Proposition 106 amended Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution to remove redistricting authority from the Ari-zona Legislature and vest that authority in an independent commission, the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC or Commission).  After the 2010 census,as after the 2000 census, the AIRC adopted redistrict-ing maps for congressional as well as state legislative districts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Arizona Legislature challenged the map the Commission adopted in January 2012 for congressional districts.  Recognizing that the voters could control redistricting for state legislators, Brief for Appellant 42, 47; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\xe2\x80\x934, the Arizona Legislature sued the AIRC in federal court seeking a declaration that the Commission and its map for congressional districts violated the \xe2\x80\x9cElections Clause\xe2\x80\x9d of the U.\xc2\xa0S.

That Clause, critical to the resolution of this case, provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Arizona Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s complaint alleged that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98Legislature\xe2\x80\x99 in the Elections Clause means [specifically and only] the representative body which makes the laws of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 21, \xc2\xb637; so read, the Legislature urges, the Clause precludes resort to an independent commission, created by initiative, to accomplish redistricting.

Ariz. Const., Art. IV, pt. 2, \xc2\xa71, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63\xe2\x80\x9323.  The AIRC convenes after each census, establishes final district boundaries, and certifies the new districts to the Arizona Secretary of State.  \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb616\xe2\x80\x9317.  The legislature may submit nonbinding recommendations to the AIRC, \xc2\xb616, and is required to make necessary appropriations for its operation, \xc2\xb618.

Less than four months later, on June 6, 2012, the Arizona Legislature filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, naming as defendants the AIRC, its five members, and the Arizona Secretary of State.  The Legislature sought both a declaration that Proposition 106 and congressional maps adopted by the AIRC are unconstitutional, and, as affirmative relief, an injunction against use of AIRC maps for any congressional election after the 2012 general election.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(a), unanimously denied a motion by the AIRC to dismiss the suit for lack of standing.

Brief for Appellant 51, 53.  To exercise that responsibility, the Legislature urges, it must have at least the opportun-ity to engage (or decline to engage) in redistricting before the State may involve other actors in the redistricting process.  See <i>id.</i>, at 51\xe2\x80\x9353.  Proposition 106, which gives the AIRC binding authority over redistricting, regardless of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s action or inaction, strips the Legislature of its alleged prerogative to initiate redistricting.  That asserted deprivation would be remedied by a court order enjoining the enforcement of Proposition 106.  Al-though we conclude that the Arizona Legislature does not have the exclusive, constitutionally guarded role it asserts, see <i>infra</i>,<i> </i>at 24\xe2\x80\x9335, one must not \xe2\x80\x9cconfus[e] weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Davis</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa010 (2011) (slip op., at 19, n.\xc2\xa010); see <i>Warth</i> v. <i>Seldin</i>,\n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490,\n500 (1975)\n (standing \xe2\x80\x9coften turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted,\xe2\x80\x9d but it \xe2\x80\x9cin no way depends on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d of the claim).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The AIRC argues that the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s alleged injury is insufficiently concrete to meet the standing requirement absent some \xe2\x80\x9cspecific legislative act that would have taken effect but for Proposition 106.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 20.  The United States, as <i>amicus curiae</i>, urges that even more is needed: the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s injury will remain speculative, the United States contends, unless and until the Arizona Secretary of State refuses to implement a competing redistricting plan passed by the Legislature.  Brief for United States 14\xe2\x80\x9317.  In our view, the Arizona Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s suit is not premature, nor is its alleged injury too \xe2\x80\x9cconjectural\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d to establish standing.  <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two prescriptions of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution would render the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s passage of a competing plan and submission of that plan to the Secretary of State unavailing.  Indeed, those actions would directly and immediately conflict with the regime Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution establishes.  Cf. <i>Sporhase</i> v. <i>Nebraska ex rel. Douglas</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S.941, 944, n.\xc2\xa02 (1982) (failure to apply for permit which \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been granted\xe2\x80\x9d under existing law did not deprive plaintiffs of standing to challenge permitting regime).  First, the Arizona Constitution instructs that the Legislature \xe2\x80\x9cshall not have the power to adopt any measure that supersedes [an initiative], in whole or in part, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unless the superseding measure furthers the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of the initiative.  Art.\xc2\xa0IV, pt. 1, \xc2\xa71(14).  Any redistricting map passed by the Legislature in an effort to supersede the AIRC\xe2\x80\x99s map surely would not \xe2\x80\x9cfurthe[r] the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of Proposition 106.  Second, once the AIRC certifies its redistricting plan to the Secretary of State, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution requires<i> </i>the Secretary to implement that plan and no other.  See Art. IV, pt. 2, \xc2\xa71(17); <i>Arizona Minority Coalition for Fair Redistricting</i> v. <i>Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 211 Ariz. 337, 351, 121 P.\xc2\xa03d 843, 857 (App. 2005) (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9cOnce the Commission certifies [its] maps, the secretary of state must use them in conducting the next election.\xe2\x80\x9d).  To establish standing, the Legislature need not violate the Arizona Constitution and show that the Secretary of State would similarly disregard the State\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental instrument of government.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Raines</i> v. <i>Byrd</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 811 (1997)\n, does not aid AIRC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that there is no standing here.  In <i>Raines</i>, this Court held that six <i>individual Members</i> of Congress lacked standing to challenge the Line Item Veto Act.  <i>Id.,</i> at 813\xe2\x80\x93814, 829\xe2\x80\x93830 (holding specifically and only that \xe2\x80\x9cindividual members of Congress [lack] Article III standing\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Act, which gave the President author-ity to cancel certain spending and tax benefit measures after signing them into law, allegedly diluted the efficacy of the Congressmembers\xe2\x80\x99 votes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 815\xe2\x80\x93817.  The \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional injury\xe2\x80\x9d at issue, we reasoned, scarcely zeroed in on any individual Member.  <i>Id.,</i> at 821.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]idely dispersed,\xe2\x80\x9d the alleged injury \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily [impacted] all Members of Congress and both Houses .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. equally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 829, 821.

Three decisions compose the relevant case law: <i>Ohio ex rel. Davis</i> v. <i>Hildebrant</i>,\n\n241 U.\xc2\xa0S. 565 (1916)\n; <i>Hawke</i> v. <i>Smith (No. 1)</i>,\n\n253 U.\xc2\xa0S. 221 (1920)\n; and <i>Smiley</i> v. <i>Holm</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 355 (1932)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Davis</i> v. <i>Hildebrant</i> involved an amendment to the Constitution of Ohio vesting in the people the right, exercisable by referendum, to approve or disapprove by popular vote any law enacted by the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislature.  A 1915 Act redistricting the State for the purpose of congressional elections had been submitted to a popular vote, resulting in disapproval of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s measure.  State election officials asked the State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court to declare the referendum void.  That court rejected the request, holding that the referendum authorized by Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a part of the legislative power of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in [federal statutory law] or in [the Elections Clause] operated to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  241 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 567.  This Court affirmed the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  In upholding the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, we recognized that the referendum was \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the legislative power\xe2\x80\x9d in Ohio, <i>ibid.</i>, legitimately exercised by the people to disapprove the legislation creating congressional districts.  For redistricting purposes, <i>Hildebrant</i> thus established, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Leg-islature\xe2\x80\x9d did not mean the representative body alone.  Rather, the word encompassed a veto power lodged in the people.  See <i>id.</i>, at 569 (Elections Clause does not bar \xe2\x80\x9ctreating the referendum as part of the legislative power for the purpose of apportionment, where so ordained by the state constitutions and laws\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Hawke</i> v. <i>Smith</i> involved the\n \nEighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature had ratified the Amendment, and a referendum on that ratification was at issue.  Reversing the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding the referendum, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cratification by a State of a constitutional amendment is not an act of legislation within the proper sense of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d  253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 229.  Instead, Article V governing ratification had lodged in \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislatures of three-fourths of the several States\xe2\x80\x9d sole authority to assent to a proposed amendment.  <i>Id.,</i> at 226.  The Court contrasted the ratifying function, exercisable exclusively by a State\xe2\x80\x99s legislature, with \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary business of legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 229.  <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Hildebrant</i>, the Court explained, involved the enactment of legislation, <i>i.e.</i>, a redistricting plan, and properly held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe referendum [was] part of the legislative author-ity of the State for [that] purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 230.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Smiley</i> v. <i>Holm</i> raised the question whether legislation purporting to redistrict Minnesota for congressional elections was subject to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto.  The Minnesota Supreme Court had held that the Elections Clause placed redistricting authority exclusively in the hands of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislature, leaving no role for the Governor.  We reversed that determination and held, for the purpose at hand, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s legislative authority includes not just the two houses of the legislature; it includes, in addition, a make-or-break role for the Governor.  In holding that the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto counted, we distinguished instances in which the Constitution calls upon state legislatures to exercise a function other than lawmaking.  State legislatures, we pointed out, performed an \xe2\x80\x9celectoral\xe2\x80\x9d function \xe2\x80\x9cin the choice of United States Senators under Article I, section 3, prior to the adoption of the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>] a \xe2\x80\x9cratifying\xe2\x80\x9d function for \xe2\x80\x9cproposed amendments to the Constitution under Article V,\xe2\x80\x9d as explained in <i>Hawke</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, and a \xe2\x80\x9cconsenting\xe2\x80\x9d function \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to the acquisition of lands by the United States under Article I, section 8, paragraph 17.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 365\xe2\x80\x93366.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In contrast to those other functions, we observed, redistricting \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves lawmaking in its essential features and most important aspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 366.  Lawmaking, we further noted, ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cmust be in accordance with the method which the State has prescribed for legislative enactments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 367.  In Minnesota, the State\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution had made the Governor \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the legislative process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 369.  And the Elections Clause, we explained, respected the State\xe2\x80\x99s choice to include the Governor in that process, although the Governor could play no part when the Constitution assigned to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d a ratifying, electoral, or consenting function.  Nothing in the Elections Clause, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cattempt[ed] to endow the legislature of the State with power to enact laws in any manner other than that in which the constitution of the State ha[d] provided that laws shall be enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 368.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Chief Justice, in dissent, features, indeed trumpets repeatedly, the pre-\n \nSeventeenth Amendment regime in which Senators were \xe2\x80\x9cchosen [in each State] by the Legislature thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa73; see <i>post</i>, at 1, 8\xe2\x80\x939, 19.

Any uncertainty about the import of \xc2\xa72a(c), however, is resolved by our holding that the Elections Clause permits regulation of congressional elections by initiative, see <i>infra</i>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9335, leaving no arguable conflict between \xc2\xa72a(c) and the first part of the Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In accord with the District Court, see <i>supra,</i> at 9, we hold that the Elections Clause permits the people of Arizona to provide for redistricting by independent commission.  To restate the key question in this case, the issue centrally debated by the parties: Absent congressional authorization, does the Elections Clause preclude the people of Arizona from creating a commission operating independently of the state legislature to establish congressional districts?

As Madison put it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe genius of republican liberty seems to demand .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not only that all power should be derived from the people, but that those intrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., No. 37, at 223.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The people\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sovereignty had been expressed by John Locke in 1690, a near century before the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s formation:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Legislative being only a Fiduciary Power to act for certain ends, there remains still in the People a Supream Power to remove or alter the Legislative, when they find the Legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them.

It would also cast doubt on numerous other election laws adopted by the initiative method of legislating.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The people, in several States, functioning as the lawmaking body for the purpose at hand, have used the initiative to install a host of regulations governing the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes, Places and Manner\xe2\x80\x9d of holding federal elections.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74.  For example, the people of California provided for permanent voter registration, specifying that \xe2\x80\x9cno amendment by the Legislature shall provide for a general biennial or other periodic reregistration of voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Elec. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72123 (West 2003).  The people of Ohio banned ballots providing for straight-ticket voting along party lines.  Ohio Const., Art.\xc2\xa0V, \xc2\xa72a.

The very prospect of lawmaking by the people may influence the legislature when it considers (or fails to consider) election-related measures.

Both parts of the Elections Clause are in line with the fundamental premise that all political power flows from the people.  <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 404\xe2\x80\x93405 (1819).  So comprehended, the Clause doubly empowers the people.

The \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversies\xe2\x80\x9d that those courts entertained did not include suits between units of government regarding their legitimate powers.  The job of the courts was, in Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9csolely, to decide on the rights of individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Marbury </i>v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803).  Tocqueville considered this one reason the new democracy could safely confer upon courts the immense power to hold legislation unconstitutional:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c[B]y leaving it to private interest to censure the law, and by intimately uniting the trial of the law with the trial of an individual, legislation is protected from wanton assaults and from the daily aggressions of party spirit.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9cI am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at once most favorable to liberty and to public order.  If the judge could only attack the legislator only openly and directly, he would sometimes be afraid to oppose him; and at other times party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. But the American judge is brought into the political arena independently of his own will.  He judges the law only because he is obliged to judge a case.  The political question that he is called upon to resolve is connected with the interests of the parties, and he cannot refuse to decide it without a denial of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 102-03 (P. Bradley ed. 1948).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That doctrine of standing, that jurisdictional limitation upon our powers, does not have as its purpose (as the majority assumes) merely to assure that we will decide disputes in concrete factual contexts that enable \xe2\x80\x9crealistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> ante, </i>at 14.  To the contrary.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic idea\xe2\x80\x94the idea of separation of powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Allen </i>v. <i>Wright</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737,\n752 (1984)\n.  It keeps us minding our own business.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We consult history and judicial tradition to determine whether a given \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98disput[e is] appropriately resolved through the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lujan </i>v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555,\n560 (1992)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  What history and judicial tradition show is that courts do not resolve direct disputes between two political branches of the same government regarding their respective powers.  Nearly every separation-of-powers case presents questions like the ones in this case.  But we have <i>never</i> passed on a separation-of-powers question raised directly by a governmental subunit\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  We have <i>always </i>resolved those questions in the context of a private lawsuit in which the claim or defense depends on the constitutional validity of action by one of the governmental subunits that has caused a private party concrete harm.  That is why, for example, it took this Court over 50 years to rule upon the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act, passed in 1867.  If the law of standing had been otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cpresumably President Wilson, or Presidents Grant and Cleveland before him, would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have had standing, and could have challenged the law preventing the removal of a Presidential appointee without the consent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i> <i>Raines</i> v. <i>Byrd</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 811,\n828 (1997)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not have to look far back in the United States Reports to find other separation-of-powers cases which, if the Arizona Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s theory of standing is correct, took an awfully circuitous route to get here.  In <i>Zivotofsky</i> v. <i>Kerry</i>, <i>ante, </i>p. ___, the President could have sued for an injunction against Congress\xe2\x80\x99s attempted \xe2\x80\x9cdirect usurpation\xe2\x80\x9d of his constitutionally-conferred authority to pronounce on foreign relations.  Or in <i>Wellness Int\xe2\x80\x99l Network, Ltd. </i>v. <i>Sharif</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), a Federal District Judge could have sought a declaratory judgment that a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicating a <i>Stern</i> claim improperly usurped his constitutionally conferred authority to decide cases and controversies.  Or in <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>Noel Canning</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), the Senate could have sued the President, claiming a direct usurpation of its prerogative to advise on and consent to Presidential appointments.  Each of these cases involved the allocation of power to one or more branches of a government; and we surely would have dismissed suits arising in the hypothesized fashions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have affirmatively rejected arguments for jurisdiction in cases like this one.  For example, in <i>Raines</i>, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 829\xe2\x80\x93830, we refused to allow Members of Congress to challenge the Line Item Veto Act, which they claimed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unconstitutionally expand[ed] the President\xe2\x80\x99s power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98alter[ed] the constitutional balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 816.  In <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon</i>,\n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447\n\xe2\x80\x93480 (1923), we refused to allow a State to pursue its claim that a conditional congressional appropriation \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute[d] an effective means of inducing the States to yield a portion of their sovereign rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  (And <i>Mellon </i>involved a contention that <i>one</i> government infringed upon <i>another</i> government\xe2\x80\x99s power\xe2\x80\x94far closer to the traditional party-versus-party lawsuit than is an intragovernmental dispute.)  We put it plainly: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the last analysis, the complaint of the plaintiff State is brought to the naked contention that Congress has usurped the reserved powers of the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 483\xe2\x80\x94and because the State could not show a discrete harm except the alleged usurpation of its powers, we refused to allow the State\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The sole precedent the Court relies upon is <i>Coleman</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,\n\n307 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433 (1939)\n.  <i>Coleman</i> can be distinguished from the present case as readily as it was distinguished in <i>Raines</i>.  In <i>Raines</i>, the accurate-in-fact (but inconsequential-in-principle) distinction was that the Senators in <i>Coleman </i>had their votes nullified, whereas the Members of Congress claimed that their votes could merely be rendered ineffective by a Presidential line-item veto.  <i>Raines</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 823\xe2\x80\x93824.  In the present case we could make the accurate-in-fact distinction that in <i>Coleman </i>individual legislators were found to have standing, whereas here it is the governmental body, the Arizona Legisla-ture, that seeks to bring suit.  But the reality is that the supposed holding of <i>Coleman </i>stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of our jurisprudence, which denies standing for intragovernmental disputes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Coleman </i>was a peculiar case that may well stand for nothing.  The opinion discussing and finding standing, and going on to affirm the Kansas Supreme Court, was written by Chief Justice Hughes and announced by Justice Stone.  Justice Frankfurter, joined by three other Justices, held there was no standing, and would have dismissed the petition (leaving the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court in place).  Justice Butler, joined by Justice McRey-nolds, dissented (neither joining Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s opinion nor separately discussing standing) and would have reversed the Kansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That adds up to two votes to affirm on the merits, two to reverse on the merits (without discussing standing) and four to dismiss for lack of standing.  Justice Stanley Reed, who was on the Court and apparently participated in the case, is not mentioned in any of the opinions recorded in the United States Reports.  So, in order to find <i>Coleman </i>a binding precedent on standing, rather than a 4-to-4 standoff, one must assume that Justice Reed voted with Hughes.  There is some reason to make that assumption: The four Justices rejecting standing went on to discuss the merits, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruling of the Court just announced removes from the case the question of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 standing to sue.\xe2\x80\x9d  307 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 456 (Black, J., concurring).  But then again, if nine Justices participated, how could it be that on one of the two issues in the case the Court was \xe2\x80\x9cequally divided and therefore .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. expresse[d] no opinion\xe2\x80\x9d?  <i>Id</i>., at 447.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A pretty shaky foundation for a significant precedential ruling.  Besides that, the two dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 mere assumption of standing\xe2\x80\x94neither saying anything about the subject nor joining Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the point\xe2\x80\x94produces (if you assume Reed joined Hughes) a majority for standing but no majority opinion explaining why.  And even under the most generous assumptions, since the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on the issue it resolved rested on the ground that that issue presented a political question\xe2\x80\x94which is itself a rejection of jurisdiction, <i>Zivotofsky</i> v. <i>Clinton</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5)\xe2\x80\x94<i>Coleman</i>\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the additional jurisdictional issue of standing was quite superfluous and arguably nothing but dictum.  The peculiar decision in <i>Coleman </i>should be charitably ignored.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court asserts, quoting <i>Raines</i>, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 819\xe2\x80\x93820, that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standing analysis has been \xe2\x80\x9cespecially rigorous when reaching the merits of the dispute would force [the Court] to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 14, n.\xc2\xa012.  The cases cited to support this dictum fail to do so; they are merely cases where a determination of unconstitutionality is avoided by applying what there is no reason to believe is anything other than <i>normal</i> standing requirements.  It seems to me utterly implausible that the Framers wanted federal courts limited to traditional judicial cases only when they were pronouncing upon the rights of Congress and the President, and not when they were treading upon the powers of state legislatures and executives.  Quite to the contrary, I think they would be <i>all the more</i> <i>averse </i>to unprecedented judicial meddling by federal courts with the branches of their state governments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Normally, having arrived at that conclusion, I would express no opinion on the merits unless my vote was necessary to enable the Court to produce a judgment.

The Court today performs just such a magic trick with the Elections Clause.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74.  That Clause vests congressional redistricting authority in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of each State.

The Constitution contains seventeen provisions referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d of a State, many of which cannot possibly be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe people.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>.

Nowhere does the majority explain how a constitutional provision that vests redistricting authority in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d permits a State to wholly exclude \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d from redistricting.

No matter how concerned we may be about partisanship in redistricting, this Court has no power to gerrymander the Constitution.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"> The majority begins by discussing policy.  I begin with the Constitution.  The Elections Clause provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Elections Clause both imposes a duty on States and assigns that duty to a particular state actor: In the absence of a valid congressional directive to the contrary, States must draw district lines for their federal representatives.  And that duty \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be carried out \xe2\x80\x9cin each State by the Legislature thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In Arizona, however, redistricting is not carried out by the legislature.  Instead, as the result of a ballot initiative, an unelected body called the Independent Redistricting Commission draws the lines.  See <i>ante</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The key question in the case is whether the Commission can conduct congressional districting consistent with the directive that such authority be exercised \xe2\x80\x9cby the Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority concedes that the unelected Commission is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of Arizona.  The Court contends instead that the people of Arizona as a whole constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Elections Clause, and that they may delegate the congressional districting authority conferred by that Clause to the Commission.  <i>Ante</i>, at 25.  The majority provides no support for the delegation part of its theory, and I am not sure whether the major-ity\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is correct on that issue.  But even giving the Court the benefit of the doubt in that regard, the Commission is still unconstitutional.  Both the Constitution and our cases make clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause is the representative body which makes the laws of the people.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority devotes much of its analysis to establishing that the people of Arizona may exercise lawmaking power under their State Constitution.  See <i>ante</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 25, 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  Nobody doubts that.  This case is governed, however, by the Federal Constitution.  The States do not, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cretain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 27, if those \xe2\x80\x9cprocesses\xe2\x80\x9d violate the United States Constitution.  In a conflict between the Arizona Constitution and the Elections Clause, the State Constitution must give way.  Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl. 2; <i>Cook</i> v. <i>Gralike</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510,\n523 (2001)\n.  The majority opinion therefore largely misses the point.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The relevant question in this case is how to define \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d under the Elections Clause.  The majority opinion does not seriously turn to that question until page 24, and even then it fails to provide a coherent answer.  The Court seems to conclude, based largely on its understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9chistory and purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the Elections Clause,<i> ante</i>, at 24, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses any entity in a State that exercises legislative power.  That circular definition lacks any basis in the text of the Constitution or any other relevant legal source.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s textual analysis consists, in its entirety, of one paragraph citing founding era dictionaries.  The majority points to various dictionaries that follow Samuel Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9clegislature\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cpower that makes laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  The notion that this definition corresponds to the entire population of a State is strained to begin with, and largely discredited by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s own admission that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]irect lawmaking by the people was virtually unknown when the Constitution of 1787 was drafted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>ante</i>, at 27.  Moreover, Dr. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s first example of the usage of \xe2\x80\x9clegislature\xe2\x80\x9d is this: \xe2\x80\x9cWithout the concurrent consent of all three parts of the legislature, no law is or can be made.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 A Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1755) (emphasis deleted).  Johnson borrowed that sentence from Matthew Hale, who defined the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Parts of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of England as the King and the two houses of Parliament.  History of the Common Law of England 2 (1713).  (The contrary notion that the people as a whole make the laws would have cost you your head in England in 1713.)  Thus, even under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred definition, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d referred to an institutional body of representatives, not the people at large.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Any ambiguity about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d is removed by other founding era sources.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]very state constitution from the Founding Era that used the term legislature defined it as a distinct multimember entity comprised of representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morley, The Intratextual Independent \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d and the Elections Clause, 109 Nw. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. Online 131, 147, and n. 101 (2015) (citing eleven State Constitutions).  The Federalist Papers are replete with references to \xe2\x80\x9clegislatures\xe2\x80\x9d that can only be understood as referring to representative institutions.  <i>E.g.</i>, The Federalist No. 27, pp. 174\xe2\x80\x93175 (C.

Noah Webster\xe2\x80\x99s heralded American Dictionary of the English Language defines \xe2\x80\x9clegislature\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he body of men in a state or kingdom, invested with power to make and repeal laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).  It continues, \xe2\x80\x9cThe legislatures of most of the states in America .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. consist of two houses or branches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I could go on, but the Court has said this before.  As we put it nearly a century ago, \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a term of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hawke</i>, 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it meant when adopted it still means for the purpose of interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cA Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe representative body which ma[kes] the laws of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.; see <i>Smiley</i>, 285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 365 (relying on this definition); <i>Colorado Gen.

When seeking to discern the meaning of a word in the Constitution, there is no better dictionary than the rest of the Constitution itself.  Our precedents new and old have employed this structural method of interpretation to read the Constitution in the manner it was drafted and ratified\xe2\x80\x94as a unified, coherent whole.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Noel Canning</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___  (2014) (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320); <i>id.</i>, at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 32); <i>McCulloch </i>v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 414\xe2\x80\x93415 (1819); <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 304, 328\xe2\x80\x93330 (1816); Amar, Intratextualism, 112 Harv.

Every one of those references is consistent with the understanding of a legislature as a representative body.  More importantly, many of them are only consistent with an institutional legislature\xe2\x80\x94and flatly incompatible with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the people as a whole.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s first use of the term: \xe2\x80\x9cThe House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01.  This reference to a \xe2\x80\x9cBranch of the State Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d can only be referring to an institutional body, and the explicit juxtaposition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe State Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe People of the several States\xe2\x80\x9d forecloses the majority\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reading.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next Section of Article I describes how to fill vacancies in the United States Senate: \xe2\x80\x9cif Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa02.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The references to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Recess of the Legislature of any State\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe next Meeting of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d are only consistent with an institutional legislature, and make no sense under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  The people as a whole (schoolchildren and a few unnamed others excepted) do not take a \xe2\x80\x9cRecess.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The list goes on.  Article IV provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened), against domestic Violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74.  It is perhaps conceivable that all the people of a State could be \xe2\x80\x9cconvened\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94although this would seem difficult during an \xe2\x80\x9cInvasion\xe2\x80\x9d or outbreak of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic Violence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but the only natural reading of the Clause is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Executive\xe2\x80\x9d may submit a federal application when \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d as a representative body cannot be convened.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Article VI provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cSenators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cl.\xc2\xa03.  Unless the majority is prepared to make all the people of every State swear an \xe2\x80\x9cOath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d this provision can only referto the \xe2\x80\x9cseveral State Legislatures\xe2\x80\x9d in their institutional capacity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Each of these provisions offers strong structural indications about what \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d must mean.  But the most powerful evidence of all comes from the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment.  Under the original Constitution, Senators were \xe2\x80\x9cchosen by the Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of each State, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa01, while Members of the House of Representatives were chosen \xe2\x80\x9cby the People,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01.  That distinction was critical to the Framers.  As James Madison explained, the Senate would \xe2\x80\x9cderive its powers from the States,\xe2\x80\x9d while the House would \xe2\x80\x9cderive its powers from the people of America.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 39, at 244.  George Mason believed that the power of state legislatures to select Senators would \xe2\x80\x9cbe a reasonable guard\xe2\x80\x9d against \xe2\x80\x9cthe Danger .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the national, will swallow up the State Legislatures.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 160 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  Not everyone agreed.  James Wilson proposed allowing the people to elect Senators directly.  His proposal was rejected ten to one.  Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, S. Doc. No. 404, 57th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1902).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before long, reformers took up Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s mantle and launched a protracted campaign to amend the Constitution.  That effort began in 1826, when Representative Henry Storrs of New York proposed\xe2\x80\x94but then set aside\xe2\x80\x94a constitutional amendment transferring the power to elect Senators from the state legislatures to the people.  2 Cong. Deb. 1348\xe2\x80\x931349.  Over the next three-quarters of a century, no fewer than 188 joint resolutions proposing similar reforms were introduced in both Houses of Congress.  1 W. Hall, The History and Effect of the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment 183\xe2\x80\x93184 (1936).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At no point in this process did anyone suggest that a constitutional amendment was unnecessary because \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d could simply be interpreted to mean \xe2\x80\x9cpeople.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Hawke</i>, 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt was never suggested, so far as we are aware, that the purpose of making the office of Senator elective by the people could be accomplished by a referendum vote.  The necessity of the amendment to accomplish the purpose of popular election is shown in the adoption of the amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, as the decades rolled by without an amendment, 28 of the 45 States settled for the next best thing by holding a popular vote on candidates for Senate, then pressuring state legislators into choosing the winner.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Abstract of Laws Relating to the Election of United States Senators, S. Doc. No. 393, 59th Cong., 2d Sess. (1907).  All agreed that cutting the state legislature out of senatorial selection entirely would require nothing less than to \xe2\x80\x9cStrike out\xe2\x80\x9d the original words in the Constitution and \xe2\x80\x9cinsert, \xe2\x80\x98elected by the people\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in its place.  Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 1st Sess., 88 (1849) (proposal of Sen. Jeremiah Clemens).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Yet that is precisely what the majority does to the Elections Clause today\xe2\x80\x94amending the text not through the process provided by Article V, but by judicial decision.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s revision renders the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment an 86-year waste of time, and singles out the Elections Clause as the only one of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s seventeen provisions referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d that departs from the ordinary meaning of the term.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Commission had no answer to this point.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42 (Justice Alito: \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any other provision where legislature means anything other than the conventional meaning?\xe2\x80\x9d  Appellee: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s response is not much better.  The majority observes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of a State may perform different functions under different provisions of the Constitution.  Under Article I, \xc2\xa73, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d performed an \xe2\x80\x9celectoral\xe2\x80\x9d function by choosing Senators.  The \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d plays a \xe2\x80\x9cconsenting\xe2\x80\x9d function under Article I, \xc2\xa78, and Article IV, \xc2\xa73; a \xe2\x80\x9cratifying\xe2\x80\x9d function under Article V; and a \xe2\x80\x9clawmaking\xe2\x80\x9d function under the Elections Clause.  <i>Ante</i>, at 19, and n.\xc2\xa017.<i> </i>All true.  The majority, however, leaps from the premise that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d performs different <i>functions</i> under different provisions to the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d assumes different <i>identities</i> under different provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a matter of ordinary language and common sense, however, a difference in function does not imply a difference in meaning.  A car, for example, generally serves a transportation function.  But it can also fulfill a storage function.  At a tailgate party or a drive-in movie, it may play an entertainment function.  In the absence of vacancies at the roadside motel, it could provide a lodging function.  To a neighbor with a dead battery, it offers an electricity generation function.  And yet, a person describing a \xe2\x80\x9ccar\xe2\x80\x9d engaged in any of these varied functions would undoubtedly be referring to the same thing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Constitution itself confirms this point.  Articles I and II assign many different functions to the Senate: a lawmaking function, an impeachment trial function, a treaty ratification function, an appointee confirmation function, an officer selection function, a qualification judging function, and a recordkeeping function.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa71; \xc2\xa73, cls. 5, 6; \xc2\xa75, cls.\xc2\xa01, 3; \xc2\xa77, cl. 2; Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.   Yet the identity of the Senate remains the same as it discharges these various functions.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Similarly, the House of Representatives performs different functions, including lawmaking, impeachment, and resolving Presidential elections in which no candidate wins a majority in the Electoral College.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa71; \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa05; \xc2\xa77, cl.\xc2\xa02; Amdt. 12.  The President is assigned not only executive functions, Art.\xc2\xa0II, but also legislative functions, such as approving or vetoing bills, convening both Houses of Congress, and recommending measures for their consideration, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa77, cl. 2; Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73.  Courts not only exercise a judicial function, Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa71, but may also perform an appointment function, Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  And so on.  Neither the majority nor the Commission points to a single instance in which the identity of these actors changes as they exercise different functions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority attempts to draw support from precedent, but our cases only further undermine its position.  In <i>Hawke</i>, this Court considered the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislatur[e]\xe2\x80\x9d in Article V, which outlines the process for ratifying constitutional amendments.  The Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9cthe representative body which ma[kes] the laws of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227.  The Court then explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term is often used in the Constitution <i>with this evident meaning</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  The Court proceeded to list other constitutional provisions that assign different functions to the \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature,\xe2\x80\x9d just as the majority does today.  <i>Id.</i>, at 227\xe2\x80\x93228; see <i>ante</i>, at 19, n.\xc2\xa017.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the majority today, however, the Court in <i>Hawke</i> never hinted that the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d varied across those different provisions because they assigned different functions.  To the contrary, the Court drew inferences from the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment and its predecessor, Article I, \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x94in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d played an <i>electoral</i> function\xe2\x80\x94to define the \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d in Article V, which assigned it a <i>ratification</i> function.  See 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228.  The Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a representative body, whatever its function.  As the Court put it, \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no question that the framers of the Constitution clearly understood and carefully used the terms in which that instrument referred to the action of the legislatures of the States.  When they intended that direct action by the people should be had they were no less accurate in the use of apt phraseology to carry out such purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(citing Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Smiley</i>, the leading precedent on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause, reaffirmed the definition announced in <i>Hawke</i>.  In <i>Smiley</i>, the petitioner argued\xe2\x80\x94as the Commission does here\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d referred not just to \xe2\x80\x9cthe two houses of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d but to \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire legislative power of the state .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. however exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1931, No. 617, p.\xc2\xa022 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court did not respond by holding, as the majority today suggests, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99 comprises the referendum and the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto in the context of regulating congressional elections,\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99 has a different iden-tity\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause than it does in Article V.  <i>Ante,</i> at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Instead, the Court in <i>Smiley</i> said this:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cMuch that is urged in argument with regard to the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x98Legislature\xe2\x80\x99 is beside the point.  As this Court said in <i>Hawke</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the term was not one \xe2\x80\x98of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the Constitution.  What it meant when adopted it still means for purposes of interpretation.  A Legislature was then the representative body which made the laws of the people.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 365 (quoting <i>Hawke</i>, 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Remarkably, the majority refuses to even acknowledge the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d adopted in both <i>Smiley</i> and <i>Hawke</i>, and instead embraces the interpretation that this Court unanimously rejected more than 80 years ago.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] </p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The history of the Elections Clause further supports the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d is a representative body.  The first known draft of the Clause to appear at the Constitutional Convention provided that \xe2\x80\x9cEach state shall prescribe the time and manner of holding elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Debates on the Federal Constitution 146 (J. Elliot ed. 1836).  After revision by the Committee of Detail, the Clause included the important limitation at issue here: \xe2\x80\x9cThe times and places, and the manner, of holding the elections of the members of each house, shall be prescribed <i>by the legislature of each state</i>; but their provisions concerning them may, at any time, be altered <i>by the legislature of the United States</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 225 (emphasis added).  The insertion of \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that the Framers thought carefully about which entity within the State was to perform congressional districting.  And the parallel between \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature of each state\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d further suggests that they meant \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature\xe2\x80\x9d as a representative body.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the majority explains, the debate over the ratification of the Elections Clause centered on its second part, which empowers Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cmake or alter\xe2\x80\x9d regulations prescribed by \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of a State.  See<i> ante</i>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9327.<i> </i>Importantly for our purposes, however, both sides in this debate \xe2\x80\x9crecognized the distinction between the state legislature and the people themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Secretary of State of Florida</i>, 668 F.\xc2\xa03d 1271, 1275\xe2\x80\x931276, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA11 2012).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Anti-Federalists, for example, supported vesting election regulation power solely in state legislatures because state \xe2\x80\x9clegislatures were more numerous <i>bodies</i>, usually <i>elected annually</i>, and thus more likely to be in sympathy with the interests<i> of the people</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Natelson, The Original Scope of the Congressional Power to Regulate Elections, 13 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 1, 31 (2010) (emphasis added) (citing sources from ratification debates).  Alexander Hamilton and others responded by raising the specter of state legislatures\xe2\x80\x94which he described as \xe2\x80\x9clocal administrations\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94deciding to \xe2\x80\x9cannihilate\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Government by \xe2\x80\x9cneglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 59, at 363.  As the majority acknowledges, the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d and the people \xe2\x80\x9coccasioned no debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 27.  That is because everybody understood what \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d meant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority contends that its counterintuitive reading of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d is necessary to advance the \xe2\x80\x9canimating principle\xe2\x80\x9d of popular sovereignty.  <i>Ante</i>, at 24.  But the ratification of the Constitution was the ultimate act of popular sovereignty, and the people who ratified the Elections Clause did so knowing that it assigned authority to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d as a representative body.  The Elections Clause was not, as the majority suggests, an all-purpose \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard against manipulation of electoral rules by politicians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 26.<i> </i>Like most provisions of the Constitution, the Elections Clause reflected a compromise\xe2\x80\x94a pragmatic recognition that the grand project of forging a Union required everyone to accept some things they did not like.  See The Federalist No. 59, at 364 (describing the power allocated to state legislatures as \xe2\x80\x9can evil which could not have been avoided\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has no power to upset such a compromise simply because we now think that it should have been struck differently.  As we explained almost a century ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he framers of the Constitution might have adopted a different method,\xe2\x80\x9d but it \xe2\x80\x9cis not the function of courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to alter the method which the Constitution has fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hawke</i>, 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to text, structure, and history, several precedents interpreting the Elections Clause further reinforce that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a representative body.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first precedent comes not from this Court, but from Congress.  Acting under its authority to serve as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa75, cl.\xc2\xa01, the House of Representatives in 1866 confronted a dispute about who should be seated as the Congressman from the Fifth District of Michigan.  At a popular convention, Michigan voters had amended the State Constitution to require votes to be cast within a resident\xe2\x80\x99s township or ward.  The Michigan Legislature, however, passed a law permitting soldiers to vote in alternative locations.  If only the local votes counted, one candidate (Baldwin) would win; if the outside votes were included, the other candidate (Trowbridge) would be entitled to the seat.  See <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>Trowbridge</i>, 2 Bartlett Contested Election Cases, H.\xc2\xa0R. Misc. Doc. No. 152, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 46\xe2\x80\x9347 (1866).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The House Elections Committee explained that the Elections Clause conferred power on \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of Michigan to prescribe election regulations.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d the Committee asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is meant by \xe2\x80\x98the legislature?\xe2\x80\x99  Does it mean the legislative power of the State, which would include a convention authorized to prescribe fundamental law; or does it mean the legislature <i>eo nomine</i>, as known in the political history of the country?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 47.  The Committee decided, and the full House agreed, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause was the \xe2\x80\x9clegislature <i>eo nomine</i>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the legislature <i>by that name</i>, a representative body.  <i>Ibid.  </i>That conclusion followed both from the known meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the framing and the many other uses of the word in the Constitution that would not be compatible with a popular convention.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here there is a conflict of authority between the constitution and legislature of a State in regard to fixing place of elections, the power of the legislature is paramount.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 46; see <i>California Democratic Party</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 567\n, and n. 11 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (relying on <i>Baldwin</i> for its conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Elections Clause\xe2\x80\x99s specific reference to \xe2\x80\x98the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99 is not so broad as to encompass the general \xe2\x80\x98legislative power of this State\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">The majority draws attention to the minority report in <i>Baldwin</i>.  <i>Ante</i>, at 29.  Under the present circumstances, I take some comfort in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to consider dissenting views.  Still, the minority report does not diminish the force of <i>Baldwin</i>.  The report cites a Michigan Supreme Court precedent that allegedly reached a con-trary result, but that case turned entirely on state constitu-tional questions arising from a state election\xe2\x80\x94not federal constitutional questions arising from a federal election.  See <i>People ex\xc2\xa0rel. Twitchell</i> v.<i> Blodgett</i>,<i> </i>13 Mich. 127 (1865).  The majority also contends that <i>Baldwin</i> \xe2\x80\x9cappears in tension with\xe2\x80\x9d an earlier House Elections Committee precedent.  <i>Ante</i>, at 29.  By its own terms, however, that earlier precedent did not involve a conflict between a state legislative act and a state constitutional provision.  See <i>Shiel</i> v. <i>Thayer</i>, 1 Bartlett Contested Election Cases, H.\xc2\xa0R. Misc. Doc. No. 57, 38th Cong., 2d Sess., 350 (1861) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe two branches of the legislature differed upon the question .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and so the bill never became a law\xe2\x80\x9d).  In any event, to the degree that the two precedents are inconsistent, the later decision in <i>Baldwin</i> should govern.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next relevant precedent is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>McPherson</i> v. <i>Blacker</i>,\n\n146 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1892)\n.  That case involved a constitutional provision with considerable similarity to the Elections Clause, the Presidential Electors Clause of Article II: \xe2\x80\x9cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner <i>as the Legislature thereof</i> may direct, a Number of Electors .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71, cl.\xc2\xa02 (emphasis added).  The question was whether the state legislature, as a body of representatives, could divide authority to appoint electors across each of the State\xe2\x80\x99s congressional districts.  The Court upheld the law and emphasized that the plain text of the Presidential Electors Clause vests the power to determine the manner of appointment in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d of the State.  That power, the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>can neither be taken away nor abdicated</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  146 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 35 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Against that backdrop, the Court decided two cases regarding the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause.  In <i>Ohio ex rel. Davis</i> v. <i>Hildebrant</i>,\n\n241 U.\xc2\xa0S. 565 (1916)\n, the Ohio Legislature passed a congressional redistricting law.  Under the Ohio Constitution, voters held a referendum on the law and rejected it.  A supporter of the law sued on behalf of the State, contending that the referendum \xe2\x80\x9cwas not and could not be a part of the legislative authority of the State and therefore could have no influence on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the law creating congressional districts\xe2\x80\x9d under the Elections Clause.  <i>Id.,</i> at 567.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court rejected the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional argument as a nonjusticiable claim that the referendum \xe2\x80\x9ccauses a State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be not republican\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution.  <i>Id.,</i> at 569 (citing Art. IV, \xc2\xa74).  The Court also rejected an argument that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s use of the referendum violated a federal statute, and held that Congress had the power to pass that statute under the Elections Clause.  <i>Id.,</i> at 568\xe2\x80\x93569.  <i>Hildebrant</i> in no way suggested that the state legislature could be displaced from the redistricting process, and <i>Hildebrant</i> certainly did not hold\xe2\x80\x94as the majority today contends\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cthe word [\xe2\x80\x98Legislature\xe2\x80\x99 in the Elections Clause] encompassed a veto power lodged in the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 16.<i> </i> <i>Hildebrant</i> simply approved a State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to employ a referendum <i>in addition to</i> redistricting by the Legislature.  See 241 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569.  The result of the decision was to send <i>the Ohio Legislature</i> back to the drawing board to do the redistricting.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Smiley</i>, the Minnesota Legislature passed a law adopting new congressional districts, and the Governor exercised his veto power under the State Constitution.  As noted above, the Minnesota secretary of state defended the veto on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d in the Elections Clause referred not just to \xe2\x80\x9cthe two houses of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d but to \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire legislative power of the state .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. however exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court rejected that argument, reiterating that the term \xe2\x80\x9cLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9cthe representative body which made the laws of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 365 (quoting <i>Hawke</i>, 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227).  The Court nevertheless went on to hold that the Elections Clause did not prevent a State from applying the usual rules of its legislative process\xe2\x80\x94including a gubernatorial veto\xe2\x80\x94to election regulations prescribed by the legislature.  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373.  As in <i>Hildebrant</i>, the legislature was not displaced, nor was it redefined; it just had to start on a new redistricting plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority initially describes <i>Hildebrant</i> and <i>Smiley</i> as holding that \xe2\x80\x9credistricting is a legislative function, to be performed in accordance with the State\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptions for lawmaking, which may include the referendum and the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 19.  That description is true, so far as it goes.  But it hardly supports the result the majority reaches here.  There is a critical difference between allowing a State to <i>supplement</i> the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s role in the legislative process and permitting the State to <i>supplant</i> the legislature altogether.  See <i>Salazar</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 1095 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\xe2\x80\x9cto be consistent with Article I, \xc2\xa74, there must be some limit on the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to define lawmaking by excluding the legislature itself\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nothing in <i>Hildebrant</i>, <i>Smiley</i>, or any other precedent supports the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that imposing some constraints on the legislature justifies deposing it entirely. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The constitutional text, structure, history, and precedent establish a straightforward rule: Under the Elections Clause, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d is a representative body that, when it prescribes election regulations, may be required to do so within the ordinary lawmaking process, but may not be cut out of that process.  Put simply, the state legislature need not be exclusive in congressional districting, but neither may it be excluded.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary understanding requires it to accept a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d that contradicts the term\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning, creates discord with the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment and the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s many other uses of the term, makes nonsense of the drafting and ratification of the Elections Clause, and breaks with the relevant precedents.  In short, the effect of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision is to erase the words \xe2\x80\x9cby the Legislature thereof\xe2\x80\x9d from the Elections Clause.  That is a judicial error of the most basic order.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect; and therefore such a construction is inadmissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court also issues an alternative holding that a federal statute,\n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72a(c), permits Arizona to vest redistricting authority in the Commission.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19\xe2\x80\x9323.

No legislative drafter remotely familiar with the English language would say that a State had to follow default rules \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ntil [it] is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d when what he meant was \xe2\x80\x9cany redistricting plan that the State adopts shall become federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  And if the drafter was doing something as significant as transforming state law into federal law, he presumably would have taken care to make that dramatic step \xe2\x80\x9cunmistakably clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452,\n460 (1991)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Tellingly, our most recent case on the meaning of Section 2a(c) seems not to have even considered the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position.  See <i>Branch</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, the majority does not even seem persuaded by its own argument.  The majority quickly cautions, in discussing Section 2a(c), that \xe2\x80\x9ca State is required to comply with the Federal Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, and other federal laws when it draws and implements its district map.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa020.  The majority therefore concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in \xc2\xa72a(c) affects a challenge to a state district map on the ground that it violates one or more of those federal requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But here the Arizona Legislature has challenged \xe2\x80\x9ca state district map on the ground that it violates one .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of those federal requirements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Elections Clause.  If we take the majority at its word, nothing in Section 2a(c) should affect that challenge.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Not only is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of Section 2a(c) implausible as a matter of statutory interpretation, it would also likely violate the Constitution in multiple ways.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of Section 2a(c) as a statute approving the lines drawn by the Commission would seemingly authorize Congress to alter the Elections Clause.  The first part of the Elections Clause gives state legislatures the power to prescribe regulations regarding the times, places, and manner of elections; the second part of the Clause gives Congress the power to \xe2\x80\x9cmake or alter such Regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is a difference between making or altering election regulations prescribed by the state legislature and authorizing an entity <i>other than the state legislature</i> to prescribe election regulations.  In essence, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reading permits Congress to use the second part of the Elections Clause to nullify the first.  Yet this Court has expressly held that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress ha[s] no power to alter Article I, section 4 [the Elections Clause].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smiley</i>, 285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 372; see also <i>Clinton</i> v. <i>City of New York</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417 (1998)\n (Congress may not circumvent Article I constraints on its lawmaking power); <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919\n (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Section 2a(c) would create a serious delegation problem.  As a general matter, Congress may pass statutes that delegate some discretion to those who administer the laws.  It is a well-accepted principle, however, that Congress may not delegate authority to one actor when the Constitution vests that authority in another actor.  See <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n472 (2001)\n.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of Section 2a(c) contradicts that rule by allowing Congress to delegate federal redistricting authority to a state entity other than the one in which the Elections Clause vests that authority: \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation conflicts with our most recent Elections Clause precedent, <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc.</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2013)\n.  There we explained that when Congress legislates under the Elections Clause, it \xe2\x80\x9c<i>necessarily</i> displaces some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11).  That is so because \xe2\x80\x9cthe power the Elections Clause confers [on Congress] is none other than the power to pre-empt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).  Put differently, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>all</i> action under the Elections Clause displaces some element of a pre-existing state regulatory regime, because the text of the Clause confers the power to do exactly (and only) that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___, n.\xc2\xa06 (slip op., at 11, n. 6).  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Section 2a(c), however, Congress has done the opposite of preempting or displacing state law\xe2\x80\x94it has <i>adopted</i> state law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Normally, when \xe2\x80\x9ca serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Crowell</i> v. <i>Benson</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22,\n62 (1932)\n.  The multiple serious constitutional doubts raised by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Section 2a(c)\xe2\x80\x94in addition to the sheer weakness of its reading as a textual matter\xe2\x80\x94provide more than enough reason to reject the majority\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  Section 2a(c) does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Justice Jackson once wrote that the Constitution speaks in \xe2\x80\x9cmajestic generalities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed</i>. v. <i>Barnette,</i>\n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624,\n639 (1943)\n.  In many places it does, and so we have cases expounding on \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amdts. 1, 4.  Yet the Constitution also speaks in some places with elegant specificity.  A Member of the House of Representatives must be 25 years old.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  Every State gets two Senators.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa01.  And the times, places, and manner of holding elections for those federal representatives \xe2\x80\x9cshall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the reasons I have explained, there is no real doubt about what \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d means.  The Framers of the Constitution were \xe2\x80\x9cpractical men, dealing with the facts of political life as they understood them, putting into form the government they were creating, and prescribing in language clear and intelligible the powers that government was to take.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>South Carolina</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 199 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, 449 (1905).  We ought to give effect to the words they used.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority today shows greater concern about redistricting practices than about the meaning of the Constitution.  I recognize the difficulties that arise from trying to fashion judicial relief for partisan gerrymandering.  See <i>Vieth</i> v. <i>Jubelirer</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267 (2004)\n; <i>ante</i>, at 1.  But our inability to find a manageable standard in that area is no excuse to abandon a standard of meaningful interpretation in this area.  This Court has stressed repeatedly that a law\xe2\x80\x99s virtues as a policy innovation cannot redeem its inconsistency with the Constitution.  \xe2\x80\x9cFailure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Clinton</i>, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 449 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see <i>Stern</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011); <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> v. <i>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477 (2010)\n;<i> Bowsher</i> v. <i>Synar</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 714 (1986)\n; <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919\n; <i>Myers</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52 (1926)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, the Court has enforced the text of the Constitution to invalidate state laws with policy objectives reminiscent of this one.  Two of our precedents held that States could not use their constitutions to impose term limits on their federal representatives in violation of the United States Constitution.  <i>Cook</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510\n; <i>U.\xc2\xa0S. Term Limits, Inc.</i> v. <i>Thornton</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 779 (1995)\n.  The people of the States that enacted these reforms surely viewed them as measures that would \xe2\x80\x9cplace the lead rein in the people\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 27.  Yet the Court refused to accept \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Framers spent significant time and energy in debating and crafting Clauses that could be easily evaded.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Term Limits</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 831.  The majority approves just such an evasion of the Constitution today.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also overstates the effects of enforcing the plain meaning of the Constitution in this case.  There is no dispute that Arizona may continue to use its Commission to draw lines for state legislative elections.  The representatives chosen in those elections will then be responsible for congressional redistricting as members of the state legislature, so the work of the Commission will continue to influence Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s federal representation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, reading the Elections Clause to require the involvement of the legislature will not affect most other redistricting commissions.  As the majority notes, many States have commissions that play an \xe2\x80\x9cauxiliary role\xe2\x80\x9d in congressional redistricting.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 8, and nn. 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But in these States, unlike in Arizona, the legislature retains primary authority over congressional redistricting.  See Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also points to a scattered array of election-related laws and constitutional provisions enacted via popular lawmaking that it claims would be \xe2\x80\x9cendangered\xe2\x80\x9d by interpreting the Elections Clause to mean what it says.  <i>Ante</i>, at 33.  Reviewing the constitutionality of these farflung provisions is well outside the scope of this case.  Suffice it to say that none of them purports to do what the Arizona Constitution does here: set up an unelected, unaccountable institution that permanently and totally displaces the legislature from the redistricting process.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his wolf comes as a wolf.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison</i> v. <i>Olson</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 654,\n699 (1988)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Absent from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of the high motives that inspired the Arizona Commission is any discussion of how it has actually functioned.  The facts described in a recent opinion by a three-judge District Court detail the partisanship that has affected the Commission on issues ranging from staffing decisions to drawing the district lines.  See <i>Harris</i> v. <i>Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 993 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1042 (Ariz. 2014).  The <i>per curiam</i> opinion explained that \xe2\x80\x9cpartisanship played some rolein the design of the map,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9csome of the commissioners were motivated in part in some of the linedrawing decisions by a desire to improve Democratic prospects in the affected districts,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Commission retained a mapping consultant that \xe2\x80\x9chad worked for Democratic, independent, and nonpartisan campaigns, but no Republican campaigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1046, 1047, 1053.  The hiring of the mapping consultant provoked sufficient controversy that the Governor of Arizona, supported by two-thirds of the Arizona Senate, attempted to remove the chairwoman of the Commission for \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial neglect of duty and gross misconduct in office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1057; see <i>Arizona</i> <i>Independent Redistricting Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Brewer</i>, 229 Ariz. 347, 275 P.\xc2\xa03d 1267 (2012) (explaining the removal and concluding that the Governor exceeded her authority under the Arizona Constitution).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Silver\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe very structure of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s reformed redistricting process reflects that partisanship still plays a prominent role.\xe2\x80\x9d  993 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1083.  Judge Wake\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion described the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csystematic overpopulation of Republican plurality districts and underpopulation of  Democratic plurality districts\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cold-fashioned partisan malapportionment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1091, 1108.  In his words, the \xe2\x80\x9cCommission has been coin-clipping the currency of our democracy\xe2\x80\x94everyone\xe2\x80\x99s equal vote\xe2\x80\x94and giving all the shavings to one party, for no valid reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1092.    </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court concluded by a two-to-one margin that this partisanship did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  The case is pending on appeal before this Court, and I take no position on the merits question.  But a finding that the partisanship in the redistricting plan did not violate the Constitution hardly proves that the Commission is operating free of partisan influence\xe2\x80\x94and certainly not that it complies with the Elections Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The people of Arizona have concerns about the process of congressional redistricting in their State.  For better or worse, the Elections Clause of the Constitution does not allow them to address those concerns by displacing their legislature.  But it does allow them to seek relief from Congress, which can make or alter the regulations prescribed by the legislature.  And the Constitution gives them another means of change.  They can follow the lead of the reformers who won passage of the\n \nSeventeenth Amendment.  Indeed, several constitutional amendments over the past century have involved modifications of the electoral process.  Amdts. 19, 22, 24, 26.  Unfortunately, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will only discourage this democratic method of change.

As it reads \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature\xe2\x80\x9d out of the Times, Places and Manner Clause, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa74, the majority offers a paean to the ballot initiative.  It speaks in glowing terms of the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic of our federal system that States retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 27.  And it urges \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eference to state lawmaking\xe2\x80\x9d so that States may perform their vital function as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98laboratories\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dof democracy.  <i>Ante,</i> at 28.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These sentiments are difficult to accept.  The conduct of the Court in so many other cases reveals a different attitude toward the States in general and ballot initiatives in particular.  Just last week, in the antithesis of deference to state lawmaking through direct democracy, the Court cast aside state laws across the country\xe2\x80\x94many of which were enacted through ballot initiative\xe2\x80\x94that reflected the traditional definition of marriage.  See <i>Obergefell </i>v.<i> Hodges</i>, <i>ante,</i> p. ___.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s tradition of disdain for state ballot initiatives goes back quite a while.  Two decades ago, it held unconstitutional an Arkansas ballot initiative imposing term limits on that State\xe2\x80\x99s Members of Congress, finding \xe2\x80\x9clittle significance\xe2\x80\x9d in the fact that such term limits were adopted by popular referendum.  <i>U.\xc2\xa0S. Term Limits, Inc.</i> v. <i>Thornton</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 779,\n822, n.\n32 (1995)\n. <i> </i>One year later, it held unconstitutional a ballot initiative that would have prevented the enactment of laws under which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships [would] constitute or otherwise be the basis of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romer</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 620,\n624 (1996)\n.  The Court neither gave deference to state lawmaking nor said anything about the virtues of direct democracy.  It instead declared that the result of the ballot initiative was an aberration\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 633.  But if \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional tradition\xe2\x80\x9d is the measuring stick, then it is hard to understand how the Court condones a redistricting practice that was unheard of for nearly 200 years after the ratification of the Constitution and that conflicts with the express constitutional command that election laws \xe2\x80\x9cbe prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s lack of respect for ballot initiatives is evident not only in what it has done, but in what it has failed to do.  Just this Term, the Court repeatedly refused to review cases in which the Courts of Appeals had set aside state laws passed through ballot initiative.  See, <i>e.g., County of Maricopa </i>v. <i>Lopez-Valenzuela</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (state constitutional amendment denying bail for illegal aliens arrested in certain circumstances); <i>Herbert </i>v. <i>Kitchen</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014) (state constitutional amendment retaining traditional definition of marriage); <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Bishop</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014) (same); <i>Rainey </i>v. <i>Bostic</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014) (same); <i>Walker </i>v. <i>Wolf</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014) (same).  It did so despite warnings that its indifference to such cases would \xe2\x80\x9conly embolden the lower courts to reject state laws on questionable constitutional grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lopez-Valenzuela, supra, </i>at ___ (slip op., at 2).  And it refused to grant a stay pending appeal of a decision purporting to require the State of Alabama to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, even though Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s licensing laws had not been challenged in that case.  See <i>Strange </i>v. <i>Searcy</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay).  In each decision, the cheers for direct democracy were conspicuously absent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sometimes disapproval of ballot initiatives has been even more blatant.  Just last Term, one dissenting opinion castigated the product of a state ballot initiative as \xe2\x80\x9cstymieing the right of racial minorities to participate in the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schuette </i>v. <i>BAMN</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Sotomayor, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  It did not hail the ballot initiative as the result of a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment of its people,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 19, nor offer any deference to state lawmaking.  Instead, it complained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he majority of Michigan voters changed the rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the existing political process .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schuette</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at ___ (slip op., at 4).  And it criticized state ballot initiatives as biased against racial minorities because such minorities \xe2\x80\x9cface an especially uphill battle\xe2\x80\x9d in seeking the passage of such initiatives.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 20).  How quickly the tune has changed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And how striking that it changed here.  The ballot initiative in this case, unlike those that the Court has previously treated so dismissively, was unusually democracy-reducing.  It did not ask the people to approve a particular redistricting plan through direct democracy, but instead to take districting away from the people\xe2\x80\x99s representatives and give it to an unelected committee, thereby reducing democratic control over the process in the future.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of this as direct democracy at its best is rather like praising a plebiscite in a \xe2\x80\x9cbanana republic\xe2\x80\x9d that installs a strongman as President for Life.  And wrapping the analysis in a cloak of federalism does little to conceal the flaws in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would dispense with the faux federalism and would instead treat the States in an evenhanded manner.  That means applying the Constitution as written.  Although the straightforward text of Article I, \xc2\xa74, prohibits redistricting by an unelected, independent commission, Article III limits our power to deciding cases or controversies.  Because I agree with Justice Scalia that the Arizona Legislature lacks Article III standing to assert an institutional injury against another entity of state government, I would dismiss its suit. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
