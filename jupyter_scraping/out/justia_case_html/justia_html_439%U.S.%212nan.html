JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Under the New Jersey homicide statutes, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] some murders are of the first degree; the rest are of the second degree.  Juries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="215">Page 439 U. S. 215</a></p><p> rendering guilty murder verdicts are to designate whether the murder was a first- or second-degree crime.  The mandatory punishment, to be imposed by the judge, for those convicted by a jury of first-degree murder is life imprisonment; [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] second-degree murder is punished by a term of not more than 30 years.  Trials to the court in murder cases are not permitted, and guilty pleas to murder indictments are forbidden.  Pleas of <em>non vult</em> or <em>nolo contendere,</em> however, are allowed.  "If such plea be accepted," the punishment "shall be either imprisonment for life or the same as that imposed upon a conviction of murder in the second degree." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The judge </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 439 U. S. 216</a></p><p> entertaining the plea determines that there is a factual basis for conviction, but need not decide whether the murder is first or second degree.</p>\n<p>Appellant Corbitt, after pleading not guilty to a murder indictment, was convicted of committing murder in the course of an arson -- a felony murder and one of the first-degree homicides. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  He was sentenced to the mandatory punishment of life imprisonment.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed by the New Jersey appellate courts.  The New Jersey Supreme Court rejected his contention that, because defendants pleading <em>non vult</em> could be sentenced to a lesser term, the mandatory life sentence following a first-degree murder verdict was an unconstitutional burden upon his right to a jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and upon his right against compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as a violation of his right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.  74 N.J. 379, 378 A.2d 235 (1977).  We noted probable jurisdiction. 434 U.S. 1060 (1978).</p>\n<p>Appellant\'s principal reliance is upon <em>United States v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/case.html">390 U. S. 570</a></span> (1968).  There, this Court held that the death sentence provided by the Federal Kidnaping Act was invalid because it could be imposed only upon the recommendation of a jury accompanying a guilty verdict, whereas the maximum penalty for those tried to the court after waiving a jury and for those pleading guilty was life </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 439 U. S. 217</a></p><p> imprisonment:  only those insisting on a jury trial faced the possibility of a death penalty.  These provisions were held to be a needless encouragement to plead guilty or to waive a jury trial, and the death penalty was consequently declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>We agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court that there are substantial differences between this case and <em>Jackson,</em> and that <em>Jackson</em> does not require a reversal of Corbitt\'s conviction. T he principal difference is that the pressures to forgo trial and to plead to the charge in this case are not what they were in <em>Jackson.</em>  First, the death penalty, which is "unique in its severity and irrevocability," <em>Gregg v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html">428 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#187">428 U. S. 187</a></span> (1976), is not involved here.  Although we need not agree with the New Jersey court that the <em>Jackson</em> rationale is limited to those cases where a plea avoids any possibility of the death penalty\'s being imposed, it is a material fact that, under the New Jersey law, the maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment, not death.  Furthermore, in <em>Jackson,</em> any risk of suffering the maximum penalty could be avoided by pleading guilty.  Here, although the punishment when a jury finds a defendant guilty of first-degree murder is life imprisonment, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the risk of that punishment is not completely avoided by pleading <em>non vult,</em> because the judge accepting the plea has the authority to impose a life term.  New Jersey does not reserve the maximum punishment for murder for those who insist on a jury trial.</p>\n<p>It is nevertheless true that, while life imprisonment is the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 439 U. S. 218</a></p><p> mandatory punishment for a defendant against whom a jury has returned a first-degree murder verdict, a judge accepting a <em>non vult</em> plea does not classify the murder, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and may impose either life imprisonment or a term of up to 30 years.  The defendant who wishes to avoid the certainty of life imprisonment if he is tried and found guilty by the jury of first-degree murder may seek to do so by tendering a <em>non vult</em> plea.  Although there is no assurance that he will be so favored, the judge does have the power to accept the plea and to sentence him to a lesser term. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It is Corbitt\'s submission that the possibility of a sentence of less than life upon the plea of <em>non vult,</em> combined with the absence of a similar possibility when found guilty by a jury, is an unconstitutional burden on his federal rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>As did the New Jersey Supreme Court, we disagree.  The cases in this Court since <em>Jackson</em> have clearly established that not every burden on the exercise of a constitutional right, and not every pressure or encouragement to waive such a right, is invalid. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Specifically, there is no <em>per se</em> rule against encouraging </p><p><a class="page-number" name="219">Page 439 U. S. 219</a></p><p> guilty pleas.  We have squarely held that a State may encourage a guilty plea by offering substantial benefits in return for the plea. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The plea may obtain for the defendant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="220">Page 439 U. S. 220</a></p><p> "the possibility or certainty . . .

S. 357</a></span> (1978), the defendant went to trial on an indictment charging him as a habitual criminal, for which the mandatory punishment was life imprisonment.  The prosecutor, however, had been willing to accept a plea of guilty to a lesser charge carrying a shorter sentence.  The defendant chose to go to trial, was convicted, and was sentenced to life.  We affirmed the conviction, holding that the State, through the prosecutor, had not violated the Constitution, since it</p>\n<p>"no more than openly presented the defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/357/case.html#365">434 U.

It follows that, by tolerating and encouraging the negotiation of pleas, this Court has necessarily accepted as constitutionally legitimate the simple reality that the prosecutor\'s interest at the bargaining table is to persuade the defendant to forgo his right to plead not guilty."</p>\n<p>434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/357/case.html#364">434 U. S. 364</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There is no difference of constitutional significance between <em>Bordenkircher</em> and this case. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  There, as here, the defendant went to trial on an indictment that included a count carrying a mandatory life term under the applicable state statutes.  There, as here, the defendant could have sought to counter the mandatory penalty by tendering a plea.  In <em>Bordenkircher,</em> as permitted by state law, the prosecutor was willing to forgo the habitual criminal count if there was a plea, in which event the mandatory sentence would have been avoided.  Here, the state law empowered the judge to impose a lesser term either in connection with a plea bargain or otherwise.  In both cases, the defendant gave up the possibility of leniency if he went to trial and was convicted on the count carrying the mandatory penalty.  In <em>Bordenkircher,</em> the probability or certainty of leniency in return for a plea did not invalidate the mandatory penalty imposed after a jury trial.  It should not do so here, where there was no assurance that a plea would be accepted if tendered and, if it had been, no assurance that a sentence less than life would be imposed.  Those matters rested ultimately in the discretion of the judge, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="222">Page 439 U. S. 222</a></p><p> perhaps substantially influenced by the prosecutor and the plea bargaining process permitted by New Jersey law. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Bordenkircher,</em> like other cases here, unequivocally recognized the State\'s legitimate interest in encouraging the entry of guilty pleas and in facilitating plea bargaining, a process mutually beneficial to both the defendant and the State. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In pursuit of this interest, New Jersey has provided that the judge may, but need not, accept pleas of <em>non vult,</em> and that he may impose life or the specified term of years.  This not only provides for discretion in the trial judge, but also sets the limits within which plea bargaining on punishment may take place.  The New Jersey Supreme Court observed that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="223">Page 439 U. S. 223</a></p><p> "encouragement of guilty defendants not to contest their guilt is at the very heart of an effective plea negotiation program."  74 N.J. at 396, 378 A.2d at 243-244.  Its conclusion was that, in this light, there were substantial benefits to the State in providing the opportunity for lesser punishment, and that the statutory pattern could not be deemed a needless or arbitrary burden on the defendant\'s constitutional rights within the meaning of <em>United States v. Jackson.</em></p>\n<p>We are in essential agreement with the New Jersey Supreme Court.  Had Corbitt tendered a plea and had it been accepted and a term of years less than life imposed, this would simply have recognized the fact that there had been a plea and that, in sentencing, it is constitutionally permissible to take that fact into account.  The States and the Federal Government are free to abolish guilty pleas and plea bargaining; but absent such action, as the Constitution has been construed in our cases, it is not forbidden to extend a proper degree of leniency in return for guilty pleas.  New Jersey has done no more than that.</p>\n<p>We discern no element of retaliation or vindictiveness against Corbitt for going to trial.  There is no suggestion that he was subjected to unwarranted charges.  Nor does this record indicate that he was being punished for exercising a constitutional right. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Indeed, insofar as this record reveals, Corbitt may have tendered a plea and it was refused.  There is no doubt that those homicide defendants who are willing to plead <em>non vult</em> may be treated more leniently than those who go to trial, but withholding the possibility of leniency from the latter cannot be equated with impermissible punishment as long as our cases sustaining plea bargaining remain undisturbed.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="224">Page 439 U. S. 224</a></p><p> Those cases, as we have said, unequivocally recognize the constitutional propriety of extending leniency in exchange for a plea of guilty and of not extending leniency to those who have not demonstrated those attributes on which leniency is based. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="225">Page 439 U. S. 225</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, we are unconvinced that the New Jersey statutory pattern exerts such a powerful influence to coerce inaccurate pleas <em>non vult</em> that it should be deemed constitutionally suspect.  There is no suggestion here that Corbitt was not well counseled, or that he misunderstood the choices that were placed before him.  Here, as in <em>Bordenkircher,</em> the State did not trespass on the defendant\'s rights "so long as the accused [was] free to accept or reject" the choice presented to him by the State, 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/357/case.html#363">434 U. S. 363</a></span>, that is, to go to trial and face the risk of life imprisonment or to seek acceptance of a <em>non vult</em> plea and the imposition of the lesser penalty authorized by law.

It thus appears that, in appropriate cases, the jury would be instructed on both first- and second-degree murder.  In this case, however, the State proceeded on a felony murder basis; the judge considered it to be a first-degree felony murder case; and there were no instructions on second-degree murder or manslaughter.

There is thus much more to be derived from plea bargaining than simply conserving scarce prosecutorial resources, and those benefits accrue equally where the plea bargaining occurs within a statutory framework.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s suggestion, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/212/case.html#229">439 U.

But in the next breath, the dissent appears to embrace plea bargaining, although the plea bargaining systems operating in a majority of the jurisdictions throughout the country inherently extend to defendants who plead guilty the probability or the certainty of leniency that will not be available if they go to trial.</p>\n<p>The dissent asserts that the attack here is on the statutory scheme, rather than upon the system of plea bargaining, which is said to individualize defendants and does not mandate a different standard of punishment depending solely on whether or not a plea is entered.  The distinction is without substance for the purposes of this case.  In the first place, plea bargaining by state prosecutors operates by virtue of state law, here, by virtue of the formal rules of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.  That system permits a proper amount of leniency in return for pleas, leniency that is denied if one goes to trial.  In this sense, the standard of punishment is necessarily different for those who plead and for those who go to trial.  For those who plead, that fact itself is a consideration in sentencing, a consideration that is not present when one is found guilty by a jury.  Second, under the New Jersey statutes, pleas may be rejected even if tendered; there must, for example, be a factual basis for the plea.  Even if a plea is accepted, there is discretion to impose life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The statute leaves much to the judge and to the prosecutor, and does not mandate lesser punishment for those pleading <em>non vult</em> than is imposed on those who go to trial.  It is also true that, under normal circumstances, juries in New Jersey may find a defendant guilty of second-degree murder, rather than first.</p>\n<p>Third, we cannot hold that a prosecutor may charge a person with a crime carrying a mandatory punishment and secure a valid conviction, despite his power to offer leniency to those who plead -- including dismissal of the mandatory count in return for a plea -- and yet hold that the legislature may not openly provide for the possibility of leniency in return for a plea.  This is particularly true where it is contemplated that plea bargaining will, in any event, go forward within the limits set by the legislature.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We do not suggest that every conceivable statutory sentencing structure, plea bargaining system, or particular plea bargain would be constitutional.  We hold only that a State may make due allowance for pleas in its sentencing decisions, and that New Jersey has not exceeded its powers in this respect by its statutory provision extending the possibility of leniency to those who plead <em>non vult</em> in homicide cases.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that <em>United States v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/case.html">390 U. S. 570</a></span>, is not controlling in this case.  In the <em>Jackson</em> case, a convicted defendant could be sentenced to death if he had requested a jury trial, but could be sentenced to no more than a life sentence if he either had pleaded guilty or had pleaded not guilty and waived a jury trial.  Under these circumstances, the Court held that this part of the federal statute was unconstitutional because it "impose[d] an impermissible burden upon the exercise of a constitutional right."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/case.html#572">390 U. S. 572</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Under the New Jersey statutory scheme, by contrast, no such impermissible burden is present.  Unlike the statute at issue in the <em>Jackson</em> case, the death penalty is not involved here, and a convicted defendant can be sentenced to the maximum penalty of life imprisonment whether he pleads <em>non vult</em> or goes to trial.  Moreover, although in New Jersey a defendant pleads <em>non vult</em> to a general indictment of murder, he can be sentenced to the maximum sentence even though the underlying facts would have supported no more than a second-degree murder conviction if the defendant had gone to trial and been found guilty by a jury.  Since the latter offense cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 439 U. S. 227</a></p><p> be punished by life imprisonment, a defendant who is guilty of second-degree murder is subject to a greater penalty if he pleads <em>non vult</em> than if he pleads not guilty and is convicted of that offense after a jury trial.  Finally, a defendant who pleads not guilty and goes to trial can be convicted of a lesser included offense or acquitted, even though, in fact, he is guilty of first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter.  It is, therefore, impossible to state with any confidence that the New Jersey statute does, in fact, penalize a defendant\'s decision to plead not guilty.<l=>*</l=></p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the statement of the Court, however, that "[t]here is no difference of constitutional significance between <em>Bordenkircher</em> and this case."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/212/case.html#221">439 U. S. 221</a></span>.  <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/357/case.html">434 U. S. 357</a></span>, involved plea negotiations between the attorney for the prosecution and the attorney for the defense in the context of an adversary system of criminal justice.  It seems to me that there is a vast difference between the settlement of litigation through negotiation between counsel for the parties and a state statute such as is involved in the present case.  While a prosecuting attorney, acting as an advocate, necessarily must be able to settle an adversary criminal lawsuit through plea bargaining with his adversary, a state legislature has a quite different function to perform.  Could a state legislature provide that the penalty for every criminal offense to which a defendant pleads guilty is to be one-half the penalty to be imposed upon a defendant convicted of the same offense after a not-guilty plea?  I would suppose that such legislation would be clearly unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Jackson.</em>  Since the reasoning of part </p><p><a class="page-number" name="228">Page 439 U. S. 228</a></p><p> of the Court\'s opinion suggests otherwise, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<p>* Indeed, despite the appellant\'s claim that the statute coerces or encourages guilty pleas, the appellant himself pleaded not guilty, went to trial, and was convicted.  The petitioner in <em>United States v. Jackson,</em> by contrast, brought a facial attack on the constitutionality of the statute by way of a motion to dismiss the indictment.  <em>See</em> 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/case.html#571">390 U. S. 571</a></span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The concept of a "false" not guilty plea has no place in our jurisprudence. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  A defendant has a constitutional right to require the State to support its accusation with evidence. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  He is therefore given an unqualified right -- before trial when he retains the presumption of innocence -- to plead not guilty. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="229">Page 439 U. S. 229</a></p><p> Because the entry of such a plea cannot at once be criminally punishable and constitutionally protected, a statute that has no other purpose or effect than to penalize assertion of the right not to plead guilty is "patently unconstitutional."  The Court so held in <em>United States v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/case.html">390 U. S. 570</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/570/case.html#581">390 U. S. 581</a></span>, and that holding is dispositive of this case. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Today, however, the Court decides that a defendant who has been convicted after a full trial may be punished not only for the crime charged in the indictment but additionally for entering a "false" plea of not guilty.  The holding in <em>Jackson,</em> though not specifically overruled, has been divorced from the rationale on which it rested.</p>\n<p>New Jersey does not seriously contend that \xc2\xa7 2A:113-3 has any purpose or effect other than to penalize assertion of the right not to plead guilty.  Its argument that the statute is justified by a valid state interest in conserving scarce prosecutorial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 439 U. S. 230</a></p><p> resources is simply a restatement of the obvious purpose of the law to motivate defendants to plead guilty instead of exercising their expensive right to trial.  If appellee is correct in its assertion that the statute has been effective as a money-saving inducement to guilty pleas, that success is necessarily attributable to the deterrent effect of the penalty imposed on those who resist the inducement.</p>\n<p>In its attempt to distinguish <em>Jackson,</em> the State argues that its statute imposes no penalty for "falsely" pleading not guilty because it provides the same maximum punishment regardless of the plea.  That argument is beside the point, because the statute provides a significantly more severe standard of punishment for the defendant who exercises his constitutional rights than for the one who submits without trial.  For the former, a mandatory life sentence is prescribed, whereas, for the latter, life is "only the maximum in a discretionary spectrum of length" that extends downward anywhere from a term of 30 years to no term at all.  <em>Dobbert v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/282/case.html">432 U. S. 282</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/282/case.html#300">432 U. S. 300</a></span>.  Whether viewed in light of the legislative purpose in enacting the statute or in light of its impact on the defendant\'s choice of how to plead, this difference in punitive standards has the same "onerous" effect as if the maximum, as well as the minimum, penalty differed. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Just as in <em>Jackson,</em> the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 439 U. S. 231</a></p><p> statute subjects the defendant who stands trial to a substantial risk of greater punishment than the defendant who pleads guilty. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor is this statutory scheme the equivalent of a plea bargain negotiated between defense counsel and the prosecutor.  While such bargains serve a state interest in common with \xc2\xa7 2A:113-3, they do so without penalizing the defendant\'s assertion of his legal rights.  In the bargaining process, individual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="232">Page 439 U. S. 232</a></p><p> factors relevant to the particular case may be considered by the prosecutor in charging and by the trial judge in sentencing, regardless of the defendant\'s plea; [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] the process does not mandate a different standard of punishment depending solely on whether or not a plea is entered. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Of even greater importance is the fact that a defendant who refuses a plea bargain will not be punished for his constitutionally protected recalcitrance; whatever punishment he receives will be for his conduct in committing the offense or offenses the State has proved at trial. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  In contrast, a defendant who faces a more severe range of statutory penalties simply because he has insisted on a trial is subjected to punishment not only for the crime the State has proved, but also for the "offense" of entering a "false" not guilty plea.</p>\n<p>Because the legislature, the voice of the community in identifying </p><p><a class="page-number" name="233">Page 439 U. S. 233</a></p><p> crimes and penalties, [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] has inflexibly engraved the different standard of punishment in the statute itself, New Jersey may not disavow or disparage its policy of imposing a special punishment simply because a person has done what the law plainly allows him to do.  As the Court reiterated last Term, the implementation of such a policy inevitably produces a due process violation of the most basic sort. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The right of the defendant to stand absolutely mute before the bar of justice and to force the government to make its case without his aid has been accepted since the earliest days of the Republic. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  That silence, and its formal invocation by entry of a not guilty plea, cannot retain the protection of the Fifth Amendment and be simultaneously a punishable offense.  The same act cannot be both lawful and unlawful.  That is the essence of the Court\'s holding in <em>Jackson. </em> I respectfully dissent from its repudiation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"[T]he plea is not evidence.
