S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa748 to criminalize the commercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty.  The statute addresses only <em>portrayals</em> of harmful acts, not the underlying conduct.  It applies to any visual or auditory depiction \xe2\x80\x9cin which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed,\xe2\x80\x9d if that conduct violates federal or state law where \xe2\x80\x9cthe creation, sale, or possession takes place,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa748(c)(1).  Another clause exempts depictions with \xe2\x80\x9cserious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa748(b).  The legislative background of \xc2\xa748 focused primarily on \xe2\x80\x9ccrush videos,\xe2\x80\x9d which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish.  Respondent Stevens was indicted under \xc2\xa748 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.  He moved to dismiss, arguing that \xc2\xa748 is facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The District Court denied his motion, and Stevens was convicted.  The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and declared \xc2\xa748 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of protected speech.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section \xc2\xa748 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.  Because \xc2\xa748 explicitly regulates expression based on content, it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98presumptively invalid,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/803/index.html">529 U. S. 803</a>, 817.  Since its enactment, the First Amendment has permitted restrictions on a few historic categories of speech\xe2\x80\x94including obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, and speech integral to criminal conduct\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9chave never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chaplinsky</em> v. <em>New Hampshire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/index.html">315 U. S. 568</a>, 572.  Depictions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list.  While the prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law, there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting <em>depictions</em> of such cruelty.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test would broadly balance the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine whether the First Amendment even applies.  But the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of speech that survive an ad\xc2\xa0hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.  The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.  <em>New York</em> v. <em>Ferber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/index.html">458 U.

S. 442</a>, 449, n.\xc2\xa06.  Stevens claims that common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of materials subject to \xc2\xa748.  The Government does not defend such applications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to specific types of extreme material.  Section 48\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality thus turns on how broadly it is construed.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cdepiction of animal cruelty\xe2\x80\x9d does not even require that the depicted conduct be cruel.  While the words \xe2\x80\x9cmaimed, mutilated, [and] tortured\xe2\x80\x9d convey cruelty, \xe2\x80\x9cwounded\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ckilled\xe2\x80\x9d do not.  Those words have little ambiguity and should be read according to their ordinary meaning.  Section 48 does require that the depicted conduct be \xe2\x80\x9cillegal,\xe2\x80\x9d but many federal and state laws concerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard against animal cruelty.  For example, endangered species protections restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals.  The statute draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, \xc2\xa748 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of whether the \xe2\x80\xa6 wounding \xe2\x80\xa6 or killing took place\xe2\x80\x9d there, \xc2\xa748(c)(1).  Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the same conduct is unlawful.  This greatly expands \xc2\xa748\xe2\x80\x99s scope, because views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.  Hunting is unlawful in the District of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national market for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand for crush videos or animal fighting depictions.  Because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country, \xc2\xa748(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that is sold in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital.  Those seeking to comply with the law face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate jurisdictions.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Limiting \xc2\xa748\xe2\x80\x99s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal fighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions clause.  The statute only exempts material with \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d value, and \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d must be taken seriously.  The excepted speech must also fall within one of \xc2\xa748(b)\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated categories.  Much speech does not.  For example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional in nature.  The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading that results in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s banning only the depictions the Government would like to ban.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the language of \xc2\xa748(b) is drawn from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Miller</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/index.html">413 U. S. 15</a>, the exceptions clause does not answer every First Amendment objection.  Under <em>Miller</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity.  But <em>Miller </em>did not determine that serious value could be used as a general precondition to protecting <em>other</em> types of speech in the first place.  Even \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wholly neutral futilities \xe2\x80\xa6 come under the protection of free speech.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/index.html">403 U. S. 15</a>, 25.  The First Amendment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify for \xc2\xa748(b)\xe2\x80\x99s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall within \xc2\xa748(c)\xe2\x80\x99s broad reach.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0Despite the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that it will apply \xc2\xa748 to reach only \xe2\x80\x9cextreme\xe2\x80\x9d cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it responsibly.  Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to avoid constitutional doubt.  A limiting construction can be imposed only if the statute \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98readily susceptible\xe2\x80\x99 to such a construction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/844/index.html">521 U. S. 844</a>, 884.  To read \xc2\xa748 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinterpretation.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9319.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(5)\xc2\xa0This construction of \xc2\xa748 decides the constitutional question.  The Government makes no effort to defend \xc2\xa748 as applied beyond crush videos and depictions of animal fighting.  It argues that those particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny.  But the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depictions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to \xc2\xa748.  Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively impermissible applications of \xc2\xa748 far outnumber any permissible ones.  The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional.  Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa748 to criminalize the commercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty.  The statute does not address underlying acts harmful to animals, but only portrayals of such conduct.

In what is referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the law exempts from prohibition any depiction \xe2\x80\x9cthat has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa748(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative background of \xc2\xa748 focused primarily on the interstate market for \xe2\x80\x9ccrush videos.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the House Committee Report on the bill, such videos feature the intentional torture and killing of helpless animals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, mice, and hamsters.  H. R. Rep. No. 106\xe2\x80\x93397, p. 2 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).  Crush videos often depict women slowly crushing animals to death \xe2\x80\x9cwith their bare feet or while wearing high heeled shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes while \xe2\x80\x9ctalking to the animals in a kind of dominatrix patter\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he cries and squeals of the animals, obviously in great pain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Apparently these depictions \xe2\x80\x9cappeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish who find them sexually arousing or otherwise exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The acts depicted in crush videos are typically prohibited by the animal cruelty laws enacted by all 50 States and the District of Columbia.  See Brief for United States 25, n.\xc2\xa07 (listing statutes).  But crush videos rarely disclose the participants\xe2\x80\x99 identities, inhibiting prosecution of the underlying conduct.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 3; accord, Brief for State of Florida et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, however, involves an application of \xc2\xa748 to depictions of animal fighting.  Dogfighting, for example, is unlawful in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, see Brief for United States 26, n.\xc2\xa08 (listing statutes), and has been restricted by federal law since 1976.  Animal Welfare Act Amendments of 1976, \xc2\xa717, 90 Stat. 421, 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72156.  Respondent Robert J. Stevens ran a business, \xe2\x80\x9cDogs of Velvet and Steel,\xe2\x80\x9d and an associated Web site, through which he sold videos of pit bulls engaging in dogfights and attacking other animals.  Among these videos were Japan Pit Fights and Pick-A-Winna: A Pit Bull Documentary, which include contemporary footage of dogfights in Japan (where such conduct is allegedly legal) as well as footage of American dogfights from the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and 1970\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  A third video, Catch Dogs and Country Living, depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar, as well as a \xe2\x80\x9cgruesome\xe2\x80\x9d scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic farm pig.  533 F.\xc2\xa03d 218, 221 (CA3 2008) (en banc).  On the basis of these videos, Stevens was indicted on three counts of violating \xc2\xa748.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stevens moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that \xc2\xa748 is facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The District Court denied the motion.  It held that the depictions subject to \xc2\xa748, like obscenity or child pornography, are categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.  2:04\xe2\x80\x93cr\xe2\x80\x9300051\xe2\x80\x93ANB (WD Pa., Nov. 10, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\xe2\x80\x9371a.  It went on to hold that \xc2\xa748 is not substantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause sufficiently narrows the statute to constitutional applications.  <em>Id.,</em> at 71a\xe2\x80\x9375a.  The jury convicted Stevens on all counts, and the District Court sentenced him to three concurrent sentences of 37 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.

The Court of Appeals first held that \xc2\xa748 regulates speech that is protected by the First Amendment.  The Court declined to recognize a new category of unprotected speech for depictions of animal cruelty, <em>id.,</em> at 224, and n.\xc2\xa06, and rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s analogy between animal cruelty depictions and child pornography, <em>id.,</em> at 224\xe2\x80\x93232.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals then held that \xc2\xa748 could not survive strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of protected speech.  <em>Id.,</em> at 232.  It found that the statute lacked a compelling government interest and was neither narrowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least restrictive means of doing so.  <em>Id.,</em> at 232\xe2\x80\x93235.  It therefore held \xc2\xa748 facially invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that \xc2\xa748 \xe2\x80\x9cmight also be unconstitutionally overbroad,\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially covers a great deal of constitutionally protected speech\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csweeps [too] widely\xe2\x80\x9d to be limited only by prosecutorial discretion.  <em>Id.,</em> at 235, n.\xc2\xa016.

It contends that depictions of \xe2\x80\x9cillegal acts of animal cruelty\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cmade, sold, or possessed for commercial gain\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily \xe2\x80\x9clack expressive value,\xe2\x80\x9d and may accordingly \xe2\x80\x9cbe regulated as <em>unprotected</em> speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 10 (emphasis added).  The claim is not just that Congress may regulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the First Amendment, but that these depictions are outside the reach of that Amendment altogether\xe2\x80\x94that they fall into a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98First Amendment Free Zone.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Airport Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Jews for Jesus, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/569/index.html">482 U. S. 569</a>, 574 (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Government notes, the prohibition of animal cruelty itself has a long history in American law, starting with the early settlement of the Colonies.  Reply Brief 12, n.\xc2\xa08; see, <em>e.g.,</em> The Body of Liberties \xc2\xa792 (Mass. Bay Colony 1641), reprinted in American Historical Documents 1000\xe2\x80\x931904, 43 Harvard Classics 66, 79 (C. Eliot ed. 1910) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo man shall exercise any Tirranny or Crueltie towards any bruite Creature which are usuallie kept for man\xe2\x80\x99s use\xe2\x80\x9d).  But we are unaware of any similar tradition excluding <em>depictions</em> of animal cruelty from \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d codified in the First Amendment, and the Government points us to none.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that \xe2\x80\x9chistorical evidence\xe2\x80\x9d about the reach of the First Amendment is not \xe2\x80\x9ca necessary prerequisite for regulation today,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 12, n.\xc2\xa08, and that categories of speech may be exempted from the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection without any long-settled tradition of subjecting that speech to regulation.  Instead, the Government points to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legislative judgment that \xe2\x80\xa6 depictions of animals being intentionally tortured and killed [are] of such minimal redeeming value as to render [them] unworthy of First Amendment protection,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 23 (quoting 533 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 243 (Cowen, J., dissenting)), and asks the Court to uphold the ban on the same basis.  The Government thus proposes that a claim of categorical exclusion should be considered under a simple balancing test: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether a given category of speech enjoys First Amendment protection depends upon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech against its societal costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 8; see also <em>id.,</em> at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage, that sentence is startling and dangerous.  The First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of free speech does not extend only to categories of speech that survive an ad\xc2\xa0hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.  The First Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.  Our Constitution forecloses any attempt to revise that judgment simply on the basis that some speech is not worth it.  The Constitution is not a document \xe2\x80\x9cprescribing limits, and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 178 (1803).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be fair to the Government, its view did not emerge from a vacuum.  As the Government correctly notes, this Court has often <em>described</em> historically unprotected categories of speech as being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 383 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 572).  In <em>New York</em> v. <em>Ferber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/index.html">458 U. S. 747</a> (1982), we noted that within these categories of unprotected speech, \xe2\x80\x9cthe evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication is required,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe balance of competing interests is clearly struck,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 763\xe2\x80\x93764.  The Government derives its proposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.  See Brief for United States 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But such descriptions are just that\xe2\x80\x94descriptive.  They do not set forth a test that may be applied as a general matter to permit the Government to imprison any speaker so long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary, or so long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts in a statute\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When we have identified categories of speech as fully outside the protection of the First Amendment, it has not been on the basis of a simple cost-benefit analysis.  In <em>Ferber</em>, for example, we classified child pornography as such a category, 458 U. S., at 763.  We noted that the State of New York had a compelling interest in protecting children from abuse, and that the value of using children in these works (as opposed to simulated conduct or adult actors) was <em>de minimis</em>.  <em>Id.,</em> at 756\xe2\x80\x93757, 762.  But our decision did not rest on this \xe2\x80\x9cbalance of competing interests\xe2\x80\x9d alone.  <em>Id.</em>, at 764.  We made clear that <em>Ferber</em> presented a special case: The market for child pornography was \xe2\x80\x9cintrinsically related\xe2\x80\x9d to the underlying abuse, and was therefore \xe2\x80\x9can integral part of the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 759, 761.  As we noted, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t rarely has been suggested that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 761\xe2\x80\x93762 (quoting <em>Giboney</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 498).  <em>Ferber</em> thus grounded its analysis in a previously recognized, long-established category of unprotected speech, and our subsequent decisions have shared this understanding.  See <em>Osborne</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/index.html">495 U. S. 103</a>, 110 (1990) (describing <em>Ferber</em> as finding \xe2\x80\x9cpersuasive\xe2\x80\x9d the argument that the advertising and sale of child pornography was \xe2\x80\x9can integral part\xe2\x80\x9d of its unlawful production (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/234/index.html">535 U.

Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.  But if so, there is no evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cdepictions of animal cruelty\xe2\x80\x9d is among them.  We need not foreclose the future recognition of such additional categories to reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s highly manipulable balancing test as a means of identifying them.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we decline to carve out from the First Amendment any novel exception for \xc2\xa748, we review Stevens\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stevens challenged \xc2\xa748 on its face, arguing that any conviction secured under the statute would be unconstitutional.  The court below decided the case on that basis, 533 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 231, n.\xc2\xa013, and we granted the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhether 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 48 is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have to establish \xe2\x80\x9cthat no set of circumstances exists under which [\xc2\xa748] would be valid,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U.

S. 702</a>, 740, n.\xc2\xa07 (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Which standard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that we need not and do not address, and neither <em>Salerno</em> nor <em>Glucksberg</em> is a speech case.  Here the Government asserts that Stevens cannot prevail because \xc2\xa748 is plainly legitimate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depictions.  Deciding this case through a traditional facial analysis would require us to resolve whether these applications of \xc2\xa748 are in fact consistent with the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the First Amendment context, however, this Court recognizes \xe2\x80\x9ca second type of facial challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad if \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html">552 U.

Stevens argues that \xc2\xa748 applies to common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities, and that these depictions constitute the vast majority of materials subject to the statute.  Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  The Government makes no effort to defend such a broad ban as constitutional.  Instead, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s entire defense of \xc2\xa748 rests on interpreting the statute as narrowly limited to specific types of \xe2\x80\x9cextreme\xe2\x80\x9d material.  Brief for United States 8.  As the parties have presented the issue, therefore, the constitutionality of \xc2\xa748 hinges on how broadly it is construed.  It is to that question that we now turn.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained two Terms ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute; it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U. S. 285</a>, 293 (2008).  Because \xc2\xa748 is a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a state court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to interpret its own law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We read \xc2\xa748 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.  To begin with, the text of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s ban on a \xe2\x80\x9cdepiction of animal cruelty\xe2\x80\x9d nowhere requires that the depicted conduct be cruel.  That text applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany \xe2\x80\xa6 depiction\xe2\x80\x9d in which \xe2\x80\x9ca living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa748(c)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured\xe2\x80\x9d convey cruelty, but \xe2\x80\x9cwounded\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ckilled\xe2\x80\x9d do not suggest any such limitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that the terms in the definition should be read to require the additional element of \xe2\x80\x9caccompanying acts of cruelty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 6; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 17\xe2\x80\x9319.  (The dissent hinges on the same assumption.  See <em>post,</em> at 6, 9.)  The Government bases this argument on the definiendum, \xe2\x80\x9cdepiction of animal cruelty,\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11 (2004), and on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the commonsense canon of <em>noscitur a sociis</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 7 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, 553 U. S., at 294).  As that canon recognizes, an ambiguous term may be \xe2\x80\x9cgiven more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Likewise, an unclear definitional phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined, see <em>Leocal</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 11 (interpreting a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial risk\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cus[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d as part of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98crime of violence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwounded \xe2\x80\xa6 or killed\xe2\x80\x9d at issue here contains little ambiguity.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief properly applies the ordinary meaning of these words, stating for example that to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98kill\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98to deprive of life.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 14 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1242 (1993)).  We agree that \xe2\x80\x9cwounded\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ckilled\xe2\x80\x9d should be read according to their ordinary meaning.  Cf. <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn.</em> v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/246/index.html">541 U. S. 246</a>, 252 (2004).  Nothing about that meaning requires cruelty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While not requiring cruelty, \xc2\xa748 does require that the depicted conduct be \xe2\x80\x9cillegal.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this requirement does not limit \xc2\xa748 along the lines the Government suggests.  There are myriad federal and state laws concerning the proper treatment of animals, but many of them are not designed to guard against animal cruelty.  Protections of endangered species, for example, restrict even the humane \xe2\x80\x9cwound[ing] or kill[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cliving animal[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa748(c)(1).  Livestock regulations are often designed to protect the health of human beings, and hunting and fishing rules (seasons, licensure, bag limits, weight requirements) can be designed to raise revenue, preserve animal populations, or prevent accidents.  The text of \xc2\xa748(c) draws no distinction based on the reason the intentional killing of an animal is made illegal, and includes, for example, the humane slaughter of a stolen cow.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, the application of \xc2\xa748 to depictions of illegal conduct extends to conduct that is illegal in only a single jurisdiction.  Under subsection (c)(1), the depicted conduct need only be illegal in \xe2\x80\x9cthe State in which the creation, sale, or possession takes place, regardless of whether the \xe2\x80\xa6 wounding \xe2\x80\xa6 or killing took place in [that] State.\xe2\x80\x9d  A depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs afoul of the ban if that depiction later finds its way into another State where the same conduct is unlawful.  This provision greatly expands the scope of \xc2\xa748, because although there may be \xe2\x80\x9ca broad societal consensus\xe2\x80\x9d against cruelty to animals, Brief for United States 2, there is substantial disagreement on what types of conduct are properly regarded as cruel.  Both views about cruelty to animals and regulations having no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the District of Columbia, for example, all hunting is unlawful.  D.\xc2\xa0C. Munic. Regs., tit. 19, \xc2\xa71560 (2009).  Other jurisdictions permit or encourage hunting, and there is an enormous national market for hunting-related depictions in which a living animal is intentionally killed.  Hunting periodicals have circulations in the hundreds of thousands or millions, see Mediaweek, Sept. 29, 2008, p.\xc2\xa028, and hunting television programs, videos, and Web sites are equally popular, see Brief for Professional Outdoor Media Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The demand for hunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand for crush videos or animal fighting depictions by several orders of magnitude.  Compare <em>ibid.</em> and Brief for National Rifle Association of America, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12 (hereinafter NRA Brief) (estimating that hunting magazines alone account for $135 million in annual retail sales) with Brief for United States 43\xe2\x80\x9344, 46 (suggesting $1 million in crush video sales per year, and noting that Stevens earned $57,000 from his videos).  Nonetheless, because the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country, \xc2\xa748(a) extends to <em>any</em> magazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as that depiction is sold within the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate jurisdictions.  Some States permit hunting with crossbows, Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x934(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa729.1\xe2\x80\x93519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it, Ore. Admin. Reg. 635\xe2\x80\x93065\xe2\x80\x930725 (2009), or restrict it only to the disabled, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Envir. Conserv. Law Ann. \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x930901(16) (West 2005).  Missouri allows the \xe2\x80\x9ccanned\xe2\x80\x9d hunting of ungulates held in captivity, Mo. Code Regs. Ann., tit. 3, 10\xe2\x80\x939.560(1), but Montana restricts such hunting to certain bird species, Mont. Admin. Rule 12.6.1202(1) (2007).  The sharp-tailed grouse may be hunted in Idaho, but not in Washington.  Compare Idaho Admin. Code \xc2\xa713.01.09.606 (2009) with Wash. Admin. Code \xc2\xa7232\xe2\x80\x9328\xe2\x80\x93342 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disagreements among the States\xe2\x80\x94and the \xe2\x80\x9ccommonwealth[s], territor[ies], or possession[s] of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa748(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x94extend well beyond hunting.  State agricultural regulations permit different methods of livestock slaughter in different places or as applied to different animals.  Compare, <em>e.g.,</em> Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7828.23(5) (2007) (excluding poultry from humane slaughter requirements) with Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code Ann. \xc2\xa719501(b) (West 2001) (including some poultry).  California has recently banned cutting or \xe2\x80\x9cdocking\xe2\x80\x9d the tails of dairy cattle, which other States permit.  2009 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 344 (S.\xc2\xa0B. 135) (West).  Even cockfighting, long considered immoral in much of America, see <em>Barnes</em> v. <em>Glen Theatre, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/560/index.html">501 U.

An otherwise-lawful image of any of these practices, if sold or possessed for commercial gain within a State that happens to forbid the practice, falls within the prohibition of \xc2\xa748(a).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only thing standing between defendants who sell such depictions and five years in federal prison\xe2\x80\x94other than the mercy of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x94is the statute\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions clause.  Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cany depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government argues that this clause substantially narrows the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach: News reports about animal cruelty have \xe2\x80\x9cjournalistic\xe2\x80\x9d value; pictures of bullfights in Spain have \xe2\x80\x9chistorical\xe2\x80\x9d value; and instructional hunting videos have \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d value.

Thus, the Government argues, \xc2\xa748 reaches only crush videos, depictions of animal fighting (other than Spanish bullfighting, see Brief for United States 47\xe2\x80\x9348), and perhaps other depictions of \xe2\x80\x9cextreme acts of animal cruelty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 41.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to narrow the statutory ban, however, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the exceptions clause.

But the text says \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d value, and \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d should be taken seriously.  We decline the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation\xe2\x80\x94advanced for the first time in this Court\xe2\x80\x94to regard as \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d anything that is not \xe2\x80\x9cscant.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Or, as the dissent puts it, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trifling.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.)

Much speech does not.  Most hunting videos, for example, are not obviously instructional in nature, except in the sense that all life is a lesson.  According to Safari Club International and the Congressional Sportsmen\xe2\x80\x99s Foundation, many popular videos \xe2\x80\x9chave primarily entertainment value\xe2\x80\x9d and are designed to \xe2\x80\x9centertai[n] the viewer, marke[t] hunting equipment, or increas[e] the hunting community.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Safari Club International et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 12.  The National Rifle Association agrees that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of the content of hunting media \xe2\x80\xa6 is merely <em>recreational</em> in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  NRA Brief 28.  The Government offers no principled explanation why these depictions of hunting or depictions of Spanish bullfights would be <em>inherently</em> valuable while those of Japanese dogfights are not.  The dissent contends that hunting depictions must have serious value because hunting has serious value, in a way that dogfights presumably do not.  <em>Post,</em> at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  But \xc2\xa748(b) addresses the value of the <em>depictions</em>, not of the underlying activity.  There is simply no adequate reading of the exceptions clause that results in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s banning only the depictions the Government would like to ban.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government explains that the language of \xc2\xa748(b) was largely drawn from our opinion in <em>Miller</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/index.html">413 U.

See Reply Brief 8, 9, and n.\xc2\xa05.  According to the Government, this incorporation of the <em>Miller</em> standard into \xc2\xa748 is therefore surely enough to answer any First Amendment objection.

Limiting <em>Miller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exception to \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d value ensured that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book [would] not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene publication.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 25, n.\xc2\xa07 (quoting <em>Kois</em> v. <em>Wisconsin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/229/index.html">408 U.

It argues that those particular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the ban on such speech is narrowly tailored to reinforce restrictions on the underlying conduct, prevent additional crime arising from the depictions, or safeguard public mores.  But the Government nowhere attempts to extend these arguments to depictions of any other activities\xe2\x80\x94depictions that are presumptively protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to the criminal sanctions of \xc2\xa748.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the Government seriously contest that the presumptively impermissible applications of \xc2\xa748 (properly construed) far outnumber any permissible ones.

See <em>supra</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  We therefore need not and do not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which has the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos and is thus likely to spur a resumption of their production, is unwarranted.  Respondent was convicted under \xc2\xa748 for selling videos depicting dogfights.  On appeal, he argued, among other things, that \xc2\xa748 is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case, and he highlighted features of those videos that might distinguish them from other dogfight videos brought to our attention.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x94incorrectly, in my view\xe2\x80\x94declined to decide whether \xc2\xa748 is unconstitutional as applied to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s videos and instead reached out to hold that the statute is facially invalid.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not endorse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes down \xc2\xa748 using what has been aptly termed the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong medicine\xe2\x80\x9d of the overbreadth doctrine, <em>United States </em>v.<em> Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U.

Accordingly, we have repeatedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the text of [the law] <em>and from actual fact</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d that substantial overbreadth exists.  <em>Virginia </em>v.<em> Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/113/index.html">539 U.

Similarly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be a <em>realistic danger</em> that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court for it to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Members of City Council of Los Angeles </em>v.<em> Taxpayers for Vincent</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/index.html">466 U. S. 789</a>, 801 (1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding that \xc2\xa748 violates the overbreadth rule, the Court declines to decide whether, as the Government maintains, \xc2\xa748 is constitutional as applied to two broad categories of depictions that exist in the real world: crush videos and depictions of deadly animal fights.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10, 19.  Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of argument that \xc2\xa748 is valid as applied to these depictions, but the Court concludes that \xc2\xa748 reaches too much protected speech to survive.  The Court relies primarily on depictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depictions of animals being slaughtered for food.  I address the Court\xe2\x80\x99s examples below.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn first to depictions of hunting.  As the Court notes, photographs and videos of hunters shooting game are common.  See <em>ante, </em>at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  But hunting is legal in all 50 States, and \xc2\xa748 applies only to a depiction of conduct that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa748(a), (c).  Therefore, in all 50 States, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the vast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls outside \xc2\xa748\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that \xc2\xa748 prohibits the sale or possession in the District of Columbia of any depiction of hunting because the District\xe2\x80\x94undoubtedly because of its urban character\xe2\x80\x94does not permit hunting within its boundaries.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  The Court also suggests that, because some States prohibit a particular type of hunting (<em>e.g., </em>hunting with a crossbow or \xe2\x80\x9ccanned\xe2\x80\x9d hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal (<em>e.g.</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9csharp-tailed grouse\xe2\x80\x9d), \xc2\xa748 makes it illegal for persons in such States to sell or possess for sale a depiction of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in which the hunting took place.  See <em>ante, </em>at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is seriously flawed.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a federal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged as overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to such a limiting construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ferber</em>, 458 U. S., at 769, n.\xc2\xa024.  See also <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 307 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o the extent the statutory text alone is unclear, our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes it especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to ascertain the intent of its drafters\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this canon, I would hold that \xc2\xa748 does not apply to depictions of hunting.  First, because \xc2\xa748 targets depictions of \xe2\x80\x9canimal cruelty,\xe2\x80\x9d I would interpret that term to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law, not to depictions of acts that happen to be illegal for reasons having nothing to do with the prevention of animal cruelty.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (interpreting \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he text of \xc2\xa748(c)\xe2\x80\x9d to ban a depiction of \xe2\x80\x9cthe humane slaughter of a stolen cow\xe2\x80\x9d).  Virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty either expressly define the term \xe2\x80\x9canimal\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude wildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activities,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] so the statutory prohibition set forth in \xc2\xa748(a) may reasonably be interpreted not to reach most if not all hunting depictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, even if the hunting of wild animals were otherwise covered by \xc2\xa748(a), I would hold that hunting depictions fall within the exception in \xc2\xa748(b) for depictions that have \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.,</em> not \xe2\x80\x9ctrifling\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]) \xe2\x80\x9cscientific,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceducational,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chistorical\xe2\x80\x9d value.  While there are certainly those who find hunting objectionable, the predominant view in this country has long been that hunting serves many important values, and it is clear that Congress shares that view.  Since 1972, when Congress called upon the President to designate a National Hunting and Fishing Day, see S.\xc2\xa0J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 86 Stat. 133, Presidents have regularly issued proclamations extolling the values served by hunting.  See Presidential Proclamation No. 8421, 74 Fed. Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama 2009) (hunting and fishing are \xe2\x80\x9cageless pursuits\xe2\x80\x9d that promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe conservation and restoration of numerous species and their natural habitats\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 8295, 73 Fed. Reg. 57233 (Pres. Bush 2008) (hunters and anglers \xe2\x80\x9cadd to our heritage and keep our wildlife populations healthy and strong,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9care among our foremost conservationists\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 7822, 69 Fed. Reg. 59539 (Pres. Bush 2004) (hunting and fishing are \xe2\x80\x9can important part of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s hunters and anglers represent the great spirit of our country\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 4682, 44 Fed. Reg. 53149 (Pres. Carter 1979) (hunting promotes conservation and an appreciation of \xe2\x80\x9chealthy recreation, peaceful solitude and closeness to nature\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 4318, 39 Fed. Reg. 35315 (Pres. Ford 1974) (hunting furthers \xe2\x80\x9cappreciation and respect for nature\xe2\x80\x9d and preservation of the environment).  Thus, it is widely thought that hunting has \xe2\x80\x9cscientific\xe2\x80\x9d value in that it promotes conservation, \xe2\x80\x9chistorical\xe2\x80\x9d value in that it provides a link to past times when hunting played a critical role in daily life, and \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d value in that it furthers the understanding and appreciation of nature and our country\xe2\x80\x99s past and instills valuable character traits.  And if hunting itself is widely thought to serve these values, then it takes but a small additional step to conclude that depictions of hunting make a non-trivial contribution to the exchange of ideas.  Accordingly, I would hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within the exception set out in \xc2\xa748(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not have the slightest doubt that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa748, had no intention of restricting the creation, sale, or possession of depictions of hunting.  Proponents of the law made this point clearly.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 106\xe2\x80\x93397, p.\xc2\xa08 (1999) (hereinafter H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]epictions of ordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within the scope of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. McCollum) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he sale of depictions of legal activities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal under this bill\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]et us be clear as to what this legislation will not do.  It will in no way prohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, even <em>opponents</em> acknowledged that \xc2\xa748 was not intended to reach ordinary hunting depictions.  See <em>ibid.</em> (Rep. Scott); <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 25897 (Rep. Paul).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I am convinced that \xc2\xa748 has no application to depictions of hunting.  But even if \xc2\xa748 did impermissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunting in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in Oregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Virginia or the sale in Washington State of the hunting of a sharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see <em>ante</em>, at 14), those isolated applications would hardly show that \xc2\xa748 bans a substantial amount of protected speech.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court\xe2\x80\x99s overbreadth analysis rests primarily on the proposition that \xc2\xa748 substantially restricts the sale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court cites a few additional examples, including depictions of methods of slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such examples do not show that the statute is substantially overbroad, for two reasons.  First, as explained above, \xc2\xa748 can reasonably be construed to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do not ban the sorts of acts depicted in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypotheticals.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Idaho Code \xc2\xa725\xe2\x80\x933514 (Lexis 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo part of this chapter [prohibiting cruelty to animals] shall be construed as interfering with or allowing interference with \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he humane slaughter of any animal normally and commonly raised as food or for production of fiber \xe2\x80\xa6 [or] [n]ormal or accepted practices of \xe2\x80\xa6 animal husbandry\xe2\x80\x9d); Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 21\xe2\x80\x934310(b) (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this section shall not apply to \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to farm animals, normal or accepted practices of animal husbandry, including the normal and accepted practices for the slaughter of such animals\xe2\x80\x9d); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x93603 (Lexis 2002) (sections prohibiting animal cruelty  \xe2\x80\x9cdo not apply to \xe2\x80\xa6 customary and normal veterinary and agricultural husbandry practices, including dehorning, castration, tail docking, and limit feeding\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, nothing in the record suggests that any one has ever created, sold, or possessed for sale a depiction of the slaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of dairy cows that would not easily qualify under the exception set out in \xc2\xa748(b).  Depictions created to show proper methods of slaughter or tail-docking would presumably have serious \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d value, and depictions created to focus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or otherwise objectionable would presumably have either serious \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cjournalistic\xe2\x80\x9d value or both.  In short, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s examples of depictions involving the docking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that \xc2\xa748 suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial overbreadth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court notes, finally, that cockfighting, which is illegal in all States, is still legal in Puerto Rico, <em>ante</em>, at 15, and I take the Court\xe2\x80\x99s point to be that it would be impermissible to ban the creation, sale, or possession in Puerto Rico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged in Puerto Rico.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  But assuming for the sake of argument that this is correct, this veritable sliver of unconstitutionality would not be enough to justify striking down \xc2\xa748 <em>in toto.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we have a duty to interpret \xc2\xa748 so as to avoid serious constitutional concerns, and \xc2\xa748 may reasonably be construed not to reach almost all, if not all, of the depictions that the Court finds constitutionally protected.  Thus, \xc2\xa748 does not appear to have a large number of unconstitutional applications.  Invalidation for overbreadth is appropriate only if the challenged statute suffers from <em>substantial</em> overbreadth\xe2\x80\x94judged not just in absolute terms, but in relation to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, 553 U. S., at 292.  As I explain in the following Part, \xc2\xa748 has a substantial core of constitutionally permissible applications.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n1</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary conduct that Congress sought to address through its passage [of \xc2\xa748] was the creation, sale, or possession of \xe2\x80\x98crush videos.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  533 F.\xc2\xa03d 218, 222 (CA3 2008) (en banc).  A sample crush video, which has been lodged with the Clerk, records the following event:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] kitten, secured to the ground, watches and shrieks in pain as a woman thrusts her high-heeled shoe into its body, slams her heel into the kitten\xe2\x80\x99s eye socket and mouth loudly fracturing its skull, and stomps repeatedly on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s head. The kitten hemorrhages blood, screams blindly in pain, and is ultimately left dead in a moist pile of blood-soaked hair and bone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Humane Society of United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2 (hereinafter Humane Society Brief).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that the <em>conduct</em> depicted in crush videos may constitutionally be prohibited.  All 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes prohibiting animal cruelty.  See 533 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>, </em>at 223, and n.\xc2\xa04 (citing statutes); H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 3.  But before the enactment of \xc2\xa748, the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was nearly impossible to prosecute.  These videos, which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0often appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 2, were made in secret, generally without a live audience, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe faces of the women inflicting the torture in the material often were not shown, nor could the location of the place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date of the activity be ascertained from the depiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3.  Thus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to identify the parties responsible for the torture.  See Punishing Depictions of Animal Cruelty and the Federal Prisoner Health Care Co-Payment Act of 1999: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p.\xc2\xa01 (1999) (hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty).  In the rare instances in which it was possible to identify and find the perpetrators, they \xe2\x80\x9coften were able to successfully assert as a defense that the State could not prove its jurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that the actions depicted took place within the time specified in the State statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 3<em>;</em> see also 145 Cong. Rec. 25896 (Rep. Gallegly) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is the prosecutors from around this country, Federal prosecutors as well as State prosecutors, that have made an appeal to us for this\xe2\x80\x9d); Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty 21 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the production of the video is not discovered during the actual filming, then prosecution for the offense is virtually impossible without a cooperative eyewitness to the filming or an undercover police operation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (discussing example of case in which state prosecutor \xe2\x80\x9chad the defendant telling us he produced these videos,\xe2\x80\x9d but where prosecution was not possible because the State could not prove where or when the tape was made).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the practical problems thwarting the prosecution of the creators of crush videos under state animal cruelty laws, Congress concluded that the only effective way of stopping the underlying criminal conduct was to prohibit the commercial exploitation of the videos of that conduct.  And Congress\xe2\x80\x99 strategy appears to have been vindicated.  We are told that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y 2007, sponsors of \xc2\xa748 declared the crush video industry dead.  Even overseas Websites shut down in the wake of \xc2\xa748.  Now, after the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision [facially invalidating the statute], crush videos are already back online.\xe2\x80\x9d  Humane Society Brief 5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it most certainly does not protect violent criminal conduct, even if engaged in for expressive purposes.  Crush videos present a highly unusual free speech issue because they are so closely linked with violent criminal conduct.  The videos record the commission of violent criminal acts, and it appears that these crimes are committed for the sole purpose of creating the videos.  In addition, as noted above, Congress was presented with compelling evidence that the only way of preventing these crimes was to target the sale of the videos.  Under these circumstances, I cannot believe that the First Amendment commands Congress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to continue.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most relevant of our prior decisions is <em>Ferber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/747/index.html">458 U. S. 747</a>, which concerned child pornography.  The Court there held that child pornography is not protected speech, and I believe that <em>Ferber</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning dictates a similar conclusion here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In<em> Ferber, </em>an important factor\xe2\x80\x94I would say the most important factor\xe2\x80\x94was that child pornography involves the commission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury to the \xe2\x80\x9cchildren who are made to engage in sexual conduct for commercial purposes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id., </em>at 753 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The <em>Ferber</em> Court repeatedly described the production of child pornography as child \xe2\x80\x9cabuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmolestation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexploitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 749 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn recent years, the exploitive use of children in the production of pornography has become a serious national problem\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 758, n.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9cSexual molestation by adults is often involved in the production of child sexual performances\xe2\x80\x9d).  As later noted in <em>Ashcroft </em>v.<em> Free Speech Coalition</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/234/index.html">535 U. S. 234</a>, 249 (2002), in <em>Ferber</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he production of the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also<em> </em>535 U.S., at 250 (<em>Ferber</em> involved \xe2\x80\x9cspeech that itself is the record of sexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, <em>Ferber</em> emphasized the fact that these underlying crimes could not be effectively combated without targeting the distribution of child pornography.  As the Court put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U. S., at 759.  The Court added:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no serious contention that the legislature was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if not impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 759\xe2\x80\x93760.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>id</em>., at 761 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for and are thus an integral part of the production of such materials\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the <em>Ferber</em> Court noted that the value of child pornography \xe2\x80\x9cis exceedingly modest, if not <em>de minimis,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> and that any such value was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly outweigh[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cthe evil to be restricted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 762\xe2\x80\x93763.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All three of these characteristics are shared by \xc2\xa748, as applied to crush videos.  First, the conduct depicted in crush videos is criminal in every State and the District of Columbia.  Thus, any crush video made in this country records the actual commission of a criminal act that inflicts severe physical injury and excruciating pain and ultimately results in death.  Those who record the underlying criminal acts are likely to be criminally culpable, either as aiders and abettors or conspirators.  And in the tight and secretive market for these videos, some who sell the videos or possess them with the intent to make a profit may be similarly culpable.  (For example, in some cases, crush videos were commissioned by purchasers who specified the details of the acts that they wanted to see performed.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 3; Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty 27).  To the extent that \xc2\xa748 reaches such persons, it surely does not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the criminal acts shown in crush videos cannot be prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited by \xc2\xa748\xe2\x80\x94the creation, sale, and possession for sale of depictions of animal torture with the intention of realizing a commercial profit.  The evidence presented to Congress posed a stark choice: Either ban the commercial exploitation of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the criminal acts that they record.  Faced with this evidence, Congress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video market.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the harm caused by the underlying crimes vastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions might conceivably be thought to possess.  Section 48 reaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture; the statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to simulations.  And, unlike the child pornography statute in <em>Ferber</em> or its federal counterpart, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72252, \xc2\xa748(b) provides an exception for depictions having any \xe2\x80\x9cserious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be acknowledged that \xc2\xa748 differs from a child pornography law in an important respect: preventing the abuse of children is certainly much more important than preventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.  It was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals concluded that <em>Ferber</em> did not support the constitutionality of \xc2\xa748.  533 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 228 (\xe2\x80\x9cPreventing cruelty to animals, although an exceedingly worthy goal, simply does not implicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting children from physical and psychological harm\xe2\x80\x9d).  But while protecting children is unquestionably <em>more</em> important than protecting animals, the Government also has a compelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in crush videos.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain.  Our society has long banned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the country.  In <em>Ferber</em>, the Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually all of the States and the United States have passed legislation proscribing the production of or otherwise combating \xe2\x80\x98child pornography,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court declined to \xe2\x80\x9csecond-guess [that] legislative judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  458 U. S., at 758.  Here, likewise, the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 48\xe2\x80\x99s ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps to enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals do not profit from their crimes.  See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897 (Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe state has an interest in enforcing its existing laws.  Right now, the laws are not only being violated, but people are making huge profits from promoting the violations\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id., </em>at 10685 (May 24, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (explaining that he introduced the House version of the bill because \xe2\x80\x9ccriminals should not profit from [their] illegal acts\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have already judged that taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.  See <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. </em>v. <em>Members of N.\xc2\xa0Y. State Crime Victims Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/105/index.html"></a><a href="/us/502/105/index.html">502 U. S. 105</a>, 119 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, <em>Ferber</em> is the case that sheds the most light on the constitutionality of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to halt the production of crush videos.  Applying the principles set forth in <em>Ferber</em>, I would hold that crush videos are not protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of the <em>Ferber </em>framework also supports the constitutionality of \xc2\xa748 as applied to depictions of brutal animal fights. (For convenience, I will focus on videos of dogfights, which appear to be the most common type of animal fight videos.)</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>First, such depictions, like crush videos, record the actual commission of a crime involving deadly violence.  Dogfights are illegal in every State and the District of Columbia, Brief for United States 26\xe2\x80\x9327, and n.\xc2\xa08 (citing statutes), and under federal law constitute a felony punishable by imprisonment for up to five years, 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72156 <em>et</em> <em>seq. </em>(2006 ed. and Supp. II), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa749 (2006 ed., Supp. II).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Congress had an ample basis for concluding that the crimes depicted in these videos cannot be effectively controlled without targeting the videos.  Like crush videos and child pornography, dogfight videos are very often produced as part of a \xe2\x80\x9clow-profile, clandestine industry,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to market the resulting products requires a visible apparatus of distribution.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Ferber, </em>458 U. S.,<em> </em>at 760.  In such circumstances, Congress had reasonable grounds for concluding that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult, if not impossible, to halt\xe2\x80\x9d the underlying exploitation of dogs by pursuing only those who stage the fights.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 759\xe2\x80\x93760; see 533 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 246 (Cowen, J., dissenting) (citing evidence establishing \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of a lucrative market for depictions of animal cruelty,\xe2\x80\x9d including videos of dogfights, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich in turn provides a powerful incentive to individuals to create [such] videos\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The commercial trade in videos of dogfights is \xe2\x80\x9can integral part of the production of such materials,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ferber, supra, </em>at 761.  As the Humane Society explains, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ideotapes memorializing dogfights are integral to the success of this criminal industry\xe2\x80\x9d for a variety of reasons.  Humane Society Brief 5.  For one thing, some dogfighting videos are made \xe2\x80\x9csolely for the purpose of selling the video (and not for a live audience).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 9.  In addition, those who stage dogfights profit not just from the sale of the videos themselves, but from the gambling revenue they take in from the fights; the videos \xe2\x80\x9cencourage [such] gambling activity because they allow those reluctant to attend actual fights for fear of prosecution to still bet on the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> accord, Brief for Center on the Administration of Criminal Law as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12 (\xe2\x80\x9cSelling videos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying crimes by providing a market for dogfighting while allowing  actual dogfights to remain underground\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThese videos are part of a \xe2\x80\x98lucrative market\xe2\x80\x99 where videos are produced by a \xe2\x80\x98bare-boned, clandestine staff\xe2\x80\x99 in order to permit the actual location of dogfights and the perpetrators of these underlying criminal activities to go undetected\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ideo documentation is vital to the criminal enterprise because it provides <em>proof</em> of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s fighting prowess\xe2\x80\x94proof demanded by potential buyers and critical to the underground market.\xe2\x80\x9d  Humane Society Brief 9.  Such recordings may also serve as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98training\xe2\x80\x99 videos for other fight organizers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>In short, because videos depicting live dogfights are essential to the success of the criminal dogfighting subculture, the commercial sale of such videos helps to fuel the market for, and thus to perpetuate the perpetration of, the criminal conduct depicted in them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, depictions of dogfights that fall within \xc2\xa748\xe2\x80\x99s reach have by definition no appreciable social value.  As noted, \xc2\xa748(b) exempts depictions having any appreciable social value, and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live fight in a larger work that aims at communicating an idea or a message with a modicum of social value would not run afoul of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the harm caused by the underlying criminal acts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the depictions might be thought to possess.  As the Humane Society explains:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe abused dogs used in fights endure physical torture and emotional manipulation throughout their lives to predispose them to violence; common tactics include feeding the animals hot peppers and gunpowder, prodding them with sticks, and electrocution.  Dogs are conditioned never to give up a fight, even if they will be gravely hurt or killed.  As a result, dogfights inflict horrific injuries on the participating animals, including lacerations, ripped ears, puncture wounds and broken bones.  Losing dogs are routinely refused treatment, beaten further as \xe2\x80\x98punishment\xe2\x80\x99 for the loss, and executed by drowning, hanging, or incineration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these dogs, unlike the animals killed in crush videos, the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes. As with crush videos, moreover, the statutory ban on commerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compelling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s criminal laws and preventing criminals from profiting from their illegal activities.  See <em>Ferber</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757\xe2\x80\x93758; <em>Simon &amp; Schuster</em>, 502 U. S., at 119.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, \xc2\xa748 may validly be applied to at least two broad real-world categories of expression covered by the statute:  crush videos and dogfighting videos.  Thus, the statute has a substantial core of constitutionally permissible applications.  Moreover, for the reasons set forth above, the record does not show that \xc2\xa748, properly interpreted, bans a substantial amount of protected speech in absolute terms.  <em>A fortiori</em>, respondent has not met his burden of demonstrating that any impermissible applications of the statute are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d in relation to its \xe2\x80\x9cplainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, 553 U. S., at 292.  Accordingly, I would reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xc2\xa748 is facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the following chart makes clear, virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty either expressly define the term \xe2\x80\x9canimal\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude wildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activities.</p>\n<p>\n<left>Alaska<left></left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nAlaska Stat. \xc2\xa711.61.140(c)(4) (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a defense to a prosecution under this section that the conduct of the defendant \xe2\x80\xa6 was necessarily incidental to lawful fishing, hunting or trapping activities\xe2\x80\x9d)<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nArizona<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nAriz.
