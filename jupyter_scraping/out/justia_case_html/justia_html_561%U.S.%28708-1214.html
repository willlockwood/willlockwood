V. TEAMSTERS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">GRANITE ROCK CO. <em>v</em>. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931214.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 19, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 24, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">In June 2004, respondent local union (Local), supported by its parent international (IBT), initiated a strike against petitioner Granite Rock, the employer of some of Local\xe2\x80\x99s members, following the expiration of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) and an impasse in their negotiations.  On July 2, the parties agreed to a new CBA containing no-strike and arbitration clauses, but could not reach a separate back-to-work agreement holding local and international union members harmless for any strike-related damages Granite Rock incurred.  IBT instructed Local to continue striking until Granite Rock approved such a hold-harmless agreement, but the company refused to do so, informing Local that continued strike activity would violate the new CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike clause.  IBT and Local responded by announcing a company-wide strike involving numerous facilities and workers, including members of other IBT locals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granite Rock sued IBT and Local, invoking federal jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), seeking strike-related damages for the unions\xe2\x80\x99 alleged breach of contract, and asking for an injunction against the ongoing strike because the hold-harmless dispute was an arbitrable grievance under the new CBA.  The unions conceded \xc2\xa7301(a) jurisdiction, but asserted that the new CBA was never validly ratified by a vote of Local\xe2\x80\x99s members, and, thus, the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike clause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock to challenge the strike.  After Granite Rock amended its complaint to add claims that IBT tortiously interfered with the new CBA, the unions moved to dismiss.  The District Court granted IBT\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the tortious interference claims on the ground that \xc2\xa7301(a) supports a federal cause of action only for breach of contract.  But the court denied Local\xe2\x80\x99s separate motion to send the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date to arbitration, ruling that a jury should decide whether ratification occurred on July 2, as Granite Rock contended, or on August 22, as Local alleged.  After the jury concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2, the court ordered arbitration to proceed on Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s breach-of-contract claims.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the tortious interference claims, but reversed the arbitration order, holding that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 ratification-date dispute was a matter for an arbitrator to resolve under the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that the clause covered the ratification-date dispute because the clause clearly covered the related strike claims; national policy favoring arbitration required ambiguity about the arbitration clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope to be resolved in favor of arbitrability; and, in any event, Granite Rock had implicitly consented to arbitrate the ratification-date dispute by suing under the contract.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date was a matter for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Whether parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute is typically an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0issue for judicial determination,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g., Howsam</em> v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/79/index.html">537 U. S. 79</a>, 83, as is a dispute over an arbitration contract\xe2\x80\x99s formation, see, <em>e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kaplan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/938/index.html">514 U. S. 938</a>, 944.  These principles would neatly dispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical.  But it is not.  It is based on when (not whether) the new CBA containing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration clause was ratified and thereby formed.  To determine whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date is arbitrable, it is necessary to apply the rule that a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only when satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate <em>that dispute.</em>  See, <em>e.g., id., at</em> 943.  To satisfy itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue that calls into question the specific arbitration clause that a party seeks to have the court enforce.  See, <em>e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc</em>. v. <em>Jackson, ante,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x936.  Absent an agreement committing them to an arbitrator, such issues typically concern the scope and enforceability of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration clause.  In addition, such issues always include whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that agreement was formed.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In cases invoking the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gateway Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Mine Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/368/index.html">414 U. S. 368</a>, 377, courts adhere to the same framework, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.</em> v. <em>Communications Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/643/index.html">475 U. S. 643</a>, and discharge their duty to satisfy themselves that the parties agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute by (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand and (2) ordering arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted, see, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 651\xe2\x80\x93652.  Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption takes courts outside the settled framework for determining arbitrability.  This Court has never held that the presumption overrides the principle that a court may submit to arbitration \xe2\x80\x9conly those disputes \xe2\x80\xa6 the parties have agreed to submit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>First Options, supra</em>, at 943, nor that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for party agreement, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>AT&amp;T Technologies</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 648651.  The presumption should be applied only where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion (absent a provision validly committing the issue to an arbitrator) that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed, is legally enforceable, and is best construed to encompass the dispute.  See, <em>e.g., First Options</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 944\xe2\x80\x93945.  This simple framework compels reversal of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two related questions central to Local\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local wishes to arbitrate.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The parties characterize their ratification-date dispute as a formation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s terms was necessary to form the contract.  For purposes of determining arbitrability, <em>when</em> a contract is formed can be as critical as <em>whether </em>it was formed.  That is so where, as here, an agreement\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date determines its formation date, and thus determines whether its provisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute.  This formation date question requires judicial resolution here because it relates to Local\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration demand in a way that required the District Court to determine the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date in order to decide whether the parties consented to arbitrate the matters the demand covered.  The CBA requires arbitration only of disputes that \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 ratification-date dispute does not clearly fit that description.  But the Ninth Circuit credited Local\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the ratification-date dispute should be presumed arbitrable because it relates to a dispute (the no-strike dispute) that <em>does </em>clearly \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA.  The Ninth Circuit overlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification-date dispute\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrability fails if, as Local asserts, the new CBA was not formed until August 22, because in that case there was no CBA for the July no-strike dispute to \xe2\x80\x9carise under.\xe2\x80\x9d  Local attempts to address this flaw in the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning by arguing that a December 2004 document the parties executed rendered the new CBA effective as of May 1, 2004, the date the prior CBA expired.  The Court of Appeals did not rule on this claim, and this Court need not do so either because it was not raised in Local\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition to the certiorari petition.  Pp. 13\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Another reason to reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment is that the ratification-date dispute, whether labeled a formation dispute or not, falls outside the arbitration clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope on grounds the presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure.  CBA \xc2\xa720 provides, <em>inter alia,</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes arbitration.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 ratification-date dispute cannot properly be said to fall within this provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope for at least two reasons.  First, the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004\xe2\x80\x94a question concerning the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s very existence\xe2\x80\x94cannot fairly be said to \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA.  Second, even if the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x99s remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing that section\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration requirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of mandatory mediation.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion finds no support in \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x99s text.  That court\xe2\x80\x99s only effort to grapple with that text misses the point by focusing on whether Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s claim to enforce the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s <em>no-strike</em> provisions could be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement, which is not the dispositive issue here.  Pp. 17\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Local\xe2\x80\x99s remaining argument in support of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment\xe2\x80\x94that Granite Rock \xe2\x80\x9cimplicitly\xe2\x80\x9d consented to arbitration when it sued to enforce the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provisions\xe2\x80\x94is similarly unavailing.  Although it sought an injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance giving rise to it, Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sue does not establish an agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue (the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s formation date) that the company did not raise and has always rightly characterized as beyond the arbitration clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Pp. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new federal common-law cause of action under LMRA \xc2\xa7301(a) for IBT\xe2\x80\x99s alleged tortious interference with the CBA.  Though virtually all other Circuits have rejected such claims, Granite Rock argues that doing so in this case is inconsistent with federal labor law\xe2\x80\x99s goal of promoting industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement of CBAs, and with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents holding that a federal common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Textile Workers </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mills of Ala.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/index.html">353 U. S. 448</a>, 451.  The company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other potential avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims, unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims, are either unavailable or insufficient.  But Granite Rock has not yet exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide an opportunity to judge their efficacy.  Accordingly, it would be premature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even assuming \xc2\xa7301(a) authorizes this Court to do so.  That is particularly true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the union\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to delay the new CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification.  Those proceedings, and others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declining to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests.

The claims turn in part on whether a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) containing a no-strike provision was validly formed during the strike period.  The employer contends that it was, while the unions contend that it was not.  Because the CBA contains an arbitration clause, we first address whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date was a matter for the District Court or an arbitrator to resolve.  We conclude that it was a matter for judicial resolution.  Next, we address whether the Court of Appeals erred in declining the employer\xe2\x80\x99s request to recognize a new federal cause of action under \xc2\xa7301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7185(a), for the international union\xe2\x80\x99s alleged tortious interference with the CBA.  The Court of Appeals did not err in declining this request.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Granite Rock Company is a concrete and building materials company that has operated in California since 1900.  Granite Rock employs approximately 800 employees under different labor contracts with several unions, including respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 287 (Local).  Granite Rock and Local were parties to a 1999 CBA that expired in April 2004.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to negotiate a new CBA hit an impasse and, on June 9, 2004, Local members initiated a strike in support of their contract demands.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The strike continued until July 2, 2004, when the parties reached agreement on the terms of a new CBA.  The CBA contained a no-strike clause but did not directly address union members\xe2\x80\x99 liability for any strike-related damages Granite Rock may have incurred before the new CBA was negotiated but after the prior CBA had expired.  At the end of the negotiating session on the new CBA, Local\xe2\x80\x99s business representative, George Netto, approached Granite Rock about executing a separate \xe2\x80\x9cback-to-work\xe2\x80\x9d agreement that would, among other things, hold union members harmless for damages incurred during the June 2004 strike.  Netto did not make execution of such an agreement a condition of Local\xe2\x80\x99s ratification of the CBA, or of Local\xe2\x80\x99s decision to cease picketing.  Thus, Local did not have a back-to-work or hold-harmless agreement in place when it voted to ratify the CBA on July 2, 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), which had advised Local throughout the CBA negotiations and whose leadership and members supported the June strike, opposed Local\xe2\x80\x99s decision to return to work without a back-to-work agreement shielding both Local and IBT members from liability for strike-related damages.  In an effort to secure such an agreement, IBT instructed Local\xe2\x80\x99s members not to honor their agreement to return to work on July 5, and instructed Local\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to continue the work stoppage until Granite Rock agreed to hold Local and IBT members free from liability for the June strike.  Netto demanded such an agreement on July 6, but Granite Rock refused the request and informed Local that the company would view any continued strike activity as a violation of the new CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike clause.  IBT and Local responded by announcing a company-wide strike that involved numerous facilities and hundreds of workers, including members of IBT locals besides Local 287.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to Granite Rock, IBT not only instigated this strike; it supported and directed it.  IBT provided pay and benefits to union members who refused to return to work, directed Local\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations with Granite Rock, supported Local financially during the strike period with a $1.2 million loan, and represented to Granite Rock that IBT had unilateral authority to end the work stoppage in exchange for a hold-harmless agreement covering IBT members within and outside Local\xe2\x80\x99s bargaining unit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 9, 2004, Granite Rock sued IBT and Local in the District Court, seeking an injunction against the ongoing strike and strike-related damages.  Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, originally and as amended, invoked federal jurisdiction under LMRA \xc2\xa7301(a), alleged that the July 6 strike violated Local\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike provision, and asked the District Court to enjoin the strike because the hold-harmless dispute giving rise to the strike was an arbitrable grievance.  See <em>Boys Markets, Inc.</em> v. <em>Retail Clerks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/235/index.html">398 U. S. 235</a>, 237\xe2\x80\x93238, 253\xe2\x80\x93254 (1970) (holding that federal courts may enjoin a strike where a CBA contemplates arbitration of the dispute that occasions the strike).  The unions conceded that LMRA \xc2\xa7301(a) gave the District Court jurisdiction over the suit but opposed Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, asserting that the CBA was not validly ratified on July 2 (or at any other time relevant to the July 2004 strike) and, thus, its no-strike clause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s claims challenging the strike.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court initially denied Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s request to enforce the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike provision because Granite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the CBA was ratified on July 2.  App. 203\xe2\x80\x93213.  Shortly after the District Court ruled, however, a Local member testified that Netto had put the new CBA to a ratification vote on July 2, and that the voting Local members unanimously approved the agreement.  Based on this statement and supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Granite Rock moved for a new trial on its injunction and damages claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 22, while that motion was pending, Local conducted a second successful \xe2\x80\x9cratification\xe2\x80\x9d vote on the CBA, and on September 13, the day the District Court was scheduled to hear Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the unions called off their strike.  Although their return to work mooted Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s request for an injunction, the District Court proceeded with the hearing and granted Granite Rock a new trial on its damages claims.  The parties proceeded with discovery and Granite Rock amended its complaint, which already alleged federal[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] claims for breach of the CBA against both Local and IBT, to add federal inducement of breach and interference with contract (hereinafter tortious interference) claims against IBT.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IBT and Local both moved to dismiss.  Among other things, IBT argued that Granite Rock could not plead a federal tort claim under \xc2\xa7301(a) because that provision supports a federal cause of action only for breach of contract.  The District Court agreed and dismissed Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference claims.  The District Court did not, however, grant Local\xe2\x80\x99s separate motion to send the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date to arbitration.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The District Court held that whether the CBA was ratified on July 2 or August 22 was an issue for the court to decide, and submitted the question to a jury.  The jury reached a unanimous verdict that Local ratified the CBA on July 2, 2004.  The District Court entered the verdict and ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration on Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s breach-of-contract claims for strike-related damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  See 546 F.\xc2\xa03d 1169 (2008).  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference claims against IBT.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1170\xe2\x80\x931175.  But it disagreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the date of the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification was a matter for judicial resolution.  See <em>id</em>., at 1176\xe2\x80\x931178.

The language and holdings on which Local and the Court of Appeals rely cannot be divorced from the first principle that underscores all of our arbitration decisions: Arbitration is strictly \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of consent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U.

S., at 943 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Applying this principle, our precedents hold that courts should order arbitration of a dispute only where the court is satisfied that neither the formation of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement <em>nor</em> (absent a valid provision specifically committing such disputes to an arbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to the dispute is in issue.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Where a party contests either or both matters, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x9d must resolve the disagreement.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Local nonetheless interprets some of our opinions to depart from this framework and to require arbitration of certain disputes, particularly labor disputes, based on policy grounds even where evidence of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to arbitrate the dispute in question is lacking.  See Brief for Respondent Local, p.\xc2\xa016 (citing cases emphasizing the policy favoring arbitration generally and the \xe2\x80\x9cimpressive policy considerations favoring arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d in LMRA cases (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That is not a fair reading of the opinions, all of which compelled arbitration of a dispute only after the Court was persuaded that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement was validly formed and that it covered the dispute in question and was legally enforceable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>First Options</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 944\xe2\x80\x93945.  That <em>Buckeye</em> and some of our cases applying a presumption of arbitrability to certain disputes do not discuss each of these requirements merely reflects the fact that in those cases some of the requirements were so obviously satisfied that no discussion was needed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Buckeye</em>, the formation of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement was not at issue because the parties agreed that they had \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded\xe2\x80\x9d an agreement to arbitrate and memorialized it as an arbitration clause in their loan contract.  546 U. S., at 444, n.\xc2\xa01.  The arbitration clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope was also not at issue, because the provision expressly applied to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]ny claim, dispute, or controversy \xe2\x80\xa6 arising from or relating to \xe2\x80\xa6 the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agreement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 442.  The parties resisting arbitration (customers who agreed to the broad arbitration clause as a condition of using Buckeye\xe2\x80\x99s loan service) claimed only that a usurious interest provision in the loan agreement invalidated the entire contract, including the arbitration clause, and thus precluded the Court from relying on the clause as evidence of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent to arbitrate matters within its scope.  See <em>id</em>., at 443.  In rejecting this argument, we simply applied the requirement in \xc2\xa72 of the FAA that courts treat an arbitration clause as severable from the contract in which it appears and enforce it according to its terms unless the party resisting arbitration specifically challenges the enforceability of the arbitration clause itself, see <em>id</em>., at 443\xe2\x80\x93445 (citing 9 U.

They then discharge this duty by: (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand; and (2) adhering to the presumption and ordering arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted.  See <em>id.</em>, at 651\xe2\x80\x93652; <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 396\xe2\x80\x93398; <em>Gateway Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Mine Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/368/index.html"></a><a href="/us/414/368/index.html">414 U.

The presumption simply assists in resolving arbitrability disputes within that framework.  Confining the presumption to this role reflects its foundation in \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal policy favoring arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have explained, this \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d is merely an acknowledgment of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to \xe2\x80\x9coverrule the judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding refusal<em> </em>to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Volt</em>, 489 U. S., at 478 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Accordingly, we have never held that this policy overrides the principle that a court may submit to arbitration \xe2\x80\x9conly those disputes \xe2\x80\xa6 that the parties have agreed to submit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>First Options</em>, 514 U.

We have applied the presumption favoring arbitration, in FAA and in labor cases, only where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed and (absent a provision clearly and validly committing such issues to an arbitrator) is legally enforceable and best construed to encompass the dispute.  See <em>First Options</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 944\xe2\x80\x93945 (citing <em>Mitsubishi</em>, 473 U. S., at 626); <em>Howsam</em>, 537 U.

This simple framework compels reversal of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two questions central to Local\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local wishes to arbitrate.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin by addressing the grounds on which the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to decide the parties\xe2\x80\x99 ratification-date dispute, which the parties characterize as a formation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s terms was necessary to form the contract.  See App. 351.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  For purposes of determining arbitrability, <em>when</em> a contract is formed can be as critical as <em>whether </em>it was formed.  That is the case where, as here, the date on which an agreement was ratified determines the date the agreement was formed, and thus determines whether the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s provisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This formation date question requires judicial resolution here because it relates to Local\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration demand in such a way that the District Court was required to decide the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date in order to determine whether the parties consented to arbitrate the matters covered by the demand.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The parties agree that the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause pertains only to disputes that \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement.  Accordingly, to hold the parties\xe2\x80\x99 ratification-date dispute arbitrable, the Court of Appeals had to decide whether that dispute could be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA.  In answering this question in the affirmative, both Local and the Court of Appeals tied the arbitrability of the ratification-date issue\xe2\x80\x94which Local raised as a defense to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s strike claims\xe2\x80\x94to the arbitrability of the strike claims themselves.  See <em>id</em>., at 347.  They did so because the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause, which pertains only to disputes \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA and thus presupposes the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s existence, would seem plainly to cover a dispute that \xe2\x80\x9carises under\xe2\x80\x9d a specific substantive provision of the CBA, but does not so obviously cover disputes about the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s own formation.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals relied upon the ratification dispute\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Local breached the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike clause (a claim the Court of Appeals viewed as clearly \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA) to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe arbitration clause is certainly \xe2\x80\x98susceptible of an interpretation\xe2\x80\x99 that covers\xe2\x80\x9d Local\xe2\x80\x99s formation-date defense.  546 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1177, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification dispute\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrability fails if the CBA was not formed at the time the unions engaged in the acts that gave rise to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s strike claims.  The unions began their strike on July 6, 2004, and Granite Rock filed its suit on July 9.  If, as Local asserts, the CBA containing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration clause was not ratified, and thus not formed, until August 22, there was no CBA for the July no-strike dispute to \xe2\x80\x9carise under,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus no valid basis for the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s July 9 claims arose under the CBA and were thus arbitrable along with, by extension, Local\xe2\x80\x99s formation date defense to those claims.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  See <em>ibid</em>.  For the foregoing reasons, resolution of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute about whether the CBA was ratified in July or August was central to deciding Local\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration demand.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that it was not necessary for the District Court to determine the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date in order to decide whether the parties agreed to arbitrate Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike claim or the ratification-date dispute Local raised as a defense to that claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Local seeks to address this flaw in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision by arguing that in December 2004 the parties executed a document that rendered the CBA effective as of May 1, 2004 (the date the prior CBA expired), and that this effective-date language rendered the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause (but not its no-strike clause) applicable to the July strike period notwithstanding Local\xe2\x80\x99s view that the agreement was ratified in August (which ratification date Local continues to argue controls the period during which the no-strike clause applies).  See Brief for Respondent Local, pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9327; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37\xe2\x80\x9339.  The Court of Appeals did not rule on the merits of this claim (<em>i.e.</em>, it did not decide whether the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date language indeed renders some or all of the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s provisions retroactively applicable to May 2004), and we need not do so either.  Even accepting Local\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that it raised this retroactivity argument in the District Court, see Brief for Respondent Local, p.\xc2\xa026,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] Local did not raise this argument in the Court of Appeals.  Nor, more importantly, did Local\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari raise the argument as an alternative ground on which this Court could or should affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment finding the ratification-date dispute arbitrable for the reasons discussed above.

The parties\xe2\x80\x99 ratification-date dispute cannot properly be characterized as falling within the (relatively narrow, cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Drake Bakeries Inc</em>., 370 U. S., at 256\xe2\x80\x93257) scope of this provision for at least two reasons.  First, we do not think the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004\xe2\x80\x94a question that concerns the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s very existence\xe2\x80\x94can fairly be said to \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA.  Second, even if the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, Section 20\xe2\x80\x99s remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing that section\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration requirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of mandatory mediation.  See App. 434\xe2\x80\x93437 (requiring arbitration of disputes \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA, but only after the Union and Employer have exhausted mandatory mediation, and limiting any arbitration decision under this provision to those \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope and terms of\nthis agreement and \xe2\x80\xa6 specifically limited to the matter\nsubmitted\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 contrary conclusion does not find support in the text of \xc2\xa720.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 only effort to grapple with that text misses the point because it focuses on whether Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s claim to enforce the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s <em>no-strike</em> provisions could be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement.  See 546 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1177, n.\xc2\xa04.  Even assuming <em>that </em>claim can be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA, it is not the issue here.  The issue is whether the formation-date defense that Local raised in response to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike suit can be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA.  It cannot for the reasons we have explained, namely, the CBA provision requiring arbitration of disputes \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA is not fairly read to include a dispute about when the CBA came into existence.  The Court of Appeals erred in failing to address this question and holding instead that the arbitration clause is \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of an interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d that covers Local\xe2\x80\x99s formation-date defense to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s suit \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing \xe2\x80\x98under\xe2\x80\x99 the alleged new CBA\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very broadly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id.</em>, at 1178.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Local\xe2\x80\x99s remaining argument in support of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment is similarly unavailing.  Local reiterates the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Granite Rock \xe2\x80\x9cimplicitly\xe2\x80\x9d consented to arbitration when it sued to enforce the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provisions.  See Brief for Respondent Local, pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318.  We do not agree that by seeking an injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance that gave rise to it, Granite Rock also consented to arbitrate the ratification (formation) date dispute we address above.  See 564 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1178.  It is of course true that when Granite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA (and all of its provisions) as enforceable.  But Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sue for compliance with the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedures on strike-related matters does not establish an agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue (the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s formation date) that Granite Rock did not raise, and that Granite Rock has always (and rightly, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>supra</em>) characterized as beyond the scope of the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause.  The mere fact that Local raised the formation date dispute as a defense to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s suit does not make that dispute attributable to Granite Rock in the waiver or estoppel sense the Court of Appeals suggested, see 546 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1178, much less establish that Granite Rock agreed to arbitrate it by suing to enforce the CBA as to other matters.  Accordingly, we hold that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s formation date was for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve, and remand for proceedings consistent with that conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn now to the claims available on remand.  The parties agree that Granite Rock can bring a breach-of-contract claim under LMRA \xc2\xa7301(a) against Local as a CBA signatory, and against IBT as Local\xe2\x80\x99s agent or alter ego.  See Brief for Respondent IBT 10\xe2\x80\x9313; Reply Brief for Petitioner 12\xe2\x80\x9313 and n.\xc2\xa011.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The question is whether Granite Rock may also bring a federal tort claim under \xc2\xa7301(a) for IBT\xe2\x80\x99s alleged interference with the CBA.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Brief for Petitioner 32.  The Court of Appeals joined virtually all other Circuits in holding that it would not recognize such a claim under \xc2\xa7301(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granite Rock asks us to reject this position as inconsistent with federal labor law\xe2\x80\x99s goal of promoting industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement of CBAs, as well as with our precedents holding that a federal common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal.  See <em>id</em>., at 31; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Textile Workers </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mills of Ala.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/index.html"></a><a href="/us/353/448/index.html">353 U. S. 448</a>, 451 (1957).  Explaining that IBT\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in this case undermines the very core of the bargaining relationship federal labor laws exist to protect, Granite Rock argues that a federal\ncommon-law tort remedy for IBT\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is necessary because other potential avenues for deterring and redressing such conduct are either unavailable or insufficient.  See Brief for Petitioner 32\xe2\x80\x9333; Reply Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  On the unavailable side of the ledger Granite Rock lists state-law tort claims, some of which this Court has held \xc2\xa7301(a) pre-empts, as well as administrative (unfair labor practices) claims, which Granite Rock says the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot entertain against international unions that (like IBT) are not part of the certified local bargaining unit they allegedly control.  On the insufficient side of the ledger Granite Rock lists federal common-law breach-of-contract claims, which Granite Rock says are difficult to prove against non-CBA signatories like IBT because international unions structure their relationships with local unions in a way that makes agency or alter ego difficult to establish.  Based on these assessments, Granite Rock suggests that this case presents us with the choice of either recognizing the federal common-law tort claim Granite Rock seeks or sanctioning conduct inconsistent with federal labor statutes and our own precedents.  See Brief for Petitioner 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not believe the choice is as stark as Granite Rock implies.  It is of course true that we have construed \xe2\x80\x9cSection 301 [to] authoriz[e] federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Benedict Coal Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/361/459/index.html">361 U. S. 459</a>, 470 (1960) (citing <em>Lincoln Mills</em>, <em>supra</em>).  But we have also emphasized that in developing this common law we \xe2\x80\x9cdid not envision any freewheeling inquiry into what the federal courts might find to be the most desirable rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howard Johnson Co</em>. v. <em>Hotel Employees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/249/index.html">417 U. S. 249</a>, 255 (1974).  The balance federal statutes strike between employer and union relations in the collective-bargaining arena is carefully calibrated, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Drivers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/274/index.html">362 U. S. 274</a>, 289\xe2\x80\x93290 (1960), and as the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs illustrate, creating a federal common-law tort cause of action would require a host of policy choices that could easily upset this balance, see Brief for Respondent IBT 42\xe2\x80\x9344; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  It is thus no surprise that virtually all Courts of Appeals have held that federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a federal common law <em>of collective bargaining agreements</em> under section 301\xe2\x80\x9d should be confined to \xe2\x80\x9ca common law of contracts, not a source of independent rights, let alone tort rights; for section 301 is \xe2\x80\xa6 a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brazinski</em> v. <em>Amoco Petroleum Additives Co</em>., 6 F.\xc2\xa03d 1176, 1180 (CA7 1993).  We see no reason for a different result here because it would be premature to recognize the federal common law tort Granite Rock requests in this case even assuming that \xc2\xa7301(a) authorizes us to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the question before us is a narrow one.  It is not whether the conduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but whether we should augment the claims already available to Granite Rock by creating a new federal common-law cause of action under \xc2\xa7301(a).  That we decline to do so does not mean that we approve of IBT\xe2\x80\x99s alleged actions.  Granite Rock describes a course of conduct that does indeed seem to strike at the heart of the collective-bargaining process federal labor laws were designed to protect.  As the record in this case demonstrates, however, a new federal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for this conduct.  Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s allegations have prompted favorable judgments not only from a federal jury, but also from the NLRB.  In proceedings that predated those in which the District Court entered judgment for Granite Rock on the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s formation date,[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] the NLRB concluded that a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete agreement\xe2\x80\x9d was reached on July 2, and that Local and IBT violated federal labor laws by attempting to delay the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification pending execution of a separate agreement favorable to IBT.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Teamsters Local 287, </em>347 N.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0B. 339, 340\xe2\x80\x93341, and n.\xc2\xa01 (2006) (applying the remedial order on the 2004 conduct to both Local and IBT on the grounds that IBT did not disaffiliate from the AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO until July 25, 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These proceedings, and the proceedings that remain to be conducted on remand, buttress our conclusion that Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s case for a new federal common-law cause of action is based on assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief that are at least questionable because they have not been fully tested in this case and thus their efficacy is simply not before us to evaluate.  Notably, Granite Rock (like IBT and the Court of Appeals) assumes that federal common law provides the only possible basis for the type of tort claim it wishes to pursue.  See Brief for Respondent IBT 33\xe2\x80\x9334; Reply Brief for Petitioner 16.  But Granite Rock did not litigate below, and thus does not present us with occasion to address, whether state law might provide a remedy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Steelworkers</em> v. <em>Rawson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/362/index.html">495 U. S. 362</a>, 369\xe2\x80\x93371 (1990); <em>Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp.</em> v. <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/653/index.html">523 U. S. 653</a>, 656, 658 (1998).  Nor did Granite Rock fully explore the breach-of-contract and administrative causes of action it suggests are insufficient to remedy IBT\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  For example, far from establishing that an agency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccessful, the record in this case suggests it might be easier to prove than usual if, as the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s decision observes, IBT and Local were affiliated in 2004 in a way relevant to Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  See <em>In re Teamsters Local 287, supra, </em>at 340, n.\xc2\xa06.  Similarly, neither party has established that the Board itself could not issue additional relief against IBT.  IBT\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici </em>argue that the \xe2\x80\x9coverlap between Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7301 claim against the IBT and the NLRB General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unfair labor practice complaint against Local 287 brings into play the National Labor Relations Act rule that an international union commits an unfair labor practice by causing its affiliated local unions to \xe2\x80\x98impose extraneous non-bargaining unit considerations into the collective bargaining process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for American Federation of Labor et\xc2\xa0al. 30\xe2\x80\x9331 (quoting <em>Paperworkers Local 620</em>, 309 N.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0B. 44, 44 (1992)).

Local\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf</em> suggests otherwise is misplaced.  Although <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf</em> contains language that might in isolation be misconstrued as establishing a presumption that labor disputes are arbitrable whenever they are not expressly excluded from an arbitration clause, 363 U. S., at 578\xe2\x80\x93582, the opinion elsewhere emphasizes that even in LMRA cases, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts\xe2\x80\x9d must construe arbitration clauses because \xe2\x80\x9ca party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 582 (applying this rule and finding the dispute at issue arbitrable only after determining that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration clause could be construed under standard principles of contract interpretation to cover it).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our use of the same rules in FAA cases is also unsurprising.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2 reflects the fact that our adversarial system assigns both sides responsibility for framing the issues in a case.  The importance of enforcing the Rule is evident in cases where, as here, excusing a party\xe2\x80\x99s noncompliance with it would require this Court to decide, in the first instance, a question whose resolution could affect this and other cases in a manner that the District Court and Court of Appeals did not have an opportunity to consider, and that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments before this Court may not fully address.</p>\n<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the parties concede the general availability of such a claim against IBT, they dispute whether Granite Rock abandoned its agency or alter ego allegations in the course of this litigation.  Compare Brief for Respondent IBT, p. 10 with Reply Brief for Petitioner 12\xe2\x80\x9313, n. 11.  Granite Rock concedes that it has abandoned its claim that IBT acted as Local\xe2\x80\x99s undisclosed principal in orchestrating the ratification response to the July 2, 2004, CBA.  See Plaintiff Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant IBT\xe2\x80\x99s Motion to Dismiss in No. 5:04\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9302767\xe2\x80\x93JW (ND Cal., Aug. 7, 2006), Doc. 178, pp.\xc2\xa06, 8 (hereinafter Points and Authorities).  But Granite Rock insists that it preserved its argument that Local served as IBT\xe2\x80\x99s agent or alter ego when Local denied ratification and engaged in unauthorized strike activity in July 2004.  Nothing in the record before us unequivocally refutes this assertion.  See App. 306, 311\xe2\x80\x93315, 318; Points and Authorities 6, n.\xc2\xa03.  Accordingly, nothing in this opinion forecloses the parties from litigating these claims on remand.</p>\n<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0IBT argues that we should dismiss this question as improvidently granted because Granite Rock abandoned its tortious interference claim when it declared its intention to seek only contractual (as opposed to punitive) damages on the claim.  See Brief for Respondent IBT 16.  We reject this argument, which confuses Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s decision to forgo the pursuit of punitive damages on its claim with a decision to abandon the claim itself.  The two are not synonymous, and IBT cites no authority for the proposition that Granite Rock must allege more than economic damages to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the Board and federal jury reached different conclusions with respect to the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ratification date, the discrepancy has little practical significance because the Board\xe2\x80\x99s remedial order against Local and IBT gives \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive effect to the terms of the [CBA of] July 2, 2004, as if ratified on that date.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Teamsters Local 287, </em>347 N.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0B. 339, 340 (2006).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963348">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF SOTOMAYOR, J.<br/>\nGRANITE ROCK CO.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7185(a).  I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the arbitration provision in the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) between Granite Rock and IBT Local 287 does not cover the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over whether Local 287 breached the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s no-strike clause.  In my judgment, the parties clearly agreed in the CBA to have this dispute resolved by an arbitrator, not a court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legal principles that govern this case are simpler than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exposition suggests.  Arbitration, all agree, \xe2\x80\x9cis a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which [it] has not agreed so to submit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Steelworkers</em> v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav.

Before ordering parties to arbitrate, a court must therefore confirm (1) that the parties have an agreement to arbitrate and (2) that the agreement covers their dispute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9.  In determining the scope of an arbitration agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that \xe2\x80\x98[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.  Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.</em> v. <em>Communications Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/475/643/index.html">475 U.

The parties made the CBA retroactively \xe2\x80\x9ceffect[ive] from May 1, 2004,\xe2\x80\x9d the day after the expiration of their prior collective-bargaining agreement.  App. to Pet. for Cert.

Local 287 contests this claim.  Specifically, it contends that it had no duty to abide by the no-strike clause in July because it did not vote to ratify the CBA until August.  As I see it, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement as to whether the no-strike clause proscribed the July work stoppage is plainly a \xe2\x80\x9cdisput[e] arising under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA and is therefore subject to arbitration as Local 287 demands.  Indeed, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 no-strike dispute is indistinguishable from myriad other disputes that an employer and union might have concerning the interpretation and application of the substantive provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement.  These are precisely the sorts of controversies that labor arbitrators are called upon to resolve every day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seems to agree that the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision generally encompasses disputes between Granite Rock and Local 287 regarding the parties\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with the terms of the CBA, including the no-strike clause.  The majority contends, however, that Local 287\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cformation-date defense\xe2\x80\x9d raises a preliminary question of contract formation that must be resolved by a court rather than an arbitrator.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning appears to be the following: If Local 287 did not ratify the CBA until August, then there is \xe2\x80\x9cno valid basis\xe2\x80\x9d for applying the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision to events that occurred in July.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s position is flatly inconsistent with the language of the CBA.  The parties expressly chose to make the agreement effective from May 1, 2004.  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which [the] agreement was ratified\xe2\x80\x9d does not, as the majority contends, determine whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute about the permissibility of the July work stoppage falls within the scope of the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  When it comes to answering the arbitrability question, it is entirely irrelevant whether Local 287 ratified the CBA in August (as it contends) or in July (as Granite Rock contends).  In either case, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute\xe2\x80\x94which postdates May 1\xe2\x80\x94clearly \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] under\xe2\x80\x9d the CBA, which is all the arbitration provision requires to make a dispute referable to an arbitrator.  Cf. <em>Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/190/index.html">501 U. S. 190</a>, 201 (1991) (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9ca collective-bargaining agreement might be drafted so as to eliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and execution of the new agreement\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s express retroactivity, the majority errs in treating Local 287\xe2\x80\x99s ratification-date defense as a \xe2\x80\x9cformation dispute\xe2\x80\x9d subject to judicial resolution.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  The defense simply goes to the merits of Granite Rock\xe2\x80\x99s claim: Local 287 maintains that the no-strike clause should not be construed to apply to the July work stoppage because it had not ratified the CBA at the time of that action.  Cf. <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kaplan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/938/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/938/index.html">514 U.

Accordingly, the defense is necessarily a matter for the arbitrator, not the court.  See <em>AT&amp;T</em>, 475 U.

Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/363/564/index.html">363 U. S. 564</a>, 568 (1960).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the judiciary undertakes to determine the merits of a grievance under the guise of interpreting the [arbitration provisions] of collective bargaining agreements, it usurps a function \xe2\x80\xa6 entrusted to the arbitration tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 569; see also <em>AT&amp;T</em>, 475 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 16.  As a result of Local 287\xe2\x80\x99s omission, the District Court and Court of Appeals proceeded under the understanding that this case presented a formation question.  It was not until its merits brief in this Court that Local 287 attempted to correct this mistaken premise by pointing to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 execution of the December 2004 CBA with its May 2004 effective date.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s rules \xe2\x80\x9cadmonis[h] [counsel] that they have an obligation to the Court to point out in the brief in opposition [to certiorari], and not later, any perceived misstatement made in the petition [for certiorari]\xe2\x80\x9d; nonjurisdictional arguments not raised at that time \xe2\x80\x9cmay be deemed waived.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2.  Although it is regrettable and inexcusable that Local 287 did not present its argument earlier, I do not see it as one we can ignore.  The question presented in this case presupposes that \xe2\x80\x9cit is disputed whether any binding contract exists.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner i.  Because it is instead undisputed that the parties executed a binding contract in December 2004 that was effective as of May 2004, we can scarcely pretend that the parties have a formation dispute.  Consideration of this fact is \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98predicate to an intelligent resolution\xe2\x80\x99 of the question presented, and therefore \xe2\x80\x98fairly included therein.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Robinette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/33/index.html">519 U.

Indeed, by declining to consider the plain terms of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement, the majority offers little more than \xe2\x80\x9can opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aetna Life Ins.
