S. C. \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) as a debt resulting from fraud. The Bankruptcy Court found that Mans\'s letters constituted false representations, but followed Circuit precedent in requiring that the Fields show their reasonable reliance on the letters. Finding the Fields unreasonable in relying without further enquiry on Mans\'s misrepresentations, the court held Mans\'s debt dischargeable. The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p><p><i>Held: </i>The standard for excepting a debt from discharge as a fraudulent representation within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) is not reasonable reliance but the less demanding one of justifiable reliance on the representation. Pp.64-77.</p><p>(a) Section 523(a)(2)(A) had an antecedent in the 1903 amendments to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and has changed only slightly since 1903, from "false pretenses or false representations" to "false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\'s or an insider\'s financial condition." Section 523(a)(2)(B), which applies to false financial statements in writing, also grew out of a 1903 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, but it changed more significantly over the years. One of these changes occurred in 1978, when Congress added a new element of reasonable reliance. Pp. 64-66.</p><p>(b) The text of \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) does not mention the level of reliance required, and the Court rejects as unsound the argument that the addition of reasonable reliance to \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) alone supports an inference that, in \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A), Congress did not intend to require reasonable reliance. That argument relies on the apparent negative pregnant, under the rule of construction that an express statutory requirement in one place, contrasted with statutory silence in another, shows an intent</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="60">60</a></p><p>Syllabus</p><p>to confine the requirement to the specified instance. Assuming this argument to be sound, it would prove at most that the reasonableness standard was not intended, but would not reveal the correct standard. Here, however, there is reason to reject the negative pregnant argument even as far as it goes. If the argument proves anything here, it proves too much: this reasoning would also strip \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) of any requirement to establish causation and scienter, an odd result that defies common sense. Moreover, the argument ignores the fact that \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) refers to common-law torts and \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) does not. The terms used in paragraph (A) imply elements that the common law has defined them to include, whereas the terms in paragraph (B) are statutory creations. Pp. 66-69.</p><p>(c) This Court has an established practice of finding Congress\'s meaning in the generally shared common law where, as here, common-law terms are used without further specification. Since the District Court treated Mans\'s conduct as amounting to fraud, the enquiry here is into the common-law understanding of "actual fraud" in 1978, when it was added to \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A). The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that justifiable, rather than reasonable, reliance is the applicable standard. The Restatement rejects a general, reasonable person standard in favor of an individual standard that turns on the particular circumstances, and it provides that a person is justified in relying on a factual representation without conducting an investigation, so long as the falsity of the representation would not be patent upon cursory examination. Scholarly treatises on torts, as well as state cases, similarly applied a justifiable reliance standard. The foregoing analysis does not relegate the negative pregnant to the rubbish heap, but merely indicates that its force is weakest when it suggests foolish results at odds with other textual pointers. The Court\'s reading also does not leave reasonableness irrelevant, for the greater the distance between the reliance claimed and the limits of the reasonable, the greater the doubt about reliance in fact. Pp. 69-76.</p><p>(d) It may be asked whether it makes sense to protect creditors who were not quite reasonable in relying on a fraudulent representation, but to apply a different rule when fraud is carried to the point of a written financial statement.

In this case we consider the level of a creditor\'s reliance on a fraudulent misrepresentation necessary to place a debt thus beyond release. While the Court of Appeals followed a rule requiring reasonable reliance on the statement, we hold the standard to be the less demanding one of justifiable reliance and accordingly vacate and remand.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>In June 1987, petitioners William and Norinne Field sold real estate for $462,500 to a corporation controlled by respondent Philip W. Mans, who supplied $275,000 toward the purchase price and personally guaranteed a promissory note for $187,500 secured by a second mortgage on the property. The mortgage deed had a clause calling for the Fields\' con-</p><p><i>*Gary Klein </i>filed a brief for the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys for the United States as <i>amicus curiae </i>urging affirmance.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="62">62</a></p><p>sent to any conveyance of the encumbered real estate during the term of the secured indebtedness, failing which the entire unpaid balance on the note would become payable upon a sale unauthorized.</p><p>On October 8, 1987, Mans\'s corporation triggered application of the clause by conveying the property to a newly formed partnership without the Fields\' knowledge or consent. The next day, Mans wrote to the Fields asking them not for consent to the conveyance but for a waiver of their rights under the due-on-sale clause, saying that he sought to avoid any claim that the clause might apply to arrangements to add a new principal to his land development organization. The letter failed to mention that Mans had already caused the property to be conveyed. The Fields responded with an offer to waive if Mans paid them $10,500. Mans answered with a lower bid, to pay only $500, and again failed to disclose the conveyance. There were no further written communications.</p><p>The ensuing years brought a precipitous drop in real estate prices, and on December 10, 1990, Mans petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Hampshire for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On the following February 6, the Fields learned of the October 1987 conveyance, which their lawyer had discovered at the registry of deeds. In their subsequent complaint in the bankruptcy proceeding, they argued that some $150,000 had become due upon the 1987 conveyance for which Mans had become liable as guarantor, and that his obligation should be excepted from discharge under \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A), as a debt resulting from fraud.1</p><p>The Bankruptcy Court found that Mans\'s letters constituted false representations on which petitioners had relied</p><p>1 Although we observe the distinction between Mans and his corporations, the record before us does not indicate that the parties thought anything should turn on treating them separately.

App. 43-44. The court held that a reasonable person would have checked for any conveyance after the exchange of letters, and that the Fields had unreasonably ignored further reason to investigate in 1988, when Mr. Field\'s boss told him of a third party claiming to be the owner of the property.3 Having found the Fields unreasonable in relying without further enquiry on Mans\'s implicit misrepresentation about the state of the title, the court held Mans\'s debt dischargeable.</p><p>The District Court affirmed, likewise following Circuit precedent in holding that \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) requires reasonable reliance to exempt a debt from discharge, and finding the Bankruptcy Court\'s judgment supported by adequate indication in the record that the Fields had relied without sufficient reason.

S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 727, 1141, 1228, and 1328(b), are subject to exception under 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 523(a), which carries 16 subsections setting out categories of nondischargeable debts. Two of these are debts traceable to falsity or fraud or to a materially false financial statement, as set out in \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2):</p><blockquote><p>\n"(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(2) for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(A) false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\'s or an insider\'s financial condition; [or]</p></blockquote><p>"(B) use of a statement in writing-</p><p>"(i) that is materially false;</p><blockquote><p>\n"(ii) respecting the debtor\'s or an insider\'s financial condition;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(iii) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable for such money, property, services, or credit reasonably relied; and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(iv) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive."</p></blockquote><p>These provisions were not innovations in their most recent codification, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (Act), Pub. L. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2590, but had obvious antecedents in the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (1898 Act), as amended, 30 Stat. 544. The precursor to \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) was created when \xc2\xa7 17(a)(2) of the 1898 Act was modified by an amendment in 1903, which provided that debts that were "liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations" would not be affected by any discharge granted to a bankrupt, who</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="65">65</a></p><p>would still be required to pay them. Act of Feb. 5, 1903, ch. 487, 32 Stat. 798. This language inserted in \xc2\xa7 17(a)(2) was changed only slightly between 1903 and 1978,5 at which time the section was recodified as \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) and amended to read as quoted above. Thus, since 1903 the statutory language at issue here merely progressed from "false pretenses or false representations" to "false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\'s or an insider\'s financial condition."</p><p>Section 523(a)(2)(B), however, is the product of more active evolution. The germ of its presently relevant language was also inserted into the 1898 Act by a 1903 amendment, which barred any discharge by a bankrupt who obtained property by use of a materially false statement in writing made for the purpose of obtaining the credit. Act of Feb. 5, 1903, ch. 487, 32 Stat. 797-798. The provision did not explicitly require an intent to deceive or set any level of reliance, but Congress modified its language in 1960 by adding the requirements that the debtor intend to deceive the creditor and that the creditor rely on the false statement, and by limiting its application to false financial statements. Act of July 12, 1960, Pub. L. 86-621, 74 Stat. 409.6 In 1978, Con-</p><p>5 The one intervening change to the quoted language was that "obtaining property" became "obtaining money or property." Act of June 22, 1938, 52 Stat. 851.</p><p>6 The 1960 amendments also transferred the language on false financial statements by individuals from \xc2\xa7 14 (where it barred any discharge) to \xc2\xa7 17(a)(2) (where it barred discharge of only the specific debt incurred as a result of the false financial statement). Thus, as of 1960 the relevant portion of \xc2\xa7 17(a)(2) provided that discharge would not release a bankrupt from debts that</p><p>"are liabilities for obtaining money or property by false pretenses or false representations, or for obtaining money or property on credit or obtaining an extension or renewal of credit in reliance upon a materially false statement in writing respecting [the bankrupt\'s] financial condition made or published or caused to be made or published in any manner whatsoever with intent to deceive." Act of July 12, 1960, Pub. L. 86-621, 74 Stat. 409.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="66">66</a></p><p>gress rewrote the provision as set out above and recodified it as \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B). Though the forms of the 1960 and 1978 provisions are quite different, the only distinction relevant here is that the 1978 version added a new element of reasonable reliance.</p><p>The sum of all this history is two close statutory companions barring discharge. One applies expressly when the debt follows a transfer of value or extension of credit induced by falsity or fraud (not going to financial condition), the other when the debt follows a transfer or extension induced by a materially false and intentionally deceptive written statement of financial condition upon which the creditor reasonably relied.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>The question here is what, if any, level of justification a creditor needs to show above mere reliance in fact in order to exempt the debt from discharge under \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A). The text that we have just reviewed does not say in so many words. While \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) speaks of debt for value "obtained by ... false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud," it does not define those terms or so much as mention the creditor\'s reliance as such, let alone the level of reliance required. No one, of course, doubts that some degree of reliance is required to satisfy the element of causation inherent in the phrase "obtained by," but the Government, as <i>amicus curiae </i>(like petitioners in a portion of their brief), submits that the minimum level will do. It argues that when \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) is understood in its statutory context, it requires mere reliance in fact, not reliance that is reasonable under the circumstances. Both petitioners and the Government note that \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) expressly requires reasonable reliance, while \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) does not. They emphasize that the precursors to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) and (B) lacked any reasonableness requirement, and that Congress added an element of reasonable reliance to \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) in 1978, but not to \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A). They contend that the addition to \xc2\xa7 523(a)</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="67">67</a></p><p>(2)(B) alone supports an inference that, in \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A), Congress did not intend to require reasonable reliance, over and above actual reliance. But this argument is unsound.</p><p>The argument relies on the apparent negative pregnant, under the rule of construction that an express statutory requirement here, contrasted with statutory silence there, shows an intent to confine the requirement to the specified instance. See <i>Gozlon-Peretz </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/395/case.html">498 U. S. 395</a>, 404 (1991) (" \'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\'\'\') (quoting <i>Russello </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/case.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983)). Thus the failure of \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) to require the reasonableness of reliance demanded by \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) shows that (A) lacks such a requirement. Without more, the inference might be a helpful one. But there is more here, showing why the negative pregnant argument should not be elevated to the level of interpretive trump card.</p><p>First, assuming the argument to be sound, the most it would prove is that the reasonableness standard was not intended. But our job does not end with rejecting reasonableness as the standard. We have to discover the correct standard, and where there are multiple contenders remaining (as there are here), the inference from the negative pregnant does not finish the job.</p><p>There is, however, a more fundamental objection to depending on a negative pregnant argument here, for in the present circumstances there is reason to reject its soundness even as far as it goes. Quite simply, if it proves anything here, it proves too much. If the negative pregnant is the reason that \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) has no reasonableness requirement, then the same reasoning will strip paragraph (A) of any requirement to establish a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the transfer of value or extension of credit, and it will eliminate scienter from the very notion</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="68">68</a></p><p>of fraud. Section 523(a)(2)(B) expressly requires not only reasonable reliance but also reliance itself; and not only a representation but also one that is material; and not only one that is material but also one that is meant to deceive. Section 523(a)(2)(A) speaks in the language neither of reliance nor of materiality nor of intentionality. If the contrast is enough to preclude a reasonableness requirement, it will do as well to show that the debtor need not have misrepresented intentionally, the statement need not have been material, and the creditor need not have relied. But common sense would balk. 7 If Congress really had wished to bar discharge to a debtor who made unintentional and wholly immaterial misrepresentations having no effect on a creditor\'s decision, it could have provided that. It would, however, take a very clear provision to convince anyone of anything so odd, and nothing so odd has ever been apparent to the courts that have previously construed this statute, routinely requiring intent, reliance, and materiality before applying \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A). See, <i>e. g., In re Phillips, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/804/930/">804 F.2d 930</a> (CA6 1986); <i>In re Martin, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/963/809/">963 F.2d 809</a> (CA5 1992); <i>In re Menna, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/16/7/">16 F.3d 7</a> (CA1 1994).</p><p>The attempt to draw an inference from the inclusion of reasonable reliance in \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B), moreover, ignores the significance of a historically persistent textual difference be-</p><p>7 The fact that \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2) uses the term "obtained by" does not avoid this problem, for two reasons. First, "obtained by" applies to both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) and (B); if it supplies the elements of materiality, intent to deceive, and actual reliance it renders \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B)\'s inclusion of materiality and intent to deceive redundant. More to the point, it renders Congress\'s addition of the requirements of actual reliance and intent to deceive to the precursor of \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) (\xc2\xa7 17(a)(2) of the 1898 Act) in 1960 nonsensical, since that provision also had the "obtained by" language. Second, it seems impossible to construe "obtained by" as encompassing a requirement of intent to deceive; one can obtain credit by a misrepresentation even if one has no intention of doing so (for example, by unintentionally writing that one has an annual income of $100,000, rather than $10,000, in applying for a loan).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="69">69</a></p><p>tween the substantive terms in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) and (B): the former refer to common-law torts, and the latter do not. The principal phrase in the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) was "obtained property ... upon a materially false statement in writing," Act of Feb. 5, 1903, ch. 487, 32 Stat. 797; in the current \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(B) it is value "obtained by ... use of a statement in writing." Neither phrase is apparently traceable to another context where it might have been construed to include elements that need not be set out separately. If other elements are to be added to "statement in writing," the statutory language must add them (and of course it would need to add them to keep this exception to dischargeability from swallowing most of the rule). The operative terms in \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A), on the other hand, "false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud," carry the acquired meaning of terms of art. They are common-law terms, and, as we will shortly see in the case of "actual fraud," which concerns us here, they imply elements that the common law has defined them to include. See <i>Durland </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/306/case.html">161 U.

The section on point dealing with fraudulent misrepresentation states that both actual and "justifiable" reliance are required. <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 537. The Restatement expounds upon justifiable reliance by explaining that a person is justified in relying on a representation of fact "although he might have ascertained the falsity of the representation had he made an investigation." <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 540. Significantly for our purposes, the illustration is given of a seller of land who says it is free of encumbrances; according to the Restatement, a buyer\'s reliance on this factual representation is justifiable, even if he could have "walk[ed] across the street to the office of the register of deeds in the courthouse" and easily have learned of an unsatisfied mortgage. <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 540, Illustration 1. The point is otherwise made in a later section noting that contributory negligence is no bar to recovery because fraudulent misrepresentation is an intentional tort.

As a comment to \xc2\xa7 541 explains, a person is</p><blockquote><p>\n"required to use his senses, and cannot recover if he blindly relies upon a misrepresentation the falsity of which would be patent to him if he had utilized his opportunity to make a cursory examination or investigation. Thus, if one induces another to buy a horse by representing it to be sound, the purchaser cannot recover even though the horse has but one eye, if the horse is shown to the purchaser before he buys it and the slightest inspection would have disclosed the defect. On the other hand, the rule stated in this Section applies only when the recipient of the misrepresentation is capable of appreciating its falsity at the time by the use of his senses. Thus a defect that any experienced horseman would at once recognize at first glance may not be patent to a person who has had no experience with horses." <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 541, Comment <i>a.</i></p></blockquote><p>A missing eye in a "sound" horse is one thing; long teeth in a "young" one, perhaps, another.</p><p>Similarly, the edition of Prosser\'s Law of Torts available in 1978 (as well as its current successor) states that justifiable reliance is the standard applicable to a victim\'s conduct in cases of alleged misrepresentation and that "[i]t is only where, under the circumstances, the facts should be apparent to one of his knowledge and intelligence from a cursory glance, or he has discovered something which should serve as a warning that he is being deceived, that he is required to make an investigation of his own."

The subjectiveness of justifiability cuts both ways, and reasonableness goes to the probability of actual reliance.</p><p align="center">\nv</p><p>There remains a fair question that ought to be faced. It makes sense to protect a creditor even if he was not quite reasonable in relying on a fraudulent representation; fraudulence weakens the debtor\'s claim to consideration. And yet, why should the rule be different when fraud is carried to the point of a written financial statement? Does it not count against our reading of the statute that a debtor who makes a misrepresentation with the formality of a written financial statement may have less to bear than the debtor who commits his fraud by a statement, perhaps oral, about something other than his bank balance? One could answer that the question does have its force, but counter it by returning to the statutory history and asking why Congress failed to place a requirement of reasonable reliance in \xc2\xa7 523(a)(2)(A) if it meant all debtors to be in the same boat. But there may be a better answer, tied to the peculiar potential of financial statements to be misused not just by debtors, but by creditors who know their bankruptcy law. The House Report on the Act suggests that Congress wanted to moderate the burden on individuals who submitted false financial statements, not because lies about financial condition are less blameworthy than others, but because the relative equities might be affected by practices of consumer finance companies, which sometimes have encouraged such falsity by their borrowers</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="77">77</a></p><p>for the very purpose of insulating their own claims from discharge. 13 The answer softens the ostensible anomaly.</p><p align="center">\nVI</p><p>In this case, the Bankruptcy Court applied a reasonable person test entailing a duty to investigate. The court stated that</p><blockquote><p>\n"the case law establishes an objective test, and that is what would be reasonable for a prudent man to do under those circumstances.

And the answer would have to be yes, and then the next question would be, well, let\'s see if he\'s done it? And those questions simply were not asked, and I don\'t think on balance that was reasonable reliance."

While the consumer finance companies use these statements in evaluating the credit risk, very often the statements are used as a basis for a false financial statement exception to discharge. The forms that the applicant fills out often have too little space for a complete list of debts. Frequently, a loan applicant is instructed by a loan officer to list only a few or only the most important of his debts. Then, at the bottom of the form, the phrase \'I have no other debts\' is either printed on the form, or the applicant is instructed to write the phrase in his own handwriting." H. R. Rep.

Mans ultimately urges that the promissory note to the Fields is, in any event, a dischargeable debt because it was not "obtained by" the allegedly fraudulent letters Mans\'s attorney wrote to the Fields\' attorney months <i>after </i>the debt was incurred. The Fields maintain that they relied on the letters to their detriment, in effect according Mans an extension of credit instead of invoking the due-on-sale clause.</p><p>Mans prevailed on the reliance issue before the bankruptcy, district, and appellate courts on the basis of thengoverning Circuit precedent.

With the Circuit law on reliance solidly in his favor, Mans understandably did not advance in the lower courts the argument that the debt was not "obtained by" fraud. When the "reliance must be reasonable" rule solid in the Circuit was challenged in this Court, however, Mans raised the causation point as an alternate justification for the judgment in his favor. See Brief for Respondent 32-33 (argument heading V. reads: "Since the credit here was not \'obtained by\' the alleged fraud, petitioners have failed to meet the [causation] requirement of 523(a)(2)(A)"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 ("[U]nder the clear language of the statute, there</p><p>terminology right below and having no real prospect of anything but needless expense even if there is a remand.

See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 108, pp. 749-753 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser &amp; Keeton). And, I agree that the Bankruptcy Court used the wrong words when it described the "reliance" standard as "an objective test" that asks "what would be reasonable for a prudent man to do under [the] circumstances." App. 43-44. I disagree, however, with the Court\'s result in this case.</p><p>First, the Bankruptcy Court, while using the wrong words, did the right thing. That court essentially found that in mid-1987, Mr. Field and his wife sold their inn for about $500,000 to Mr. Mans, a developer. To secure the $187,000 that Mans still owed them, the Fields kept a mortgage, which had a term that accelerated the debt should Mans transfer the property to anyone else without their permission. A few months later, Mans wrote to the Fields saying that he wanted to transfer the inn to a development partnership which Mans had formed with a new partner, Mr. De Felice. Mans observed that because the Fields had transferred the inn to a corporation, the stock of which was wholly owned by Mans, Mans could effectively accomplish the transfer to the new partnership by simply conveying the stock of the holding company to the partnership, thereby avoiding the "debt acceleration" clause. But, Mans said, he would prefer to transfer the inn outright, and therefore was seeking their permission to do so without accelerating the debt. The Fields did not give permission. Mans transferred the inn anyway. Nothing more was heard of the matter until 1991, when real estate values fell, Mans went bankrupt, and the Fields brought this lawsuit in an effort to prevent the $150,000 they were then owed from disappearing in the bankruptcy.</p><p>The Bankruptcy Judge found that Mans\' mid-1987 letters implied that he had not <i>yet </i>transferred the inn to the partnership as of the time he wrote the letters. But this impli-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="81">81</a></p><p>cation was false, for Mans had transferred the inn at least a few days earlier. Still, the Bankruptcy Court asked whether that false implication had made any difference, i. <i>e., </i>whether the Fields, during the next few years, had relied upon this false implication in not accelerating the debt (and obtaining their money before Mans\' bankruptcy). The judge very much doubted any <i>actual </i>reliance. But, in any event, Mr. Field had visited the property fairly regularly to check on the progress of the development, he had seen Mans there fairly often, and he had been told that De Felice had been on the premises, claiming to be "the new owner." And, that being so, the judge held that at some point over the course of the next 31/2 years-during which time Mr. Field was "accepting mortgage payments and looking at drawings and discussing the project with Mans"-Mr. Field <i>should simply have asked </i>Mans, "What\'s the deal here? Who owns this thing?" <i>Id., </i>at 42-43. (Or, the Fields could "have simply checked the title in the ... County Registry of Deeds which Mr. Field has demonstrated he knows very well is up in North Haverhill." <i>Id., </i>at 42.)</p><p>To hold this <i>is, </i>in my view, to apply the commentators\' "justifiable reliance" standard. The court focused upon the individual circumstances and capacity of the plaintiff, Mr. Field. See Prosser &amp; Keeton \xc2\xa7 108, at 751. The court found that Mr. Field should have looked into the matter, not because of any general "duty to investigate," but because, in the particular circumstances, he "discovered something which should serve as a warning that he [was] being deceived." <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 108, at 752. That is, the court did not use the "objective" test as an improper search for "contributory negligence"-i. <i>e., </i>to deny recovery to one also at fault for failing to exercise "the care of a reasonably prudent person for his own protection." <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 108, at 750. Rather, the court viewed the failure to investigate, in light of the clear warnings of deception, as a means of testing whether there was "some objective corroboration to plaintiff\'s claim that</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="82">82</a></p><p>he did rely," a primary purpose of the "justifiable reliance" requirement. See <i>id., </i>\xc2\xa7 108, at 750-751.</p><p>Second, the Bankruptcy Court\'s use of what turned out to be the wrong words ("reasonable" and "prudent man" rather than "justifiable") is not grounds for reversal, for no one brought the "correct" terminology to the lower courts\' attention. The Fields did not argue in the Bankruptcy Court, or in their briefs to the District Court or the Court of Appeals, or in their petition for certiorari, that there was any difference between "reasonable reliance" and "justifiable reliance." To the contrary, the Fields took the view (which the Court now unanimously rejects) that <i>actual </i>reliance alonewhether or not it meets <i>any </i>objective standard-is sufficient for recovery. Indeed, it appears that the Fields did not even mention the word "justifiable" below, but, rather, used the term "reasonable" throughout to refer to any kind of objective standard. The first time the word "justifiable" appears in this case seems to be in the Fields\' brief on the merits in this Court where they point to the Restatement\'s use of the term "justifiable," Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7 540 (1976), and argue that "[j]ustifiable reliance does <i>not </i>require that the recipient of misrepresentation investigate the underlying assertion." Brief for Petitioners 20 (emphasis in original). But see Prosser &amp; Keeton \xc2\xa7 108, at 752.</p><p>Third, the "correct" terminology would not have appeared obvious to a judge, certainly not to a judge who was not a special expert in the common law of misrepresentation. Prior case law was not neat in its use of the terminology. The commentaries do not refer to the old prudent person standard as a "reasonable reliance" standard, but, instead, distinguish between the "justifiable reliance" standard as it has been understood in cases now disapproved, and the "justifiable reliance" standard as it is applied in most modern cases. See <i>id., </i>\xc2\xa7 108; 2 F. Harper, F. James, &amp; O. Gray, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 7.12, pp. 455-464 (2d ed. 1986). Indeed, the majority\'s footnotes distinguish between cases in which a court (1)</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="83">83</a></p><p>used a "prudent person" standard or imposed a general duty to investigate, and (2) used a plaintiff-specific standard while disavowing a general duty to investigate. <i>Ante, </i>at 72-75, nn. 10-12. But, courts in the first category did not always use the words "reasonable reliance" to describe their standard. See, <i>e. g., Horner </i>v. <i>Ahern, </i>207 Va. 860, 863-864, 153 S. E. 2d 216, 219 (1967). Indeed, sometimes they used the word "justifiable." See, <i>e. g., Cudemo </i>v. <i>Al </i>&amp; <i>Lou Construction Co., </i>54 App. Div. 2d 995, 996, 387 N. Y. S. 2d 929, 930 (1976). Nor did courts in the second category always use the words "justifiable reliance" to describe their standard. See, <i>e. g., Barnes </i>v. <i>Lopez, </i>25 Ariz. App. 477, 480, 544 P. 2d 694, 697 (1976). Indeed, sometimes they used the words "reasonable reliance." See, <i>e. g., Johnson </i>v. <i>Owens, </i>263 N. C. 754, 758-759, 140 S. E. 2d 311, 314 (1965). The relevant historical controversy in the law of fraud has focused not so much on labels as on the nature of the duty to investigate <i>(e. </i>g., whether the duty is applicable normally or only in special, suspicious circumstances) and on the extent to which the law looks to the circumstances and capacities of a particular plaintiff. See Prosser &amp; Keeton \xc2\xa7 108. The Bankruptcy Court, as I have just pointed out, followed modern fraud law in both respects.</p><p>Fourth, while I understand that sometimes this Court might appropriately announce a legal standard and remand the case to the lower courts for application of the chosen standard, I do not agree that it should do so here. The record below is brief (87 pages of transcript plus exhibits). The Bankruptcy Judge\'s findings are reasonably clear. And, further litigation is expensive. Mr. Mans is bankrupt, representing himself until this Court appointed a lawyer for him; the Fields are not wealthy and should not be encouraged to pursue what is, in my view, the impossible dream of eventually recovering the $150,000 (minus legal fees). And, the example this Court sets by not looking more closely into the details of the case is not a happy one-particularly if it sug-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="84">84</a></p><p>gests that appellate courts can, or should, insist that lower courts use commentator-approved technical terminology when the parties have not argued for its use and when that use seems most unlikely to have made any difference. Doing so simply generates unnecessary appeals, creating additional delay and expense in a system that could use less of both.</p><p>For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
