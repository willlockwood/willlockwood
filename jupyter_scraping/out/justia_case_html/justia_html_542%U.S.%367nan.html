UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, et al. <em>v.</em> UNITED STATES DISTRICT \nCOURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA et al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93475. Argued April 27, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 24, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The President established the National Energy Policy Development Group (Group) to give him advice and make recommendations on energy policy, assigning a number of federal agency heads and assistants to serve as Group members and authorizing the Vice President, as Group chairman, to include other federal officers as appropriate.  After the Group issued a final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations, respondents filed these separate actions, later consolidated in the District Court, alleging that the Group had not complied with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which, <em>inter alia</em>, imposes a variety of open-meeting and disclosure requirements on entities meeting the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory committee.\xe2\x80\x9d  As relevant here, such a committee is an entity or \xe2\x80\x9csubgroup \xe2\x80\xa6 , which is \xe2\x80\xa6 established or utilized by the President, \xe2\x80\xa6 exclud[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 any committee \xe2\x80\xa6 composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, [federal] officers or employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa72(B)(i).  The complaint alleged that, because nonfederal employees and private lobbyists regularly attended and fully participated in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s nonpublic meetings as <em>de facto</em> Group members, the Group could not benefit from the \xc2\xa72(B) exemption and was therefore subject to FACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The suit sought declaratory relief and an injunction requiring the defendants\xe2\x80\x94including the Vice President and the Government officials serving on the Group\xe2\x80\x94to produce all materials allegedly subject to FACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among its rulings, the District Court granted the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss as to some of them, but denied it as to others.  The Court held that FACA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive requirements could be enforced against the Vice President and the other Government participants under the Mandamus Act, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71361, and against the agency defendants under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706.  It deferred ruling on whether the FACA disclosure duty was sufficiently clear and nondiscretionary for mandamus to issue.  It also deferred ruling on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that to disregard the \xc2\xa72(B) exemption and apply FACA to the Group would violate separation-of-powers principles and interfere with the President\xe2\x80\x99s and Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional prerogatives.  Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a \xe2\x80\x9ctightly-reined\xe2\x80\x9d discovery to ascertain the Group\xe2\x80\x99s structure and membership, and thus to determine whether the <em>de facto</em> membership doctrine applied.  While acknowledging that discovery itself might raise serious constitutional questions, the court explained that the Government could assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materials from disclosure.  The court noted that if, after discovery, respondents had no evidentiary support for their allegations about <em>de facto</em> members in the Group, the Government could prevail on statutory grounds.  Even were it appropriate to address constitutional issues, the court explained, its discovery orders would provide the factual development necessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusion into the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority.  The court then ordered respondents to submit a discovery plan, approved that plan in due course, entered orders allowing discovery to proceed, and denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion for certification under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71292(b) with respect to the discovery orders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals to vacate the discovery orders and for other relief, but the court dismissed the mandamus petition on the ground that alternative avenues of relief remained available.  Citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/index.html">418 U. S. 683</a>, the court held that petitioners, in order to guard against intrusion into the President\xe2\x80\x99s prerogatives, must first assert executive privilege with particularity in the District Court.  If the lower court sustained the privilege, the appeals court observed, petitioners would be able to obtain all the relief they sought; but if the District Court rejected the claim, mandamus might well be appropriate.  So long as the separation-of-powers conflict remained hypothetical, the court held, it had no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.  Although acknowledging that the scope of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 discovery requests was overly broad, the appeals court nonetheless agreed with the District Court that petitioners should bear the burden of invoking executive privilege and of objecting to the discovery orders with detailed precision.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 preliminary argument that the mandamus petition was jurisdictionally out of time is rejected.  Respondents assert that, because the Government\xe2\x80\x99s basic argument was one of discovery immunity\xe2\x80\x94i.e.,</em> it need not invoke executive privilege or make particular objections to the discovery requests\xe2\x80\x94the mandamus petition should have been filed within 60 days after the District Court denied the motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B).  On this theory, the last day for any filing in the appeals court was September 9, 2002, whereas the mandamus petition and notice of appeal were not filed until November 7.  However, Rule 4(a), by its plain terms, applies only to the filing of a notice of appeal.  It is inapplicable to the mandamus petition under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S.nbsp;C. \xc2\xa71651.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 alternative argument that the mandamus petition was barred by the equitable doctrine of laches also fails.  Laches might be a bar where the petitioner slept on his rights and especially if the delay was prejudicial.  <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>County of Douglas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/348/index.html">107 U. S. 348</a>, 355.  Here, however, the flurry of motions the Government filed after the District Court denied the dismissal motion overcomes respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument.  Nor does the Court accept their argument that laches should apply because those Government motions amounted to little more than dilatory tactics.  Given the drastic nature of mandamus and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings that the writ may not issue while alternative avenues of relief remain available, the Government cannot be faulted for attempting to resolve the dispute through less drastic means.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred in concluding it lacked authority to issue mandamus because the Government could protect its rights by asserting executive privilege in the District Court.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Mandamus is a \xe2\x80\x9cdrastic and extraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d remedy \xe2\x80\x9creserved for really extraordinary causes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Fahey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/258/index.html">332 U. S. 258</a>, 259\xe2\x80\x93260.  While the conditions for obtaining it may be demanding, they are not insuperable.  This Court has issued mandamus to, <em>inter alia</em>, restrain a lower court whose actions would threaten the separation of powers by embarrassing the Executive Branch.  <em>Ex parte Peru,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/index.html">318 U. S. 578</a>, 588.  Were the Vice President not a party, the argument that the Court of Appeals should have entertained a mandamus action might present different considerations.  Here, however, the Vice President and his Group comembers are the subjects of the discovery orders.  The mandamus petition alleges that the orders threaten substantial intrusions on the process by which those closest to the President advise him.  These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable, through mandamus or otherwise.  A President\xe2\x80\x99s communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any ordinary individual.  <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U. S., at 715.  While the President is not above the law, the Judiciary must afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest possible protection<em>, ibid.,</em> recognizing the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties.  These separation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President.  Accepted mandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court to prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branch\xe2\x80\x99s ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities.  See <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 587.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals labored under the mistaken assumption that the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s separation-of-powers objections.  In its view, the requirement that the Vice President and his Group colleagues bear the burden of invoking executive privilege with narrow specificity and objecting to the discovery requests with detailed precision was mandated by <em>Nixon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d 418 U. S., at 706.  The appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis overlooks fundamental differences between this case and <em>Nixon,</em> which cannot bear the weight the court put on it.  Unlike this case, which concerns requests for information for use in a civil suit, <em>Nixon</em> involved the proper balance between the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the confidentiality of its communications and the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 713.  The distinction between criminal and civil proceedings is not just a matter of formalism in this context.  The right to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings does not have the same \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d as it does in the criminal context.  <em>Id.</em>, at 711.  Withholding necessary materials in an ongoing criminal case constitutes an impermissible impairment of another branch\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cessential functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 711.  Withholding the information in this case does not hamper such \xe2\x80\x9cessential functions\xe2\x80\x9d in quite the same way.  The District Court ordered discovery here, not to remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertain whether FACA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements apply to the Group at all.  This situation cannot, in fairness, be compared to <em>Nixon</em>, where a court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to resolve cases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinged on the availability of certain indispensable information.  Another important factor here is the burden imposed by the discovery orders.  This is not a routine discovery dispute.  The discovery requests are directed to the Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on the Group to give advice and make recommendations to the President.  Special considerations control when the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s interests in maintaining its autonomy and safeguarding its communications\xe2\x80\x99 confidentiality are implicated.  See, e.g., <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/681/index.html">520 U. S. 681</a>, 707.  Even when compared against <em>Nixon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s criminal subpoenas involving the President, the civil discovery here militates against respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position.  There are no checks in civil discovery analogous to the constraints imposed in the criminal justice system to filter out insubstantial legal claims.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions and private attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 obligation of candor to the judicial tribunal have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the Executive Branch.  Finally, the narrowly tailored subpoena orders in <em>Nixon,</em> which \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely identified\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspecific[ally] \xe2\x80\xa6 enumerated\xe2\x80\x9d  the relevant materials, 418 U. S., at 688, and n.\xc2\xa05, stand in marked contrast to the overly broad discovery requests approved by the District Court.  Given that disparity, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents provide no support for the appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the Executive Branch bear the burden of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making particularized objections.  Indeed, those precedents suggest just the opposite.  See, <em>e.g., Clinton, supra, </em>at 705.  Contrary to their conclusions, <em>Nixon </em>did not leave the lower courts the sole option of inviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege.  Rather, they could have narrowed the scope of the discovery orders on their own.  In deciding whether to issue mandamus, the Court of Appeals must not only determine whether there are exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power, <em>Will</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/index.html">389 U. S. 90</a>, 95, or \xe2\x80\x9ca clear abuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Holland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/379/index.html">346 U. S. 379</a>, 383, but must also ask whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Absent overriding concerns such as the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, see <em>Schlagenhauf</em> v. <em>Holder,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/104/index.html">379 U. S. 104</a>, 111, the Court declines to direct the Court of Appeals to issue mandamus against the District Court.  This is not a case where, having considered the issues, the appeals court abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ.  Instead, it relied on its mistaken reading of <em>Nixon</em> and prematurely terminated its inquiry without even reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case or exercising its discretion to determine whether mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances.  Because issuance of the writ is vested in the discretion of the court to which to petition is made, this Court leaves it to the Court of Appeals to address the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments and other matters bearing on whether mandamus should issue, bearing in mind the burdens imposed on the Executive Branch in any future proceedings.  Special considerations applicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that the lower courts should be sensitive to Government requests for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, <em>e.g.,</em> whether the statute embodies the <em>de facto</em> membership doctrine.

This case requires us to consider the circumstances under which a court of appeals may exercise its power to issue a writ of mandamus to modify or dissolve the orders when, by virtue of their overbreadth, enforcement might interfere with the officials in the discharge of their duties and impinge upon the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional prerogatives.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few days after assuming office, President George W. Bush issued a memorandum establishing the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG or Group).  The Group was directed to \xe2\x80\x9cdevelo[p] \xe2\x80\xa6 a national energy policy designed to help the private sector, and government at all levels, promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound production and distribution of energy for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 156\xe2\x80\x93157.  The President assigned a number of agency heads and assistants\xe2\x80\x94all employees of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x94to serve as members of the committee.  He authorized the Vice President, as chairman of the Group, to invite \xe2\x80\x9cother officers of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x9d to participate \xe2\x80\x9cas appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 157.  Five months later, the NEPDG issued a final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following publication of the report, respondents Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club filed these separate actions, which were later consolidated in the District Court.  Respondents alleged the NEPDG had failed to comply with the procedural and disclosure requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA or Act), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa72, p.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FACA was enacted to monitor the \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous committees, boards, commissions, councils, and similar groups [that] have been established to advise officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72(a), and to prevent the \xe2\x80\x9cwasteful expenditure of public funds\xe2\x80\x9d that may result from their proliferation, <em>Public Citizen</em> v. <em>Department of Justice,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/440/index.html">491 U. S. 440</a>, 453 (1989).  Subject to specific exemptions, FACA imposes a variety of open-meeting and disclosure requirements on groups that meet the definition of an \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory committee.\xe2\x80\x9d  As relevant here, an \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory committee\xe2\x80\x9d means</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cany committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, which is\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) established or utilized by the President,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n<p>\n\nexcept that [the definition] excludes (i) any committee that is composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa73(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents do not dispute the President appointed only Federal Government officials to the NEPDG.  They agree that the NEPDG, as established by the President in his memorandum, was \xe2\x80\x9ccomposed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The complaint alleges, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cnon-federal employees,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cprivate lobbyists,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregularly attended and fully participated in non-public meetings.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 21 (Judicial Watch Complaint \xc2\xb6  ;25).  Relying on <em>Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Inc.</em> v. <em>Clinton</em>, 997 F.\xc2\xa02d 898 (CADC 1993) <em>(AAPS)</em>, respondents contend that the regular participation of the non-Government individuals made them <em>de facto</em> members of the committee.  According to the complaint, their \xe2\x80\x9cinvolvement and role are functionally indistinguishable from those of the other [formal] members.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 915.  As a result, respondents argue, the NEPDG cannot benefit from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s exemption under subsection B and is subject to FACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vice President Cheney, the NEPDG, the Government officials who served on the committee, and the alleged <em>de facto</em> members were named as defendants.  The suit seeks declaratory relief and an injunction requiring them \nto produce all materials allegedly subject to FACA\xe2\x80\x99s \nrequirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All defendants moved to dismiss.  The District Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.  The court acknowledged FACA does not create a private cause of action.  On this basis, it dismissed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims against the non-Government defendants.  Because the NEPDG had been dissolved, it could not be sued as a defendant; and the claims against it were dismissed as well.  The District Court held, however, that FACA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive requirements could be enforced against the Vice President and other Government participants on the NEPDG under the Mandamus Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71361, and against the agency defendants under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706.  The District Court recognized the disclosure duty must be clear and nondiscretionary for mandamus to issue, and there must be, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cfinal agency actions\xe2\x80\x9d for the APA to apply.  According to the District Court, it was premature to decide these questions.  It held only that respondents had alleged sufficient facts to keep the Vice President and the other defendants in the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court deferred ruling on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that to disregard the exemption and apply FACA to the NEPDG would violate principles of separation of powers and interfere with the constitutional prerogatives of the President and the Vice President.  Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a \xe2\x80\x9ctightly-reined\xe2\x80\x9d discovery to ascertain the NEPDG\xe2\x80\x99s structure and membership, and thus to determine whether the <em>de facto</em> membership doctrine applies.  <em>Judicial Watch, Inc.</em> v. <em>National Energy Policy Dev. Group</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 20, 54 (DC 2002).  While acknowledging that discovery itself might raise serious constitutional questions, the District Court explained that the Government could assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materials from disclosure.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, these \xe2\x80\x9cissues of executive privilege will be much more limited in scope than the broad constitutional challenge raised by the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 55.  The District Court adopted this approach in an attempt to avoid constitutional questions, noting that if, after discovery, respondents have no evidentiary support for the allegations about the regular participation by lobbyists and industry executives on the NEPDG, the Government can prevail on statutory grounds.  Furthermore, the District Court explained, even were it appropriate to address constitutional issues, some factual development is necessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusion into the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority.  The court denied in part the motion to dismiss and ordered respondents to submit a discovery plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In due course the District Court approved respondents\xe2\x80\x99 discovery plan, entered a series of orders allowing discovery to proceed, see CADC App. 238, 263, 364 (reproducing orders entered on Sept. 9, Oct. 17, and Nov. 1, 2002), and denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion for certification under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b) with respect to the discovery orders.  Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals to vacate the discovery orders, to direct the District Court to rule on the basis of the administrative record, and to dismiss the Vice President from the suit.  The Vice President also filed a notice of appeal from the same orders.  See <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U. S. 541</a> (1949); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/index.html">418 U. S. 683</a> (1974).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for a writ of mandamus and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s attempted interlocutory appeal.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Cheney</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 1096 (CADC 2003).  With respect to mandamus, the majority declined to issue the writ on the ground that alternative avenues of relief remained available.  Citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon,</em> <em>supra</em>, the majority held that petitioners, to guard against intrusion into the President\xe2\x80\x99s prerogatives, must first assert privilege.  Under its reading of <em>Nixon</em>, moreover, privilege claims must be made \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98with particularity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1104.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, if the District Court sustains the privilege, petitioners will be able to obtain all the relief they seek.  If the District Court rejects the claim of executive privilege and creates \xe2\x80\x9can imminent risk of disclosure of allegedly protected presidential communications,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmandamus might well be appropriate to avoid letting \xe2\x80\x98the cat \xe2\x80\xa6 out of the bag.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1104\xe2\x80\x931105.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut so long as the separation of powers conflict that petitioners anticipate remains hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel held, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1105.  The majority acknowledged the scope of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 requests is overly broad, because it seeks far more than the \xe2\x80\x9climited items\xe2\x80\x9d to which respondents would be entitled if \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court ultimately determines that the NEPDG is subject to FACA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1105\xe2\x80\x931106; <em>id.</em>, at 1106 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe requests to produce also go well beyond FACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[Respondents\xe2\x80\x99] discovery also goes well beyond what they need to prove\xe2\x80\x9d).  It nonetheless agreed with the District Court that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall bear the burden\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of invoking executive privilege and filing objections to the discovery orders with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98detailed precision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1105 (quoting Aug. 2, 2002, Order).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For similar reasons, the majority rejected the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s interlocutory appeal.  In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon</em>, the Court held that the President could appeal an interlocutory subpoena order without having \xe2\x80\x9cto place himself in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger the procedural mechanism for review.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U. S., at 691.  The majority, however, found the case inapplicable because Vice President Cheney, unlike then-President Nixon, had not yet asserted privilege.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Vice President was not forced to choose between disclosure and suffering contempt for failure to obey a court order.  The majority held that to require the Vice President to assert privilege does not create the unnecessary confrontation between two branches of Government described in <em>Nixon</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Randolph filed a dissenting opinion.  In his view <em>AAPS</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 <em>de facto</em> membership doctrine is mistaken, and the Constitution bars its application to the NEPDG.  Allowing discovery to determine the applicability of the <em>de facto</em> membership doctrine, he concluded, is inappropriate.  He would have issued the writ of mandamus directing dismissal of the complaints.  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1119.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  540 U. S. ___ (2003).  We now vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings to reconsider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s mandamus petition.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a preliminary matter, we address respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of mandamus was jurisdictionally out of time or, alternatively, barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.  According to respondents, because the Government\xe2\x80\x99s basic argument was one of discovery immunity\xe2\x80\x94that is, it need not invoke executive privilege or make particular objections to the discovery requests\xe2\x80\x94the mandamus petition should have been filed with the Court of Appeals within 60 days after the District Court denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  See<em> </em>Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered\xe2\x80\x9d).  On this theory, the last day for making any filing to the Court of Appeals was September 9, 2002.  The Government, however, did not file the mandamus petition and the notice of appeal until November 7, four months after the District Court issued the order that, under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, commenced the time for appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As even respondents acknowledge, however, Rule 4(a), by its plain terms, applies only to the filing of a notice of appeal.  Brief for Respondent Sierra Club 23.  Rule 4(a) is inapplicable to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s mandamus petition under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71651.  Because we vacate the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment and remand the case for further proceedings for the court to consider whether a writ of mandamus should have issued, we need not decide whether the Vice President also could have appealed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders under <em>Nixon</em> and the collateral order doctrine.  We express no opinion on whether the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s notice of appeal was timely filed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the mandamus petition was barred by laches does not withstand scrutiny.  Laches might bar a petition for a writ of mandamus if the petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cslept upon his rights \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, and especially if the delay has been prejudicial to the [other party], or to the rights of other persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>County of Douglas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/348/index.html">107 U. S. 348</a>, 355 (1883).  Here, the flurry of activity following the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the motion to dismiss overcomes respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Government neglected to assert its rights.  The Government filed, among other papers, a motion for a protective order on September 3; a motion to stay pending appeal on October 21; and a motion for leave to appeal pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b) on October 23.  Even were we to agree that the baseline for measuring the timeliness of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s mandamus petition was the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying the motion to dismiss, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s active litigation posture was far from the neglect or delay that would make the application of laches appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not accept, furthermore, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that laches should apply because the motions filed by the Government following the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of its motion to dismiss amounted to little more than dilatory tactics to \xe2\x80\x9cdelay and obstruct the proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Sierra Club 23.  In light of the drastic nature of mandamus and our precedents holding that mandamus may not issue so long as alternative avenues of relief remain available, the Government cannot be faulted for attempting to resolve the dispute through less drastic means.  The law does not put litigants in the impossible position of having to exhaust alternative remedies before petitioning for mandamus, on the one hand, and having to file the mandamus petition at the earliest possible moment to avoid laches, on the other.  The petition was properly before the Court of Appeals for its consideration.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now come to the central issue in the case\xe2\x80\x94whether the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude it \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus,\xe2\x80\x9d 334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105, on the ground that the Government could protect its rights by asserting executive privilege in the District Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common-law writ of mandamus against a lower court is codified at 28 U.

Second, the petitioner must satisfy \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the burden of showing that [his] right to issuance of the writ is \xe2\x80\x9cclear and indisputable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kerr, supra,</em> at 403 (quoting <em>Banker\xe2\x80\x99s Life &amp; Casualty Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 384).  Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.  <em>Kerr, supra,</em> at 403 (citing <em>Schlagenhauf</em> v. <em>Holder,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/104/index.html">379 U. S. 104</a>, 112, n.\xc2\xa08 (1964)).  These hurdles, however demanding, are not insuperable.  This Court has issued the writ to restrain a lower court when its actions would threaten the separation of powers by \xe2\x80\x9cembarrass[ing] the executive arm of the Government,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ex parte Peru,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/index.html">318 U.

Here, however, the Vice President and his comembers on the NEPDG are the subjects of the discovery orders.  The mandamus petition alleges that the orders threaten \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial intrusions on the process by which those in closest operational proximity to the President advise the President.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 343.  These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable, through mandamus or otherwise.  It is well established that \xe2\x80\x9ca President\xe2\x80\x99s communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any \xe2\x80\x98ordinary individual.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.

As <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em> explained, these principles do not mean that the \xe2\x80\x9cPresident is above the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U. S., at 715.  Rather, they simply acknowledge that the public interest requires that a coequal branch of Government \xe2\x80\x9cafford Presidential confidentiality the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and give recognition to the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These separation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President.  Accepted mandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court of appeals to prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branch\xe2\x80\x99s ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities.  See <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 587 (recognizing jurisdiction to issue the writ because \xe2\x80\x9cthe action of the political arm of the Government taken within its appropriate sphere [must] be promptly recognized, and \xe2\x80\xa6 delay and inconvenience of a prolonged litigation [must] be avoided by prompt termination of the proceedings in the district court\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 701 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have recognized that \xe2\x80\x98[e]ven when a branch does not arrogate power to itself \xe2\x80\xa6 the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair another in the performance of its constitutional duties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Loving </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/748/index.html">517 U.

Relying on <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, it held that even though respondents\xe2\x80\x99 discovery requests are overbroad and \xe2\x80\x9cgo well beyond FACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d the Vice President and his former colleagues on the NEPDG \xe2\x80\x9cshall bear the burden\xe2\x80\x9d of invoking privilege with narrow specificity and objecting to the discovery requests with \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed precision.\xe2\x80\x9d  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105\xe2\x80\x931106.  In its view, this result was required by <em>Nixon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U. S., at 706.  If <em>Nixon</em> refused to recognize broad claims of confidentiality where the President had asserted executive privilege, the majority reasoned, <em>Nixon</em> must have rejected, <em>a fortiori</em>, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim of discovery immunity where the privilege has not even been invoked.  According to the majority, because the Executive Branch can invoke executive privilege to maintain the separation of powers, mandamus relief is premature.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This analysis, however, overlooks fundamental differences in the two cases.  <em>Nixon</em> cannot bear the weight the Court of Appeals puts upon it.  First, unlike this case, which concerns respondents\xe2\x80\x99 requests for information for use in a civil suit, <em>Nixon</em> involves the proper balance between the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the confidentiality of its communications and the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 713.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was explicit that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\xa6 concerned with the balance between the President\xe2\x80\x99s generalized interest in confidentiality and the need for relevant evidence in civil litigation\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  We address only the conflict between the President\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of a generalized privilege of confidentiality and the constitutional need for relevant evidence in criminal trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 712, n.\xc2\xa019.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distinction <em>Nixon</em> drew between criminal and civil proceedings is not just a matter of formalism.  As the Court explained, the need for information in the criminal context is much weightier because \xe2\x80\x9cour historic[al] commitment to the rule of law \xe2\x80\xa6 is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that \xe2\x80\x98the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 708\xe2\x80\x93709 (quoting <em>Berger</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/78/index.html">295 U. S. 78</a>, 88 (1935)).  In light of the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d need for \xe2\x80\x9cevery man\xe2\x80\x99s evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the criminal justice system, 418 U. S., at 709, 710, not only must the Executive Branch first assert privilege to resist disclosure, but privilege claims that shield information from a grand jury proceeding or a criminal trial are not to be \xe2\x80\x9cexpansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for truth,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id.</em>, at 710.  The need for information for use in civil cases, while far from negligible, does not share the urgency or significance of the criminal subpoena requests in <em>Nixon</em>.  As <em>Nixon</em> recognized, the right to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings does not have the same \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional dimensions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 711.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also observed in <em>Nixon</em> that a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch [is] to do justice in criminal prosecutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 707.  Withholding materials from a tribunal in an ongoing criminal case when the information is necessary to the court in carrying out its tasks \xe2\x80\x9cconflict[s] with the function of the courts under Art.\xc2\xa0III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Such an impairment of the \xe2\x80\x9cessential functions of [another] branch,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, is impermissible.  Withholding the information in this case, however, does not hamper another branch\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform its \xe2\x80\x9cessential functions\xe2\x80\x9d in quite the same way.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The District Court ordered discovery here, not to remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertain whether FACA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements even apply to the NEPDG in the first place.  Even if FACA embodies important congressional objectives, the only consequence from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 inability to obtain the discovery they seek is that it would be more difficult for private complainants to vindicate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 policy objectives under FACA.  And even if, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, the reasoning in Judge Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion in the end is rejected and FACA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory objectives would be to some extent frustrated, it does not follow that a court\xe2\x80\x99s Article III authority or Congress\xe2\x80\x99 central Article I powers would be impaired.  The situation here cannot, in fairness, be compared to <em>Nixon</em>, where a court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to resolve cases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinges on the availability of certain indispensable information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A party\xe2\x80\x99s need for information is only one facet of the problem.  An important factor weighing in the opposite direction is the burden imposed by the discovery orders.  This is not a routine discovery dispute.  The discovery requests are directed to the Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on the NEPDG to give advice and make recommendations to the President.  The Executive Branch, at its highest level, is seeking the aid of the courts to protect its constitutional prerogatives.  As we have already noted, special considerations control when the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s interests in maintaining the autonomy of its office and safeguarding the confidentiality of its communications are implicated.  This Court has held, on more than one occasion, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he high respect that is owed to the office of the Chief Executive \xe2\x80\xa6 is a matter that should inform the conduct of the entire proceeding, including the timing and scope of discovery,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Clinton</em>, 520 U. S., at 707, and that the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional responsibilities and status [are] factors counseling judicial deference and restraint\xe2\x80\x9d in the conduct of litigation against it, <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U. S., at 753.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on cases that do not involve senior members of the Executive Branch, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kerr</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/394/index.html"></a><a href="/us/426/394/index.html">426 U. S. 394</a> (1976), is altogether misplaced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even when compared against <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s criminal subpoenas, which did involve the President, the civil discovery here militates against respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position.  The observation in <em>Nixon</em> that production of confidential information would not disrupt the functioning of the Executive Branch cannot be applied in a mechanistic fashion to civil litigation.  In the criminal justice system, there are various constraints, albeit imperfect, to filter out insubstantial legal claims.  The decision to prosecute a criminal case, for example, is made by a publicly accountable prosecutor subject to budgetary considerations and under an ethical obligation, not only to win and zealously to advocate for his client but also to serve the cause of justice.  The rigors of the penal system are also mitigated by the responsible exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  In contrast, there are no analogous checks in the civil discovery process here.  Although under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, sanctions are available, and private attorneys also owe an obligation of candor to the judicial tribunal, these safeguards have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the Executive Branch.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn view of the visibility of\xe2\x80\x9d the Offices of the President and the Vice President and \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect of their actions on countless people,\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9ceasily identifiable target[s] for suits for civil damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 751.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the narrow subpoena orders in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em> stand on an altogether different footing from the overly broad discovery requests approved by the District Court in this case.  The criminal subpoenas in <em>Nixon</em> were required to satisfy exacting standards of \xe2\x80\x9c(1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3) specificity.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U. S., at 700 (interpreting Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 17(c)).  They were \xe2\x80\x9cnot intended to provide a means of discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U. S., at 698.  The burden of showing these standards were met, moreover, fell on the party requesting the information.  <em>Id., </em>at 699 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must show that the applicable standards are met\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <em>Nixon</em>, the Court addressed the issue of executive privilege only after having satisfied itself that the special prosecutor had surmounted these demanding requirements.  <em>Id.</em>, at 698 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf we sustained this [Rule 17(c)] challenge, there would be no occasion to reach the claim of privilege asserted with respect to the subpoenaed material\xe2\x80\x9d).  The very specificity of the subpoena requests serves as an important safeguard against unnecessary intrusion into the operation of the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to <em>Nixon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s subpoena orders that \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely identified\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspecific[ally] \xe2\x80\xa6 enumerated\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant materials, <em>id.</em>, at 688, and n.\xc2\xa05, the discovery requests here, as the panel majority acknowledged, ask for everything under the sky:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c1.\xc2\xa0All documents identifying or referring to any staff, personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of the Task Force.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c2.\xc2\xa0All documents establishing or referring to any Sub-Group.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c3.\xc2\xa0All documents identifying or referring to any staff, personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of any Sub-Group.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c4.\xc2\xa0All documents identifying or referring to any other persons participating in the preparation of the Report or in the activities of the Task Force or any Sub-Group.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c5.\xc2\xa0All documents concerning any communication relating to the activities of the Task Force, the activities of any Sub-Groups, or the preparation of the Report\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c6.\xc2\xa0All documents concerning any communication relating to the activities of the Task Force, the activities of the Sub-Groups, or the preparation of the Report between any person \xe2\x80\xa6 and [a list of agencies].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 220\xe2\x80\x93221.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The preceding excerpt from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c<em>First </em>Request for Production of Documents,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 215 (emphasis added), is only the beginning.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Set of Interrogatories\xe2\x80\x9d are similarly unbounded in scope.  <em>Id.</em>, at 224.  Given the breadth of the discovery requests in this case compared to the narrow subpoena orders in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon</em>, our precedent provides no support for the proposition that the Executive Branch \xe2\x80\x9cshall bear the burden\xe2\x80\x9d of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making particularized objections.  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105.  To be sure, <em>Nixon</em> held that the President cannot, through the assertion of a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad [and] undifferentiated\xe2\x80\x9d need for confidentiality and the invocation of an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute, unqualified\xe2\x80\x9d executive privilege, withhold information in the face of subpoena orders.  418 U. S., at 706, 707.  It did so, however, only after the party requesting the information\xe2\x80\x94the special prosecutor\xe2\x80\x94had satisfied his burden of showing the propriety of the requests.  Here, as the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the discovery requests are anything but appropriate.  They provide respondents all the disclosure to which they would be entitled in the event they prevail on the merits, and much more besides.  In these circumstances, <em>Nixon</em> does not require the Executive Branch to bear the onus of critiquing the unacceptable discovery requests line by line.  Our precedents suggest just the opposite.  See, <em>e.g., Clinton </em>v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/681/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/681/index.html">520 U. S. 681</a> (1997); <em>id.</em>, at 705 (holding that the Judiciary may direct \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate<em> </em>process\xe2\x80\x9d to the Executive); <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U. S., at 753.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, however, did in fact object to the scope of discovery and asked the District Court to narrow it in some way.  Its arguments were ignored.  See App. 167, 181\xe2\x80\x93183 (arguing \xe2\x80\x9cthis case can be resolved far short of the wide-ranging inquiries plaintiffs have proposed\xe2\x80\x9d and suggesting alternatives to \xe2\x80\x9climi[t]\xe2\x80\x9d discovery); <em>id.</em>, at 232 (\xe2\x80\x9cDefendants object to the scope of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 discovery requests and to the undue burden imposed by them.  The scope of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 requests is broader than that reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 232, n.\xc2\xa010 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe state our general objections here for purposes of clarity for the record and to preclude any later argument that, by not including them here, those general objections have been waived\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, the Government objected to the burden that would arise from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that the Vice President winnow the discovery orders by asserting specific claims of privilege and making more particular objections.  App. 201 (Tr. of Status Hearing (Aug. 2, 2002)) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns with disrupting the effective functioning of the presidency and the vice-presidency\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 274 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ompliance with the order of the court imposes a burden on the Office of the Vice President.  That is a real burden.  If we had completed and done everything that Your Honor has asked us to do today that burden would be gone, but it would have been realized\xe2\x80\x9d).  These arguments, too, were rejected.  See <em>id.</em>, at 327, 329 (Nov. 1, 2002, Order) (noting that the court had, \xe2\x80\x9con numerous occasions,\xe2\x80\x9d rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion \xe2\x80\x9cthat court orders requiring [it] to respond in any fashion to [the] discovery requests creates an \xe2\x80\x98unconstitutional burden\xe2\x80\x99 on the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s and the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusions, <em>Nixon </em>does not leave them the sole option of inviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege while remaining otherwise powerless to modify a party\xe2\x80\x99s overly broad discovery requests.  Executive privilege is an extraordinary assertion of power \xe2\x80\x9cnot to be lightly invoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reynolds,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/1/index.html">345 U. S. 1</a>, 7 (1953).  Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course.  The Judiciary is forced into the difficult task of balancing the need for information in a judicial proceeding and the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s Article II prerogatives.  This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s claims of confidentiality and autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of separation of powers and checks and balances.  These \xe2\x80\x9coccasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two branches\xe2\x80\x9d should be avoided whenever possible.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 692.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In recognition of these concerns, there is sound precedent in the District of Columbia itself for district courts to explore other avenues, short of forcing the Executive to invoke privilege, when they are asked to enforce against the Executive Branch unnecessarily broad subpoenas.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Poindexter</em>, 727 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1501 (1989), defendant Poindexter, on trial for criminal charges, sought to have the District Court enforce subpoena orders against President Reagan to obtain allegedly exculpatory materials.  The Executive considered the subpoenas \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable and oppressive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1503.  Rejecting defendant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Executive must first assert executive privilege to narrow the subpoenas, the District Court agreed with the President that \xe2\x80\x9cit is undesirable as a matter of constitutional and public policy to compel a President to make his decision on privilege with respect to a large array of documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court decided to narrow, on its own, the scope of the subpoenas to allow the Executive \xe2\x80\x9cto consider whether to invoke executive privilege with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 a smaller number of documents following the narrowing of the subpoenas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1504.  This is but one example of the choices available to the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we discussed at the outset, under principles of mandamus jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals may exercise its power to issue the writ only upon a finding of \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial \xe2\x80\x98usurpation of power,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Will,</em> 389 U. S., at 95, or \xe2\x80\x9ca clear abuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bankers Life</em>, 346 U. S., at 383.  As this case implicates the separation of powers, the Court of Appeals must also ask, as part of this inquiry, whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.  This is especially so here because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of whether mandamus relief is appropriate should itself be constrained by principles similar to those we have outlined, <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311, that limit the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 use of the remedy.  The panel majority, however, failed to ask this question.  Instead, it labored under the mistaken assumption that the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s separation-of-powers objections.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the absence of overriding concerns of the sort discussed in <em>Schlagenhauf</em>, 379 U. S., at 111 (discussing, among other things, the need to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cpiecemeal litigation\xe2\x80\x9d and to settle important issues of first impression in areas where this Court bears special responsibility), we decline petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to direct the Court of Appeals to issue the writ against the District Court.  Moreover, this is not a case where, after having considered the issues, the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ.  Instead, the Court of Appeals, relying on its mistaken reading of <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, prematurely terminated its inquiry after the Government refused to assert privilege and did so without even reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case, much less exercised its discretion to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Because the issuance of the writ is a matter vested in the discretion of the court to which the petition is made, and because this Court is not presented with an original writ of mandamus, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ex parte</em> <em>Peru</em>, 318 U. S., at 586, we leave to the Court of Appeals to address the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments with respect to the challenge to <em>AAPS</em> and the discovery orders.  Other matters bearing on whether the writ of mandamus should issue should also be addressed, in the first instance, by the Court of Appeals after considering any additional briefs and arguments as it deems appropriate.  We note only that all courts should be mindful of the burdens imposed on the Executive Branch in any future proceedings.  Special considerations applicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that the courts should be sensitive to requests by the Government for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, for example, whether the statute embodies the <em>de facto</em> membership doctrine.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961658">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n542 U.

In the normal case, it is entirely appropriate to require the responding party to make particularized objections to discovery requests.  In some circumstances, however, the requesting party should be required to assume a heavy burden of persuasion before any discovery is allowed.  Two interrelated considerations support taking that approach in this case: the nature of the remedy respondents requested from the District Court, and the nature of the statute they sought to enforce.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant here, respondents, Judicial Watch, Inc., and Sierra Club, sought a writ of mandamus under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71361.  Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, available to \xe2\x80\x9ca plaintiff only if \xe2\x80\xa6 the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Ringer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/602/index.html">466 U. S. 602</a>, 616 (1984).  Thus, to persuade the District Court that they were entitled to mandamus relief, respondents had to establish that petitioners had a nondiscretionary duty to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq</em>., p.\xc2\xa01, and in particular with FACA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9crecords related to the advisory committee\xe2\x80\x99s work be made public\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the only requirement still enforceable if, as respondent Sierra Club concedes, the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG) no longer exists.  See <em>Judicial Watch, Inc.</em> v. <em>National Energy Policy Dev. Group</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 20, 42 (DC 2002).  Relying on the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 novel <em>de facto</em> member doctrine, <em>ante</em>, at 3, respondents sought to make that showing by obtaining the very records to which they will be entitled if they win their lawsuit.  In other words, respondents sought to obtain, through discovery, information about the NEPDG\xe2\x80\x99s work in order to establish their entitlement <em>to</em> <em>the same information</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, granting broad discovery in this case effectively prejudged the merits of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim for mandamus relief\xe2\x80\x94an outcome entirely inconsistent with the extraordinary nature of the writ.  Under these circumstances, instead of requiring petitioners to object to particular discovery requests, the District Court should have required respondents to demonstrate that particular requests would tend to establish their theory of the case.*<footcall num="*">  I therefore think it would have been appropriate for the Court of Appeals to vacate the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s discovery order.

In vacating the judgment of the Court of Appeals, however, this Court remands for consideration whether mandamus is appropriate due to the <em>overbreadth </em>of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s discovery orders.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1, 16\xe2\x80\x9320.  But, as the Court of Appeals observed, it appeared that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cnever asked the district court to <em>narrow</em> discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Cheney</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 1096, 1106 (CADC 2003) (emphasis in original).

The Government argument that \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of doing a document production is an unconstitutional burden,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 274, was similarly anchored.  The Government so urged at a District Court hearing in which its underlying \xe2\x80\x9cposition [was] that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to produce anything,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 249.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line was firmly and consistently that \xe2\x80\x9creview, limited to the administrative record, should frame the resolution of this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 181; accord <em>id.</em>, at 179, 233.

Indeed, the Government acknowledged before the District Court that its litigation strategy involved opposition to the discovery plan as a whole in lieu of focused objections.  See <em>id.</em>, at 205 (Government stated: \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not choose to offer written objections to [the discovery plan]\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further sounding the Government\xe2\x80\x99s leitmotif, in a hearing on the proposed discovery plan, the District Court stated that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t file objections\xe2\x80\x9d to rein in discovery \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view] no discovery is appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 192; <em>id.</em>, at 205 (same).  Without endeavoring to correct any misunderstanding on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s part, the Government underscored its resistance to any and all discovery.  <em>Id.</em>, at 192\xe2\x80\x93194; <em>id.</em>, at  201 (asserting that respondents are \xe2\x80\x9cnot entitled to discovery to supplement [the administrative record]\xe2\x80\x9d).

See <em>id.</em>, at 339\xe2\x80\x93365.  In its mandamus petition, the Government asked the appellate court to \xe2\x80\x9cvacate the discovery orders issued by the district court, direct the court to decide the case on the basis of the administrative record and such supplemental affidavits as it may require, and direct that the Vice President be dismissed as a defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 364\xe2\x80\x93365.  In support of those requests, the Government again argued that the case should be adjudicated without discovery: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution and principles of comity preclude discovery of the President or Vice President, especially without a demonstration of compelling and focused countervailing interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 360.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the discovery plan presented by respondents and approved by the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cgoes well beyond what [respondents] need.\xe2\x80\x9d  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1106.

Far from ordering immediate \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure of communications between senior executive branch officials and those with information relevant to advice that was being formulated for the President,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals observed, the District Court had directed the Government initially to produce only \xe2\x80\x9cnon-privileged documents and a privilege log.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1104 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals stressed that the District Court could accommodate separation-of-powers concerns short of denying all discovery or compelling the invocation of executive privilege.  See 334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105\xe2\x80\x931106.  Principally, the Court of Appeals stated, discovery could be narrowed, should the Government so move, to encompass only \xe2\x80\x9cwhether non-federal officials participated [in NEPDG], and if so, to what extent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1106.  The Government could identify relevant materials produced in other litigation, thus avoiding undue reproduction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1105; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a; <em>supra</em>, at 3.  If, after appropriate narrowing, the discovery allowed still impels \xe2\x80\x9cthe Vice President \xe2\x80\xa6 to claim privilege,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court could \xe2\x80\x9centertain [those] privilege claims\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creview allegedly privileged documents in camera.\xe2\x80\x9d  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1107.  Mindful of \xe2\x80\x9cthe judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to police the separation of powers in litigation involving the executive,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals expressed confidence that the District Court would \xe2\x80\x9crespond to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 concern and narrow discovery to ensure that [respondents] obtain no more than they need to prove their case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1106.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court repeatedly has observed that the writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</em> v. <em>Mayacamas Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/271/index.html"></a><a href="/us/485/271/index.html">485 U.

See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x937.  The Court now remands this case so the Court of Appeals can consider whether a mandamus writ should issue ordering the District Court to \xe2\x80\x9cexplore other avenues, short of forcing the Executive to invoke privilege,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in particular, to \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow, on its own, the scope of [discovery].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Nothing in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders or the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion, however, suggests that either of those courts would refuse reasonably to accommodate separation-of-powers concerns.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3, 7\xe2\x80\x938.  When parties seeking a mandamus writ decline to avail themselves of opportunities to obtain relief from the District Court, a writ of mandamus ordering the same relief\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, here, reined-in discovery\xe2\x80\x94is surely a doubtful proposition.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, moreover, did not err in failing to narrow discovery on its own initiative.  Although the Court cites <em>United States</em> v. <em>Poindexter</em>, 727 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1501 (DC 1989), as \xe2\x80\x9csound precedent\xe2\x80\x9d for district-court narrowing of discovery, see <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, the target of the subpoena in that case, former President Reagan, unlike petitioners in this case, affirmatively requested such narrowing, 727 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 1503.  A district court is not subject to criticism if it awaits a party\xe2\x80\x99s motion before tightening the scope of discovery; certainly, that court makes no \xe2\x80\x9cclear and indisputable\xe2\x80\x9d error in adhering to the principle of party initiation, <em>Kerr</em>, 426 U. S., at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Review by mandamus at this stage of the proceedings would be at least comprehensible as a means to test the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position that <em>no </em>discovery is appropriate in this litigation.  See Brief for Petitioners 45 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]etitioners\xe2\x80\x99 separation-of-powers arguments are \xe2\x80\xa6 in the nature of a claim of immunity from discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But in remanding for consideration of discovery-tailoring measures, the Court apparently rejects that no-discovery position.  Otherwise, a remand based on the overbreadth of the discovery requests would make no sense.  Nothing in the record, however, intimates lower-court refusal to reduce discovery.  Indeed, the appeals court has already suggested tailored discovery that would avoid \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively prejudg[ing] the merits of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Stevens, J., concurring).

A question not decided by the District Court, and barely raised in a petition for mandamus, hardly qualifies as grounds for \xe2\x80\x9cdrastic and extraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d mandamus relief, <em>Ex parte Fahey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/258/index.html">332 U. S. 258</a>, 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (1947).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas urges that respondents cannot obtain \xc2\xa71361 relief if \xe2\x80\x9cwide-ranging discovery [is needed] to prove that they have <em>any </em>right to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original).  First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, see <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939; <em>infra</em>, at 11, should the Government so move, the District Court could contain discovery so that it would not be \xe2\x80\x9cwide-ranging.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, all agree that an applicant seeking a \xc2\xa71361 mandamus writ must show that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [federal] defendant owes him a clear, <em>nondiscretionary</em> duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Ringer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/602/index.html">466 U. S. 602</a>, 616 (1984) (emphasis added).  No \xc2\xa71361 writ may issue, in other words, when federal law grants discretion to the federal officer, rather than imposing a duty on him.  When federal law imposes an obligation, however, suit under \xc2\xa71361 is not precluded simply because facts must be developed to ascertain whether a federal command has been dishonored.  Congress enacted \xc2\xa71361 to \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] it more convenient for aggrieved persons to file actions in the nature of mandamus,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Stafford</em> v. <em>Briggs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/527/index.html">444 U. S. 527</a>, 535 (1980), not to address the rare instance in which a federal defendant, upon whom the law unequivocally places an obligation, concedes his failure to measure up to that obligation.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0While I agree with the Court that an interlocutory appeal may become appropriate at some later juncture in this litigation, see <em>ante</em>, at 21, I note that the decision whether to allow such an appeal lies in the first instance in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s sound discretion, see 28 U.

Court for Northern Dist. of Cal.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/394/index.html">426 U. S. 394</a>, 402 (1976).  In framing our review of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, the Court recognizes this hurdle, observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe petitioner must satisfy \xe2\x80\x98the burden of showing that [his] right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Kerr</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But in reaching its disposition, the Court barely mentions the fact that respondents, Judicial Watch, Inc., and Sierra Club, face precisely the same burden to obtain relief from the District Court.  The proper question presented to the Court of Appeals was not only whether it is clear and indisputable that petitioners have a right to an order \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vacat[ing] the discovery orders issued by the district court, direct[ing] the court to decide the case on the basis of the administrative record and such supplemental affidavits as it may require, and direct[ing] that the Vice President be dismissed as a defendant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  334 F.\xc2\xa03d 1096, 1101 (CADC 2003) (quoting Emergency Pet. for Writ of Mandamus in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Cheney</em>, in No. 02\xe2\x80\x935354 (CADC)).  The question with which the Court of Appeals was faced also necessarily had to account for the fact that respondents sought mandamus relief in the District Court.  Because they proceeded by mandamus, respondents had to demonstrate in the District Court a clear and indisputable right to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) materials.  If respondents\xe2\x80\x99 right to the materials was not clear and indisputable, then petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 right to relief in the Court of Appeals was clear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One need look no further than the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to conclude respondents\xe2\x80\x99 right to relief in the District Court was unclear and hence that mandamus would be unavailable.  Indeed, the District Court acknowledged this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition \xe2\x80\x9cthat applying FACA to meetings among Presidential advisors \xe2\x80\x98present[s] formidable constitutional difficulties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Judicial Watch, Inc.</em> v. <em>National Energy Policy Dev. Group</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 20, 47 (DC 2002) (quoting <em>Public Citizen</em> v. <em>Department of Justice,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/440/index.html">491 U. S. 440</a>, 466 (1989)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Putting aside the serious constitutional questions raised by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 challenge, the District Court could not even determine whether FACA applies to the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG) as a statutory matter.  219 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 54\xe2\x80\x9355 (noting the possibility that, after discovery, petitioners might prevail on summary judgment on statutory grounds).  I acknowledge that under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 <em>de facto </em>member doctrine, see <em>Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Inc.</em> v. <em>Clinton</em>, 997 F.\xc2\xa02d 898, 915 (CADC 1993), a district court is authorized to undertake broad discovery to determine whether FACA\xe2\x80\x99s Government employees exception, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa73(2)(C)(i), p.\xc2\xa02, applies.  But, application of the <em>de facto </em>member doctrine to authorize broad discovery into the inner-workings of the NEPDG has the same potential to offend the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s separation of powers as the actual application of FACA to the NEPDG itself.  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1114\xe2\x80\x931115 (Randolph, J., dissenting).  Thus, the existence of this doctrine cannot support the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s actions here.  If respondents must conduct wide-ranging discovery in order to prove that they have <em>any</em> right to relief\xe2\x80\x94much less that they have a clear and indisputable right to relief\xe2\x80\x94mandamus is unwarranted, and the writ should not issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the District Court might later conclude that FACA applies to the NEPDG as a statutory matter and that such application is constitutional, the mere fact that the District Court <em>might</em> rule in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 favor cannot establish the clear right to relief necessary for mandamus.  Otherwise, the writ of mandamus could turn into a freestanding cause of action for plaintiffs seeking to enforce virtually any statute, even those that provide no such private remedy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the District Court clearly exceeded its authority in this case, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with instruction to issue the writ.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
