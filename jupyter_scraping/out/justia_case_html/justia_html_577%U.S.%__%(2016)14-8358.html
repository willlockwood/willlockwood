In those cases, the Court simply observed that the last-antecedent rule may be overcome by contextual indicia of meaning.  Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to identify such indicia are unavailing.  He claims that the state predicates are so similar that a limiting phrase could apply equally to all three.  But by transforming a list of separate predicates into a set of near-synonyms, Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s reading results in too much redundancy and risks running headlong into the rule against superfluity.

However, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction relies on contextual cues particular to the sexual-abuse predicates, not on a general assumption that Congress sought full parity between all state and federal predicates.

The rule of lenity is used to resolve ambiguity only when the ordinary canons have revealed no satisfactory construction.

Eleven years later, Lockhart was indicted in the Eastern District of New York for attempting to receive child pornography in violation of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72252(a)(2) and for possessing child pornography in violation of \xc2\xa72252(a)(4)(b).  Lockhart pleaded guilty to the possession offense and the Government dismissed the receipt offense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s presentence report calculated a guidelines range of 78 to 97 months for the possession offense.  But the report also concluded that Lockhart was subject to \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimum because his prior New York abuse conviction related \xe2\x80\x9cto aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d  PSR \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb687\xe2\x80\x9388.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lockhart objected, arguing that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d applies to all three listed crimes: \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>and </i>\xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  He therefore contended that his prior conviction for sexual abuse involving an <i>adult</i> fell outside the enhancement\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.

The issue before us is whether the limiting phrase that appears at the end of that list\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94applies to all three predicate crimes preceding it in the list or only the final predicate crime.  We hold that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d the antecedent immediately preceding it.  Although \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s list of state predicates is awkwardly phrased (to put it charitably), the provision\xe2\x80\x99s text and context together reveal a straightforward reading.  A timeworn textual canon is confirmed by the structure and internal logic of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Consider the text.  When this Court has interpreted statutes that include a list of terms or phrases followed by a limiting clause, we have typically applied an interpretive strategy called the \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20,\n26 (2003)\n.  The rule provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca limiting clause or phrase .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also<i> </i>Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1532\xe2\x80\x931533 (10th ed. 2014) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Q]ualifying words or phrases modify the words or phrases immediately preceding them and not words or phrases more remote, unless the extension is necessary from the context or the spirit of the entire writing\xe2\x80\x9d); A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 144 (2012).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has applied the rule from our earliest decisions to our more recent.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Sims Lessee</i> v. <i>Irvine</i>, 3 Dall. 425, 444, n. (1799); <i>FTC</i> v. <i>Mandel Brothers, Inc.</i>,\n\n359 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385,\n389, n.\n4 (1959)\n; <i>Barnhart</i>, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rule reflects the basic intuition that when a modifier appears at the end of a list, it is easier to apply that modifier only to the item directly before it.  That is particularly true where it takes more than a little mental energy to process the individual entries in the list, making it a heavy lift to carry the modifier across them all.  For example, imagine you are the general manager of the Yankees and you are rounding out your 2016 roster.  You tell your scouts to find a defensive catcher, a quick-footed shortstop, or a pitcher from last year\xe2\x80\x99s World Champion Kansas City Royals.  It would be natural for your scouts to confine their search for a pitcher to last year\xe2\x80\x99s championship team, but to look more broadly for catchers and shortstops.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applied here, the last antecedent principle suggests that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only the phrase that it immediately follows: \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  As a corollary, it also suggests that the phrases \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d are not so constrained.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, as with any canon of statutory interpretation, the rule of the last antecedent \xe2\x80\x9cis not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barnhart</i>, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26; see also <i>Davis </i>v.<i> Michigan Dept. of Treasury</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 803,\n809 (1989)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d).  For instance, take \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the laws, the treaties, and the constitution of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Post</i>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa01 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  A reader intuitively applies \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe laws,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe treaties\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitution\xe2\x80\x9d because (among other things) laws, treaties, and the constitution are often cited together, because readers are used to seeing \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d modify each of them, and because the listed items are simple and parallel without unexpected internal modifiers or structure.  Section 2252(b)(2), by contrast, does not contain items that readers are used to seeing listed together or a concluding modifier that readers are accustomed to applying to each of them.  And the varied syntax of each item in the list makes it hard for the reader to carry the final modifying clause across all three.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More importantly, here the interpretation urged by the rule of the last antecedent is not overcome by other indicia of meaning.  To the contrary, \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s context fortifies the meaning that principle commands.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our inquiry into \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s context begins with the internal logic of that provision.  Section 2252(b)(2) establishes sentencing minimums and maximums for three categories of offenders.  The first third of the section imposes a 10-year maximum sentence on offenders with no prior convictions.  The second third imposes a 10-year minimum and 20-year maximum on offenders who have previously violated a federal offense listed within various chapters of the Federal Criminal Code.  And the last third imposes the same minimum and maximum on offenders who have previously committed state \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse,aggravated sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d as well as a number of state crimes related to the possession and distribution of child pornography.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Among the chapters of the Federal Criminal Code that can trigger \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s recidivist enhancement are crimes \xe2\x80\x9cunder .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. chapter 109A.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chapter 109A criminal-</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">izes a range of sexual-abuse offenses involving adults <i>or</i> minors and wards.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  And it places those federal sexual-abuse crimes under headings that use language nearly identical to the language \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) uses to enumerate the three categories of state sexual-abuse predicates.  The first section in Chapter 109A is titled \xe2\x80\x9cAggravated sexual abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241.  The second is titled \xe2\x80\x9cSexual abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72242.  And the third is titled \xe2\x80\x9cSexual abuse of a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72243.  Applying the rule of the last antecedent, those sections mirror precisely the order, precisely the divisions, and nearly precisely the words used to describe the three state sexual-abuse predicate crimes in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2): \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This similarity appears to be more than a coincidence.  We cannot state with certainty that Congress used Chapter 109A as a template for the list of state predicates set out in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), but we cannot ignore the parallel, particularly because the headings in Chapter 109A were in place when Congress amended the statute to add \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s state sexual-abuse predicates.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If Congress had intended to limit each of the state predicates to conduct \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward,\xe2\x80\x9d we doubt it would have followed, or thought it needed to follow, so closely the structure and language of Chapter 109A.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  The conclusion that Congress followed the federal template is supported by the fact that Congress did nothing to indicate that offenders with prior federal sexual-abuse convictions are more culpable, harmful, or worthy of enhanced punishment than offenders with nearly identical state priors.  We therefore see no reason to interpret \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) so that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]exual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d that occurs in the Second Circuit courthouse triggers the sentence enhancement, but \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d that occurs next door in the Manhattan munici-pal building does not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Lockhart argues, to the contrary, that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d should be interpreted to modify all three state sexual-abuse predicates.  He first contends, as does our dissenting colleague, that the so-called series-qualifier principle supports his reading.  This principle, Lockhart says, requires a modifier to apply to all items in a series when such an application would represent a natural construction.

And, most recently, in <i>Paroline </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), the Court noted that the rule need not be applied \xe2\x80\x9cin a mechanical way where it would require accepting \xe2\x80\x98unlikely premises.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But in none of those cases did the Court describe, much less apply, a countervailing grammatical mandate that could bear the weight that either Lockhart or the dissent places on the series qualifier principle.  Instead, the Court simply observed that sometimes context weighs against the application of the rule of the last antecedent.  <i>Barnhart</i>, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26.  Whether a modifier is \xe2\x80\x9capplicable as much to the first .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as to the last\xe2\x80\x9d words in a list, whether a set of items form a \xe2\x80\x9csingle, integrated list,\xe2\x80\x9d and whether the application of the rule would require acceptance of an \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely premise\xe2\x80\x9d are fundamentally contextual questions. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lockhart attempts to identify contextual indicia that he says rebut the rule of the last antecedent, but those indicia hurt rather than help his prospects.  He points out that the final two state predicates, \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cnearly synonymous as a matter of everyday speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 17.  And, of course, anyone who commits \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d has also necessarily committed \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  So, he posits, the items in the list are sufficiently similar that a limiting phrase could apply equally to all three of them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s effort to demonstrate some similarity among the items in the list of state predicates reveals far too much similarity.  The three state predicate crimes are not just related on Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s reading; they are hopelessly redundant.  Any conduct that would qualify as \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d would also qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d  We take no position today on the meaning of the terms \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d including their similarities and differences.  But it is clear that applying the limiting phrase to all three items would risk running headlong into the rule against superfluity by transforming a list of separate predicates<i> </i>into a set of synonyms describing the same predicate.  See<i> Bailey </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137,\n146 (1995)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWe assume that Congress used two terms because it intended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying the limiting phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d more sparingly, by contrast, preserves some distinction between the categories of state predicates by limiting only the third category to conduct \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d  We recognize that this interpretation does not eliminate all superfluity between \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Atlantic Research Corp.</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128,\n137 (2007)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur hesitancy to construe statutes to render language superfluousdoes not require us to avoid surplusage at all costs.  It is appropriate to tolerate a degree of surplusage\xe2\x80\x9d).  But there is a ready explanation for the redundancy that remains: It follows the categories in Chapter 109A\xe2\x80\x99s federal template.  See <i>supra,</i> at 6.  We see no similar explanation for Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s complete collapse of the list.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent offers a suggestion rooted in its impressions about how people ordinarily speak and write.  <i>Post</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934.  The problem is that, as even the dissent acknowledges, \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s list of state predicates is hardly intuitive.  No one would mistake its odd repetition and inelegant phrasing for a reflection of the accumulated wisdom of everyday speech patterns.  It would be as if a friend asked you to get her tart lemons, sour lemons, or sour fruit from Mexico.  If you brought back lemons from California, but your friend insisted that she was using customary speech and obvi-ously asked for Mexican fruit only, you would be forgiven for disagreeing on both counts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Faced with \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s inartful drafting, then, do we interpret the provision by viewing it as a clear, commonsense list best construed as if conversational English?  Or do we look around to see if there might be some provenance to its peculiarity?  With Chapter 109A so readily at hand, we are unpersuaded by our dissenting colleague\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of basic examples from day-to-day life.  Whatever the validity of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s broader point, this simply is not a case in which colloquial practice is of much use.  Section 2252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s list is hardly the way an average person, or even an average lawyer, would set about to describe the relevant conduct if they had started from scratch.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Lockhart next takes aim at our construction of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) to avoid disparity between the state and federal sexual-abuse predicates.  He contends that other dispar-ities between state and federal predicates in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) indicate that parity was not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern.  For example, \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) imposes the recidivist enhancement on offenders with prior federal convictions under Chapter 71 of Title 18, which governs obscenity.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71461\xe2\x80\x931470.  Yet \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) does not impose a similar enhancementfor offenses under state obscenity laws.  Similarly, \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor provision, \xc2\xa72252(b)(1), creates a mandatory minimum for sex trafficking involving children, but not sex trafficking involving adults.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">However, our construction of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s sexual-abuse predicates does not rely on a general assumption that Congress sought full parity between all of the federal and state predicates in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).  It relies instead on contextual cues particular to the sexual-abuse predicates.  To enumerate the state sexual-abuse predicates, Congress used language similar to that in Chapter 109A of the Federal Criminal Code, which describes crimes involving both adults and children.  See <i>supra, </i>at<i> </i>6.<i> </i>We therefore assume that the same language used to describe the state sexual-abuse predicates also describes conduct involving both adults and children.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Lockhart, joined by the dissent, see<i> post</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311,<i> </i>next says that the provision\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history supports the view that Congress deliberately structured \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) to treat state and federal predicates differently.  They rely on two sources.  The first is a reference in a Report from the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996,\n\n110Stat.\n3009\xe2\x80\x9326.  That Act was the first to add the language at issue here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.  (It was initially added to \xc2\xa72252(b)(1), then added two years later to \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Report noted that the enhancement applies to persons with prior convictions \xe2\x80\x9cunder any State child abuse law or law relating to the production, receipt or distribution of child pornography.\xe2\x80\x9d  See<i> </i>S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93358, p. 9 (1996).  But that reference incompletely describes the state pornography production and distribution predicates, which cover not only \xe2\x80\x9cproduction, receipt, or distributing of child pornography,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Report indicates, but also \xe2\x80\x9cproduction, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).  For the reasons discussed, we have no trouble concluding that the Report also incompletely describes the state sexual-abuse predicates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lockhart and the dissent also rely on a letter sent from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to the House of Representative\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on the Judiciary commenting on the proposed \xe2\x80\x9cChild Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 105\xe2\x80\x93557, pp. 26\xe2\x80\x9334 (1998).  In the letter, DOJ provides commentary on the then-present state of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72252(b)(1) and 2252(b)(2), noting that although there is a \xe2\x80\x9c5-year mandatory minimum sentence for individuals charged with receipt or distribution of child pornography and who have prior state convictions for child molestation\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to \xc2\xa72252(b)(1), there is \xe2\x80\x9cno enhanced provision for those individuals charged with possession of child pornography who have prior convictions for child abuse\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).  <i>Id.</i>, at 31.  That letter, they say, demonstrates that DOJ understood the language at issue here to impose a sentencing enhancement only for prior state convictions involving children.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We doubt that DOJ was trying to describe the full reach of the language in \xc2\xa72252(b)(1), as the dissent suggests.  To the contrary, there are several clues that the letter was relaying on just one of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s many salient features.  For instance, the letter\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9cchild molestation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cchild abuse\xe2\x80\x9d do not encompass a large number of state crimes that are unambiguously covered by \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, crimes involving \xe2\x80\x9cwards.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wards can be minors, but they can also be adults.  See,<i> e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa72243(b) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cwards\xe2\x80\x9d as persons who are \xe2\x80\x9cin official detention\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunder .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. custodial, supervisory, or disciplinary authority\xe2\x80\x9d).  More-over, we doubt that DOJ intended to express a belief that the potentially broad scope of serious crimes encompassed by \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and abusive sexual conduct\xe2\x80\x9d reaches no further than state crimes that would traditionally be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cchild molestation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cchild abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 amendment to the provision did give \xe2\x80\x9cDOJ just what it wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 10.  But the amendment also did more than that.  We therefore think it unnecessary to restrict our interpretation of the provision to the parts of it that DOJ chose to highlight in its letter.  Just as importantly, the terse descriptions of the provision in the Senate Report and DOJ letter do nothing to explain <i>why </i>Congress would have wanted to apply the mandatory minimum to individuals convicted in federal court of sex-ual abuse or aggravated sexual abuse involving an adult, but not to individuals convicted in state court of the same.  The legislative history, in short, \xe2\x80\x9chardly speaks with [a] clarity of purpose\xe2\x80\x9d through which we can discern Congress\xe2\x80\x99 statutory objective.  <i>Universal Camera Corp. </i>v. <i>NLRB</i>,\n\n340 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474,\n483 (1951)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The best explanation Lockhart can muster is a basic administrability concern: Congress \xe2\x80\x9cknew what conduct it was capturing under federal law and could be confident that all covered federal offenses were proper predicates. But Congress did not have the same familiarity with the varied and mutable sexual-abuse laws of all fifty states.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 27.  Perhaps Congress worried that state laws punishing relatively minor offenses like public lewdness or indecent exposure involving an adult would be swept into \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).  <i>Id.,</i> at 28.  But the risk Lockhart identifies is minimal.  Whether the terms in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) are given their \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d meaning, see<i> Descamps </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013); <i>Taylor </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575 (1990)\n, or are defined in light of their federal counterparts\xe2\x80\x94which we do not decide\xe2\x80\x94they are unlikely to sweep in the bizarre or unexpected state offenses that worry Lockhart.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, Lockhart asks us to apply the rule of lenity.  We have used the lenity principle to resolve ambiguity in favor of the defendant only \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed\xe2\x80\x9d when the ordinary canons of statutory construction have revealed no satisfactory construction.  <i>Callanan </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n364 U.\xc2\xa0S. 587,\n596 (1961)\n.  That is not the case here.  To be sure, Lockhart contends that if we applied a different principle of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x94namely, his \xe2\x80\x9cseries-qualifier principle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94we would arrive at an alternative construction of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).  But the arguable availability of multiple, divergent principles of statutory construction cannot automatically trigger the rule of lenity.  Cf.<i> </i>Llewellyn, Remarks on the<i> </i>Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are To Be Construed, 3 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 395, 401 (1950) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here are two opposing canons on almost every point\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, the rule of the last antecedent is well supported by context and Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s alternative is not.  We will not apply the rule of lenity to override a sensible grammatical principle buttressed by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We conclude that the text and structure of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) confirm that the provision applies to prior state convictions for \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d whether or not the convictions involved a minor or ward.  We therefore hold that Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction for sexual abuse of an adult is encompassed by \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).

And consider a law imposing a penalty for the \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of any statute, rule, or regulation relating to insider trading.\xe2\x80\x9d  Surely a person would have cause to protest if punished under that provision for violating a traffic statute.  The reason in all three cases is the same: Everyone understands that the modifying phrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinvolved with the new Star Wars movie,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin New York,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crelating to insider trading\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94applies to each term in the preceding list, not just the last.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That ordinary understanding of how English works, in speech and writing alike, should decide this case.  Avondale Lockhart is subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for possessing child pornography if, but only if, he has a prior state-law conviction for \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72252(b)(2).  The Court today, relying on what is called the \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent,\xe2\x80\x9d reads the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d as modifying only the final term in that three-item list.  But properly read, the modifier applies to each of the terms\xe2\x80\x94just as in the examples above.  That normal construction finds support in uncommonly clear-cut legislative history, which states in so many words that the three predicate crimes all involve abuse of children.  And if any doubt remained, the rule of lenity would command the same result: Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction for sexual abuse <i>of an adult </i>does not trigger \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimum penalty.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Begin where the majority does\xe2\x80\x94with the rule of the last antecedent.  See <i>ante,</i> at 3.  This Court most fully discussed that principle in <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20 (2003)\n, which considered a statute providing that an individual qualifies as disabled if \xe2\x80\x9che is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work <i>which exists in the national economy</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (quoting\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A)) (emphasis added).  The Court held, invoking the last-antecedent rule, that the italicized phrase modifies only the term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial gainful work,\xe2\x80\x9d and not the term \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work\xe2\x80\x9d occurring earlier in the sentence.  Two points are of especial note.  First, <i>Barnhart </i>contained a significant caveat: The last-antecedent rule \xe2\x80\x9ccan assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26; see, <i>e.g., Nobelman</i> v. <i>American Savings Bank</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 324\n\xe2\x80\x93331 (1993) (refusing to apply the rule when a contrary interpretation was \xe2\x80\x9cthe more reasonable one\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, the grammatical structure of the provision in <i>Barnhart </i>is nothing like that of the statute in this case: The modifying phrase does not, as here, immediately follow a list of multiple, parallel terms.  That is true as well in the other instances in which this Court has followed the rule.  See, <i>e.g., Jama </i>v.<i> Immigration and Customs Enforcement</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335 (2005)\n; <i>Batchelor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n156 U.\xc2\xa0S. 426 (1895)\n; <i>Sims Lessee</i> v. <i>Irvine</i>, 3 Dall. 425 (1799).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, this Court has made clear that the last-antecedent rule does not generally apply to the grammatical construction present here: when \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he modifying clause appear[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the end of a single, integrated list.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jama,</i> 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 344, n.\xc2\xa04.  Then, the exact opposite is usually true: As in the examples beginning this opinion, the modifying phrase refers alike to each of the list\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  A leading treatise puts the point as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a series,\xe2\x80\x9d a modifier at the end of the list \xe2\x80\x9cnormally applies to the entire series.\xe2\x80\x9d  A.

Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 147 (2012); compare <i>id.,</i> at 152 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the syntax involves something other than<i> </i>[such]<i> </i>a parallel series of nouns or verbs,\xe2\x80\x9d the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cnormally applies only to the nearest reasonable referent\xe2\x80\x9d).  That interpretive practice of applying the modifier to the whole list boasts a fancy name\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cseries-qualifier canon,\xe2\x80\x9d see Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1574 (10th ed. 2014)\xe2\x80\x94but, as my opening examples show, it reflects the completely ordinary way that people speak and listen, write and read.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even the exception to the series-qualifier principle is intuitive, emphasizing both its common-sensical basis and its customary usage.  When the nouns in a list are so disparate that the modifying clause does not make sense when applied to them all, then the last-antecedent rule takes over.  Suppose your friend told you not that she wants to meet \xe2\x80\x9can actor, director, or producer involved with Star Wars,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead that she hopes someday to meet \xe2\x80\x9ca President, Supreme Court Justice, or actor involved with Star Wars.\xe2\x80\x9d  Presumably, you would know that she wants to meet a President or Justice even if that person has no connection to the famed film franchise.  But so long as the modifying clause \xe2\x80\x9cis applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Paroline</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 9) (quoting <i>Porto Rico Railway, Light &amp; Power Co.</i> v. <i>Mor</i>,\n\n253 U.\xc2\xa0S. 345,\n348 (1920)\n).  In other words, the modifier then qualifies not just the last antecedent but the whole series.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the majority itself must acknowledge, see <i>ante, </i>at 7\xe2\x80\x938,<i> </i>this Court has repeatedly applied the series-qualifier rule in just that manner.  In <i>Paroline</i>, for example, this Court considered a statute requiring possessors of child pornography to pay restitution to the individuals whose abuse is recorded in those materials.  The law defines such a victim\xe2\x80\x99s losses to include \xe2\x80\x9cmedical services relating to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care; physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation; necessary transportation, temporary housing, and child care expenses; lost income; attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees, as well as other costs incurred; and any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72259(b)(3)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(F) (lettering omitted).  The victim bringing the lawsuit invoked the last-antecedent rule to argue that the modifier at the end of the provision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas a proximate result of the offense\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94pertained only to the last item in the preceding list, and not to any of the others.  See 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  But the Court rejected that view: It recited the \xe2\x80\x9ccanon[\xc2\xa0] of statutory construction,\xe2\x80\x9d derived from the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d use of language, that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen several words are followed by a clause\xe2\x80\x9d that can sensibly modify them all, it should be understood to do so.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Thus, the Court read the proximate-cause requirement to cover each and every term in the list.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>United States</i> v. <i>Bass</i>,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336 (1971)\n, to take just one other example, followed the same rule.  There, the Court confronted a statute making it a crime for a convicted felon to \xe2\x80\x9creceive[\xc2\xa0], possess[\xc2\xa0], or transport[\xc2\xa0] in commerce or affecting commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71202(a) (1970 ed.) (current version at\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)).  The Government contended that the modifying clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin commerce or affecting commerce\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94applied only to\xe2\x80\x9ctransport\xe2\x80\x9d and not to \xe2\x80\x9creceive\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpossess.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Court rebuffed that argument.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he natural construction of the language,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court recognized, \xe2\x80\x9csuggests that the clause \xe2\x80\x98in commerce or affecting commerce\xe2\x80\x99 qualifies all three antecedents in the list.\xe2\x80\x9d  404 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  Relying on longstanding precedents endorsing such a construction, the Court explained: \xe2\x80\x9cSince \xe2\x80\x98in commerce or affecting commerce\xe2\x80\x99 undeniably applies to at least one antecedent, and since it makes sense with all three, the more plausible construction here is that it in fact applies to all three.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 339\xe2\x80\x93340 (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Standard Brewery, Inc.</i>,\n\n251 U.\xc2\xa0S. 210,\n218 (1920)\n; <i>Porto Rico Railway</i>, 253 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 348); see also, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,\n853 (2000)\n (similarly treating the interstate commerce element in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany building, vehicle, or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce\xe2\x80\x9d as applying to buildings and vehicles).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That analysis holds equally for \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), the sentencing provision at issue here.  The relevant language\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94contains a \xe2\x80\x9csingle, integrated list\xe2\x80\x9d of parallel terms (<i>i.e.</i>, sex crimes) followed by a modifying clause.  <i>Jama</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 344, n.\xc2\xa04.  Given the close relation among the terms in the series, the modifier makes sense \xe2\x80\x9cas much to the first and other words as to the last.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Paroline</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  In other words, the reference to a minor or ward applies as well to sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse as to abusive sexual conduct.  (The case would be different if, for example, the statute established a mandatory minimum for any person previously convicted of \xe2\x80\x9carson, receipt of stolen property, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d)  So interpreting the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cas applicable to all\xe2\x80\x9d the preceding terms is what \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural construction of the language\xe2\x80\x9d requires.  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>Bass</i>, 404 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority responds to all this by claiming that the \xe2\x80\x9cinelegant phrasing\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) renders it somehow exempt from a grammatical rule reflecting \xe2\x80\x9chow people ordinarily\xe2\x80\x9d use the English language.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  But to begin with, the majority is wrong to suggest that the series-qualifier canon is only about \xe2\x80\x9ccolloquial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconversational\xe2\x80\x9d English.  <i>Ibid</i>.  In fact, it applies to both speech and writing, in both their informal and their formal varieties.  Here is a way to test my point: Pick up a journal, or a book, or for that matter a Supreme Court opinion\xe2\x80\x94most of which keep \xe2\x80\x9ceveryday\xe2\x80\x9d colloquialisms at a far distance.  <i>Ibid</i>.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll come across many sentences having the structure of the statutory provision at issue here: a few nouns followed by a modifying clause.  And you\xe2\x80\x99ll discover, again and yet again, that the clause modifies every noun in the series, not just the last\xe2\x80\x94in other words, that even (especially?) in formal writing, the series-qualifier principle works.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  And the majority is wrong too in suggesting that the \xe2\x80\x9codd repetition\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s list of state predicates causes the series-qualifier principle to lose its force.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s own made-up sentence proves that much.  If a friend asked you \xe2\x80\x9cto get her tart lemons, sour lemons, or sour fruit from Mexico,\xe2\x80\x9d you might well think her list of terms perplexing: You might puzzle over the difference between tart and sour lemons, and wonder why she had specifically mentioned lemons when she apparently would be happy with sour fruit of any kind.  But of one thing, you would have no doubt: Your friend wants some produce <i>from Mexico</i>; it would not do to get her, say, sour lemons from Vietnam.  However weird the way she listed fruits\xe2\x80\x94or the way \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) lists offenses\xe2\x80\x94the modifying clause still refers to them all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority as well seeks refuge in the idea that applying the series-qualifier canon to \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) would violate the rule against superfluity.  See <i>ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Says the majority: \xe2\x80\x9cAny conduct that would qualify as \xe2\x80\x98aggravated sexual abuse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98sexual abuse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x99 would also qualify as \xe2\x80\x98abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  But that rejoinder doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he canon against superfluity,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has often stated, \xe2\x80\x9cassists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Microsoft Corp.</i> v. <i>i4i Ltd. Partnership</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 91,\n106 (2011)\n (internal quotation marks omitted); see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Bruesewitz</i> v. <i>Wyeth LLC</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223,\n236 (2011)\n.\xc2\xa0 And the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach (as it admits, see <i>ante,</i> at 9) produces superfluity too\xe2\x80\x94and in equal measure.  Now (to rearrange the majority\xe2\x80\x99s sentence) any conduct that would qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d would also qualify as \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  In other words, on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading as well, two listed crimes become subsets of a third, so that the three could have been written as one.  And indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s superfluity has an especially odd quality, because it relates to themodifying clause itself: The majority, that is, makes the term \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d wholly unnecessary.  Remember the old adage about the pot and the kettle?  That is why the rule against superfluity cannot excuse the majority from reading \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s modifier, as ordinary usage demands, to pertain to all the terms in the preceding series.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Legislative history confirms what the natural construction of language shows: Each of the three predicate of-fenses at issue here must involve a minor.  The list of those crimes appears in two places in \xc2\xa72252(b)\xe2\x80\x94both in\xc2\xa72252(b)(1), which contains a sentencing enhancement for those convicted of distributing or receiving child pornography, and in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), which includes a similar enhancement for those (like Lockhart) convicted of possessing such material.  Descriptions of that list of offenses, made at the time Congress added it to those provisions, belie the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The relevant language\xe2\x80\x94again, providing for a manda-tory minimum sentence if a person has a prior state-lawconviction for \xe2\x80\x9caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94first made its appearance in 1996, when Congress inserted it into \xc2\xa72252(b)(1).  See Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, \xc2\xa7121(5),\n\n110Stat.\n3009\xe2\x80\x9330,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72251 note.  At that time, the Senate Report on the legislation explained what the new language meant: The mandatory minimum would apply to an \xe2\x80\x9coffender with a prior conviction under .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any <i>State child abuse law</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93358, p. 9 (1996) (emphasis added).  It is hard to imagine saying any more directly that the just-added state sexual-abuse predicates all involve minors, and minors only.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two years later, in urging Congress to include the same predicate offenses in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), the Department of Justice (DOJ) itself read the list that way.  In a formal bill comment, DOJ noted that proposed legislation on child pornography failed to fix a statutory oddity: Only \xc2\xa72252(b)(1), and not \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), then contained the state predicates at issue here.  DOJ described that discrepancy as follows: Whereas \xc2\xa72252(b)(1) provided a penalty enhancement for \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals charged with receipt or distribution of child pornography <i>and who have prior state convictions for child molestation,</i>\xe2\x80\x9d the adjacent \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) contained no such enhancement for those \xe2\x80\x9ccharged with possession of child pornography <i>who have prior convictions for child abuse</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  H. R. Rep. No. 105\xe2\x80\x93557, p. 31 (1998) (emphasis added).  That should change, DOJ wrote: A possessor of child pornography should also be subject to a 2-year mandatory minimum if he had \xe2\x80\x9ca <i>prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  DOJ thus made clear that the predicate offenses it recom-mended adding to \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x94like those already in\xc2\xa72252(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94related not to all sexual abuse but only to sexual abuse of children.  And Congress gave DOJ just what it wanted: Soon after receiving the letter, Congress added the language at issue to \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), resulting in the requested 2-year minimum sentence.  See Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998, \xc2\xa7202(a)(2),\n\n112Stat.\n2977,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 note.  So every indication, in 1998 no less than in 1996, was that all the predicate crimes relate to children alone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s response to this history fails to blunt its force.  According to the majority, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany state child abuse law\xe2\x80\x9d in the Senate Report is simply an \xe2\x80\x9cincomplete[\xc2\xa0] descri[ption]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe state sexual-abuse predicates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12.  And similarly, the majority ventures, the DOJ letter was merely noting \xe2\x80\x9cone of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s many salient features.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  But suppose that you (like the Senate Report\xe2\x80\x99s or DOJ letter\xe2\x80\x99s authors) had to paraphrase or condense the statutory language at issue here, and that you (like the majority) thought it captured <i>all</i> sexual-abuse crimes.  Would you then use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany state child abuse law\xe2\x80\x9d as a descriptor (as the Senate Report did)?  And would you refer to the whole list of state predicates as involving \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d (as the DOJ letter did)?  Of course not.  But you might well use such shorthand if, alternatively, you understood the statutory language (as I do) to cover only sexual offenses against children.  And so the authors of the Report and letter did here.  Such documents of necessity abridge statutory language; but they do not do so by conveying an utterly false impression of what that language is most centrally about\xe2\x80\x94as by describing a provision that (supposedly) covers all sexual abuse as one that reaches only child molestation.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, the majority objects that the Senate Report\xe2\x80\x99s (and DOJ letter\xe2\x80\x99s) drafters did \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to explain <i>why</i>\xe2\x80\x9d Congress would have limited \xc2\xa72252(b)\xe2\x80\x99s state sexual-abuse predicates to those involving children when the provision\xe2\x80\x99s federal sexual-abuse predicates (as all agree) are not so confined.  <i>Ante,</i> at 13 (emphasis in original).  But Congress is under no obligation to this Court to justify its choices.  (Nor is DOJ obliged to explain them to Congress itself.)  Rather, the duty is on this Court to carry out those decisions, regardless of whether it understands all that lay behind them.  The Senate Report (and DOJ letter too) says what it says about \xc2\xa72252(b)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, confirming in no uncertain terms the most natural reading of the statutory language.  Explanation or no, that is more than sufficient.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And the majority (as it concedes) cannot claim that Congress simply must have wanted \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s federal and state predicates to be the same.  See <i>ante</i>, at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur construction of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s sexual-abuse predicates does not rely on a general assumption that Congress sought full parity between all of the federal and state predicates\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is because both \xc2\xa72252(b)(1) and \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) contain many federal predicates lacking state matches.  Under \xc2\xa72252(b)(1), for example, a person is subject to a mandatory minimum if he previously violated \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71591, which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ex trafficking of children or [sex trafficking] by force, fraud, or coercion.\xe2\x80\x9d  But if the prior conviction is under state law, only sex trafficking of children will trigger that minimum; trafficking of adults, even if by force, fraud, or coercion, will not.  That mismatch\xe2\x80\x94trafficking of both adults and children on the federal side, trafficking of children alone on the state side\xe2\x80\x94precisely parallels my view of the sexual-abuse predicates at issue here.  More generally, ten federal obscenity crimes trigger both \xc2\xa72252(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s and \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced punishments; but equivalent state crimes do not do so.  And five federal prostitution offenses prompt mandatory minimums under those provisions; but no such state offenses do.  Noting those disparities, the Government concedes: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress adds state-law offenses to the lists of predicate offenses triggering child-pornography recidivist enhancements, it sometimes adds state offenses corresponding to only a subset of the federal offenses\xe2\x80\x9d previously included.  Brief for United States 43.  Just so.  And this Court ought to enforce that choice.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As against the most natural construction of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s language, plus unusually limpid legislative history, the majority relies on a structural argument.  See <i>ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  The federal sexual-abuse predicates in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), the majority begins, are described as crimes \xe2\x80\x9cunder .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Chapter 109A,\xe2\x80\x9d and that chapter \xe2\x80\x9ccriminalizes a range of sexual-abuse offenses involving adults <i>or </i>minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936(emphasis in original).  Once again, the majority cannot say that this fact alone resolves the question presented, given the many times (just discussed) that Congress opted to make federal crimes, but not equivalent state crimes, predicates for \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimums.  But the majority claims to see more than that here: The headings of the sections in Chapter 109A, it contends, \xe2\x80\x9cmirror precisely the order .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and nearly precisely the words used to describe\xe2\x80\x9d the state predicate crimes at issue.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  The majority \xe2\x80\x9ccannot state with certainty,\xe2\x80\x9d but hazards a guess that Congress thus used Chapter 109A \xe2\x80\x9cas a template for the list of state predicates\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or, otherwise said, that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cfollowed\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cstructure and language of Chapter 109A\xe2\x80\x9d in defining those state-law offenses.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s state predicates are not nearly as similar to the federal crimes in Chapter 109A as the majority claims.  That Chapter includes the following offenses: \xe2\x80\x9cAggravated sexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72241, \xe2\x80\x9cSexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa72242, \xe2\x80\x9cSexual abuse of a minor or ward,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72243, and \xe2\x80\x9cAbusive sexual contact,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244.  The Chapter thus contains <i>four</i> crimes\xe2\x80\x94one more than found in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s list of state offenses.  If the drafters of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) meant merely to copy Chapter 109A, why would they have left out one of its crimes?  The majority has no explanation.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  And there is more.  Suppose Congress, for whatever hard-to-fathom reason, wanted to replicate only Chapter 109A\xe2\x80\x99s first three offenses.  It would then have used the same language, referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse of a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d  (And had Congress used that language, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof a minor or ward\xe2\x80\x9d would clearly have applied only to the third term, to differentiate it from the otherwise identical second.)  But contra the majority, see <i>ante, </i>at 6, 9\xe2\x80\x9310,<i> </i>that is not what \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s drafters did.  Rather than repeating the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d they used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual conduct\xe2\x80\x9d in the list\xe2\x80\x99s last term\xe2\x80\x94which echoes, if anything, the separate crime of \xe2\x80\x9cabusive sexual contact\xe2\x80\x9d (included in Chapter 109A\xe2\x80\x99s <i>fourth </i>offense, as well as in other places in the federal code, see, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7920(d)).  The choice of those different words indicates, yet again, that Congress did not mean, as the majority imagines, to duplicate Chapter 109A\xe2\x80\x99s set of offenses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, even the Government has refused to accept the notion that the federal and state sexual-abuse predicates mirror each other.  The Government, to be sure, has argued that it would be \xe2\x80\x9canomalous\xe2\x80\x9d if federal, but notstate, convictions for sexually abusing adults trigger\xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced penalty.  Brief for United States 23.  (I have discussed that more modest point above: Anomalous or not, such differences between federal and state predicates are a recurring feature of the statute.  See <i>supra,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.)  But the Government, in both briefing and argument, rejected the idea that Congress wanted the list of state predicates in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) to mimic the crimes in Chapter 109A; in other words, it denied that Congress meant for the state and federal offenses to bear the same meaning.  See Brief for United States 22, n.\xc2\xa08; Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.  Even in the face of sustained questioning from Members of this Court, the Government held fast to that position.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Tr. of Oral Arg. 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (Justice Alito: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hy do you resist the argument that what Congress was doing was picking up basically the definitions of the Federal offenses [in Chapter 109A] that are worded almost identically?\xe2\x80\x9d  Assistant to the Solicitor General: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Congress was trying\xe2\x80\x9d to do that).  The listed state and federal offenses, the Government made clear, are not intended to be copies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority seems to think that view somehow consistent with its own hypothesis that Chapter 109A served as a \xe2\x80\x9ctemplate\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s state predicates, <i>ante,</i> at 6; in responding to one of Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, the majority remarks that the state predicates might have a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d meaning, distinct from Chapter 109A\xe2\x80\x99s, <i>ante,</i> at 14.  But if that is so, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s supposed template is not much of a template after all.  The predicate state offenses would \xe2\x80\x9cfollow\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparallel\xe2\x80\x9d Chapter 109A in a single respect, but not in any others\xe2\x80\x94that is, in including sexual abuse of adults, but not in otherwise defining wrongful sexual conduct (whether concerning adults or children).  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  The template, one might say, is good for this case and this case only.  And the majority has no theory for why that should be so: It offers not the slimmest explanation of how Chapter 109A can resolve today\xe2\x80\x99s question but not the many issues courts will face in the future involving the meaning of \xc2\xa72252(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s state predicate offenses.  That is because no rationale would make sense.  The right and consistent view is that Chapter 109A, like the other federal predicates in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2), is across-the-board irrelevant in defining that provision\xe2\x80\x99s state predicates.  Thus, the federal chapter\xe2\x80\x99s four differently worded crimes are independent of the three state offenses at issue here\xe2\x80\x94all of which, for the reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ve given, must \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Suppose, for a moment, that this case is not as clear as I\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested.  Assume there is no way to know whether to apply the last-antecedent or the series-qualifier rule.  Imagine, too, that the legislative history is not quite so compelling and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctemplate\xe2\x80\x9d argument not quite so strained.  Who, then, should prevail?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has a rule for how to resolve genuine ambiguity in criminal statutes: in favor of the criminal defendant.  As the majority puts the point, the rule of lenity insists that courts side with the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the ordinary canons of statutory construction have revealed no satisfactory construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 14 (citing <i>Callanan</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n364 U.\xc2\xa0S. 587,\n596 (1961)\n); see also <i>Bifulco</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 381,\n387 (1980)\n (holding that the rule of lenity \xe2\x80\x9capplies not only to interpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the very least, that principle should tip the scales in Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s favor, because nothing the majority has said shows that the modifying clause in \xc2\xa72252(b)(2) <i>unambiguously </i>applies to only the last term in the preceding series.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But in fact, Lockhart\xe2\x80\x99s case is stronger.  Consider the following sentence, summarizing various points made above: \xe2\x80\x9cThe series-qualifier principle, the legislative history, and the rule of lenity discussed in this opinion all pointin the same direction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Now answer the following question: Has only the rule of lenity been discussed in this opinion, or have the series-qualifier principle and the legislative history been discussed as well?  Even had you not read the preceding 16-plus pages, you would know the right answer\xe2\x80\x94because of the ordinary way all of us use language.  That, in the end, is why Lockhart should win.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s baseball example, see <i>ante</i>, at 4, reads the other way only because its three terms are <i>not</i> parallel.
