The state conviction triggers removal only if, by definition, the underlying crime falls within a category of removable offenses defined by federal law.  The BIA has long applied the categorical approach to assess whether a state drug conviction triggers removal under successive versions of what is now \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).  <i>Matter of Paulus</i>, 11 I. &amp; N. Dec. 274, is illustrative.  At the time the BIA decided <i>Paulus</i>, California controlled certain \xe2\x80\x9cnarcotics\xe2\x80\x9d not listed as \xe2\x80\x9cnarcotic drugs\xe2\x80\x9d under federal law.  <i>Id.</i>, at 275.  The BIA concluded that an alien\xe2\x80\x99s California conviction for offering to sell an unidentified \xe2\x80\x9cnarcotic\xe2\x80\x9d was not a deportable offense, for it was possible that the conviction involved a substance controlled only under California, not federal, law.  Under the <i>Paulus</i> analysis, Mellouli would not be deportable.  The state law involved in Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, like the California statute in <i>Paulus</i>, was not confined to federally controlled substances; it also included substances controlled only under state, not federal, law.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The BIA, however, announced and applied a different approach to drug-paraphernalia offenses (as distinguished from drug possession and distribution offenses) in <i>Matter of Martinez Espinoza</i>, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 118.  There, the BIA ranked paraphernalia statutes as relating to \xe2\x80\x9cthe drug trade in general,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoning that a paraphernalia conviction \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d any and all controlled substances, whether or not federally listed, with which the paraphernalia can be used.  <i>Id.</i>, at 120\xe2\x80\x93121.  Under this reasoning, there is no need to show that the type of controlled substance involved in a paraphernalia conviction is one defined in \xc2\xa7802.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s disparate approach to drug possession and distribution offenses and paraphernalia possession offenses finds no home in \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s text and \xe2\x80\x9cleads to consequences Congress could not have intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Moncrieffe</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  That approach has the anomalous result of treating less grave paraphernalia possession misdemeanors more harshly than drug possession and distribution offenses.  The incongruous upshot is that an alien is <i>not </i>removable for <i>possessing</i> a substance controlled only under Kansas law, but he <i>is </i>removable for using a sock to contain that substance.  Because it makes scant sense, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is owed no deference under the doctrine described in <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

The Government argues that aliens who commit <i>any</i> drug crime, not just paraphernalia offenses, in States whose drug schedules substantially overlap the federal schedules are deportable, for \xe2\x80\x9cstate statutes that criminalize hundreds of federally controlled drugs and a handful of similar substances, are laws \xe2\x80\x98relating to\xe2\x80\x99 federally controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17.  While the words \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d are broad, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading stretches the construction of \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) to the breaking point, reaching state-court convictions, like Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s, in which \xe2\x80\x9c[no] controlled substance (as defined in [\xc2\xa7802])\xe2\x80\x9d figures as an element of the offense.  Construction of \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) must be faithful to the text, which limits the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d for removal purposes, to the substances controlled under \xc2\xa7802.  Accordingly, to trigger removal under \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i), the Government must connect an element of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s conviction to a drug \xe2\x80\x9cdefined in [\xc2\xa7802].\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">719 F.\xc2\xa03d 995, reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-H">Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

During a postarrest search in a Kansas detention facility, deputies discovered four orange tablets hidden in Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s sock.  According to a probable-cause affidavit submitted in the state prosecution, Mellouli acknowledged that the tablets were Adderall and that he did not have a prescription for the drugs.  Adderall, the brand name of an amphetamine-based drug typically prescribed to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] is a controlled substance under both federal and Kansas law.

Based on the probable-cause affidavit, a criminal complaint was filed charging Mellouli with trafficking contraband in jail.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, Mellouli was charged with only the lesser offense of possessing drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor.

The BIA concluded that an alien\xe2\x80\x99s California conviction for offering to sell an unidentified \xe2\x80\x9cnarcotic\xe2\x80\x9d was not a deportable offense, for it was possible that the conviction involved a substance, such as peyote, controlled only under California law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 275\xe2\x80\x93276.<i> </i>Because the alien\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was not necessarily predicated upon a federally controlled \xe2\x80\x9cnarcotic drug,\xe2\x80\x9d the BIA concluded that the conviction did not establish the alien\xe2\x80\x99s deportability.  <i>Id.</i>, at 276.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the <i>Paulus</i> analysis, adhered to as recently as 2014 in <i>Matter of Ferreira</i>, 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 415 (BIA 2014),[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>] Mellouli would not be deportable.  Mellouli pleaded guilty to concealing unnamed pills in his sock.  At the time of Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 schedules of controlled substances included at least nine substances\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.</i>, salvia and jimson weed\xe2\x80\x94not defined in \xc2\xa7802.  See Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa765\xe2\x80\x934105(d)(30), (31).  The state law involved in Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, therefore, like the California statute in <i>Paulus</i>, was not confined to federally controlled substances; it required no proof by the prosecutor that Mellouli used his sock to conceal a substance listed under \xc2\xa7802, as opposed to a substance controlled only under Kansas law.  Under the categorical approach applied in <i>Paulus</i>, Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s drug-paraphernalia conviction does not render him deportable.  In short, the state law under which he was charged categorically \xe2\x80\x9crelat[ed] to a controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d but was not limited to substances \xe2\x80\x9cdefined in [\xc2\xa7802].\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The BIA, however, announced and applied a different approach to drug-paraphernalia offenses (as distinguished from drug possession and distribution offenses) in <i>Matter of Martinez Espinoza</i>, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 118 (2009).  There, the BIA ranked paraphernalia statutes as relating to \xe2\x80\x9cthe drug trade in general.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 121.  The BIA rejected the argument that a paraphernalia conviction should not count at all because it targeted implements, not controlled substances.  <i>Id.,</i> at 120.  It then reasoned that a paraphernalia conviction \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d any and all controlled substances, whether or not federally listed, with which the paraphernalia can be used.  <i>Id.,</i> at 121.  Under this reasoning, there is no need to show that the type of controlled substance involved in a paraphernalia conviction is one defined in \xc2\xa7802.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Immigration Judge in this case relied upon <i>Martinez Espinoza</i> in ordering Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s removal, quoting that decision for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the requirement of a correspondence between the Federal and State controlled substance schedules, embraced by <i>Matter of Paulus</i> . . . has never been extended\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to paraphernalia offenses.

Denying Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review, the Eighth Circuit deferred to the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Martinez Espinoza</i>, and held that a Kansas paraphernalia conviction \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relates to\xe2\x80\x99 a federal controlled substance because it is a crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98associated with the drug trade in general.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  719 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1000.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The disparate approach to state drug convictions, devised by the BIA and applied by the Eighth Circuit, finds no home in the text of \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).  The approach, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cleads to consequences Congress could not have intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Moncrieffe</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).

The BIA, however, has adopted conflicting positions on the meaning of \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i), distinguishing drug possession and distribution offenses from offenses involving the drug trade in general, with the anomalous result that minor paraphernalia possession offenses are treated more harshly than drug possession and distribution offenses.  Drug possession and distribution convictions trigger removal only if they necessarily involve a federally controlled substance, see <i>Paulus</i>, 11 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 274, while convictions for paraphernalia possession, an offense less grave than drug possession and distribution, trigger removal whether or not they necessarily implicate a federally controlled substance, see <i>Martinez Espinoza</i>, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 118.  The incongruous upshot is that an alien is <i>not </i>removable for <i>possessing</i> a substance controlled only under Kansas law, but he <i>is </i>removable for using a sock to contain that substance.  Because it makes scant sense, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, we hold, is owed no deference under the doctrine described in <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

As noted, \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) authorizes the removal of any alien \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of a violation of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any law or reg-ulation of a State, the United States, or a foreigncountry relating to a controlled substance (as defined in [\xc2\xa7802]).\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the Government, the words \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d modify \xe2\x80\x9claw or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cviolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (a limiting phrase ordinarily modifies the last antecedent).  Therefore, the Government argues, aliens who commit \xe2\x80\x9cdrug crimes\xe2\x80\x9d in States whose drug schedules substantially overlap the federal schedules are removable, for \xe2\x80\x9cstate statutes that criminalize hundreds of federally controlled drugs and a handful of similar substances, are laws \xe2\x80\x98relating to\xe2\x80\x99 federally controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not gainsay that, as the Government urges, the last reasonable referent of \xe2\x80\x9crelating to,\xe2\x80\x9d as those words appear in \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i), is \xe2\x80\x9claw or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The removal provision is thus satisfied when the elements that make up the state crime of conviction relate to a federally controlled substance.  As this case illustrates, however, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the federal removal statute stretches to the breaking point, reaching state-court convictions, like Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s, in which \xe2\x80\x9c[no] controlled substance (as defined in [\xc2\xa7802])\xe2\x80\x9d figures as an element of the offense.  We recognize, too, that the \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) words to which the dissent attaches great weight, <i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9crelating to,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, are \xe2\x80\x9cbroad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maracich </i>v.<i> Spears</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  As we cautioned in <i>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans</i> v. <i>Travelers Ins.

The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position here severs that link by authorizing deportation any time the state statute of conviction bears some general relation to federally controlled drugs.  The Government offers no cogent reason why its position is limited to state drug schedules that have a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial overlap\xe2\x80\x9d with the federal schedules.  Brief for Respondent 31.  A statute with <i>any </i>overlap would seem to be <i>related to</i> federally controlled drugs.  Indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position might well encompass convictions for offenses related to drug activity more generally, such as gun possession, even if those convictions do not actually involve drugs (let alone federally controlled drugs).  The Solicitor General, while resisting this particular example, acknowledged that convictions under statutes \xe2\x80\x9cthat have some connection to drugs indirectly\xe2\x80\x9d might fall within \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.  This sweeping interpretation departs so sharply from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and history that it cannot be considered a permissible reading.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, construction of \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) must be faithful to the text, which limits the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d for removal purposes, to the substances controlled under \xc2\xa7802.  We therefore reject the argument that <i>any</i> drug offense renders an alien removable, without regard to the appearance of the drug on a \xc2\xa7802 schedule.  Instead, to trigger removal under \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i), the Government must connect an element of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s conviction to a drug \xe2\x80\x9cdefined in [\xc2\xa7802].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the U.\xc2\xa0S.

Because the statute renders an alien removable whenever he is convicted of violating a law \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d a federally controlled substance, I would affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With one exception not applicable here, \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) makes removable \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspir-acy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21).\xe2\x80\x9d  I would hold, consistent with the text, that the provision requires that the conviction arise under a \xe2\x80\x9claw or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21).\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, Mellouli was properly subject to removal if the Kansas statute of conviction \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] toa controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21),\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of whether his particular conduct would also have subjected him to prosecution under federal controlled-substances laws.  See <i>ante,</i> at 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn alien\xe2\x80\x99s actual conduct is irrelevant to the inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d).

To \xe2\x80\x9crelate to\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morales</i> v. <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374,\n383 (1992)\n (quoting Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)).  In ordinary parlance, one thing can \xe2\x80\x9crelate to\xe2\x80\x9d another even if it also relates to other things.  As ordinar-ily understood, therefore, a state law regulating various controlled substances may \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21)\xe2\x80\x9d even if the statute also controls a few substances that do not fall within the federal definition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The structure of the removal statute confirms this interpretation.  Phrases like \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d have broad but indeterminate meanings that must be understood in the context of \xe2\x80\x9cthe structure of the statute and its other provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maracich</i> v. <i>Spears</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans</i> v. <i>Travelers Ins.

Several surrounding subsections of the removal statute reveal that when Congress wanted to define with greater specificity the conduct that subjects an alien to removal, it did so by omitting the expansive phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelating to.\xe2\x80\x9d  For example, a neighboring provision makes removable \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny alien who .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is convicted un-der any law of purchasing, selling, offering for sale, exchanging, using, owning, possessing, or carrying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any weapon, part, or accessory <i>which is</i> a firearm or destructive device (as defined in section 921(a) of title 18).\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(C) (emphasis added).  This language explicitly requires that the object of the offense fit within a federal definition.  Other provisions adopt similar requirements.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(E)(i) (making removable \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny alien who .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is convicted of a crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9cthe term \xe2\x80\x98crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x99 means any crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. committed by\xe2\x80\x9d a person with a specified family relationship with the victim); see generally \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) (defining certain aggravated felonies using federal definitions as elements).  That Congress, in this provision, required only that a law <i>relate</i> <i>to</i> a federally controlled substance, as opposed to <i>involve</i> such a substance, suggests that it understood \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d as having its ordinary and expansive meaning.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16,\n23 (1983)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying this interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9crelating to,\xe2\x80\x9d a conviction under Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 drug paraphernalia statute qualifies as a predicate offense under \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).  That state statute prohibits the possession or use of drug paraphernalia to \xe2\x80\x9cstore, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce a controlled substance into the human body.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x935709(b)(2) (2013 Cum. Supp.).  And, as used in this statute, a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance\xe2\x80\x9d is a substance that appears on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 schedules, \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x935701(a), which in turn consist principally of federally controlled substances.  <i>Ante,</i> at 3; see also Brief for Petitioner 3 (listing nine substances on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 schedules that were not on the federal schedules at the time of Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s arrest); Brief for Respondent 8 (noting that, at the time of Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, more than 97 percent of the named substances on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 schedules were federally controlled).  The law certainly \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21)\xe2\x80\x9d because it prohibits conduct involving controlled substances falling within the federal definition in \xc2\xa7802.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">True, approximately three percent of the substances appearing on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 lists of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s conviction did not fall within the federal definition, <i>ante,</i> at 3, meaning that an individual convicted of possessing paraphernalia may never have used his paraphernalia with a federally controlled substance.  But that fact does not destroy the relationship between the <i>law</i> and federally controlled substances.  Mellouli was convicted for violating a state law \xe2\x80\x9crelating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21),\xe2\x80\x9d so he was properly removed under\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority rejects this straightforward interpretation because it \xe2\x80\x9creach[es] state-court convictions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which \xe2\x80\x98[no] controlled substance (as defined in [\xc2\xa7802])\xe2\x80\x99 figures as an element of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 13.  This assumes the answer to the question at the heart of this case: whether the removal statute does in fact reach such convictions.  To answer that question by assuming the answer iscircular.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority hints that some more limited definition of \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d is suggested by context.  See <i>ibid.</i>  I wholeheartedly agree that we must look to context to understand indeterminate terms like \xe2\x80\x9crelating to,\xe2\x80\x9d which is why I look to surrounding provisions of the removal statute.  These \xe2\x80\x9creveal that when Congress wanted to define with greater specificity the conduct that subjects an alien to removal, it did so by omitting the expansive phrase \xe2\x80\x98relating to.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Supra,</i> at 3.  For its part, the majority looks to the context of other provisions referring to \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances\xe2\x80\x9d without a definitional parenthetical, <i>ante,</i> at 13, n.\xc2\xa011, and rejoins that the most natural reading of the statute \xe2\x80\x9cshrinks to the vanishing point the words \xe2\x80\x98as defined in [\xc2\xa7802],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>ante, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, n.\xc2\xa09.  But the definition of controlled substances <i>does</i> play a role in my interpretation, by requiring that the law bear some relationship to <i>federally</i> controlled substances.  Although we need not establish the precise boundaries of that relationship in this case given that Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 paraphernalia law clearly qualifies under any reasonable definition of \xe2\x80\x9crelating to,\xe2\x80\x9d the definition of controlled substances imposes a meaningful limit on the statutes that qualify.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority <i>appears </i>to conclude that a statute \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d a federally controlled substance if its \xe2\x80\x9cdefinition of the offense of conviction\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily includes as an element of that offense a federally controlled substance.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  The text will not bear this meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first problem with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is that it converts a removal provision expressly keyed to features of the statute itself into one keyed to features of the underlying generic offense.  To understand the difference, one need look no further than this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Moncrieffe</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).  In that case, removal was predicated on the generic offense of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.,</i> at<i> </i>___ (slip op., at 2).  Thus, in order to satisfy the federal criteria, it was necessary for the state offense at issue to have as elements the same elements that make up that generic offense.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5).  By contrast, \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) does not refer to a generic offense for which we must discern the relevant criteria from its nature.  Instead, it establishes the relevant criteria explicitly, and does so for the lawof conviction itself rather than for some underlying generic offense\xe2\x80\x94that is, the law of conviction must \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] to\xe2\x80\x9d a federally controlled substance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only plausible way of reading the text here to refer to a generic offense that has as one element the involve-ment of a federally controlled substance would be to read \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d as modifying \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9claw.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under that reading, the statute would attach immigration consequences to a \xe2\x80\x9c<i>violation </i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21),\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a violation of a \xe2\x80\x9c<i>law</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21).\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet the majority expressly\xe2\x80\x94and correctly\xe2\x80\x94rejects as grammatically incorrect Mellouli\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d clause modifies \xe2\x80\x9cviolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> Having done so, the majority can reconcile its outcome with the text only by interpreting the words \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cregulating only.\xe2\x80\x9d  It should be obvious why the majority does not make this argument explicit.  Even assuming \xe2\x80\x9cregulating only\xe2\x80\x9d were a <i>permissible</i> interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for it certainly is not the most natural one\xe2\x80\x94that interpretation would be foreclosed by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 pointed word choice in the surrounding provisions.  And given the logical upshot of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, it is it even more understandable that it avoids offering an explicit exegesis.  For unless the Court ultimately adopts the modified categorical approach for statutes, like the one at issue here, that define offenses with reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances\xe2\x80\x9d generally, and treats them as divisible by each separately listed substance, <i>ante, </i>at 6, n.\xc2\xa04, its interpretation would mean that <i>no </i>conviction under a controlled-substances regime more expansive than the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s would trigger removal.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Thus, whenever a State moves first in subjecting some newly discovered drug to regulation, every alien convicted during the lag between state and federal regulation would be immunized from the immigration consequences of his conduct.  Cf. Brief for Respondent 10 (explaining that two of the nine nonfederally controlled substances on Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 schedules at the time Mellouli was arrested became federally controlled within a year of his arrest).  And the Government could never, under \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i), remove an alien convicted of violating the controlled-substances law of a State that defines \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances\xe2\x80\x9d with reference to a list containing even one substance that does not appear on the federal schedules.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finding no support for its position in the text, the majority relies on the historical background, <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and especially the Board of Immigration Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 (BIA) decision in <i>Matter of Paulus</i>, 11 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 274 (1965)\xe2\x80\x94a surprising choice, given that the majority concludes its discussion of that history by acknowledging that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s atextual approach to the statute makes \xe2\x80\x9cscant sense,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 11.  To the extent that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach to \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) and its predecessors is consistent with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s, it suffers from the same flaw: It fails to account for the text of the removal provision because it looks at whether the <i>conviction</i> itself necessarily involved a substance regulated under federal law, not at whether the statute related to one.  See <i>Paulus</i>, 11 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 276 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly a <i>conviction</i> for illicit possession of or traffic in a substance which is defined as a narcotic drug under federal laws can be the basis for deportation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <i>Matter of Ferreira</i>, 26 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N.

True, faithfully applying that text means that an alien may be deported for committing an offense that does not involve a federally controlled substance.

I fail to understand why it chooses to do so, apart from a gut instinct that an educated professional engaged to an American citizen should not be removed for concealing unspecified orange tablets in his sock.  Or perhaps the majority just disapproves of the fact that Kansas, exercising its police powers, has decided to criminalize conduct that Congress, exercising its limited powers, has decided not to criminalize, <i>ante,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.
