All the other property claimed by Mr. Pinto for himself and others was ordered to be restored to him.

It was then stated and made to appear to the satisfaction of the circuit court that after the <em>Nereid</em> and her cargo had been libeled by the captors as prize of war in the district court and after the condemnation thereof, except the parts of the cargo which were claimed by Mr. Pinto, and during the pendency of such claim, Peter H. Schenck, the prize agent of the <em>Governor Tompkins,</em> entered the whole of the cargo of the <em>Nereid</em> at the custom house of the City of New York, and secured the duties thereon, Mr. Pinto having consented that the goods which he claimed should be entered with the others, and be subject to the payment of such duties as they were by law liable to, without prejudice to his rights under his claim; that the prize agent did enter the goods so condemned (as also the said goods of which Mr. Pinto claimed the one-fourth) as prize goods, and bonded therefor for prize duties, but was required by the collector of the customs, and did enter all the residue of the goods, claimed by Mr. Pinto, as neutral property, subject to the full duties payable on goods regularly imported in foreign bottoms, and bonded for the same accordingly.  The goods claimed by Mr. Pinto were afterwards, and before condemnation, sold by the marshal of the district, together with the goods condemned, in pursuance of an order of the district court, to which Mr. Pinto also consented, subject to the same reservation of his rights, and the proceeds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 14 U.
