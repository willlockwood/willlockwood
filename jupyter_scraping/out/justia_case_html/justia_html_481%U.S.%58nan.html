Under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1441(a), any civil action brought in state court of which the federal district courts have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant to the appropriate federal district court.  Petitioner insurer underwrites an ERISA-covered plan set up by petitioner employer to pay benefits to salaried employees disabled by sickness or accident.  After petitioners\' doctors found that respondent employee was fit to resume working, his plan benefits were discontinued, his supplemental claim for benefits was denied, and his employment was terminated when he refused to return to work.  He then filed suit in state court for reimplementation of his benefits and for related common law contract and tort claims, but petitioners removed the suit to federal court, alleging federal question jurisdiction over the disability claim by virtue of ERISA and pendent jurisdiction over the remaining claims.  The District Court found the case properly removable, and granted summary judgment for petitioners on the merits.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the District Court lacked removal jurisdiction, finding that the complaint purported to state only state law causes of action, and that the "well-pleaded complaint" rule, under which a cause of action "arises under" federal law for jurisdictional purposes only when the plaintiff\'s well-pleaded complaint raises federal law issues, did not allow removal predicated on the basis that the state law claims were subject to the federal defense of ERISA preemption.

The question presented by this litigation is whether these state common law claims are not only preempted by ERISA, but also displaced by ERISA\'s civil enforcement provision, \xc2\xa7 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1132(a)(1)(B), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] to the extent that complaints filed in state courts purporting to plead such state common law causes of action are removable to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1441(b).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>General Motors Corporation, a Delaware corporation whose principal place of business is in Michigan, has set up an employee benefit plan subject to the provisions of ERISA for its salaried employees.  The plan pays benefits to salaried employees disabled by sickness or accident, and is insured by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Metropolitan).</p>\n<p>General Motors employed Michigan resident Arthur Taylor as a salaried employee from 1959-1980.  In 1961, Taylor was involved in a job-related automobile accident, and sustained a back injury.  Taylor filed a workers\' compensation claim for this injury, and he eventually returned to work.  In May, 1980, while embroiled in a divorce and child custody dispute, Taylor took a leave of absence from his work on account of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 481 U. S. 61</a></p><p> severe emotional problems.  Metropolitan began paying benefits under General Motors\' employee benefit plan, but asked Taylor to submit to a psychiatric examination by a designated psychiatrist.  He did so, and the psychiatrist determined that Taylor was emotionally unable to work.  Six weeks later, after a followup examination, however, Metropolitan\'s psychiatrist determined that Taylor was now fit for work; Metropolitan stopped making payments as of July 30, 1980.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Taylor had filed a supplemental claim for benefits, alleging that his back injuries disabled him from continuing his work.  Metropolitan again sent Taylor to be examined, this time by an orthopedist.  The physician found no orthopedic problems, and Metropolitan subsequently denied the supplemental disability claim.  On October 31, General Motors requested that Taylor report to its medical department for an examination.  That examination took place on November 5, and a General Motors physician concluded that Taylor was not disabled.  When Taylor nevertheless refused to return to work, General Motors notified him that his employment had been terminated.</p>\n<p>Six months later, Taylor filed suit against General Motors and Metropolitan in Michigan state court praying for judgment for</p>\n<p>"compensatory damages for money contractually owed Plaintiff, compensation for mental anguish caused by breach of this contract, as well as immediate reimplementation of all benefits and insurance coverages Plaintiff is entitled to,"</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 85-688, pp. 28a-29a.  Taylor also asserted claims for wrongful termination of his employment and for wrongfully failing to promote him in retaliation for the 1961 worker\'s compensation claim.  <em>Id.</em> at 25a-26a.

Noting a split in authority on the question among the federal courts, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the Court of Appeals found that Taylor\'s complaint stated only state law causes of action subject to the federal defense of ERISA preemption, and that the "well-pleaded complaint" rule of <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.

The Court of Appeals further held that the established doctrine permitting the removal of cases purporting to state only state law causes of action in labor cases preempted by \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185, did not apply to this case.  763 F.2d at 220.

This lawsuit "relate[s] to [an] employee benefit plan."  \xc2\xa7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a).  It is based upon common law of general application that is not a law regulating insurance.  <em>See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.

Accordingly, the suit is preempted by \xc2\xa7 514(a), and is not saved by \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A).  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html#48">481 U.

S. 56</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The century-old jurisdictional framework governing removal of federal question cases from state into federal courts is described in JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s opinion for a unanimous Court in <em>Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html">463 U. S. 1</a></span> (1983).  By statute,</p>\n<p>"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1441(a).  One category of cases over which the district courts have original jurisdiction are "federal question" cases; that is, those cases "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331.  It is long-settled law that a cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff\'s well-pleaded complaint raises issues of federal law.  <em>Gully v. First National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U. S. 109</a></span> (1936); <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, supra.</em>  The "well-pleaded complaint rule" is the basic principle marking the boundaries of the federal question jurisdiction of the federal district courts.  <em>Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., supra,</em> at 9-12.</p>\n<p>Federal preemption is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff\'s suit.  As a defense, it does not appear on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, and, therefore, does not authorize removal to federal court.  <em>Gully v. First National Bank, supra.</em>  One corollary of the well-pleaded complaint rule developed in the case law, however, is that Congress may so completely preempt a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 481 U. S. 64</a></p><p> in character.  For 20 years, this Court has singled out claims preempted by \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA for such special treatment.  <em>Avco Corp. v. Machinists,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/557/case.html">390 U. S. 557</a></span> (1968).</p>\n<p>"The necessary ground of decision [in <em>Avco</em>] was that the preemptive force of \xc2\xa7 301 is so powerful as to displace entirely any state cause of action \'for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization.\'  Any such suit is purely a creature of federal law, notwithstanding the fact that state law would provide a cause of action in the absence of \xc2\xa7 301."</p>\n<p><em>Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#23">463 U. S. 23</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>There is no dispute in this litigation that Taylor\'s complaint, although preempted by ERISA, purported to raise only state law causes of action.  The question therefore resolves itself into whether or not the <em>Avco</em> principle can be extended to statutes other than the LMRA in order to recharacterize a state law complaint displaced by \xc2\xa7 502(a)(1)(B) as an action arising under federal law.  In <em>Franchise Tax Board,</em> the Court held that ERISA preemption, without more, does not convert a state claim into an action arising under federal law.  <em>Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#25">463 U. S. 25</a></span>-27.  The court suggested, however, that a state action that was not only preempted by ERISA, but also came "within the scope of \xc2\xa7 502(a) of ERISA" might fall within the <em>Avco</em> rule.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#24">463 U. S. 24</a></span>-25.  The claim in this case, unlike the state tax collection suit in <em>Franchise Tax Board,</em> is within the scope of \xc2\xa7 502(a), and we therefore must face the question specifically reserved by <em>Franchise Tax Board.</em></p>\n<p>In the absence of explicit direction from Congress, this question would be a close one.  As we have made clear today in <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html#54">481 U. S. 54</a></span>,</p>\n<p>"[t]he policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 481 U. S. 65</a></p><p> were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA."</p>\n<p><em>Cf. Franchise Tax Board of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#25">463 U. S. 25</a></span>-26 ("Unlike the contract rights at issue in <em>Avco,</em> the State\'s right to enforce its tax levies is not of central concern to the federal statute").  Even with a provision such as \xc2\xa7 502(a)(1)(B) that lies at the heart of a statute with the unique preemptive force of ERISA, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#24">463 U. S. 24</a></span>, n. 26, however, we would be reluctant to find that extraordinary preemptive power, such as has been found with respect to \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA, that converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule.  But the language of the jurisdictional subsection of ERISA\'s civil enforcement provisions closely parallels that of \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA.  Section 502(f) says:</p>\n<p>"The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, without respect to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to grant the relief provided for in subsection (a) of this section in any action."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1132(f).  <em>Cf.</em> \xc2\xa7 301(a) of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185(a).  The presumption that similar language in two labor law statutes has a similar meaning is fully confirmed by the legislative history of ERISA\'s civil enforcement provisions.  The Conference Report on ERISA describing the civil enforcement provisions of \xc2\xa7 502(a) says:</p>\n<p>"[W]ith respect to suits to enforce benefit rights under the plan or to recover benefits under the plan which do not involve application of the title I provisions, they may be brought not only in U.S. district courts but also in State courts of competent jurisdiction.  <em>All such actions in Federal or State courts are to be regarded as arising under the laws of the United States in similar fashion to</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 481 U. S. 66</a></p><p> <em>those brought under section 501 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947.</em>"</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 93-1280, p. 327 (1974) (emphasis added).  No more specific reference to the <em>Avco</em> rule can be expected, and the rest of the legislative history consistently sets out this clear intention to make \xc2\xa7 502(a)(1)(B) suits brought by participants or beneficiaries federal questions for the purposes of federal court jurisdiction in like manner as \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA.  <em>See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html#54">481 U. S. 54</a></span>-55.  For example, Senator Williams, a sponsor of ERISA, emphasized that the civil enforcement section would enable participants and beneficiaries to bring suit to recover benefits denied contrary to the terms of the plan and that, when they did so,</p>\n<p>"[i]t is intended that such actions will be regarded as arising under the laws of the United States, in similar fashion to those brought under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act."</p>\n<p>120 Cong.Rec. 29933 (1974).  <em>See also id.</em> at 29942 (remarks of Sen. Javits) (federal substantive law to "deal with issues involving rights and obligations under private welfare and pension plans").</p>\n<p>Taylor argues strenuously that this action cannot be removed to federal court, because it was not "obvious" at the time he filed suit that his common law action was both preempted by \xc2\xa7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a), and also displaced by the civil enforcement provisions of \xc2\xa7 502(a).  <em>See</em> Brief for Respondent 14-21.  But the touchstone of the federal district court\'s removal jurisdiction is not the "obviousness" of the preemption defense, but the intent of Congress.  Indeed, as we have noted, even an "obvious" preemption defense does not, in most cases, create removal jurisdiction.  In this case, however, Congress has clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of \xc2\xa7 502(a) removable to federal court.  Since we have found Taylor\'s cause of action to be within the scope of \xc2\xa7 502(a), we must honor that intent, whether preemption was obvious or not at the time this suit was filed. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 481 U.

It, therefore, "arise[s] under the . . . laws . . . of the United States," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331, and is removable to federal court by the defendants, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1441(b).

The Court rejects the position, urged by respondent, that removal jurisdiction exists only when the complaint states a claim that is "obviously" preempted by state law -- that is, when a federal statute has obviously preempted state law, or when a decision of this Court has construed an ambiguous federal statute to preempt state law.  The Court instead focuses on the "intent of Congress," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/58/case.html#66">481 U. S. 66</a></span>, to make respondent\'s cause of action removable to federal court.  This intent to preempt became effective when ERISA became law.  Consequently, although preemption was not obvious under respondent\'s standard at the time of removal,<l=>* the District Court did in fact have jurisdiction over respondent\'s preempted claim.</l=></p>\n<p>While I join the Court\'s opinion, I note that our decision should not be interpreted as adopting a broad rule that any defense premised on congressional intent to preempt state law is sufficient to establish removal jurisdiction.  The Court holds only that removal jurisdiction exists when, as here, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 481 U. S. 68</a></p><p> "Congress has <em>clearly</em> manifested an intent to make causes of action . . . <em>removable to federal court.</em>"  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  In future cases involving other statutes, the prudent course for a federal court that does not find a <em>clear</em> congressional intent to create removal jurisdiction will be to remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p>* In the understated words of a prior case which this Court repeats today, the preemption provisions of ERISA "<em>perhaps are not a model of legislative drafting,\'" <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html#46">481 U. S. 46</a></span>, quoting <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
