Fowler, a citizen of Illinois, of the sum of $6,000, for five years, with interest at the rate of ten percent per annum, payable semiannually.  The latter executed to the company six coupon bonds, of $1,000 each, dated May 1, 1874, payable May 1, 1879, with interest semiannually at the rate of seven percent per annum, the principal and interest payable at the office of the company in New York.  As security for the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon, the borrower conveyed to Jonathan Edwards, trustee, a lot in Springfield, Illinois, with the appurtenances thereon.

When this decree was entered, the defendants filed a written motion and petition for rehearing, in respect to which the same proceedings were had as in the preceding cases.  A formal order for rehearing was made June 30, 1885, and entered as of October 31, 1884, and there was a final decree, January 11, 1887, in favor of plaintiff for $5,411.23, of which $5,381.83 was found to be the principal sum actually received by the defendants, and $29.40 to have been paid for insurance.

JUSTICE HARLAN, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>These appeals are from the same decree.  The cases arise under the usury laws of Illinois.  They do not differ materially from Nos. 32 and 33 except as to the amount of the loan.  The answer raises the same questions as were raised in those cases.  The decree gave no credit on the principal sum for payments on account of interest, but was for the amount actually received by the borrower in cash, and the sum paid by the mortgagee for insurance, with interest on the aggregate amount at six percent from the date of its rendition.  Under the statute of Illinois relating to interest upon the loan or forbearance of money, and for the reasons given in the opinion in cases Nos. 32 and 3, the loan in question must be held to have been usurious, and the decree should have been in conformity with the principles announced in those cases.</p>\n<p>The decree is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed, with costs, and the cause is remanded, with instructions to make such modifications in the decree as will be consistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
