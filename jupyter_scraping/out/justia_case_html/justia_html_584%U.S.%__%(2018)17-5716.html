Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sentences do not fall into this category because the District Court did not consider the Guidelines ranges in imposing its ultimate sentences.

First, they insist that because this Court has said that the Guidelines ranges serve as \xe2\x80\x9cthe starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> Peugh</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530, 542, <i>all</i> sentences are \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d Guidelines ranges.  But that does not follow.  Just because district courts routinely calculate defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Guidelines ranges does not mean that any sentence subsequently imposed must be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a Guidelines range.  What matters instead is the role that the Guidelines range played in the selection of the sentence eventually imposed.  And here the ranges played no relevant role.  Second, petitioners argue that even if their sentences were not actually based on the Guidelines ranges, they are eligible under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) because their sentences <i>should have been</i> based on those ranges.  But even assuming that this is the correct interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cbased on,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners are not eligible because the District Court made no mistake in sentencing them.  The court properly discarded their Guidelines ranges and permissibly considered only factors related to substantial assistance when departing downward.  Third, petitioners stress that the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statement shows that defendants in their shoes should be eligible for sentence reductions.  Policy statements, however, cannot make defendants eligible when \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) makes them ineligible.  Fourth, petitioners contend that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule creates unjustifiable sentencing disparities, but, in fact, the rule avoids such disparities.  Identically situated defendants sentenced today may receive the same sentences petitioners received, and those defendants, like petitioners, are not eligible for sentence reductions under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).

The five petitioners in today\xe2\x80\x99s case claim to be eligible under this provision.  They were convicted of drug offenses that carried statutory mandatory minimum sentences, but they received sentences below these mandatory minimums, as another statute allows, because they substantially assisted the Government in prosecuting other drug offenders.  We hold that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sentences were \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d their mandatory minimums and on their substantial assistance to the Government, not on sentencing ranges that the Commission later lowered.  Petitioners are therefore ineligible for \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) sentence reductions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">All five petitioners pleaded guilty before the same sentencing judge to methamphetamine conspiracy offenses that subjected them to mandatory minimum sentences under\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1).  Before the District Court imposed those sentences, however, it first calculated petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 advisory Guidelines ranges, as district courts do in sentencing proceedings all around the country.  These ranges take into account the seriousness of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offense and his criminal history in order to produce a set of months as a recommended sentence (<i>e.g.</i>, 151 to 188 months for petitioner Koons).  But not only are these ranges advisory, they are also tentative: They can be overridden by other considerations, such as a congressionally mandated minimum sentence.  Indeed, the Guidelines themselves instruct that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the [final] guideline sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa75G1.1(b) (Nov. 2016) (USSG); see also \xc2\xa71B1.1(a)(8).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is what happened here.  In each of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 cases, the top end of the Guidelines range fell below the applicable mandatory minimum sentence, and so the court concluded that the mandatory minimum superseded the Guidelines range.  <i>E.g.</i>,<i> </i>App. 197; see also <i>id.</i>, at 70.  Thus, in all five cases, the court discarded the advisory ranges in favor of the mandatory minimum sentences.  See <i>id.</i>, at 114\xe2\x80\x93115, 148, 174, 197, 216.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When a statute sets out a mandatory minimum sentence, a defendant convicted under that statute will generally receive a sentence at or above the mandatory minimum\xe2\x80\x94but not always.  If the defendant has substantially assisted the Government \xe2\x80\x9cin the investigation or prosecution of another person,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government may move under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(e) to allow the district court to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a sentence below\xe2\x80\x9d the mandatory minimum \xe2\x80\x9cso as to reflect [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government filed such motions in each of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 cases, and in each case, the District Court departed downward from the mandatory minimum because of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 substantial assistance.  In settling on the final sentences, the court considered the so-called \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial-assistance factors\xe2\x80\x9d found in \xc2\xa75K1.1(a) of the Guidelines, all of which relate to the assistance defendants supply the Government.  App. 80, 197; see, <i>e.g.</i>, USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75K1.1(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), (5) (the \xe2\x80\x9cextent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctimeliness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csignificance[,] and usefulness\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assistance and the \xe2\x80\x9ctruthfulness, completeness, and reliability of [the] information\xe2\x80\x9d provided).  In no case did the court consider the original drug Guidelines ranges that it had earlier discarded.  See App. 115\xe2\x80\x93116, 148\xe2\x80\x93154, 174\xe2\x80\x93177, 197\xe2\x80\x93198, 216\xe2\x80\x93218.  The sentences ultimately imposed in these cases represented downward departures from the mandatory minimums of between 25 and 45 percent.  See Brief for United States 3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Years after petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sentences became final, the Sentencing Commission issued amendment 782, which reduced the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 base offense levels for certain drug offenses, including those for which petitioners were convicted.  See USSG App. C, Amdt. 782 (Supp. Nov. 2012\xe2\x80\x93Nov. 2016); see also <i>Hughes</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 7.

The courts below held that petitioners could not make that showing, App. 93\xe2\x80\x9397; 850 F.\xc2\xa03d 973, 977 (CA8 2017), and we granted certiorari to review the question, 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We hold that petitioners do not qualify for sentence reductions under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) because their sentences were not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d their lowered Guidelines ranges.

The Guidelines range will often play that part, for district judges must calculate the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s advisory range and then will frequently tie the sentence they impose to that range.  See <i>ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310; see also \xc2\xa73553(a)(4).  But that is not always the case.  After all, the Guidelines are advisory, and in some instances they even explicitly call for the ranges to be tossed aside.  When that happens\xe2\x80\x94when the ranges play no relevant part in the judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x94the resulting sentence is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a Guidelines range.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sentences fall into this latter category of cases.

On the contrary, the court scrapped the ranges in favor of the mandatory minimums, and never considered the ranges again; as the court explained, the ranges dropped out of the case.  App. 114\xe2\x80\x93115, 148, 174, 197, 216.  And once out of the case, the ranges could not come close to forming the \xe2\x80\x9cbasis for the sentence that the District Court imposed,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hughes</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 14, and petitioners thus could not receive \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) sentence reductions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 four counterarguments do not change our conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, petitioners insist that because the Guidelines ranges serve as \xe2\x80\x9cthe starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> Peugh</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530, 542 (2013), <i>all</i> sentences are \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d Guidelines ranges.  See Brief for Petitioners 21\xe2\x80\x9322; Reply Brief 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  It is true that our cases require sentencing judges to calculate the now-advisory Guidelines range in every sentencing proceeding.  And it is true that many judges use those ranges as \xe2\x80\x9cthe foundation of [their] sentencing decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hughes</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 8.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But it does not follow that any sentence subsequently imposed must be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a Guidelines range.  What matters, instead, is the role that the Guidelines range played in the selection of the sentence eventually imposed\xe2\x80\x94not the role that the range played in the initial calculation.  And here, while consideration of the ranges may have served as the \xe2\x80\x9cstarting point\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that the court began by calculating those ranges, the ranges clearly did not form the \xe2\x80\x9cfoundation\xe2\x80\x9d of the sentences ultimately selected.  See <i>Hughes</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  In constructing a house, a builder may begin by considering one design but may ultimately decide to use entirely different plans.  While the first design would represent the starting point in the builder\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process, the house finally built would not be \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d that design.  The same is true here.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sentences were not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d Guidelines ranges that the sentencing judge dis- carded in favor of mandatory minimums and substantial-assistance factors.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, petitioners argue that even if their sentences were not actually based on their Guidelines ranges, they are eligible under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) because their sentences <i>should have been</i> based on those ranges.  See Brief for Petitioners 25\xe2\x80\x9334.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  But even under that reading of \xe2\x80\x9cbased on,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners are not eligible because the District Court made no mistake at sentencing.  Petitioners emphasize that when a court departs downward because of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance, \xc2\xa73553(e) requires it to impose a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 28 (emphasis deleted).  But that does not mean \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the guidelines <i>range</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, a court imposes a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d when it follows the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94including the parts of the Guidelines that instruct it to disregard the advisory ranges, see USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.1(a)(8), 5G1.1(b)\xe2\x80\x94in settling on a sentence.  And that is precisely what the court did here.  It properly discarded the advisory ranges, <i>ibid.</i>, and<i> </i>permissibly considered only factors related to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 substantial assistance, rather than factors related to the advisory ranges, as a guide in determining how far to depart downward, USSG \xc2\xa75K1.1.  See \xc2\xa73553(e).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, petitioners stress that the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statement makes clear that the Commission wanted defendants in their shoes to be eligible for sentence reductions.  Brief for Petitioners 35\xe2\x80\x9338; see USSG \xc2\xa71B1.10(c) (policy statement).  But the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statement cannot alter \xc2\xa73582(c)(2), which applies only when a sentence was \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a subsequently lowered range.  The Sentencing Commission may limit the application of its retroactive Guidelines amendments through its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98applicable policy statements.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dillon</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 817, 824\xe2\x80\x93826 (2010).  But policy statements cannot make a defendant eligible when \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) makes him ineligible.  See <i>id.</i>, at 824\xe2\x80\x93825.  In short, because petitioners do not satisfy \xc2\xa73582(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s threshold \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, the Commission had no power to enable their sentence reductions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth and finally, far from creating \xe2\x80\x9cunjustifiable sentencing disparities,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 38\xe2\x80\x9342, our rule <i>avoids</i> such disparities.  Identically situated defendants sentenced today may receive the same sentences as petitioners received.  See App. 89\xe2\x80\x9390.
