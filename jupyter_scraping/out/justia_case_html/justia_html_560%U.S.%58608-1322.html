RATLIFF</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931322.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 22, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 14, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Ratliff was Ruby Kills Ree\xe2\x80\x99s attorney in Ree\xe2\x80\x99s successful suit against the United States Social Security Administration for Social Security benefits.  The District Court granted Ree\xe2\x80\x99s unopposed motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which provides, <em>inter alia,</em> that \xe2\x80\x9ca court shall award to a prevailing party \xe2\x80\xa6 fees and other expenses \xe2\x80\xa6 in any civil action \xe2\x80\xa6 brought by or against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  Before paying the fees award, the Government discovered that Ree owed the United States a debt that predated the award.  Accordingly, it sought an administrative offset against the award under 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716, which subjects to offset all \xe2\x80\x9cfunds payable by the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delinquent federal debts, see \xc2\xa73701(b), unless, <em>e.g.,</em> payment is exempted by statute or regulation.  See, <em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa73716(e)(2).  The parties to this case have not established that any such exemption applies to \xc2\xa72412(d) fees awards, which, as of 2005, are covered by the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s Offset Program (TOP).  After the Government notified Ree that it would apply TOP to offset her fees award against a portion of her debt, Ratliff intervened, challenging the offset on the grounds that \xc2\xa72412(d) fees belong to a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney and thus may not be used to satisfy the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s federal debts.  The District Court held that because \xc2\xa72412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party,\xe2\x80\x9d not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to challenge the offset.  The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that under its precedent, EAJA attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees are awarded to prevailing parties\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees award is payable to the litigant and is therefore subject to an offset to satisfy the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing debt to the Government.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Nothing in EAJA contradicts this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding view that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees statutes is a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of art\xe2\x80\x9d that refers to the prevailing litigant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</em> v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/598/index.html">532 U. S. 598</a>, 603.  That the term has its usual meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is underscored by the fact that subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions clearly distinguish the party who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees.  The Court disagrees with Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that subsection (d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d nonetheless renders \xc2\xa72412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  The dictionaries show that, in the litigation context, the transitive verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d has the settled meaning of giving or assigning <em>by</em> judicial decree.  Its plain meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is thus that the court shall \xe2\x80\x9cgive or assign by \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial determination\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d (here, Ree) attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in the amount sought and substantiated under, <em>inter alia</em>, subsection (d)(1)(B).  That the prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney may have a beneficial interest or a contractual right in the fees does not alter this conclusion.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s argument that other EAJA provisions, combined with the Social Security Act (SSA) and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases, render \xc2\xa72412(d) at least ambiguous on the question presented here, and that these other provisions resolve the ambiguity in her favor.  Even accepting that \xc2\xa72412(d) is ambiguous\xc2\xb8 the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions differentiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards.  Nor is the necessity of such payments established by the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies.  That SSA fees awards are payable directly to a prevailing claimant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7406(b)(1)(A), undermines Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s case by showing that Congress knows how to create a direct fee requirement where it desires to do so.  Given the stark contrast between the language of the SSA and EAJA provisions, the Court is reluctant to interpret subsection (d)(1)(A) to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence that such a requirement applies.  Such evidence is not supplied by a 1985 EAJA amendment requiring that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7406(b) and 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)], the \xe2\x80\xa6 attorney [must] refun[d] to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  See note following \xc2\xa72412.  Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this recognition that an attorney will sometimes \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d) fees suggests that subsection (d)(1)(A) should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that the SSA expressly authorizes gives more weight to \xe2\x80\x9crecei[pt]\xe2\x80\x9d than the term can bear: The ensuing reference to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to \xe2\x80\x9crefund\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller fee to the claimant demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first place.  Moreover, Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s reading is irreconcilable with the textual differences between the two Acts.  The fact that the Government, until 2006, frequently paid EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in SSA cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney her rights in the award does not alter the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s fees provision.  That some such cases involved a prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising, given that it was not until 2005 that the TOP was modified to require offsets against attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awards.  And as Ratliff admits, the Government has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has assigned her right to fees to the attorney.  Finally, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988, which contains language virtually identical to \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s.

S. C. \xc2\xa72412(d), provides in pertinent part that \xe2\x80\x9ca court shall award to a prevailing party \xe2\x80\xa6 fees and other expenses \xe2\x80\xa6 in any civil action \xe2\x80\xa6 brought by or against the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  We consider whether an award of \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72412(d) is payable to the litigant or to his attorney.  We hold that a \xc2\xa72412(d) fees award is payable to the litigant and is therefore subject to a Government offset to satisfy a pre-existing debt that the litigant owes the United States.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arises out of proceedings in which a Social Security claimant, Ruby Willows Kills Ree, prevailed on a claim for benefits against the United States.  Respondent Catherine Ratliff was Ree\xe2\x80\x99s attorney in those proceedings.  The District Court granted Ree\xe2\x80\x99s unopposed motion for a \xc2\xa72412(d) fees award in the amount of $2,112.60.  Before the United States paid the fees award, however, it discovered that Ree owed the Government a debt that predated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the award.  Accordingly, the United States sought an administrative offset against the fees award to satisfy part of that debt.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to use administrative offsets is statutory.  See 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73711(a), 3716(a) (authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are unsuccessful to \xe2\x80\x9ccollect the claim by administrative offset\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Congress has subjected to offset all \xe2\x80\x9cfunds payable by the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delinquent federal debts, see \xc2\xa73701(b), unless, as relevant here, payment is exempted by statute, see \xc2\xa73716(e)(2).  No such exemption applies to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awards under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(A)), which are otherwise subject to offset, see 31 CFR \xc2\xa7285.5(e)(1) (2009), and which, as of January 2005, are covered by the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) operated by the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s Financial Management Service (FMS).  See Brief for Petitioner 4 (explaining TOP\xe2\x80\x99s extension to cover so-called \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98miscellaneous\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d payments that include attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees payments\nthe Treasury Department makes on behalf of federal agencies).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the Government, relying on the TOP, notified Ree that the Government would apply her \xc2\xa72412(d) fees award to offset a portion of her outstanding federal debt.  Ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the grounds that \xc2\xa72412(d) fees belong to a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney and thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s federal debts.  The District Court held that because \xc2\xa72412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the prevailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to challenge the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed offset.  See No. CIV. 06\xe2\x80\x935070\xe2\x80\x93RHB, 2007 WL 6894710, *1 (D SD, May 10, 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.  540 F.\xc2\xa03d 800 (2008).  It held that under Circuit precedent, \xe2\x80\x9cEAJA attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees are awarded to prevailing parties\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 802.  The Court of Appeals recognized that its decision did not accord with a \xe2\x80\x9cliteral interpretation of the EAJA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and exacerbated a split among the Courts of Appeals, compare <em>id</em>., at 801\xe2\x80\x93802, with, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Reeves</em> v. <em>Astrue</em>, 526 F.\xc2\xa03d 732, 733 (CA11 2008); <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Astrue</em>, 510 F.\xc2\xa03d 1246, 1249\xe2\x80\x931251 (CA10 2007); <em>FDL Technologies, Inc</em>. v. <em>United States</em>, 967 F.\xc2\xa02d 1578, 1580 (CA Fed. 1992); <em>Panola Land Buying Assn.</em> v. <em>Clark</em>, 844 F.\xc2\xa02d 1506, 1510\xe2\x80\x931511 (CA11 1988).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We granted certiorari.  557 U.

We have long held that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in fee statutes is a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of art\xe2\x80\x9d that refers to the prevailing litigant.

S. 598</a>, 603 (2001).  This treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98American Rule\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that each <em>litigant</em> \xe2\x80\x9cbear [his] own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 602 (citing <em>Key Tronic Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/809/index.html">511 U. S. 809</a>, 819 (1994)).  Nothing in EAJA supports a different reading.  Cf. <em>Arthur Andersen LLP</em> v. <em>Carlisle</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2009) (slip op., at 6, n.\xc2\xa04) (where Congress employs \xe2\x80\x9cidentical words and phrases within the same statute,\xe2\x80\x9d they are presumed to carry \xe2\x80\x9cthe same meaning\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, other subsections within \xc2\xa72412(d) underscore that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (d)(1)(A) carries its usual and settled meaning\xe2\x80\x94prevailing litigant.  Those other subsections clearly distinguish the party who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(B)) (the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d must apply for the fees award and \xe2\x80\x9csho[w]\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9cis a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award\xe2\x80\x9d by, among other things, submitting \xe2\x80\x9can itemized statement <em>from any attorney</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>representing or appearing in behalf of the party</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that details the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s hourly rate and time spent on the case (emphasis added)); see also Part III, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection (d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d renders \xc2\xa72412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney and thus protects the fees from a Government offset against the prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s federal debts.  See Brief for Respondent 11\xe2\x80\x9319 (arguing that subsection (d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98award\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly incorporates a critical distinction\xe2\x80\x9d between the right to an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98award\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of fees and the right to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98receiv[e]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the fees).  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The transitive verb \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98award\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d has a settled meaning in the litigation context: It means \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o give or assign <em>by</em> sentence or judicial determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 125 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cto give <em>by</em> judicial decree\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The plain meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (d)(1)(A) is thus that the court shall \xe2\x80\x9cgive or assign by \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial determination\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d (here, Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s client Ree) attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in the amount sought and substantiated under, <em>inter alia</em>, subsection (d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny.  According to Ratliff, subsection (d)(1)(B), which uses \xe2\x80\x9cthe noun \xe2\x80\x98award\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to mean a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98decision,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d requires us to construe subsection (d)(1)(A) (which uses \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d as a verb) to mean that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly the prevailing party may receive the <em>award</em> (the decision granting fees), but only the attorney who earned the <em>fee</em> (the payment asked or given for professional services) is entitled to receive it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 16, 15 (emphasis in original; some internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  This argument ignores the settled definitions above, and even the definitions Ratliff proffers, because each makes clear that the verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (d)(1)(A) means to \xe2\x80\x9cgive <em>by</em> the decision of a law court\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cgrant \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>by</em> judicial decree,\xe2\x80\x9d not simply to \xe2\x80\x9cgive a decision\xe2\x80\x9d itself.  <em>Id.,</em> at 16, and n. 39 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  We thus agree with the Government that under the statutory language here, the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial decision is the <em>means</em> by which the court confers a right to payment upon the prevailing party; it is not itself the <em>thing</em> that the court gives (or orders the defendant to give) to the party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 4 (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Hewitt</em> v. <em>Helms</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/755/index.html">482 U. S. 755</a>, 761 (1987) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all civil litigation, the judicial decree is not the end but the means\xe2\x80\x9d)).  This settled and natural construction of the operative statutory language is reflected in our cases.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Scarborough</em> v. <em>Principi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/401/index.html">541 U. S. 401</a>, 405 (2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cEAJA authorizes the <em>payment</em> of fees <em>to</em> a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s final textual argument\xe2\x80\x94that subsection (d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x9d itself establishes that the fees are payable to the prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, see Brief for Respondent 19\xe2\x80\x9322\xe2\x80\x94proves far too much.  The fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party fees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest or a contractual right does not establish that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cawards\xe2\x80\x9d the fees directly to the attorney.  For the reasons we have explained, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain text does the opposite\xe2\x80\x94it \xe2\x80\x9cawards\xe2\x80\x9d the fees to the litigant, and thus subjects them to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has outstanding federal debts.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an effort to avoid the Act\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning, Ratliff argues that other provisions of EAJA, combined with the SSA and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases, render \xc2\xa72412(d) at least ambiguous on the question presented here, and that these other provisions resolve the ambiguity in her favor.  Again we disagree.  Even accepting \xc2\xa72412(d) as ambiguous on the question presented, the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter our conclusion that EAJA fees are payable to litigants and are thus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding federal debts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s provisions differentiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards.  As noted above, subsection (d)(1)(B) requires the prevailing party to submit a fee application showing that she is otherwise \xe2\x80\x9celigible to receive an award\xe2\x80\x9d and, as a complement to that requirement, compels the prevailing party to submit \xe2\x80\x9can itemized statement <em>from any attorney</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>representing or appearing in behalf of the party</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that details the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s hourly rate and time the attorney spent on the case.  (Emphasis added.)  This language would make little sense if, as Ratliff contends, \xc2\xa72412(d)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d language effectively refers to the prevailing litigant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  Subsection (d)(1)(B) similarly makes clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d (not her attorney) is the recipient of the fees award by requiring the <em>prevailing party </em>to demonstrate that <em>her</em> net worth falls within the range the statute requires for fees awards.  And EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s cost provision further underscores the point.  That provision uses language identical to that in the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees provision to allow prevailing parties to recover \xe2\x80\x9cthe reasonable expenses of expert witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to prepare \xe2\x80\x9cthe party\xe2\x80\x99s case,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(2)(A), yet Ratliff does not argue that it makes costs payable directly to the vendors who provide the relevant services.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies establish that subsection (d)(1)(A) fees awards are payable to prevailing parties\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys.  It is true that the SSA makes fees awards under that statute payable directly to a prevailing claimant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7406(b)(1)(A) (providing that where a claimant \xe2\x80\x9cwho was represented before the court by an attorney\xe2\x80\x9d obtains a favorable judgment, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of\xe2\x80\x9d the benefits award and may certify the full amount of the statutory fees award <em>\xe2\x80\x9cfor payment to such attorney</em> out of, and not in addition to, the amount of\xe2\x80\x9d the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s benefits award (emphasis added)).  But the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s express authorization of such payments undermines Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s case insofar as it shows that Congress knows how to make fees awards payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.  Given the stark contrast between the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s express authorization of direct payments to attorneys and the absence of such language in subsection (d)(1)(A), we are reluctant to interpret the latter provision to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence supporting such an interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ratliff contends that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1985 amendments to \xc2\xa7206(b) of EAJA supply just such evidence, at least in Social Security cases.   See \xc2\xa73(2), 99 Stat. 186, note following 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412.  The 1985 amendments address the fact that Social Security claimants may be eligible to receive fees awards under both the SSA and EAJA, and clarify the procedure that attorneys and their clients must follow to prevent the windfall of an unauthorized double recovery of fees for the same work.  Section 206(b) provides that no violation of law occurs \xe2\x80\x9cif, where the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7406(b) and 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)], the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to Ratliff, the fact that \xc2\xa7206(b) recognizes, or at least assumes, that an attorney will sometimes \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d fees under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d) suggests that we should construe subsection (d)(1)(A) to incorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that the SSA expressly authorizes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument gives more weight to \xc2\xa7206(b)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to attorney \xe2\x80\x9crecei[pt]\xe2\x80\x9d of fees than the reference can bear.  Section 206(b)\xe2\x80\x99s ensuing reference to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to \xe2\x80\x9crefun[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the amount of the smaller fee to the claimant, which reference suggests that the award belongs to the claimant in the first place, alone undercuts Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9creceives\xe2\x80\x9d as implying an initial statutory payment to the attorney.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s reading is in any event irreconcilable with the textual differences between EAJA and the SSA we discuss above.  Thus, even accepting Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s argument that subsection (d)(1)(A) is ambiguous, the statutory provisions she cites resolve any ambiguity in favor of treating subsection (d)(1)(A) awards as payable to the prevailing litigant, and thus subject to offset where the litigant has relevant federal debts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s history of paying EAJA awards directly to attorneys in certain cases does not compel a different conclusion.  The Government concedes that until 2006, it \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently paid EAJA fees in Social Security cases directly to attorneys.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 13.  But this fact does not alter our interpretation of subsection (d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d language or the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations under the statute.  As the Government explains, it most often paid EAJA fees directly to attorneys in cases in which the prevailing party had assigned its rights in the fees award to the attorney (which assignment would not be necessary if the statute rendered the fees award payable to the attorney in the first instance).  The fact that some such cases involved a prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising given that it was not until 2005 that the Treasury Department modified the TOP to require offsets against \xe2\x80\x9cmiscellaneous\xe2\x80\x9d payments such as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awards.  And as Ratliff admits, the Government has since continued the direct payment practice only in cases where \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff does not owe a debt to the government and assigns the right to receive the fees to the attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 28 (boldface deleted).  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to continue direct payments only in such cases is easily explained by the 2005 amendments to the TOP, and nothing about the Government\xe2\x80\x99s past payment practices altered the statutory text that governs this case or estopped the Government from conforming its payment practices to the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s revised regulations.  For all of these reasons, neither EAJA nor the SSA supports Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s reading of subsection (d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988, which contains language virtually identical to the EAJA provision we address here,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] buttress this conclusion.  Our most recent cases applying \xc2\xa71988(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d language recognize the practical reality that attorneys are the beneficiaries and, almost always, the ultimate recipients of the fees that the statute awards to \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing part[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Venegas</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/82/index.html">495 U. S. 82</a>, 86 (1990).  But these cases emphasize the nonstatutory (contractual and other assignment-based) rights that typically confer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of the fees award the statute confers on the prevailing litigant.  As noted above, these kinds of arrangements would be unnecessary if, as Ratliff contends, statutory fees language like that in \xc2\xa71988(b) and EAJA provides attorneys with a statutory right to direct payment of awards.  Hence our conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe party, rather than the lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 87, is \xe2\x80\x9centitle[d] to receive the fees\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71988(b), <em>id.</em>, at 88, and that the statute \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols what the losing defendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff must pay his lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 90; see also <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Jeff D.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/717/index.html">475 U.

See Brief for Respondent 8, 46 (citing 31 CFR \xc2\xa7285.5(e)(5)).  We need not decide this question because Ratliff did not raise the regulations as a bar to offset in her brief in opposition to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari, see this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2, or in the proceedings below.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The split exists in the Social Security context because the Social Security Act (SSA), 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U.

That is not accurate.  As we have explained, Social Security claimants and attorneys normally enter into contingent-fee agreements that are subject to judicial \xe2\x80\x9creview for reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gisbrecht</em> v. <em>Barnhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/789/index.html">535 U. S. 789</a>, 809 (2002).  Where the court allows a fee, \xc2\xa7406(b) permits the Commissioner to collect the approved fee out of the client\xe2\x80\x99s benefit award and to certify the fee for \xe2\x80\x9cpayment to such attorney out of\xe2\x80\x9d that award.  \xc2\xa7406(b)(1)(A).  In such cases, the attorney would \xe2\x80\x9crefun[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the fee to the client in the event that the attorney also receives a (larger) EAJA award, because the attorney \xe2\x80\x9creceive[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the SSA fee from the client\xe2\x80\x99s funds.  Similarly inaccurate is Ratliff\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that our construction of EAJA \xc2\xa7206(b)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9crefun[d]\xe2\x80\x9d would preclude attorneys from collecting any fees from a prevailing party until both SSA and EAJA payments are awarded.  Our construction does not alter or preclude what we have recognized as courts\xe2\x80\x99 common practice of awarding EAJA fees at the time a court remands a case to the Social Security Administration (Administration) for benefits proceedings.  Such awards often allow attorneys to collect EAJA fees months before any fees are awarded under 42 U. S.C \xc2\xa7406(b), because \xc2\xa7406(b) fees cannot be determined until the Administration enters a final benefits ruling.

S. C. \xc2\xa72412(d) is payable to the prevailing litigant rather than the attorney.  The EAJA does not legally obligate the Government to pay a prevailing litigant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, and the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to pay her attorney is controlled not by the EAJA but by contract and the law governing that contract.  That conclusion, however, does not answer the question whether Congress intended the Government to deduct moneys from EAJA fee awards to offset a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing and unrelated debt, as the Treasury Department began to do only in 2005 pursuant to its authority under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA).  In my view, it is likely both that Congress did not consider that question and that, had it done so, it would not have wanted EAJA fee awards to be subject to offset.  Because such offsets undercut the effectiveness of the EAJA and cannot be justified by reference to the DCIA\xe2\x80\x99s text or purpose, it seems probable that Congress would have made, and perhaps will in the future make, the opposite choice if clearly presented with it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In enacting the EAJA, Congress found \xe2\x80\x9cthat certain individuals, partnerships, corporations, and labor and other organizations may be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights in civil actions and in administrative proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7202(a), 94 Stat. 2325, note following 5 U.

But it is common sense that increasing the risk that an attorney will not receive a fee award will inevitably decrease the willingness of attorneys to undertake representation in these kinds of cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Government contends that any disincentive the fear of administrative offset may create is mitigated in the Social Security context by the Social Security Act\xe2\x80\x99s independent provision authorizing a fee award payable directly to the attorney.  See <em>id.,</em> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7406(b)(1)(A)).  But as the Government acknowledges, the \xe2\x80\x9cEAJA\xe2\x80\x99s fee-shifting provisions are potentially more generous than [the Social Security Act\xe2\x80\x99s] in at least three respects\xe2\x80\x9d: (1) A court may not award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under the Social Security Act, but may under the EAJA, when the claimant wins only a procedural victory and does not obtain any past-due benefits; (2) fees under the Social Security Act are limited to a percentage of benefits awarded, while EAJA fees are calculated under the lodestar method by examining the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable hours expended and her reasonable hourly rate; and (3) in contrast to the Social Security Act, fees may be awarded under the EAJA in addition to, rather than out of, the benefits awarded.  Brief for Petitioner 6\xe2\x80\x937.  EAJA awards thus provide an important additional incentive for attorneys to undertake Social Security cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government argues that lawyers can easily determine at the outset whether a potential client owes the Government a debt and can then assist the client in establishing a written repayment plan that would prevent an offset.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 18.  At oral argument, however, the Government acknowledged that it was not aware of any instance in which this has happened in the five years since it began subjecting EAJA fee awards to administrative offset.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  It is not difficult to understand why.  Helping a client establish a repayment plan would be a time-consuming endeavor uncompensated by any fee-shifting provision, and a client who needs such assistance is unlikely to have the funds to pay the attorney for that service.  If the Government is instead suggesting that a lawyer can simply decline to represent a prospective client once she knows of the client\xe2\x80\x99s debtor status, that suggestion only proves my point.  Cf. NOSSCR Brief 25 (describing deterrent effect of offsets on representation).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, the Government has no compelling response to the fact that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will make it more difficult for the neediest litigants to find attorneys to represent them in cases against the Government.  I \xe2\x80\x9cfind it difficult to ascribe to Congress an intent to throw\xe2\x80\x9d an EAJA litigant \xe2\x80\x9ca lifeline that it knew was a foot short\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Given the anomalous nature of this result, and its frustration of the very purposes behind the EAJA itself, Congress cannot lightly be assumed to have intended it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sullivan</em>, 490 U. S., at 890.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government suggests that it is possible to glean such intent from the fact that Congress did not expressly exempt EAJA awards from administrative offset under the DCIA.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9320; 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716(c)(1)(C) (specifying certain federal payments that are not subject to administrative offset); see also 31 CFR \xc2\xa7285.5(e)(2) (2009) (identifying payments that are not subject to administrative offset because of a statutory exemption).  If \xe2\x80\x9capplication of the offset program to such awards will make it more difficult for Social Security claimants or other litigants to find attorneys,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government contends, the \xe2\x80\x9cprovisions that govern the offset program indicate that Congress is willing to bear that cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 20.  The history of these provisions indicates otherwise.  For more than two decades after the EAJA was enacted in 1980, the Commissioner of Social Security \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently paid\xe2\x80\x9d EAJA fee awards directly to the attorney, not the prevailing party.  <em>Stephens ex rel. R. E. </em>v. <em>Astrue</em>, 565 F.\xc2\xa03d 131, 135 (CA4 2009); see also <em>Bryant</em> v. <em>Commissioner of Social Security</em>, 578 F.\xc2\xa03d 443, 446 (CA6 2009); cf. <em>ante</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa03, 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, the Commissioner created a direct deposit system for attorneys and issued [Internal Revenue Service] 1099 forms directly to the attorneys who received awards, noting the awards as taxable attorney income.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stephens</em>, 565 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 135.  Not until 2005, when the Treasury Department extended the offset program to cover \xe2\x80\x9cmiscellaneous\xe2\x80\x9d federal payments, including \xe2\x80\x9cfees,\xe2\x80\x9d did the Commissioner cease paying EAJA fee awards directly to attorneys and adopt the position that the awards were appropriately considered the property of the prevailing party.  <em>Id.,</em> at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Bryant</em>, 578 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 446; <em>ante</em>, at 2, 10.  Congress therefore had no reason to include a specific exemption of EAJA fee awards (in the Social Security context or otherwise) from the offset program when it enacted the DCIA in 1996.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am further reluctant to conclude that Congress would want EAJA fee awards to be offset for a prevailing litigant\xe2\x80\x99s unrelated debts because it is not likely to effectuate the DCIA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cmaximiz[ing] collections of delinquent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick action to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all appropriate collection tools.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa731001(b)(1), 110 Stat. 1321\xe2\x80\x93358.  This purpose would be better served if claimants are able to find attorneys to help them secure the benefits they are rightfully owed in the first place, thereby making available a source of funds to permit repayment of the claimants\xe2\x80\x99 Government debts at all.  See NOSSCR Brief 32; see also 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716(c)(3)(A) (after initial $9,000 annual exemption, Social Security benefits are subject to administrative offset).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and agree with its textual analysis, the foregoing persuades me that the practical effect of our decision \xe2\x80\x9cseverely undermines the [EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s] estimable aim\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The Legislature has just cause to clarify beyond debate\xe2\x80\x9d whether this effect is one it actually intends.  <em>Bartlett</em> v. <em>Strickland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/556/1/index.html">556 U. S. 1</a>, __ (2009) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The EAJA makes fee awards available to challenge Government action under a wide range of statutes, but, as respondent notes, the vast majority of EAJA awards are made in these two contexts, with Social Security cases representing the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share.  Brief for Respondent 4\xe2\x80\x935; Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants\xe2\x80\x99 Representatives et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In its brief, the Government downplays the frequency with which fee awards under the EAJA are made.  At oral argument, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel represented that EAJA fee awards are made in 42% of Social Security cases in which the claimant prevails and in 70% of all veteran\xe2\x80\x99s benefits cases filed.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  The Government did not contest the number for Social Security cases but suggested that the percentage of veteran\xe2\x80\x99s benefits cases resulting in EAJA awards is closer to 50% or 60%.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52.  Under either estimate, these are hardly vanishing odds of success for an attorney deciding whether to take a client\xe2\x80\x99s case.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
