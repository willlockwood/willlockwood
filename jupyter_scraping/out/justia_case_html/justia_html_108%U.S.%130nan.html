CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The petition for removal was filed before answer, and we must look therefore to the bill alone to determine what the controversy is.  From this it appears that Henry M. Loud claims that the defendants Wasey, Henry M. Loud, and Whiting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 108 U. S. 132</a></p><p> hold certain real and personal property in trust to secure a debt owing by him and the defendant Gay to the defendant Winchester; and, after the debt is paid, for the use and benefit of himself and Gay.  He asks for an accounting by the trustees, the removal of Wasey and Whiting, and the appointment of others in their places, and, after the debt is paid, a conveyance of what remains of the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust.  The case presents but a single controversy, although it involves the determination of several questions.  It may be that Winchester is the principal defendant in interest, but full and complete relief cannot be afforded in respect to the single cause of action, to-wit, the trust, without the presence of all the parties to the suit.  According to the averments in the bill, all the defendants except Henry M. Loud deny the existence of the trust, and, if that should be established, all the defendants are directly interested in the relief that is asked.  The case falls clearly within the rule stated in <em>Hyde v. Ruble,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/407/case.html">104 U. S. 407</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>The order remanding the suit is affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
