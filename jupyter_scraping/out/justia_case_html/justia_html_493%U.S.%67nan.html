The hiring hall is "nonexclusive," in that workers are free to seek employment through other means, and employers are not restricted to hiring persons recommended by the union.  Petitioner, a member of the union, filed suit alleging that respondent:  (1) violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) and 609 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) -- which forbid a union to "fine, suspend, expe[l] or otherwise discipline" a member for exercising LMRDA-secured rights -- by refusing to refer him through the hiring hall as a result of his political opposition to respondent\'s leadership; and (2) breached its duty of fair representation under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by discriminating against him in respect to such referrals.  The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that discrimination in hiring hall referrals constitutes an unfair labor practice subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board).  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that fair representation claims must be brought before the Board, and that petitioner had failed to state a claim under the LMRDA.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

The fact that the alleged violation of respondent\'s duty of fair representation might also be an unfair labor practice, over which state and federal courts lack jurisdiction under <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v.

Such a rule would remove an unacceptably large number of fair representation claims from federal courts, since the NLRB has developed an unfair labor practice jurisprudence in many areas traditionally encompassed by the duty of fair representation.  Decisions of this Court containing language recognizing the need for a single expert federal agency to adjudicate difficult hiring hall problems are distinguished, since those cases focused on whether exclusive hiring halls had encouraged union membership impermissibly as forbidden by the NLRA, rather than on whether unions have administered properly out-of-work lists as required by their duty of fair representation.  Also distinguished are the Court\'s decisions holding that state court hiring hall suits are preempted by NLRB jurisdiction, since state law claims frequently involve tort, contract, and other substantive areas of law that have developed independently of federal labor law, whereas the duty of fair representation has "judicially evolved" as part of federal labor law and is unlikely generally to create conflicts with the operative realities of federal labor policy.  The Court of Appeals\' holding that an employee cannot prevail in a fair representation suit against his <em>union</em> if he fails to allege that his <em>employer</em> breached the collective bargaining agreement constitutes a misstatement of existing law.  Although <em>Vaca</em> recognized the desirability of having the same entity adjudicate a joint fair representation/breach of contract action, it in no way implied that a fair representation action <em>requires</em> a concomitant claim against the employer.  Independent federal court jurisdiction exists over fair representation claims because the duty of fair representation is implied from the NLRA\'s grant of exclusive representation status to unions, such that the claims "aris[e] under a[n] Act of Congress regulating commerce" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1337(a), the pertinent jurisdictional provision.  Moreover, a fair representation claim is a separate cause of action from any possible suit against the employer.  Thus, this Court declines to adopt a rule that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the NLRB over any fair representation suit whose hypothetical accompanying claim against the employer might be raised before the Board.

There is no merit to respondent\'s contention that it did not breach its duty of fair representation because that duty should be defined in terms of what is an unfair labor practice, and because it committed no such practice, since the NLRA forbids only union discrimination based on union membership or lack thereof, and not on any other form of maladministration of a job-referral system.  Equating breaches of the duty of fair representation with unfair labor practices would make the two redundant, despite their different purposes, and would eliminate some </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 493 U. S. 69</a></p><p> of the prime virtues of the fair representation duty -- flexibility and adaptability.  That duty is not intended to mirror the contours of unfair labor practices, but arises independently in order to prevent arbitrary conduct against individuals deprived by the NLRA of traditional forms of redress against unions.  Also without merit is respondent\'s contention that it should be relieved of its duty of fair representation because, in the hiring hall context, it is acting essentially as an employer in matching up job requests with available personnel, and therefore does not "represent" the employees as a bargaining agent.  That the particular function of job referral resembles a task that an employer might perform is of no consequence, since the union is administering a provision of the collective bargaining agreement, and is therefore subject to the duty of fair representation.  <em>Humphrey v.

In fact, if a union assumes the employer\'s role in a hiring hall, its responsibility to exercise its power fairly <em>increases,</em> rather than <em>decreases,</em> since the individual employee then stands alone against a single entity, the joint union/employer.

Respondent\'s alleged refusal to refer petitioner to employment through the union hiring hall as a result of his political opposition to the union\'s leadership does not give rise to a claim under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) and 609 of the LMRDA.  By using the phrase "otherwise discipline," those sections demonstrate a congressional intent to denote only punishment authorized by the union as a collective entity to enforce its rules, and not to include all acts that deterred the exercise of LMRDA-protected rights.  The construction that the term refers only to actions undertaken under color of the union\'s right to control the member\'s conduct in order to protect the interests of the union or its membership is buttressed by the legislative history and by the statute\'s structure, which specifically enumerates types of discipline -- fine, expulsion, and suspension -- that imply some sort of established disciplinary process, rather than <em>ad hoc</em> retaliation by individual union officers, and which, in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(5), includes procedural safeguards designed to protect against improper disciplinary action -- "written specific charges," "a reasonable time to prepare a defense," and a "full and fair hearing" -- that would apply to the type of procedure encountered in <em>Boilermakers v.

Breininger was at all relevant times a member of respondent, Local Union No. 6 of the Sheet Metal Workers International Association.  Pursuant to a multi-employer collective bargaining agreement, respondent operates a hiring hall through which it refers both members and nonmembers of the union for construction work.  Respondent maintains an out-of-work list of individuals who wish to be referred to jobs.  When an employer contacts respondent for workers, he may request certain persons by name.  If he does not, the union begins at the top of the list and attempts to telephone in order each worker listed until it has satisfied the employer\'s request.  The hiring hall is not the exclusive source of employment for sheet metal workers; they are free to seek employment through other mechanisms, and employers are not restricted to hiring only those persons recommended by the union. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondent also maintains a job referral list under the Specialty Agreement, a separate collective bargaining agreement negotiated to cover work on siding, decking, and metal buildings.</p>\n<p>Petitioner alleges that respondent refused to honor specific employer requests for his services and passed him over in making job referrals.  He also contends that respondent refused to process his internal union grievances regarding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="72">Page 493 U. S. 72</a></p><p> these matters.  Petitioner\'s first amended complaint contained two counts.  First, he asserted a violation of the duty of fair representation, contending that respondent, "in its representation of [petitioner], has acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily, and/or in bad faith and/or without reason or cause."  First Amended Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd 13.  Second, petitioner alleged that his union, "in making job referrals, . . . has favored a faction of members . . . who have been known to support . . . the present business manager," as "part of widespread, improper discipline for political opposition in violation of 29 U.S.C. [\xc2\xa7 411(a)(5)] and 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 529."  <em>Id.,</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 17.  Respondent, in other words, "acting by and through its present business manager . . . and its present business agent [has] <em>otherwise disciplined\'" petitioner within the meaning of LMRDA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) and 609.  <em>Id.,</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 16.\n</em></p>\n<p>The District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain petitioner\'s suit because "discrimination in hiring hall referrals constitutes an unfair labor practice," and "[t]he NLRB has exclusive jurisdiction over discrimination in hiring hall referrals."  No. C 83-1126 (ND Ohio, Feb. 20, 1987), p. 6, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. A9.  The District Court determined that adjudicating petitioner\'s claims "would involve interfe[r]ing with the NLRB\'s exclusive jurisdiction."  <em>Id.</em> at 7, App. to Pet. for Cert. A10.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed in a brief per curiam opinion.  With respect to the fair representation claim, the court noted that "[c]ircuit courts have consistently held that . . . fair representation claims must be brought before the Board" and that</p>\n<p>"if the employee fails to affirmatively allege that his <em>employer</em> breached the collective bargaining agreement, which [petitioner] failed to do in the case at bar, he cannot prevail."</p>\n<p>849 F.2d at 999 (emphasis in original).  In regard to the LMRDA count, the Court of Appeals found that</p>\n<p>"[d]iscrimination in the referral system, because it does not breach the employee\'s union membership rights, does not constitute \'discipline\' within the meaning of LMRDA"</p>\n<p>and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 493 U.

In <em>Miranda Fuel Co., Inc.,</em> 140 N.L.R.B. 181 (1962), <em>enf. denied,</em> 326 F.2d 172 (CA2 1963), the NLRB determined that violations of the duty of fair representation might also be unfair labor practices under \xc2\xa7 8(b) of the NLRA, <em>as amended,</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(b) (1982 ed.). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Board held that the right of employees under \xc2\xa7 7 of the NLRA, <em>as amended,</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 157, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or to refrain from such activities,</p>\n<p>"is a statutory limitation on statutory bargaining representatives, and . . . that Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 493 U.

In addition, the Board reasoned that</p>\n<p>"a statutory bargaining representative and an employer also respectively violate Section 8(b)(2) and 8(a)(3) when, for arbitrary or irrelevant reasons or upon the basis of an unfair classification, the union attempts to cause or does cause an employer to derogate the employment status of an employee."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 186.  While petitioner alleged a breach of the duty of fair representation, his claim might relate to conduct that under <em>Miranda Fuel</em> also constitutes an unfair labor practice.  And, as a general matter, neither state nor federal courts possess jurisdiction over claims based on activity that is "arguably" subject to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7 or 8 of the NLRA.  <em>See San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U.

Sipes, supra,</em> we held that <em>Garmon\'s</em> preemption rule does not extend to suits alleging a breach of the duty of fair representation.  Our decision in <em>Vaca</em> was premised on several factors.  First, we noted that courts developed and elaborated the duty of fair representation before the Board even acquired statutory jurisdiction over union activities.  Indeed, fair representation claims often involve matters "not normally within the Board\'s.unfair labor practice jurisdiction," 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#181">386 U.

We therefore doubted whether "the Board brings substantially greater expertise to bear on these problems than do the courts."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#181">386 U.

Another consideration in <em>Vaca</em> for finding the fair representation claim judicially cognizable was the NLRB General Counsel\'s unreviewable discretion to refuse to institute unfair labor practice proceedings.</p>\n<p>"[T]he General Counsel will refuse to bring complaints on behalf </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 493 U.

Consequently, we were unwilling to assume that Congress intended to deny employees their traditional fair representation remedies when it enacted \xc2\xa7 8(b) as part of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA).  As Justice WHITE described <em>Vaca v. Sipes</em> last Term in <em>Karahalios v. Federal Employees,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/527/case.html">489 U.

We held that the \'tardy assumption\' of jurisdiction by the NLRB was insufficient reason to abandon our prior cases, such as <em>Syres [v. Oil Workers,</em> 350 U.S. 892 (1955)]."</p>\n<p>That a breach of the duty of fair representation might also be an unfair labor practice is thus not enough to deprive a federal court of jurisdiction over the fair representation claim.  <em>See Communications Workers v. Beck,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/735/case.html">487 U. S. 735</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/735/case.html#743">487 U. S. 743</a></span> (1988).</p>\n<p>We decline to create an exception to the <em>Vaca</em> rule for fair representation complaints arising out of the operation of union hiring halls.  Although the Board has had numerous opportunities to apply the NLRA to hiring hall policies, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 493 U. S. 76</a></p><p> reject the notion that the NLRB ought to possess exclusive jurisdiction over fair representation complaints in the hiring hall context because it has had experience with hiring halls in the past. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  As an initial matter, we have never suggested that the <em>Vaca</em> rule contains exceptions based on the subject matter of the fair representation claim presented, the relative expertise of the NLRB in the particular area of labor law involved, or any other factor.  We are unwilling to begin the process of carving out exceptions now, especially since we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 493 U. S. 77</a></p><p> see no limiting principle to such an approach.  Most fair representation cases require great sensitivity to the tradeoffs between the interests of the bargaining unit as a whole and the rights of individuals. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Furthermore, we have never indicated that NLRB "experience" or "expertise" deprives a court of jurisdiction over a fair representation claim.  The Board has developed an unfair labor practice jurisprudence in many areas traditionally encompassed by the duty of fair representation.  The Board, for example, repeatedly has applied the <em>Miranda Fuel</em> doctrine in cases involving racial discrimination.  <em>See International Brotherhood of Painters, Local 1066 (W.J.

In addition, the Board has found gender discrimination by unions to be an unfair labor practice.  <em>See Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts,</em> 287 N.L.R.B.

In short,</p>\n<p>"[a] cursory review of Board volumes following <em>Miranda Fuel</em> discloses numerous cases in which the Board has found the duty of fair representation breached where the union\'s conduct was motivated by an employee\'s lack of union membership, strifes resulting from intra-union politics, and racial or gender considerations."</p>\n<p><em>United States Postal Service,</em> 272 N.L.R.B. 93, 104 (1984).  Adopting a rule that NLRB expertise bars federal jurisdiction would remove an unacceptably large number of fair representation claims from federal courts.</p>\n<p>Respondent calls to our attention language in some of our decisions recognizing that</p>\n<p>"[t]he problems inherent in the operation of union hiring halls are difficult and complex, and point up the importance of limiting initial competence to adjudicate such matters to a single expert federal agency."</p>\n<p><em>Plumbers v.

The cases cited by respondent, however, focus not on whether unions have administered properly out-of-work lists as required by their duty of fair representation, but rather on whether exclusive hiring halls have encouraged union membership impermissibly as forbidden by \xc2\xa7 8(b).  Such exclusive arrangements are not illegal <em>per se</em> under federal labor law, but rather are illegal only if they in fact result in discrimination prohibited by the NLRA.  <em>See Teamsters v.

We therefore decline to interpret the state law preemption cases as establishing a principle that hiring halls are somehow so different from other union activities that fair representation claims are not cognizable outside of the NLRB.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals below also held that if an employee fails to allege that his <em>employer</em> breached the collective bargaining agreement, then he cannot prevail in a fair representation suit against his <em>union.

We noted that, where the union has control of the grievance and arbitration system, the employee-plaintiff\'s failure to exhaust his contractual remedies may be excused if the union has wrongfully refused to process his claim, and thus breached its duty of fair representation.  <em>See Vaca,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#185">386 U.

Indeed, the earliest fair representation suits involved claims against unions for breach of the duty in <em>negotiating</em> a collective bargaining agreement, a context in which no breach-of-contract action against an employer is possible.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/330/case.html">Ford Motor Co. v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 493 U.

Even after a collective bargaining agreement has been signed, we have never required a fair representation plaintiff to allege that his <em>employer</em> breached the agreement in order to prevail.  <em>See, e.g., Communications Workers v.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The employer would thereby violate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 493 U.

S. 255</a></span>-256 (1944), and be held jointly and severally liable with the union, <em>but only in a suit before the Board.</em> [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In the hiring hall environment, permitting courts to hear fair representation claims against the union would create the danger of bifurcated proceedings before a court and the NLRB.  The absence of a \xc2\xa7 301 claim, according to respondent, requires that we hold that the NLRB possesses exclusive jurisdiction over petitioner\'s fair representation suit.</p>\n<p>This argument misinterprets our reasoning in <em>Vaca</em>.  Because a plaintiff must as a matter of logic prevail on his unfair representation allegation against the union in order to excuse his failure to exhaust contractual remedies before he can litigate the merits of his \xc2\xa7 301 claim against his employer, we found it</p>\n<p>"obvious that the courts will be compelled to pass upon whether there has been a breach of the duty of fair representation in the context of many \xc2\xa7 301 breach-of-contract actions."</p>\n<p>386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#187">386 U. S. 187</a></span>.  Moreover, because the union\'s breach may have enhanced or contributed to the employee\'s injury, permitting fair representation suits to be heard in court facilitates the fashioning of a remedy.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We concluded that it made little sense to prevent courts from adjudicating fair representation claims.</p>\n<p>The situation in the instant case is entirely different.  In the hiring hall context, the Board may bring a claim alleging a violation of \xc2\xa7 8(b)(1)(A) against the union, and a parallel suit against the employer under \xc2\xa7 8(a)(3), without implicating the duty of fair representation at all.  Or, as in the instant case, an employee may bring a claim solely against the union based on its wrongful refusal to refer him for work.  While in <em>Vaca,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 493 U. S. 83</a></p><p> an allegation that the union had breached its duty of fair representation was a necessary component of the \xc2\xa7 301 claim against the employer, the converse is not true here:  a suit against the union need not be accompanied by an allegation that an employer breached the contract, since, whatever the employer\'s liability, the employee would still retain a legal claim against the union.  The fact that an employee may bring his fair representation claim in federal court in order to join it with a \xc2\xa7 301 claim does not mean that he <em>must</em> bring the fair representation claim before the Board in order to "join" it with a hypothetical unfair labor practice case against the employer that was never actually filed.</p>\n<p>Federal courts have jurisdiction to hear fair representation suits whether or not they are accompanied by claims against employers.  We have always assumed that independent federal jurisdiction exists over fair representation claims because the duty is implied from the grant of exclusive representation status and the claims therefore "arise under" the NLRA.  <em>See, e.g., Tunstall v. Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/210/case.html">323 U.

Lower courts that have addressed the issue have uniformly found that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1337(a), which provides federal jurisdiction for, <em>inter alia,</em> "any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce," creates federal jurisdiction over fair representation claims, because we held in <em>Capital Service, Inc. v.

Pan American World Airlines, Inc.,</em> 828 F.2d 546, 549 (CA9 1987).  We agree with this reasoning.  Because federal court jurisdiction exists over a fair representation claim regardless of whether it is accompanied by a breach of contract claim against an employer under \xc2\xa7 301, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and because a fair representation claim is a separate cause of action from any possible suit against the employer, we decline to adopt a rule that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the NLRB over any fair representation suit whose hypothetical accompanying claim against the employer might be raised before the Board.</p>\n<p>The concerns that animated our decision in <em>Vaca</em> are equally present in the instant case.  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District Court was without jurisdiction to hear petitioner\'s fair representation claim.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent contends that, even if jurisdiction in federal court is proper, petitioner has failed to allege a fair representation claim for two reasons. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 493 U. S. 85</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>First, respondent notes that we have interpreted NLRA \xc2\xa7 8(a)(3) to forbid employer discrimination in hiring only when it is intended to discriminate on a union-related basis.  <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/278/case.html">380 U. S. 278</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/278/case.html#286">380 U. S. 286</a></span> (1965).  Respondent maintains that symmetry requires us to interpret \xc2\xa7 8(b)(2) as forbidding only discrimination based on union-related criteria, and not any other form of maladministration of a union job-referral system. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Respondent contends that, under this standard, it committed no unfair labor practice in this case.  The LMRA, according to respondent, reflects a purposeful </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 493 U. S. 86</a></p><p> congressional decision to limit the scope of \xc2\xa7 8(b)(2) to instances where a union discriminates solely on the basis of union membership or lack thereof.  This decision would be negated if the duty of fair representation were construed as extending further than the unfair labor practice provisions of the NLRA.</p>\n<p>We need not decide the appropriate scope of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(2) because we reject the proposition that the duty of fair representation should be defined in terms of what is an unfair labor practice.  Respondent\'s argument rests on a false syllogism:  (a) because <em>Miranda Fuel Co.,</em> 140 N.L.R.B. 181 (1962), <em>enf. denied,</em> 326 F.2d 172 (CA2 1963), establishes that a breach of the duty of fair representation is also an unfair labor practice, and (b) the conduct in this case was not an unfair labor practice, therefore (c) it must not have been a breach of the duty of fair representation either.  The flaw in the syllogism is that there is no reason to equate breaches of the duty of fair representation with unfair labor practices, especially in an effort to <em>narrow</em> the former category.  The NLRB\'s rationale in <em>Miranda Fuel</em> was precisely the opposite; the Board determined that breaches of duty of fair representation were also unfair labor practices in an effort to <em>broaden,</em> not <em>restrict,</em> the remedies available to union members.  <em>See</em> 140 N.L.R.B. at 184-186. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Pegging the duty of fair representation to the Board\'s definition of unfair labor practices would make the two redundant, despite their different purposes, and would eliminate some of the prime virtues of the duty of fair representation -- flexibility and adaptability.  <em>See Vaca,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#182">386 U. S. 182</a></span>-183.</p>\n<p>The duty of fair representation is not intended to mirror the contours of \xc2\xa7 8(b); rather, it arises independently from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 493 U. S. 87</a></p><p> the grant under \xc2\xa7 9(a) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 159(a) (1982 ed.), of the union\'s exclusive power to represent all employees in a particular bargaining unit.  It serves as a</p>\n<p>"bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct against individuals stripped of traditional forms of redress by the provisions of federal labor law."</p>\n<p><em>Vaca,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#182">386 U.

S. 181</a></span> (1967) ("It was because the national labor policy vested unions with power to order the relations of employees with their employer that this Court found it necessary to fashion the duty of fair representation").  Respondent\'s argument assumes that enactment of the LMRA in 1947 somehow limited a union\'s duty of fair representation according to the unfair labor practices specified in \xc2\xa7 8(b).  We have never adopted such a view, and we decline to do so today.</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>Second, respondent insists that petitioner has failed to state a claim because in the hiring hall setting a union is acting essentially as an employer in matching up job requests with available personnel.  Because a union does not "represent" the employees as a bargaining agent in such a situation, respondent argues that it should be relieved entirely of its duty of fair representation. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>We cannot accept this proposed analogy.  Only because of its status as a Board-certified bargaining representative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 493 U. S. 88</a></p><p> and by virtue of the power granted to it by the collective bargaining agreement does a union gain the ability to refer workers for employment through a hiring hall.  Together with this authority comes the responsibility to exercise it in a nonarbitrary and nondiscriminatory fashion, because the members of the bargaining unit have entrusted the union with the task of representing them.  That the particular function of job referral resembles a task that an employer might perform is of no consequence.  The key is that the union is administering a provision of the contract, something that we have always held is subject to the duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p>"The undoubted broad authority of the union as exclusive bargaining agent in the negotiation <em>and administration</em> of a collective bargaining contract is accompanied by a responsibility of equal scope, the responsibility and duty of fair representation."</p>\n<p><em>Humphrey v.

Sipes, supra,</em> for example, we held that a union has a duty of fair representation in grievance arbitration, despite the fact that NLRA \xc2\xa7 9(a) expressly reserves the right of</p>\n<p>"any individual employee or group of employees . . . to present grievances to their employer and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining contract or agreement then in effect."</p>\n<p>The union in <em>Vaca</em> exercised power over grievances because the contract so provided, not because the NLRA required such an arrangement.  Hence, the observation that a contract might provide for the operation of a hiring hall directly by a consortium of interested employers rather than a union is irrelevant; the same might have been said about the system for processing grievances in <em>Vaca.</em>  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 493 U. S. 89</a></p><p> short, a union does not shed its duty of fair representation merely because it is allocating job openings among competing applicants, something that might be seen as similar to what an employer does.</p>\n<p>The union\'s assumption in the hiring hall of what respondent believes is an "employer\'s" role in no way renders the duty of fair representation inapplicable.  When management administers job rights outside the hiring hall setting, arbitrary or discriminatory acts are apt to provoke a strong reaction through the grievance mechanism.  In the union hiring hall, however, there is no balance of power.  If respondent is correct that in a hiring hall the union has assumed the mantle of employer, then the individual employee stands alone against a single entity:  the joint union/employer.  An improperly functioning hiring hall thus resembles a closed shop,</p>\n<p>"\'with all of the abuses possible under such an arrangement, including discrimination against employees, prospective employees, members of union minority groups, and operation of a closed union.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Teamsters v.

In sum, if a union does wield additional power in a hiring hall by assuming the employer\'s role, its responsibility to exercise that power fairly <em>increases,</em> rather than <em>decreases.</em>  That has been the logic of our duty of fair representation cases since <em>Steele v.

These provisions make it unlawful for a union to "fine, suspend, expel or otherwise discipline" any of its members for exercising rights secured under the LMRDA. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Court of Appeals reasoned that because "[h]iring hall referrals . . . are available to nonmembers as well as to members," 849 F.2d at 999, and the hiring hall was not an exclusive source of employment for sheet metal workers, petitioner did not suffer discrimination on the basis of rights he held by virtue of his <em>membership</em> in the union.  We affirm the Court of Appeals\' conclusion, although we do not adopt its reasoning. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Finnegan v.

S. 91</a></p><p> Petitioner, joined by the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argues that the Court of Appeals misapplied our reasoning in <em>Finnegan,</em> because Congress could not have intended to prohibit a union from expelling a member of the rank-and-file from a members-only hall for his political opposition to the union leadership, but to permit the leadership to impose the same sanction if the hiring hall included a few token nonmembers as well.  Either way, the purpose of the Act would hardly be served if a union were able to coerce its members into obedience by threatening them with a loss of job referrals.  Under the reading urged by the United States, <em>Finnegan</em> held only that the LMRDA does not protect the positions and perquisites enjoyed exclusively by union leaders; it did not narrow the protections available to "nonpolicymaking employees, that is, rank-and-file member-employees." <em>Finnegan,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/431/case.html#443">456 U. S. 443</a></span> (BLACKMUN, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>We need not decide the precise import of the language and reasoning of <em>Finnegan,</em> however, because we find that, by using the phrase "otherwise discipline," Congress did not intend to include all acts that deterred the exercise of rights protected under the LMRDA, but rather meant instead to denote only punishment authorized by the union as a collective entity to enforce its rules.  "Discipline is the criminal law of union government."  Summers, The Law of Union Discipline, 70 Yale L.J. 175, 178 (1960).  The term refers only to actions "undertaken under color of the union\'s right to control the member\'s conduct in order to protect the interests of the union or its membership."  <em>Miller v. Holden,</em> 535 F.2d 912, 915 (CA5 1976).</p>\n<p>Our construction of the statute is buttressed by its structure.  First, the specifically enumerated types of discipline -- fine, expulsion, and suspension -- imply some sort of established disciplinary process rather than <em>ad hoc</em> retaliation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 493 U. S. 92</a></p><p> by individual union officers. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  <em>See</em> 2A C. Sands, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7 47.17, p. 166 (4th ed. 1984) (<em>ejusdem generis</em>).  Second, \xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) includes procedural protections -- "written specific charges" served before discipline is imposed, "a reasonable time" in which to prepare a defense, and a "full and fair hearing" -- that would not apply to instances of unofficial, <em>sub rosa</em> discrimination.  These protections contemplate imposition of discipline through the type of procedure we encountered in <em>Boilermakers v. Hardeman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/233/case.html">401 U. S. 233</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/233/case.html#236">401 U. S. 236</a></span>-237 (1971) (expulsion after trial before union committee, with subsequent internal union review).  The fact that \xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) does not prohibit union discipline altogether, but rather seeks to provide "safeguards against improper disciplinary action," indicates that "discipline" refers to punishment that a union can impose by virtue of its own authority over its members.  A hiring hall could hardly be expected to provide a hearing before every decision not to refer an individual to a job.</p>\n<p>The legislative history supports this interpretation of "discipline."  Early drafts of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(5), for example, contained elaborate lists of "due process protections," such as the presumption of innocence, venue restrictions, the right to counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 493 U. S. 93</a></p><p> other guarantees typically found in the criminal context. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Congress envisioned that "discipline" would entail the imposition of punishment by a union acting in its official capacity.  <em>See</em> 105 Cong.Rec. 5812 (1959) (remarks of Sen. McClellan) (referring to "safeguards . . . against improper disciplinary action" as procedures that must be followed before a union member can be "expelled or punished," "tried," or "suspend[ed]" by the union); <em>id.</em> at 6023 (remarks of Sen. Kuchel) (noting that discipline may be imposed only on "the usual reasonable constitutional basis upon which [criminal] charges might be brought").</p>\n<p>A forerunner of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) in the Senate provided criminal penalties for <em>both</em> improper "discipline" by "any <em>labor organization,</em> its officers, agents, representatives, or employees" <em>and</em> the use by</p>\n<p>"<em>any person</em> . . . of force or violence, or . . . economic reprisal or threat thereof, to restrain, coerce, or intimidate, or attempt to restrain, coerce, or intimidate any member of a labor organization for the purpose of interfering with or preventing the exercising by such member of any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of this Act."</p>\n<p>S. 1555, as reported, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 53 (1959) (emphasis added); <em>see also</em> S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 5354, 94 (1959), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 1959, p. 2318; 105 Cong.Rec. 15120 (1959) (comments of Sen. Goldwater).  Although S. 1555 was not passed in this form by the Senate, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] the fact that, even in an earlier bill, improper <em>discipline by a labor organization</em> was listed separately from <em>economic coercion by any person</em> shows that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 493 U. S. 94</a></p><p> Senate believed that the two were distinct, and that it did not intend to include the type of unauthorized "economic reprisals" suffered by petitioner in the instant case in its definition of "discipline."  The bipartisan compromise bill introduced by Representatives Landrum and Griffin, which amended S. 1555 after its passage by the Senate, substituted civil remedies for the criminal penalties.  Rep. Griffin explained that the bill covered only the "denial of . . . rights through <em>union discipline,</em>" 105 Cong.Rec. 13091 (1959) (emphasis added), an apparent reference to penalties imposed by the union in its official capacity as a labor organization.  Discipline "must be done in the name of or on behalf of the union as an organizational entity."  Etelson &amp; Smith, Union Discipline Under the Landrum-Griffin Act, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 727, 732 (1969).</p>\n<p>In the instant case, petitioner alleged only that the union business manager and business agent failed to refer him for employment because he supported one of their political rivals.  He did not allege acts by the union amounting to "discipline" within the meaning of the statute.  According to his complaint, he was the victim of the personal vendettas of two union officers.  The opprobrium of the union <em>as an entity,</em> however, was not visited upon petitioner.  He was not punished by any tribunal, nor was he the subject of any proceedings convened by respondent.  In sum, petitioner has not alleged a violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) and 609, and the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed his claim under the LMRDA.

Hiring is deemed to be "exclusive," for example, if the union retains sole authority to supply workers to the employer up to a designated percentage of the work force or for some specified period of time, such as 24 or 48 hours, before the employer can hire on his own.  <em>See Carpenters, Local 608 (Various Employers),</em> 279 N.L.R.B. 747, 754 (1986), <em>enf\'d,</em> 811 F.2d 149 (CA2), <em>cert. denied,</em> 484 U.S. 817 (1987).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 8(b)(1)(A) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to restrain or coerce</p>\n<p>"employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title [section 7 of the NLRA]:  <em>Provided,</em> That this paragraph shall not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(b)(1)(A) (1982 ed.).

The Board has held that</p>\n<p>"any departure from established exclusive hiring hall procedures which results in a denial of employment to an applicant falls within that class of discrimination which inherently encourages union membership, breaches the duty of fair representation owed to all hiring hall users, and violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) and (2), unless the union demonstrates that its interference with employment was pursuant to a valid union-security clause or was necessary to the effective performance of its representative function."</p>\n<p><em>Operating Engineers, Local 406,</em> 262 N.L.

The NLRB, however, has construed \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(2) more expansively to bar the use of unfair, irrelevant, or invidious considerations in employee referrals of employees, and to prohibit, absent sufficient justification by the union, any departure from established procedures.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em>  We need not pass on the wisdom of the Board\'s interpretation, because we hold that, whatever the proper reading of \xc2\xa7 8(b), petitioner has stated a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation.  We note, however, that respondent\'s arguments are inconsistent.  On the one hand, respondent contends that courts should not entertain fair representation suits because to do so would disturb NLRB efforts to create a uniform unfair labor practice body of law governing hiring halls.  On the other hand, respondent maintains that the NLRB rules with respect to hiring hall unfair labor practices are actually in excess of what the statute authorizes.  If that is so, the NLRB does not seem particularly "expert" in this area.  Moreover, if the NLRB\'s hiring hall rules are void because they are beyond what the statute permits, then there is no overlap between the duty of fair representation and the unfair labor practices developed by the Board, and there is in fact <em>less</em> reason to hold that courts lack jurisdiction over hiring hall fair representation claims.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, in deciding not to enforce <em>Miranda Fuel,</em> the Second Circuit explicitly rejected a crabbed view of the duty of fair representation and juxtaposed a statement of the narrowness of \xc2\xa7 8 with an acknowledgement that the duty of fair representation is a broader concept.  <em>See</em> 326 F.2d at 176.  No decision of this Court has held otherwise.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s argument would require us to find that there is no duty of fair representation at all in the hiring hall context; this is a position which cannot be reconciled with numerous decisions of the Courts of Appeals and the NLRB.  <em>See, e.g., Lewis v.

In addition, we were careful to note that the Board retained authority "to determin[e] whether discrimination has in fact been practiced" and to "eliminat[e] discrimination" in the operation of hiring halls.  365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/667/case.html#677">365 U.

First, many unions were run autocratically, and did not accord their members the right of self-governance.  <em>See Sheet Metal Workers v. Lynn,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/347/case.html">488 U. S. 347</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/347/case.html#356">488 U.

Accordingly, Congress decreed that union members would have equal voting rights and the freedom of speech and assembly and provided in \xc2\xa7 102, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 412, a means of enforcing these rights through a civil cause of action in federal court.  Second, there was evidence that unions imposed discipline on their members in violation of their members\' civil rights or without adequate procedural safeguards. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  <em>See Finnegan,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/431/case.html#442">456 U.

The provisions which address these concerns, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 493 U. S. 97</a></p><p> LRMDA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101(a)(5) [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and 609, [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 411(a)(5), 529, are written in expansive language.  They respectively prohibit the imposition of discipline by any labor "organization or any officer thereof," 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 411(a)(5), and "any labor organization, or any officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative of a labor organization, or any employee thereof."  \xc2\xa7 529.  And they refer not only to fines, suspension and expulsion, the usual sanctions imposed by a union, but also to unspecified means by which the union "otherwise discipline[s]" its members.</p>\n<p>As a matter of plain language, "discipline" constitutes "punishment by one in authority . . . with a view to correction or training."  Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 644 (1976); <em>see also</em> Random House Dictionary of the English Language 562 (2d ed. 1987) ("punishment inflicted by way of correction and training"); 4 Oxford English Dictionary 735 (2d ed. 1989) (same).  Union discipline is thus punishment imposed by the union or its officers "to control the member\'s conduct in order to protect the interests of the union or its membership."  <em>Miller v. Holden,</em> 535 F.2d 912, 915 (CA5 1976).  It easily includes the use of a hiring hall system by one who is charged with administering it to punish a member for his political opposition.  Indeed, the express </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 493 U. S. 98</a></p><p> reference in the Act to "fines," a form of discipline that traditionally was not imposed after a trial, suggests that Congress intended the Act to reach discipline that is both informal and affects only a member\'s economic rights.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as a matter of the statute\'s purpose and policy, it would make little sense to exclude the abuse of a hiring hall to deprive a member of job referrals from the type of discipline against which the union member is protected.  Congress intended the LMRDA to prevent unions from exercising control over their membership through measures that did not provide adequate procedural protection.</p>\n<p>"[I]nterference with employment rights constitute[s] a powerful tool by which union leaders [can] control union affairs, often in violation of workers\' membership rights."</p>\n<p><em>Vandeventer v. Local Union No. 513, Int\'l Union of Operating Engineers,</em> 579 F.2d 1373, 1378 (CA8 1978); <em>see also</em> Etelson &amp; Smith, Union Discipline Under the Landrum-Griffin Act, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 727, 732 (1969) ("Since the prime motivation to join a union is concern about one\'s interests as an employee, it seems manifest that a very effective method of disciplining a union member would be to cause injury to those interests").  It is inconceivable that a statute written so broadly would not include such sanctions within its compass.</p>\n<p>The Court nonetheless concludes that the denial of hiring hall referrals is not properly attributable to the union, and does not constitute discipline within the meaning of LMRDA.  The Court errs in its construction of petitioner\'s complaint and in its interpretation of LMRDA.  At this pleading stage, petitioner\'s allegations must be accepted as true, and his complaint may be dismissed "only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations."  <em>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/69/case.html">467 U.

Petitioner alleges</p>\n<p>"that, in failing to refer him for employment, . . . the defendant, acting by and through its present business manager, David Williams, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 493 U.

App. to Pet. to Cert. A21.  The Court elsewhere acknowledges that "the ability to refer workers for employment through a hiring hall" is a power of the <em>union</em> granted it by the collective bargaining agreement, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/67/case.html#88">493 U. S. 88</a></span>, and it properly concludes that petitioner\'s allegations are sufficient to support the imposition of liability upon the union for breaching its duty of fair representation.  Petitioner\'s allegation that the union\'s officers used their union-granted authority over the hiring hall to punish him for his union activities should also be sufficient to support the claim that punishment was imposed "under color of" the union\'s right to control its membership and that the "opprobrium of the union <em>as an entity</em>" was "visited upon petitioner."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/67/case.html#94">493 U. S. 94</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court states that the discriminatory use of the hiring hall to punish petitioner does not constitute discipline because it is not an "established disciplinary process" or imposed by "any tribunal" or as the result of "any proceeding."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/67/case.html#91">493 U. S. 91</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/67/case.html#94">493 U. S. 94</a></span>.  But, as Congress was well aware, [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] discipline can be imposed informally as well as formally and pursuant to unwritten practices similar to those petitioner has alleged as well as to a formal established policy.  The language and structure of the Act does not evince any intention to restrict its coverage to sanctions that are imposed by tribunals </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 493 U. S. 100</a></p><p> or as the result of proceedings.  That Congress specified detailed procedures to be followed in disciplinary proceedings does not mean that no procedures need be followed when discipline is imposed without any proceeding whatsoever.  Nor does the legislative history, which reflects Congress\'s intention to prevent a wide range of arbitrary union action, support such a crabbed reading. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  By holding that the informally imposed sanctions alleged here are not covered by the LMRDA, the Court ironically deprives union members of the protection of the Act\'s procedural safeguards at a time when they are most needed -- when the union or its officers act so secretly and so informally that the member receives no advance notice, no opportunity to be heard, and no explanation for the union\'s action.  This construction of the labor organization\'s "Bill of Rights" is perverse, and cannot have been intended by Congress.</p>\n<p>Finally, this case is not controlled, as the Court of Appeals concluded, by our decision in <em>Finnegan v.

S. 101</a></p><p> <em>amicus curiae,</em> the Solicitor General has cogently explained why <em>Finnegan</em> is not controlling:</p>\n<p>"The question presented by this case is far different.  Here, participation in the Union\'s job referral program is a benefit enjoyed by all members of the Union within the bargaining unit, and the issue is whether withdrawal of the benefit can be deemed \'discipline\' even though that benefit may also be extended to nonmembers of the Union.  <em>Finnegan</em>\'s emphasis on the distinction between union members and union leaders does not apply to this situation.  In fact, the court of appeals\' reliance on language in <em>Finnegan</em> that drew that distinction turns the Court\'s approach on its head.  <em>Finnegan</em>\'s conclusion that the Act did not protect the positions and perquisites enjoyed only by union leaders was surely not intended to narrow the class of benefits, enjoyed by the rank-and-file, that cannot be withdrawn in retaliation for the exercise of protected rights."</p>\n<p>"The court of appeals implicitly acknowledged (<em>see</em> Pet.App. A3) that participation in a job referral system limited to union members would be a part of \'a union member\'s rights or status <em>as a member of the union</em>\' (456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/456/431/case.html#437">456 U. S. 437</a></span>).  The fact that nonmembers may be included within the system should not alter that characterization.  In either case, when a union member\'s removal from or demotion on an out-of-work list is based upon a violation of a union rule or policy, or political opposition to the union\'s leadership, the removal or demotion can fairly be characterized as a punitive action taken against the member <em>as a member</em> that sets him apart from other members of the rank-and-file.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/456/431/case.html#437">456 U. S. 437</a></span>-438.  Moreover, such an action bears enough similarity to the specific disciplinary actions referred to in Section 609 to fall within the residual category of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 493 U. S. 102</a></p><p> sanctions -- encompassed by the phrase \'otherwise disciplined\' -- that are subject to that provision. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]"</p>\n<p>Today the Court correctly refuses to adopt the Court of Appeals\' reasoning, but its rationale is just as flawed as that of the Court of Appeals.  Retaliation effected through a union job referral system is a form of discipline, even if the system is used by nonmembers as well as members and even if the sanction is the result of an <em>ex parte, ad hoc,</em> unrecorded decision by the union.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent from the Court\'s disposition of petitioner\'s claim under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Ingraham v.

That provision, which was later embodied in \xc2\xa7 610 of the Act, is addressed to attempts to interfere with rights protected by the substantive provisions of Title I, and not to the arbitrary imposition of discipline at which the procedural provisions were aimed.  It does not follow, as the Court seems to assume, that, because Congress did not prohibit "all acts that deterred the exercise of rights protected under LMRDA," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/67/case.html#91">493 U.

Most of the Courts of Appeals that have considered the issue have properly concluded that depriving a member of job referrals and other forms of economic reprisals can constitute discipline under LMRDA.  <em>See Guidry v.

Two Courts of Appeals have held that suspension of a member from a nonexclusive job referral system did not constitute discipline when such suspension was required by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.  <em>See Turner v.
