S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324, 1325, and will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see \xc2\xa71328(a).  A debtor may obtain a discharge of government-sponsored student loan debts only if failure to discharge that debt would impose an \xe2\x80\x9cundue hardship\xe2\x80\x9d on the debtor and his dependents.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(8); 1328.  Bankruptcy courts must make this undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001(6), which the party seeking the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.  Respondent Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan proposed repaying the principal on his student loan debt and discharging the interest once the principal was repaid, but he did not initiate the required adversary proceeding.  The student loan creditor, petitioner United, received notice of the plan from the Bankruptcy Court and did not object to the plan or to Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to initiate the required proceeding.  The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan without holding such a proceeding or making a finding of undue hardship.  Once Espinosa paid his student loan principal, the court discharged the interest.  A few years later, the Department of Education sought to collect that interest.  In response, Espinosa asked the court to enforce the confirmation order by directing the Department and United to cease any collection efforts.  United opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside as void the confirmation order because the plan provision authorizing discharge of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code and the Bankruptcy Rules, and because United\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights were violated when Espinosa failed to serve it with the required summons and complaint.  Rejecting those arguments, the Bankruptcy Court granted Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s motion in relevant part and denied the cross-motion.  The District Court reversed, holding that United was denied due process when the confirmation order was issued without the required service.  The Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed.  It concluded that by confirming Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan without first finding undue hardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most committed a legal error that United might have successfully appealed, but that such error was no basis for setting aside the order as void under Rule 60(b)(4).  It also held that Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to serve United was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void because United received actual notice of the plan and failed to object.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation order is not void under Rule 60(b)(4).

Such finality ordinarily would \xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] in the way of challenging [the order\xe2\x80\x99s] enforceability,\xe2\x80\x9d Travelers Indemnity Co.</em> v. <em>Bailey</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___.  However, Rule 60(b)(4) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment that \xe2\x80\x9cis void,\xe2\x80\x9d but only in the rare instance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be heard.  United\xe2\x80\x99s alleged error falls in neither category.  Conceding that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order, United contends that the judgment is void because United did not receive adequate notice of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s proposed discharge.  Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to serve the summons and complaint as required by the Bankruptcy Rules deprived United of a right granted by a procedural rule.  United could have timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection.  But this deprivation did not amount to a violation of due process, which requires notice \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mullane</em> v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/index.html">339 U. S. 306</a>, 314.  Here, United\xe2\x80\x99s actual notice of the filing and contents of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan more than satisfied its due process rights.  Thus, Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make the required service does not entitle United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Contrary to United\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the confirmation order is not void because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan absent an undue hardship finding under \xc2\xa7523(a)(8).  Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief.  Section 523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over student loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a denial of due process.  Instead, it requires a court to make a certain findings before confirming a student loan debt\xe2\x80\x99s discharge.  \xe2\x80\x98That this requirement is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98self-executing,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation</em> v. <em>Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/440/index.html">541 U. S. 440</a>, 450, means only that the bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes.  Although the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is enforceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.  A Chapter 13 plan proposing such a discharge without the required determination violates \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).  Failure to comply with this self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court may confirm only a plan that, <em>inter alia, </em>complies with the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable provisions\xe2\x80\x9d of the Code.  \xc2\xa71325(a).  Neither the Code nor the Rules prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint.

Such bad-faith efforts should be deterred by the specter of penalties that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ebtors and their attorneys face \xe2\x80\xa6 under various provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/638/index.html">503 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(8), 1328.  The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require bankruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6), which the party seeking the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.  The debtor in this case filed a plan with the Bankruptcy Court that proposed to discharge a portion of his student loan debt, but he failed to initiate the adversary proceeding as required for such discharge.  The creditor received notice of, but did not object to, the plan, and failed to file an appeal after the Bankruptcy Court subsequently confirmed the plan.  Years later, the creditor filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) asking the Bankruptcy Court to rule that its order confirming the plan was void because the order was issued in violation of the Code and Rules.  We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether an order that confirms the discharge of a student loan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or an adversary proceeding, or both, is a void judgment for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between 1988 and 1989, respondent Francisco Espinosa obtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a total principal amount of $13,250.  In 1992, Espinosa filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13.  That Chapter permits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or a portion of their debts over a period of time specified in the plan.  See <em>Nobelman</em> v. <em>American Savings Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/324/index.html">508 U. S. 324</a>, 327 (1993); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b).  A proposed bankruptcy plan becomes effective upon confirmation, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324, 1325, and will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see \xc2\xa71328(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan listed his student loan debt as his only specific indebtedness.  App. 15\xe2\x80\x9318.  The plan proposed to repay only the principal on that debt, stating that the remainder\xe2\x80\x94the accrued interest\xe2\x80\x94would be discharged once Espinosa repaid the principal.  <em>Id., </em>at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require, the clerk of the Bankruptcy Court mailed notice and a copy of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan to petitioner United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (United), the creditor to whom Espinosa owed the student loan debt.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Id., </em>at 34; see Rules 2002(b), (g)(2), 3015(d).

The plan also noted the deadlines for filing a proof of claim or an objection to the plan.  <em>Id., </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0United received this notice and, in response, filed a proof of claim for $17,832.15, an amount representing both the principal and the accrued interest on Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loans.  <em>Id., </em>at 35.  United did not object to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s proposed discharge of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loan interest without a determination of undue hardship, nor did it object to Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to initiate an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 1993, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan without holding an adversary proceeding or making a finding of undue hardship.  One month later, the Chapter 13 trustee mailed United a form notice stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he amount of the claim filed differs from the amount listed for payment in the plan\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[y]our claim will be paid as listed in the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 44<em>.</em>  The form also apprised United that if United \xe2\x80\x9cwishe[d] to dispute the above stated treatment of the claim,\xe2\x80\x9d it had the \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility\xe2\x80\x9d to notify the trustee within 30 days.  <em>Ibid.</em>  United did not respond to that notice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 1997, Espinosa completed the payments on his student loan principal, as required by the plan.  Shortly thereafter, the Bankruptcy Court discharged Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loan interest.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2000, the United States Department of Education commenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loans.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In response, Espinosa filed a motion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its 1997 discharge order by directing the Department and United to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on his student loan debt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to set aside as void the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 order confirming Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan.  United made two arguments in support of its motion.  First, United claimed that the provision of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan authorizing the discharge of his student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code, which requires a court to find undue hardship before discharging a student loan debt, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(8), 1328(a), and with the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to make the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6).  Second, United argued that its due process rights had been violated because Espinosa failed to serve it with the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial proceeding.  See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s motion in relevant part, denied United\xe2\x80\x99s cross-motion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their collection efforts.  United sought review in the District Court, which reversed.  That court held that United was denied due process because the confirmation order was issued without service of the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which issued an initial <em>per curiam</em> opinion remanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider correcting an apparent clerical error in its discharge order.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  530 F.\xc2\xa03d 895, 899 (2008).  The Bankruptcy Court corrected the error, after which the Court of Appeals resubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the District Court.  The Court of Appeals concluded that by confirming Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan without first finding undue hardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most committed a legal error that United might have successfully appealed, but that any such legal error was not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as void under Rule 60(b).  553 F.\xc2\xa03d 1193, 1198\xe2\x80\x931202 (2008).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In addition, the Court of Appeals held that although Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to serve United with a summons and complaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan debt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void because United received actual notice of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan and failed to object.

Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, 11.  Such an argument would fail in any event.  First, \xc2\xa7523(a)(8)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory requirement that a bankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging a student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a discharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.<em> </em>See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 515\xe2\x80\x93516 (2006).  Second, the requirement that a bankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary proceeding derives from the Bankruptcy Rules, see Rule Proc. 7001(6), which are \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U.

Specifically, United argues that the Bankruptcy Court violated United\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights by confirming Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan despite Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to serve the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require for the commencement of an adversary proceeding.  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to serve United with a summons and complaint deprived United of a right granted by a procedural rule.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004(b)(3).  United could have timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection.  But this deprivation did not amount to a violation of United\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to due process.  Due process requires notice \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullane</em> v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/index.html">339 U.

S. 220</a>, 225 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ue process does not require actual notice . . .\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, United received <em>actual</em> notice of the filing and contents of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan.  This more than satisfied United\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights.  Accordingly, on these facts, Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s failure to serve a summons and complaint does not entitle United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unable to demonstrate a jurisdictional error or a due process violation, United and the Government, as <em>amicus</em>, urge us to expand the universe of judgment defects that support Rule 60(b)(4) relief.  Specifically, they contend that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation order is void because the court lacked statutory authority to confirm Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan absent a finding of undue hardship.  In support of this contention, they cite the text of \xc2\xa7523(a)(8), which provides that student loan debts guaranteed by governmental units are not dischargeable \xe2\x80\x9c<em>unless</em>\xe2\x80\x9d a court finds undue hardship.  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(8) (emphasis added).  They argue that this language imposes a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98self-executing\xe2\x80\x99 limitation on the effect of a discharge order\xe2\x80\x9d that renders the order legally unenforceable, and thus void, if it is not satisfied.  Brief for Petitioner 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18 (quoting <em>Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation </em>v. <em>Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/440/index.html">541 U. S. 440</a>, 450 (2004)).  In addition, United cites \xc2\xa71325(a)(1), which instructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans that comply with \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\xa6 applicable provisions\xe2\x80\x9d of the Code.  Reading these provisions in tandem, United argues that an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge a student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is \xe2\x80\x9cdoubly beyond the court\xe2\x80\x99s authority and therefore void.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 13.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hardship in accordance with \xc2\xa7523(a)(8) is on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments that qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(4).  As noted, \xc2\xa7523(a)(8) does not limit the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over student loan debts.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>Supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310; see <em>Hood</em>, 541 U. S., at 447 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s property\xe2\x80\x9d).<em> </em>Nor does the provision impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a denial of due process.  Instead, \xc2\xa7523(a)(8) requires a court to make a certain finding before confirming the discharge of a student loan debt.  It is true, as we explained in <em>Hood</em>, that this requirement is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98self-executing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 450.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  But that means only that the bankruptcy court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for purposes of Rule 60(b)(4).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the Code\xe2\x80\x99s clear and self-executing requirement for an undue hardship determination, the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find undue hardship before confirming Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan was a legal error.  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.  But the order remains enforceable and binding on United because United had notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0United\xe2\x80\x99s response\xe2\x80\x94that it had no obligation to object to Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan until Espinosa served it with the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require, Brief for Petitioner 33\xe2\x80\x94is unavailing.  Rule 60(b)(4) does not provide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights.  United had actual notice of the filing of Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan, its contents, and the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent confirmation of the plan.  In addition, United filed a proof of claim regarding Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loan debt, thereby submitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction  with respect to that claim.  See <em>Langenkamp </em>v. <em>Culp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/42/index.html">498 U. S. 42</a>, 44 (1990) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  United therefore forfeited its arguments regarding the validity of service or the adequacy of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s procedures by failing to raise a timely objection in that court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 60(b)(4) strikes a balance between the need for finality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that litigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a dispute.  Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan\xe2\x80\x99s contents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan before the time for appeal expires, that party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not justify Rule 60(b)(4) relief.  We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation order is not void.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In issuing its judgment, however, the Court of Appeals looked beyond the narrow question whether the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s order confirming Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s plan was void under Rule 60(b)(4).  It canvassed other bankruptcy court decisions within the Circuit that presented a different question\xe2\x80\x94whether a bankruptcy court presented with a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt, in the absence of an adversary proceeding to determine undue hardship, should confirm the plan despite its failure to comply with the Code and Rules.  The Court of Appeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined to confirm such plans \xe2\x80\x9ceven when the creditor fail[ed] to object to the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  553 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1205.  The court disapproved that practice and overruled those cases, stating that bankruptcy courts <em>must</em> confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without a determination of undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This, we think, was a step too far.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Espinosa concedes, Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 36, a Chapter 13 plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt without a determination of undue hardship violates \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).  Failure to comply with this self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of the plan even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in the proceeding at all.  See <em>Hood</em>, 541 U. S., at 450.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  That is because \xc2\xa71325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan only if the court finds, <em>inter alia</em>, that the plan complies with the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable provisions\xe2\x80\x9d of the Code.  \xc2\xa71325(a) (providing that a bankruptcy court \xe2\x80\x9cshall confirm a plan\xe2\x80\x9d if the plan \xe2\x80\x9ccomplies with the provisions of\xe2\x80\x9d Chapter 13 and with \xe2\x80\x9cother applicable provisions of this title\xe2\x80\x9d); see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Home State Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/78/index.html">501 U. S. 78</a>, 87 (1991); see also \xc2\xa7105(a) (authorizing bankruptcy courts to issue \xe2\x80\x9cany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out\xe2\x80\x9d the Code\xe2\x80\x99s provisions).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 assertion, the Code makes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the obligation\xe2\x80\x94to direct a debtor to conform his plan to the requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are mindful that conserving assets is an important concern in a bankruptcy proceeding.  We thus assume that, in some cases, a debtor and creditor may agree that payment of a student loan debt will cause the debtor an undue hardship sufficient to justify discharge.  In such a case, there is no reason that compliance with the undue hardship requirement should impose significant costs on the parties or materially delay confirmation of the plan.  Neither the Code nor the Rules prevent the parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship, and neither prevents the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa04(k).  But, to comply with \xc2\xa7523(a)(8)\xe2\x80\x99s directive, the bankruptcy court must make an independent determination of undue hardship before a plan is confirmed, even if  the creditor fails to object or appear in the adversary proceeding.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0United argues that our failure to declare the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s order void will encourage unscrupulous debtors to abuse the Chapter 13 process by filing plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship requirement in the hopes the bankruptcy court will overlook the proposal and the creditor will not object.  In the event the objectionable provision is discovered, United claims, the debtor can withdraw the plan and file another without penalty.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We acknowledge the potential for bad-faith litigation tactics.  But expanding the availability of relief under Rule 60(b)(4) is not an appropriate prophylaxis.  As we stated in <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/638/index.html">503 U. S. 638</a> (1992), \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ebtors and their attorneys face penalties under various provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 644; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011.  The specter of such penalties should deter bad-faith attempts to discharge student loan debt without the undue hardship finding Congress required.  And to the extent existing sanctions prove inadequate to this task, Congress may enact additional provisions to address the difficulties United predicts will follow our decision.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0United is a guaranty agency that administers the collection of federally guaranteed student loans in accordance with regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Education.

That provision appeared irreconcilable with the confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the interest on Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loan debt.  Suggesting that the Bankruptcy Court may have automatically generated the discharge order without tailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the discharge order to conform to the confirmation order.  <em>Id.</em>, at 899; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission\xe2\x80\x9d).  On remand, the Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order excepting Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s student loan debt from discharge \xe2\x80\x9cwas inserted because of a clerical mistake\xe2\x80\x9d and struck that language from the order.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(1)(B), (C) (specified tax debts); \xc2\xa7523(a)(5) (domestic support obligations); \xc2\xa7523(a)(9) (debts \xe2\x80\x9ccaused by\xe2\x80\x9d the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful operation of a vehicle while intoxicated).
