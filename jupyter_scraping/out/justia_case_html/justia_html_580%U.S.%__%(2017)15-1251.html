Given this provision, the responsibilities of an office requiring Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation (PAS office) may go unperformed if a vacancy arises and the President and Senate cannot promptly agree on a replacement.  Congress has accounted for this reality by giving the President limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant PAS office without first obtaining Senate approval.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The current version of that authorization is the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA).  Section 3345(a) of the FVRA permits three categories of Government officials to perform acting service in a vacant PAS office.  Subsection (a)(1) prescribes the general rule that, if a vacancy arises in a PAS office, the first assistant to that office \xe2\x80\x9cshall perform\xe2\x80\x9d the office\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunctions and duties temporarily in an acting capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) provide that, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding paragraph (1),\xe2\x80\x9d the President \xe2\x80\x9cmay direct\xe2\x80\x9d a person already serving in another PAS office, or a senior employee in the relevant agency, to serve in an acting capacity instead.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Section 3345 also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.  Subsection (b)(1) states: \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section\xe2\x80\x9d if the President nominates him for the vacant PAS office and, during the 365-day period preceding the vacancy, the person \xe2\x80\x9cdid not serve in the position of first assistant\xe2\x80\x9d to that office or \xe2\x80\x9cserved in [that] position . . . for less than 90 days.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or the Board) is a PAS office.  In June 2010, a vacancy arose in that office, and the President directed Lafe Solomon to serve as acting general counsel.  Solomon qualified for acting service under subsection (a)(3) of the FVRA, because he was a senior employee at the NLRB.  In January 2011, the President nominated Solomon to serve as the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel on a permanent basis.  The Senate never took action on the nomination, and the President ultimately withdrew Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s name in favor of a new candidate, whom the Senate confirmed in October 2013.  Throughout this entire period Solomon served as the acting general counsel to the NLRB.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">In January 2013, an NLRB Regional Director, exercising authority on Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, issued an unfair labor practices complaint against respondent SW General, Inc.  An Administrative Law Judge concluded that SW General had committed unfair labor practices, and the NLRB agreed.  SW General sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that the complaint was invalid because, under subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA, Solomon could not perform the duties of general counsel to the NLRB after having been nominated to fill that position.  The NLRB countered that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection (a)(1), not to acting officers who, like Solomon, serve under (a)(2) or (a)(3).  The Court of Appeals vacated the Board\xe2\x80\x99s order.  It concluded that the prohibition on acting service by nominees contained in subsection (b)(1) applies to all acting officers, regardless of whether they serve pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3).  As a result, Solomon became ineligible to perform the duties of general counsel in an acting capacity once the President nominated him to fill that post.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA prevents a person who has been nominated to fill a vacant PAS office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity.  The prohibition applies to anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.  It is not limited to first assistants performing acting service under subsection (a)(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The text of the FVRA requires this conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Subsection (b)(1) applies to any \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and prohibits service \xe2\x80\x9cas an acting officer for an office under this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cPerson\xe2\x80\x9d has an expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the FVRA.  See <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n.  And \xe2\x80\x9cunder this section\xe2\x80\x9d clarifies that subsection (b)(1) applies to all of \xc2\xa73345: The FVRA contains cross-references to specific subsections and paragraphs.  But subsection (b)(1) refers to \xc2\xa73345, which contains all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.  The rest of the FVRA also uses the pairing of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csection\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass anyone serving as an acting officer under the FVRA, and Congress could readily have used more specific language if it intended subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants acting under (a)(1).  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The dependent clause at the beginning of subsection (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94confirms the breadth of the prohibition on acting service by nominees.  In statutes, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clauses show that one provision prevails over another in the event of a conflict.  Here, that means that subsection (b)(1) applies even when it conflicts with the default rule in (a)(1) that first assistants \xe2\x80\x9cshall perform\xe2\x80\x9d acting duties.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2) The Board argues that, because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d does not mention (a)(2) or (a)(3), Congress did not intend the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) to apply to people serving as acting officers under those provisions.  The Board relies on the \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive canon, <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, expressing one item of [an] associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Echazabal</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 73\n (internal quotation marks omitted). </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This interpretive canon applies, however, only when \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances support[\xc2\xa0] a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 81.  A \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause does not naturally give rise to such an inference; it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.  Singling out one conflict generally does not suggest that other, unaddressed conflicts should be resolved in the opposite manner.  Here, the conflict between (a)(1) and (b)(1) is unique: The former uses mandatory language\xe2\x80\x94the first assistant \xe2\x80\x9cshall perform\xe2\x80\x9d acting duties\xe2\x80\x94while the latter identifies who \xe2\x80\x9cmay not\xe2\x80\x9d serve as an acting officer.  The \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause clarifies that the mandatory language in subsection (a)(1) does not prevail over subsection (b)(1) in the event of a conflict.  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) lack that mandatory language, so the natural inference is that Congress left these provisions out of the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause because they differ from subsection (a)(1), not to implicitly exempt them from the prohibition in subsection (b)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Moreover, subsection (b)(2) specifies that (b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to certain people who are \xe2\x80\x9cserving as the first assistant.\xe2\x80\x9d  If (b)(1) applied only to first assistants, stating that limitation would be superfluous.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) Because the text is clear, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s arguments about legislative history, purpose, and post-enactment practice need not be considered.  In any event, its arguments are not compelling.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The original draft of the FVRA contained a prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers, but explicitly limited that prohibition to first assistants.  The Board argues that, when Congress revised this original draft, it made changes to give the President more flexibility to appoint acting officers and did not intend to broaden the prohibition on nominees performing acting service.  The glitch in this argument is that Congress did change the prohibition on nominees performing acting service, revising it to clearly apply to all acting officers.  The fact that certain Senators stated that they wanted to give the President more flexibility to appoint acting officials does not mean that they got exactly what they wanted.  Nor does a statement by one of the sponsors of the FVRA\xe2\x80\x94who said that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants\xe2\x80\x94overcome the clear text, particularly given that the very next Senator to speak offered a contradictory account of the provision.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Board also argues that, since the FVRA was enacted, Congress has not objected when Presidents have nominated individuals who were serving as acting officers under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3), and that the Office of Legal Counsel and Government Accountability Office have issued guidance construing subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants.  Relying on <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Noel Canning</i>, the Board contends that this \xe2\x80\x9chistorical practice\xe2\x80\x9d is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9csignificant weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\xe2\x80\x9c[H]istorical practice\xe2\x80\x9d is too grand a title for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  The FVRA was not enacted until 1998, and the evidence the Board cites is not significant enough to warrant the conclusion that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to speak up implies that it has acquiesced in the view that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants.  By contrast, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Noel Canning</i> dealt with the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority under the Recess Appointments Clause; an issue that had attracted intense attention from Presidents, Attorneys General, and the Senate dating back to the beginning of the Republic.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2. Applying the FVRA to this case is straightforward.  Subsection (b)(1) prohibited Solomon from continuing his service as acting general counsel once the President nominated him to fill the position permanently.  The President could have appointed another person to serve as acting officer in Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s place, but did not do so.

Congress has long accountedfor this reality by authorizing the President to direct certain officials to temporarily carry out the duties of a vacant PAS office in an acting capacity, without Senate confirmation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA),\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73345 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, is the latest version of that authorization.  Section 3345(a) of the FVRA authorizes three classes of Government officials to become acting officers.  The general rule is that the first assistant to a vacant office shall become the acting officer.  The President may override that default rule by directing either a person serving in a different PAS office or a senior employee within the relevant agency to become the acting officer instead.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The FVRA, however, prohibits certain persons from serving as acting officers if the President has nominated them to fill the vacant office permanently.  The question presented is whether that limitation applies only to first assistants who have automatically assumed acting duties, or whether it also applies to PAS officers and senior employees serving as acting officers at the President\xe2\x80\x99s behest.  We hold that it applies to all three categories of acting officers.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent power is a critical \xe2\x80\x9cstructural safeguard[\xc2\xa0] of the constitutional scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Edmond</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651,\n659 (1997)\n.  The Framers envisioned it as \xe2\x80\x9can excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President\xe2\x80\x9d and a guard against \xe2\x80\x9cthe appointment of unfit characters .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 76, p. 457 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  The constitutional process of Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, however, can take time: The President may not promptly settle on a nominee to fill an office; the Senate may be unable, or unwilling, to speedily confirm the nominee once submitted.  Yet neither may desire to see the duties of the vacant office go unperformed in the interim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Since President Washington\xe2\x80\x99s first term, Congress has given the President limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant PAS office without first obtaining Senate approval.  The earliest statutes authorized the appointment of \xe2\x80\x9cany person or persons\xe2\x80\x9d to fill specific vacancies in the Departments of State, Treasury, and War.  Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 37, \xc2\xa78,\n\n1Stat.\n281.  Congress at first allowed acting officers to serve until the permanent officeholder could resume his duties or a successor was appointed, <i>ibid.</i>, but soon imposed a six-month limit on acting service, Act of Feb. 13, 1795, ch. 21,\n\n1Stat.\n415.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress revisited the issue in the 1860s, ultimately passing the Vacancies Act of 1868.  The Vacancies Act expanded the number of PAS offices that the President could fill with acting officers.  Act of July 23, 1868, ch. 227,\n\n15Stat.\n168; see also Act of Feb. 20, 1863, ch. 45,\n\n12Stat.\n656.  With that expansion came new constraints.  The authority to appoint \xe2\x80\x9cany person or persons\xe2\x80\x9d as an acting officer gave way to a default rule that the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst or sole assistant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall\xe2\x80\x9d perform that function, with an exception allowing the President to instead fill the post with a person already serving in a PAS office.\n\n15Stat.\n168.  And rather than six months of acting service, the Vacancies Act generally authorized only ten days.  <i>Ibid.</i>  That narrow window of acting service was later lengthened to 30 days.  Act of Feb. 6, 1891, ch. 113,\n\n26Stat.\n733.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">During the 1970s and 1980s, interbranch conflict arose over the Vacancies Act.  The Department of Justice took the position that, in many instances, the head of an executive agency had independent authority apart from the Vacancies Act to temporarily fill vacant offices.  The Comptroller General disagreed, arguing that the Act was the exclusive authority for temporarily filling vacancies in executive agencies.  See M. Rosenberg, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, The New Vacancies Act: Congress Acts to Protect the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s Confirmation Prerogative 2\xe2\x80\x934 (1998) (Rosenberg).  Congress then amended the Vacancies Act to clarify that it applies to such agencies, while at the same time lengthening the term of permissible acting service to 120 days, with a tolling period while a nomination is pending.  <i>Id.,</i> at 3; see Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act, \xc2\xa77,\n\n102Stat.\n988.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But tensions did not ease.  By 1998, approximately 20 percent of PAS offices in executive agencies were occupied by \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary designees, most of whom had served beyond the 120-day limitation period .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without presidential submissions of nominations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rosenberg 1.  These acting officers filled high-level positions, sometimes in obvious contravention of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.  One, for instance, was brought in from outside Government to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, immediately after the Senate refused to confirm him for that very office.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see M. Rosenberg, Congressional Research Service, Valid-ity of Designation of Bill Lann Lee as Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights 1\xe2\x80\x933 (1998).  Perceiving a threat to the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent power, see Rosen-berg 6, Congress acted again.  In 1998, it replaced the Vacancies Act with the FVRA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 3345(a) of the FVRA permits three categories of Government officials to perform acting service in a vacant PAS office.  Subsection (a)(1) prescribes a general rule: If a person serving in a PAS office dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform his duties, the first assistant to that office \xe2\x80\x9cshall perform\xe2\x80\x9d the office\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunctions and duties .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. temporarily in an acting capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next two paragraphs of \xc2\xa73345(a) identify alternatives.  Subsection (a)(2) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding paragraph (1),\xe2\x80\x9d the President \xe2\x80\x9cmay direct a person\xe2\x80\x9d who already serves in a PAS office to \xe2\x80\x9cperform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Subsection (a)(3) adds that \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding paragraph (1),\xe2\x80\x9d the President \xe2\x80\x9cmay direct\xe2\x80\x9d a person to perform acting duties if the person served in a senior position in the relevant agency for at least 90 days in the 365-day period preceding the vacancy.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 3345 also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.  Subsection (b)(1) states: \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section\xe2\x80\x9d if the President nominates him for the vacant PAS office and, during the 365-day period preceding the vacancy, the individual \xe2\x80\x9cdid not serve in the position of first assistant\xe2\x80\x9d to that office or \xe2\x80\x9cserved in [that] position .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for less than 90 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  Subsection (b)(2) creates an exception to this prohibition, providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]aragraph (1) shall not apply to any person\xe2\x80\x9d serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other sections of the FVRA establish time limits on acting service and penalties for noncompliance.  In most cases, the statute permits acting service for \xe2\x80\x9c210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs\xe2\x80\x9d; tolls that time limit while a nomination is pending; and starts a new 210-day clock if the nomination is \xe2\x80\x9crejected, withdrawn, or returned.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73346(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b)(1).  Upon a second nomination, the time limit tolls once more, and an acting officer can serve an additional 210 days if the second nomination proves unsuccessful.  \xc2\xa73346(b)(2).  The FVRA ensures compliance by providing that, in general, \xe2\x80\x9cany function or duty of a vacant office\xe2\x80\x9d performed by a person not properly serving under the statute \xe2\x80\x9cshall have no force or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73348(d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) is charged with administering the National Labor Relations Act.

The President directed Lafe Solomon to serve temporarily as the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s acting general counsel, citing the FVRA as the basis for the appointment.  See Memorandum from President Barack Obama to L. Solomon (June 18, 2010).  Solomon satisfied the requirements for acting service under subsection (a)(3) of the FVRA because he had spent the previous ten years in the senior position of Director of the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Representation Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The President had bigger plans for Solomon than acting service.  On January 5, 2011, he nominated Solomon to serve as the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel on a permanent basis.  The Senate had other ideas.  That body did not act upon the nomination during the 112th Congress, so it was returned to the President when the legislative session expired.  159 Cong. Rec. S17 (Jan. 3, 2013).  The President resubmitted Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s name for consideration in the spring of 2013, <i>id.,</i> at S3884 (May 23, 2013), but to no avail.  The President ultimately withdrew Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s nomination and put forward a new candidate, whom the Senate confirmed on October 29, 2013.  <i>Id.,</i> at S7635.  Throughout this entire period, Solomon served as the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s acting general counsel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities included exercising \xe2\x80\x9cfinal authority\xe2\x80\x9d to issue complaints alleging unfair labor practices.  29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7153(d), 160(b).  In January 2013, an NLRB Regional Director, exercising authority on Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, issued a complaint alleging that respondent SW General, Inc.\xe2\x80\x94a company that provides ambulance services\xe2\x80\x94had improperly failed to pay certain bonuses to long-term employees.  An Administrative Law Judge concluded that SW General had committed unfair labor practices, and the NLRB agreed.  360 N.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0B. 109 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">SW General filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  It argued that the unfair labor practices complaint was invalid because, under subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA, Solomon could not legally perform the duties of general counsel after having been nominated to fill that position.  The NLRB defended Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  It contended that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection (a)(1), not to acting officers who, like Solomon, serve under (a)(2) or (a)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals granted SW General\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review and vacated the Board\xe2\x80\x99s order.  It reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe text of subsection (b)(1) squarely supports\xe2\x80\x9d the conclusion that the provision\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on nominees serving as acting officers \xe2\x80\x9capplies to all acting officers, no matter whether they serve pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).\xe2\x80\x9d  796 F.\xc2\xa03d 67, 78 (CADC 2015).

In full, it states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section, if\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">(A) during the 365-day period preceding the date of the death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve, such person\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">(i) did not serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">(ii) served in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer for less than 90 days; and</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">(B) the President submits a nomination of such person to the Senate for appointment to such office.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Subsection (b)(2) adds that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]aragraph (1) shall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to a person serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We conclude that the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) applies to anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.  It is not, as the Board contends, limited to first assistants performing acting service under subsection (a)(1).

The phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d does not limit the reach of (b)(1), but instead clarifies that the prohibition applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that first assistants shall perform acting duties.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our analysis of subsection (b)(1) begins with its text.  Subsection (b)(1) applies to any \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and prohibits service \xe2\x80\x9cas an acting officer for an office under this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  The key words are \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csection.\xe2\x80\x9d  They clearly indicate that (b)(1) applies to all acting officers under \xc2\xa73345, regardless of the means of appointment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start with \xe2\x80\x9cperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word has a naturally expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the FVRA.  See <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308,\n312 (1978)\n.  Important as they may be, first assistants are not the only \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of the bunch.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Now add \xe2\x80\x9cunder this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  The language clarifies that subsection (b)(1) applies to all persons serving under \xc2\xa73345.  Congress often drafts statutes with hierarchical schemes\xe2\x80\x94section, subsection, paragraph, and on down the line.  See <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</i> v. <i>Nigh</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 50\n\xe2\x80\x9361 (2004); L. Filson, The Legislative Drafter\xe2\x80\x99s Desk Reference 222 (1992).  Congress used that structure in the FVRA and relied on it to make precise cross-references.  When Congress wanted to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph, it said so.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa73346(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9csubsection (b)\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa73346(b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cparagraph (1)\xe2\x80\x9d).  But in (b)(1) Congress referred to the entire section\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa73345\xe2\x80\x94which subsumes all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rest of the FVRA uses the pairing of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csection\xe2\x80\x9d the same way.  Section 3346, for example, specifies how long \xe2\x80\x9cthe <i>person</i> serving as an acting officer as described under <i>section</i> 3345 may serve in the office.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  And \xc2\xa73348(d)(1) describes the consequences of noncompliance with the FVRA by referring to the actions \xe2\x80\x9ctaken by any <i>person</i> who is not acting under <i>section</i> 3345, 3346, or 3347.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  No one disputes that both provisions apply to anyone serving as an acting officer under the FVRA, not just first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Had Congress intended subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants acting under (a)(1), it could easily have chosen clearer language.  Replacing \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cfirst assistant\xe2\x80\x9d would have done the trick.  So too would replacing \xe2\x80\x9cunder this section\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cunder subsection (a)(1).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that [Congress] did not adopt [either] readily available and apparent alternative strongly supports\xe2\x80\x9d the conclusion that subsection (b)(1) applies to any acting officer appointed under any provision within \xc2\xa73345.  <i>Knight</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 181,\n188 (2008)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> The dependent clause at the beginning of subsection (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94confirms that the prohibition on acting service applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that the first assistant shall perform acting duties.

A \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause does not naturally give rise to such an inference; it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.  Such a clause confirms rather than constrains breadth.  Singling out one potential conflict might suggest that Congress thought the conflict was particularly difficult to resolve, or was quite likely to arise.  But doing so generally does not imply anything about other, unaddressed conflicts, much less that they should be resolved in the <i>opposite</i> manner.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Suppose a radio station announces: \xe2\x80\x9cWe play your favorite hits from the \xe2\x80\x9960s, \xe2\x80\x9970s, and \xe2\x80\x9980s.  Notwithstanding the fact that we play hits from the \xe2\x80\x9960s, we do not play music by British bands.\xe2\x80\x9d  You would not tune in expecting to hear the 1970s British band \xe2\x80\x9cThe Clash\xe2\x80\x9d any more than the 1960s \xe2\x80\x9cBeatles.\xe2\x80\x9d  The station, after all, has announced that \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not play music by British bands.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause just establishes that this applies even to music from the \xe2\x80\x9960s, when British bands were prominently featured on the charts.  No one, however, would think the station singled out the \xe2\x80\x9960s to convey implicitly that its categorical statement \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not play music by British bands\xe2\x80\x9d actually did not apply to the \xe2\x80\x9970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Drawing a negative inference from the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause in subsection (b)(1) is similarly inapt.  Without that clause, subsection (b)(1) plainly would apply to all persons serving as acting officers under \xc2\xa73345(a).  Adding \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d makes sense because (a)(1) conflicts with (b)(1) in a unique manner.  The former is mandatory and self-executing: The first assistant \xe2\x80\x9c<i>shall</i> perform\xe2\x80\x9d acting duties.  The latter, by contrast, speaks to who \xe2\x80\x9cmay not\xe2\x80\x9d be an acting officer.  So if a vacancy arises and the President nominates the first assistant to fill the position, (a)(1) says the first assistant \xe2\x80\x9cshall perform\xe2\x80\x9d the duties of that office in an acting capacity while the nomination is pending, and (b)(1) says he \xe2\x80\x9cmay not.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause clarifies that the language of (a)(1) does not prevail if that conflict occurs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compare the mandatory language of subsection (a)(1) to (a)(2) and (a)(3).  People appointed under those provisions are just as much acting officers as first assistants who assume the role.  But there is no freestanding directive that they perform acting duties; subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) just say that the President \xe2\x80\x9cmay direct\xe2\x80\x9d them to do so.  The natural inference, then, is that Congress left these provisions out of the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause because they are different from subsection (a)(1), not to exempt from the broad prohibition in subsection (b)(1) those officers serving under (a)(2) and (a)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d is used the same way in other parts of \xc2\xa73345.  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) are each preceded by the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding paragraph (1).\xe2\x80\x9d  The phrase recognizes that subsection (a)(1) is unique, and resolves the potential conflict between the mandatory \xe2\x80\x9cshall perform\xe2\x80\x9d in that provision and the permissive \xe2\x80\x9cmay direct\xe2\x80\x9d in (a)(2) and (a)(3).  But it implies nothing about other potential conflicts that may arise in the statutory scheme.  In subsection (b)(1), it works the same way: The \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clause simply shows that (b)(1) overrides (a)(1), and nothing more.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Step back from the Board\xe2\x80\x99s focus on \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d and another problem appears: Its interpretation of subsection (b)(1) makes a mess of (b)(2).  Subsection (b)(2) specifies that (b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply to any person\xe2\x80\x9d if (A) that person \xe2\x80\x9cis serving as the first assistant\xe2\x80\x9d; (B) the first assistant position is itself a PAS office; and (C) \xe2\x80\x9cthe Senate has approved the appointment of such person\xe2\x80\x9d to that office.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation makes the first requirement superfluous, a result we typically try to avoid.  <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362,\n404 (2000)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Under our reading, subsection (b)(1) has no effect on (c)(1).  Subsection (b)(1) addresses nominations <i>generally</i>, prohibiting any person who has been nominated to fill any vacant office from performing that office\xe2\x80\x99s duties in an acting capacity.  Subsection (c)(1) speaks to a <i>specific</i> nomination scenario: When a person is \xe2\x80\x9cnominated by the President for reappointment for an additional term to the same office .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without a break in service.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this particular situation, the FVRA authorizes the nominee \xe2\x80\x9cto continue to serve in that office.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73345(c).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC</i> v. <i>Amalgamated Bank</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 639,\n645 (2012)\n.  The general prohibition on acting service by nominees yields to the more specific authorization allowing officers up for reappointment to remain at their posts.  Applying subsection (b)(1) to \xc2\xa73345(a) hardly compels a different result.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of subsection (b)(1) is clear: Subject to one narrow exception, it prohibits anyone who has been nominated to fill a vacant PAS office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity, regardless of whether the acting officer was appointed under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3).  It is not limited to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under (a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Board contends that legislative history, purpose, and post-enactment practice uniformly show that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants.  The text is clear, so we need not consider this extra-textual evidence.  See <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Rigsby</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).  In any event, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s evidence is not compelling.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Board argues that subsection (b)(1) was designed to serve a specific purpose: preventing the President from having his nominee serve as an acting officer by making him first assistant after (or right before) a vacancy arises.  Brief for Petitioner 38.  The original draft of the FVRA authorized first assistants and PAS officers to perform acting service.  Subsection (b) of that draft provided that if a first assistant was nominated to fill the vacant office, he could not perform that office\xe2\x80\x99s duties in an acting capacity unless he had been the first assistant for at least 180 days before the vacancy.  Several Senators thought the FVRA too restrictive.  They asked to add senior agency officials to the list of potential acting officers and to shorten the 180-day length-of-service requirement in subsection (b).  Their requests, the Board says, were granted; the final version of the FVRA included subsection (a)(3) for senior employees and shortened the length-of-service requirement to 90 days.  There was no intent to extend the pro-hibition in subsection (b) beyond first assistants.  <i>Id.,</i> at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The glitch in this argument is of course the text of subsection (b)(1).  Congress did amend the statute to allow senior employees to become acting officers under subsection (a)(3).  The only substantive change that was requested in (b) was to reduce the length-of-service requirement.  Congress could have done that with a few tweaks to the original version of subsection (b).  Instead, Congress went further: It also removed language that expressly limited subsection (b) to first assistants.  And it added a provision\xe2\x80\x94subsection (b)(2)\xe2\x80\x94that makes sense only if (b)(1) applies to all acting officers.  In short, Congress took a provision that explicitly applied only to first assistants and turned it into one that applies to all acting officers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Board protests that Congress would not have expanded the prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers after Senators asked to give the President <i>more</i> flexibility.  See Brief for Petitioner 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  That certain Senators made specific demands, however, does not mean that they got exactly what they wanted.  Passing a law often requires compromise, where even the most firm public demands bend to competing interests.  See <i>Ragsdale</i> v. <i>Wolverine World Wide, Inc.</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n\xe2\x80\x9394 (2002).  What Congress ultimately agrees on is the text that it enacts, not the preferences expressed by certain legislators.  See <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 75,\n79 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compromise is precisely what happened here: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] period of intense negotiations\xe2\x80\x9d took place after Senators demanded changes to the original draft of the FVRA, and the final bill was \xe2\x80\x9ca compromise measure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rosenberg 9.  The legislation as passed <i>did</i> expand the pool of individuals the President could appoint as acting officers, by adding senior employees in subsection (a)(3).  But it also expanded the scope of the limitation on acting service in (b)(1), by dropping the language making (b)(1) applicable only to first assistants.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Board contends that this compromise must not have happened because Senator Thompson, one of the sponsors of the FVRA, said that subsection (b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9capplies only when the acting officer is the first assistant, and not when the acting officer is designated by the President pursuant to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73345(a)(2) or 3345(a)(3).\xe2\x80\x9d  144 Cong.

But Senator Byrd\xe2\x80\x94the very next speaker\xe2\x80\x94offered a contradictory account: A nominee may not \xe2\x80\x9cserve as an acting officer\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9che is not the first assistant\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chas been the first assistant for less than 90 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. days, and has not been confirmed for the position.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 27498.  This is a good example of why floor statements by individual legislators rank among the least illuminating forms of legislative history.  See <i>Milner</i> v. <i>Department of Navy</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 562, 572 (2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cThose of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text.  We will not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the Board supports its interpretation with post-enactment practice.  It notes that the Office of Legal Counsel and the Government Accountability Office have issued guidance construing subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants.  And three Presidents have, without congressional objection, submitted the nominations of 112 individuals who were serving as acting officers under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3).  The Board contends that this \xe2\x80\x9chistorical practice\xe2\x80\x9d is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9csignificant weight\xe2\x80\x9d because the FVRA \xe2\x80\x9cconcern[s] the allocation of power between two elected branches of Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 49 (quoting <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Noel Canning</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c[H]istorical practice\xe2\x80\x9d is too grand a title for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  The FVRA was not enacted until 1998, and the 112 nominations that the Board cites make up less than two percent of the thousands of nominations to positions in executive agencies that the Senate has considered in the years since its passage.  Even the guidance documents the Board cites paid the matter little attention; both made conclusory statements about subsection (b)(1), with no analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this context, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to speak up does not fairly imply that it has acquiesced in the Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  See <i>Zuber</i> v. <i>Allen</i>,\n\n396 U.\xc2\xa0S. 168\n, n.\xc2\xa021 (1969); <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>Sandoval</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 275,\n292 (2001)\n.  The Senate may not have noticed that certain nominees were serving as acting officers in violation of the FVRA, or it may have chosen not to reject a qualified candidate just to make a point about compliance with the statute.  Either is at least as plausible as the theory that the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s inaction reflects considered acceptance of the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s practice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decision in <i>Noel Canning</i>\xe2\x80\x94the chief opinion on which the Board relies\xe2\x80\x94is a sharp contrast.  That case dealt with the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, an issue that has attracted intense attention and written analysis from Presidents, Attorneys General, and the Senate.  573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 22\xe2\x80\x9332).  The voluminous historical record dated back to \xe2\x80\x9cthe beginning of the Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d and included \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of intra-session recess appointments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 12).  That the chronicle of the Recess Appointments Clause weighed heavily in <i>Noel Canning</i> offers no support to the Board here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying the FVRA to this case is straightforward.  Solomon was appointed as acting general counsel under subsection (a)(3).  Once the President submitted his nomination to fill that position in a permanent capacity, subsection (b)(1) prohibited him from continuing his acting service.  This does not mean that the duties of general counsel to the NLRB needed to go unperformed; the President could have appointed another person to serve as the acting officer in Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s place.  And he had a wide array of individuals to choose from: any one of the approximately 250 senior NLRB employees or the hundreds of individuals in PAS positions throughout the Government.  The President, however, did not do so, and Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s continued service violated the FVRA.

Principal officers must be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.  See <i>Edmond </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651,\n660 (1997)\n.  That process \xe2\x80\x9cis also the default manner of appointment for inferior officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But the Clause provides a limited exception for the appointment of inferior officers: Congress may \xe2\x80\x9cby Law\xe2\x80\x9d authorize the President, the head of an executive department, or a court of law to appoint inferior officers without the advice and consent of the Senate.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The FVRA governs the process by which the President may temporarily fill a vacancy in an Executive Branch office normally occupied by an officer of the United States.  As relevant in this case, when a vacancy arises, the President may \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d an official to \xe2\x80\x9cperform the functions and duties of the office temporarily.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73345(a)(2), (3).  That official may be an officer previously appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to any office, or certain high-ranking employees of the agency in which the vacancy arose.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The FVRA does not, however, require the President to seek the advice and consent of the Senate before directing the official to perform the functions of the vacant office.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the President \xe2\x80\x9cdirect[s]\xe2\x80\x9d someone to serve as an officer pursuant to the FVRA, he is \xe2\x80\x9cappoint[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d that person as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficer of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Appointments Clause.  Around the time of the framing, the verb \xe2\x80\x9cappoint\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o establish anything by decree,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 S.

Appointing inferior officers in this manner raises no constitutional problems.  That is because the Appointments Clause authorizes Congress to enact \xe2\x80\x9cLaw[s],\xe2\x80\x9d like the FVRA, \xe2\x80\x9cvest[ing] the Appointment of such inferior Officers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the President alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appointing principal officers under the FVRA, however, raises grave constitutional concerns because the Appointments Clause forbids the President to appoint principal officers without the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because we interpret the FVRA to forbid Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s appointment in this case, we need not confront these concerns.  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation necessarily raises the question whether that appointment complied with the requirements of the Appointments Clause.  That inquiry turns on two considerations: (1) whether the general counsel of the NLRB is an \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Appointments Clause and, if so, (2) whether he is a principal officer who can be appointed only by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  In my view, the general counsel plainly is an officer of the United States.  I also think he is likely a principal officer. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As an initial matter, the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel is an \xe2\x80\x9cofficer of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d whose appointment is governed by the Appointments Clause.  \xe2\x80\x9cExtensive evidence suggests\xe2\x80\x9d that, at the time of the framing, this phrase was understood to encompass \xe2\x80\x9call federal officials with responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mascott, Whoare \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d? 70 Stan.

Before 1947, the Board \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled not only the filing of complaints, but their prosecution and adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>Food &amp; Commercial Workers</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112,\n117 (1987)\n.  The Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, ch. 120,\n\n61Stat.\n136, however, \xe2\x80\x9ceffected an important change\xe2\x80\x9d in the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s structure by \xe2\x80\x9cseparat[ing] the prosecuting from the adjudicating function, to place the former in the General Counsel, and to make him an independent official appointed by the President.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>NLRB</i>,\n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 10\n, n.\xc2\xa010 (1958).  Congress thus separated the NLRB into \xe2\x80\x9ctwo independent branches,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Food &amp; Commercial Workers</i>, 484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 129, andmade the general counsel \xe2\x80\x9cindependent of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s supervision and review,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 118; see also <i>id.,</i> at 129 (Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdecided to place the General Counsel within the agency, but to make the office independent of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s authority\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutorial decisions are unreviewable by either the Board or the Judiciary.  <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</i>,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132,\n138 (1975)\n; <i>Vaca </i>v. <i>Sipes</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 171,\n182 (1967)\n.  Although the Board has power to define some of the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duties, see\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7153(d), and the general counsel represents the Board in certain judicial proceedings, see Higgins, Labor Czars\xe2\x80\x94Commissars\xe2\x80\x94Keeping Women in the Kitchen\xe2\x80\x94The Purpose and Effects of the Administrative Changes Made by Taft-Hartley, 47 Cath. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 941, 967 (1998), the statute does not give the Board the power to remove him or otherwise generally to control his activities, see <i>Edmond</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 664 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe power to remove officers, we have recognized, is a powerful tool for control\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 510 (holding that executive officials were inferior officers in large part because they were subject to a superior\xe2\x80\x99s removal).  Because it appears that the general counsel answers to no officer inferior to the President, he is likely a principal officer.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Accordingly, the President likely could not lawfully have appointed Solomon to serve in thatrole without first obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I recognize that the \xe2\x80\x9cburdens on governmental processes\xe2\x80\x9d that the Appointments Clause imposes may \xe2\x80\x9coften seem clumsy, inefficient, even unworkable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>INS </i>v. <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919,\n959 (1983)\n.  Granting the President unilateral power to fill vacancies in high offices might contribute to more efficient Government.  But the Appointments Clause is not an empty formality.  Although theFramers recognized the potential value of leaving the selection of officers to \xe2\x80\x9cone man of discernment\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to a fractious, multimember body, see The Federalist No. 76, p. 510 (J. Cooke ed., 1961), they also recognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the Government, see <i>id.,</i> at 513; 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa71524, p. 376 (1833).

They thus empowered the Senate to confirm principal officers on the view that \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessity of its co-operation in the business of appointments will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of\xe2\x80\x9d the President.

The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA) cedes the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation authority, partially and on a temporary basis, to allow executive agencies to continue to function when one of those high-level offices becomes vacant.  It authorizes certain categories of officials to perform the duties of vacant offices on an acting basis.  One of its provisions pulls back that authorization when an official has been nominated to fill the vacant office on a permanent basis.  The scope of that provision is at issue here.  I agree with the Court that the provision applies to first assistants to a vacant office who serve as acting officials automatically, by operation of the FVRA.  I dis-agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the provision also applies to other officials who may serve as acting officials if the President directs them to serve in that capacity.  The Court gives the provision a broader reach than the text can bear with no support from the history of, or practice under, the FVRA.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the Court explains, the FVRA governs vacancies in offices held by persons \xe2\x80\x9cwhose appointment to office is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73345(a).  These are known as \xe2\x80\x9cPAS\xe2\x80\x9d offices.  When an official in a PAS office \xe2\x80\x9cdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office\xe2\x80\x9d the FVRA steps in.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also \xc2\xa73345(c)(2) (an \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of a term of office\xe2\x80\x9d makes an official unable \xe2\x80\x9cto perform the functions and duties\xe2\x80\x9d of the office).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 3345 of the FVRA authorizes four categories of officials to perform the duties of a vacant office.  Subsection (a)(1) contains a default rule: The \xe2\x80\x9cfirst assistant to the office\xe2\x80\x9d automatically assumes the vacant office and performs \xe2\x80\x9cthe functions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73345(a)(1).  Subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1) authorize the President to override that default rule.  The President may direct a person already confirmed by the Senate to a PAS office to serve as the acting officer.  See \xc2\xa73345(a)(2).  The President may direct certain senior officials in the same agency to serve as the acting officer.  See \xc2\xa73345(a)(3).  Or the President may direct a person whose Senate-confirmed term in the office has expired and who has been nominated to a subsequent term in that same office to serve as the acting officer until the Senate acts on the nomination.  See \xc2\xa73345(c)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Subsection (b)(1) takes away this authorization in a specific situation.  It provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the first assistant default rule\xe2\x80\x94a person may not serve as an acting official while nominated to fill the office if the person was not the first assistant to the office for at least 90 of the 365 days preceding the vacancy.  \xc2\xa73345(b)(1).  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a person serving as the Senate-confirmed first assistant to the vacant office.  See \xc2\xa73345(b)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In my view, the text, purpose, and history of the FVRA make clear that the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) applies only to a first assistant who performs the duties of a vacant office under subsection (a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the Court observes, subsection (b)(1) contains some potentially broad language.  The provision specifies when \xe2\x80\x9ca person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xc2\xa73345.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthis section,\xe2\x80\x9d taken in isolation, could signal that the prohibition applies to subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1) and thus covers all acting officials.  But context matters.  And here, the context cabins those words and gives subsection (b)(1) a more limited reach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of subsection (b)(1) contains a clear signal that its prohibition applies only to first assistants who automatically assume a vacant office under subsection (a)(1): It begins with the clause \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1).\xe2\x80\x9d  A notwithstanding clause identifies a potential conflict between two or more provisions and specifies which provision will prevail.  Under the familiar <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> interpretive canon, the choice to single out subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94and only subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94in this notwithstanding clause strongly suggests that the prohibition reaches, and conflicts with, subsection (a)(1), and only subsection (a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rest of \xc2\xa73345 confirms this conclusion.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) establishes who <i>may not</i> perform the duties of a vacant office.  In doing so, it introduces a potential conflict with subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1), which identify four categories of persons who <i>may</i> perform the duties of a vacant office.  By stating that its prohibition applies \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1),\xe2\x80\x9d subsection (b)(1) expressly states that its prohibition takes precedence over the default rule set out in subsection (a)(1).  The omission of any reference to subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1), in spite of the parallel potential for conflict with those subsections, suggests that the omission was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bruesewitz</i> v. <i>Wyeth LLC</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223\n\xe2\x80\x93233 (2011) (quoting <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Peabody Coal Co.</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149,\n168 (2003)\n). That choice means that subsection (b)(1) trumps subsection (a)(1) but not subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing about a notwithstanding clause renders it impervious to this established rule of statutory interpretation.  The Court says that the rule has less force in the context of a notwithstanding clause because such a clause \xe2\x80\x9cconfirms rather than constrains\xe2\x80\x9d the breadth of the provision to which it is attached.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  But the breadth of the attached provision is precisely the question here, and the clause\xe2\x80\x99s specific reference to subsection (a)(1) and only subsection (a)(1) strongly supports reading the attached prohibition to limit only subsection (a)(1).  See <i>Preseault</i> v. <i>ICC</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9314 (1990) (a reference to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98this Act\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in a notwithstanding clause limited the scope of the attached provision (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court claims that the reference to subsection (a)(1) may serve a different purpose.  In its view, the reference might instead demonstrate a congressional concern that a conflict between subsection (b)(1) and subsection (a)(1) would be \xe2\x80\x9cquite likely to arise\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly difficult to resolve.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  A closer examination does not bear out this hypothesis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text itself refutes the theory that subsection (b)(1) is more likely to conflict with subsection (a)(1) than the other subsections.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a person who served as the first assistant to the vacant office for more than 90 days in the year before the vacancy arose, \xc2\xa73345(b)(1)(A), or who serves as a Senate-confirmed first assistant to the office, \xc2\xa73345(b)(2).  A person serving under subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94by definition, only a first assistant\xe2\x80\x94has a leg up in meeting those conditions and avoiding subsection (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition altogether.  Those serving under subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1)\xe2\x80\x94PAS officials, senior agency officials, or officials whose terms in the vacant office have expired\xe2\x80\x94do not.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) is thus more likely, not less likely, to conflict with subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And true enough, subsection (a)(1) sets out an automatic rule under which the first assistant assumes acting status upon a vacancy, whereas subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1) set out conditional rules, under which the President may choose to direct other officials to assume acting status.  But that distinction makes no difference when asking whether a conflict between subsections (b)(1) and (a)(1) would be harder to resolve without guidance than a conflict between subsection (b)(1) and the other subsections.  In stating who may not assume acting status, subsection (b)(1) conflicts equally with the rules about who may assume acting status set out in subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1).  The reference to subsection (a)(1) in subsection (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s notwithstanding clause thus cannot be understood as a means to resolve a particularly vexing conflict.  The same conflict exists for all four categories.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanations make the notwithstanding clause in subsection (b)(1) superfluous.  If the notwithstanding clause serves only to confirm the breadth of subsection (b)(1) and singles out subsection (a)(1) to address a conflict shared equally by other subsections, then it does no real work.  The clause could be deleted without changing the meaning of subsection (b)(1), as the Court all but admits.  See <i>ante,</i> at 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Worse still, a broad interpretation of subsection (b)(1) renders subsection (c)(1) superfluous.  Under subsection (c)(1), the President may designate a person whose term in an office has expired and who has been nominated to a subsequent term to serve as the acting official.  It is unlikely, even implausible, that a person who serves out a set term will have served as the first assistant to her own office during the year before her term expired.  Yet subsection (b)(1) requires such service before a person can serve as both an acting official and a nominee.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  As a result, if subsection (b)(1) applies to all acting officials, it would prohibit what subsection (c)(1) expressly permits: acting service by a person nominated by the President to serve out a consecutive Senate-confirmed term in the vacant office.  That is no way to read a statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Not a problem, the Court says.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]ubsection (b)(1) has no effect on (c)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d because subsection (c)(1) contains a specific rule about acting service by a nominee for a second term that, under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, controls over the general rule governing acting service by a nominee in subsection (b)(1).  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning on this point undercuts its opening claim that the words \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunder this section\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(1) must refer to \xe2\x80\x9canyone who performs acting duties under the FVRA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.  And it underscores why the \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d clause in subsection (b)(1) is superfluous under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  The general authorization of acting service by a first assistant in subsection (a)(1) would yield to the specific prohibition on acting service by certain nominees in subsection (b)(1) even without the notwithstanding clause.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In contrast, reading subsection (b)(1) to apply only to a first assistant serving as an acting official under subsection (a)(1) renders no other provision superfluous.  The Court reasons that subsection (b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a person \xe2\x80\x9cserving as the first assistant to the office\xe2\x80\x9d would be superfluous if subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1).  See <i>ante</i>, at 13.  But recall that subsection (b)(2) creates an exception to subsection (b)(1).  Subsection (b)(1) provides that a person cannot serve as an acting official while nominated if that person was not the first assistant to the vacant office for at least 90 of the 365 days before the vacancy arose.  Subsection (b)(2) states that those requirements do \xe2\x80\x9cnot apply to\xe2\x80\x9d current Senate-confirmed first assistants.  Put another way, subsection (b)(1) imposes requirements based on a person\xe2\x80\x99s past service, and subsection (b)(2) lifts those requirements based on a person\xe2\x80\x99s current service.  The reference in subsection (b)(2)(A) to a person \xe2\x80\x9cserving as the first assistant to the office\xe2\x80\x9d is thus necessary to convey the relevant time period of the service that triggers the exception to subsection (b)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The events leading up to and following the enactment of the FVRA further support interpreting subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, nothing in the legislative history of the FVRA indicates that subsection (b)(1) was enacted as a broad prohibition on acting service by all nominees.  Under the Vacancies Act of 1868, the FVRA\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, the first assistant to a vacant office served as the acting official unless the President directed another PAS official to do so.  See Act of July 23, 1868, ch. 227,\n\n15Stat.\n168\xe2\x80\x93169.  The Act did not prohibit any person, first assistant or otherwise, from serving as an acting official while nominated to fill the office.  This structure remained in place for over a century.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The events that prompted the FVRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment confirm, in line with the reading above, that the Act altered this pre-existing structure to prohibit certain first assistants from serving in an acting capacity while nominated to the vacant office.  The service of one acting official, Bill Lann Lee, was the turning point in a broader, long-running dispute between the political branches over Executive Branch compliance with the Vacancies Act of 1868.  In 1997, Lee was brought into the Department of Justice to serve as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division after his nomination to the position failed.  He continued to serve in an acting capacity after he was renominated to the position.  The decision to bring Lee in to serve in the Department of Justice after his failed nomination led to strong congressional criticism.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Letter from A. Fois, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, to Sen. S. Thurmond, pp. 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Feb. 24, 1998).  Subsection (b)(1) addresses the Lee incident and prevents its recurrence.  See S. Rep. No. 105\xe2\x80\x93250, p. 13 (1998) (explaining that an earlier version of subsection (b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[s] manipulation of first assistants to include persons highly unlikely to be career officials\xe2\x80\x9d).  It bars a first assistant from serving under subsection (a)(1) while nominated unless the person was the first assistant for a significant period of time before the vacancy arose (90 of the previous 365 days) or the person is the Senate-confirmed first assistant to the vacant office.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In contrast, there is no indication of an intent to depart further from the century-old practice under the Vacancies Act of 1868 and prohibit acting service by other officials nominated to a vacant office.  No one has identified congressional statements expressing concern with such service or calling for a broader prohibition.  Indeed, an earlier version of subsection (b)(1) unquestionably applied only to first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1), even though the bill permitted the President to designate a PAS official as the acting official instead of the first assistant.  See <i>id</i>., at 25.  The legislative history does not document the reason for the changes to this subsection.  The Court suggests that an unspoken congressional compromise led to an expanded subsection (b)(1).  <i>Ante, </i>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  While the compromise it hypothesizes is possible, no evidence supports it, and the absence of any hint that the compromise was hoped for during the development of or debate on the FVRA means that it is not probable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of subsection (b)(1), the Executive Branch began violating the FVRA almost immediately after its enactment.  Within months, the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) advised Executive Branch agencies that the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9capplies only to persons who serve as acting officers by virtue of having been the first assistant to the office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Guidance on Application of Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 23 Op. OLC 60, 64 (1999).  The Government Accountability Office, tasked with aiding congressional enforcement of the FVRA, later reached the same conclusion.  See Letter from C. Joyner, Dir., Strategic Issues, to F. Thompson, Chairman, U. S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Subject: Eligibility Criteria for Individuals To Temporarily Fill Vacant Positions Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934 (GAO\xe2\x80\x9301\xe2\x80\x93468R, Feb. 23, 2001).  Since the enactment of the FVRA, the Senate has received over 100 nominations of persons who continued to serve in an acting capacity after their nomination but had not satisfied the conditions in subsection (b)(1) for acting service by a nominee.  See App. A to Brief for United States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And yet, this legion of would-be violations prompted no response.  No evidence suggests that the Senate reacted by requiring any of those nominees to cease their acting service.  Cf. Pet. for Cert. 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (citing objections raised after the decision below).  The failure to object is all the more glaring in light of the enforcement mechanism written into the FVRA.  Section 3349 requires each Executive Branch agency to \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately\xe2\x80\x9d notify the Comptroller General, who heads the Government Accountability Office, and both Houses of Congress of \xe2\x80\x9ca vacancy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the date such vacancy occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe name of any person serving in an acting capacity and the date such service began,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe name of any person nominated to the Senate to fill the vacancy and the date such nomination is submitted,\xe2\x80\x9d and the date a nomination is acted upon.  This provision leaves no doubt that Congress had all the information it needed to object to any FVRA violations it perceived.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congressional silence in the face of a decade-plus practice of giving subsection (b)(1) a narrow reach casts serious doubt on the broader interpretation.  It indicates that Congress, like the Executive Branch, interpreted subsection (b)(1) in line with its text to reach only first assistants to the vacant office serving pursuant to subsection (a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The FVRA prohibits a limited set of acting officials\xe2\x80\x94non-Senate confirmed first assistants who serve under subsection (a)(1) and did not serve as the first assistant to the vacant office for at least 90 of the 365 days before the vacancy arose\xe2\x80\x94from performing the duties of a vacant office while also serving as the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to fill that office.  Reading the provision more broadly to apply to all acting officials disregards the full text of the FVRA and finds no support in its purpose or history.  The Court prefers that reading.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30.  This also misses the mark.  Like subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), subsection (c)(1) is located in \xc2\xa73345, titled, \xe2\x80\x9cActing officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Div.

Moreover, relegating officials directed to serve under subsection (c)(1) to some statutorily unnamed, non-acting official status would muddle other provisions of the FVRA.
