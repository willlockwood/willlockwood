The Federal Circuit has adopted a two-part test for determining whether damages may be increased pursuant to \xc2\xa7284.

At the same time, however, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]iscretion is not whim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 139.  Although there is \xe2\x80\x9cno precise rule or formula\xe2\x80\x9d for awarding damages under \xc2\xa7284, a district court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion should be exercised in light of the considerations\xe2\x80\x9d underlying the grant of that discretion.  <i>Octane Fitness, LLC</i> v. <i>ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Here, 180 years of enhanced damage awards under the Patent Act establish that they are not to be meted out in a typical infringement case, but are instead designed as a sanction for egregious infringement behavior.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0In many respects, the <i>Seagate</i> test rightly reflects this historic guidance.  It is, however, \xe2\x80\x9cunduly rigid, and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Octane Fitness, </i>572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0By requiring an objective recklessness finding in every case, the <i>Seagate </i>test excludes from discretionary punishment many of the most culpable offenders, including the \xe2\x80\x9cwanton and malicious pirate\xe2\x80\x9d who intentionally infringes a patent\xe2\x80\x94with no doubts about its validity or any notion of a defense\xe2\x80\x94for no purpose other than to steal the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s business.  <i>Seymour</i> v. <i>McCormick</i>, 16 How. 480, 488.  Under <i>Seagate, </i>a district court may not even consider enhanced damages for such a pirate, unless the court first determines that his infringement was \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively\xe2\x80\x9d reckless.  In the context of such deliberate wrongdoing, however, it is not clear why an independent showing of objective recklessness should be a prerequisite to enhanced damages.  <i>Octane Fitness</i> arose in a different context but is instructive here.  There, a two-part test for determining when a case was \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and therefore eligible for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x94was rejected because a claim of \xe2\x80\x9csubjective bad faith\xe2\x80\x9d alone could \xe2\x80\x9cwarrant a fee award.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  So too here: A patent infringer\xe2\x80\x99s subjective willfulness, whether intentional or knowing, may warrant enhanced damages, without regard to whether his infringement was objectively reckless.  The <i>Seagate</i> test further errs by making dispositive the ability of the infringer to muster a reasonable defense at trial, even if he did not act on the basis of that defense or was even aware of it.  Culpability, however, is generally measured against the actor\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge at the time of the challenged conduct.  In sum, \xc2\xa7284 allows district courts to punish the full range of culpable behavior.  In so doing, they should take into account the particular circumstances of each case and reserve punishment for egregious cases typified by willful misconduct.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0<i>Seagate</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that recklessness be proved by clear and convincing evidence is also inconsistent with \xc2\xa7284.  Once again, <i>Octane Fitness </i>is instructive.  There, a clear and convincing standard for awards of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees was rejected because the statute at issue supplied no basis for imposing a heightened standard.  Here, too, \xc2\xa7284 \xe2\x80\x9cimposes no specific evidentiary burden, much less such a high one,\xe2\x80\x9d 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  And the fact that Congress erected a higher standard of proof elsewhere in the Patent Act, but not in \xc2\xa7284, is telling.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]atent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at ___.  Enhanced damages are no exception.  P.\xc2\xa012.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0Having eschewed any rigid formula for awarding enhanced damages under \xc2\xa7284, this Court likewise rejects the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s tripartite appellate review framework.  In <i>Highmark Inc.</i> v. <i>Allcare Health Management System, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, the Court built on the <i>Octane Fitness </i>holding\xe2\x80\x94which confirmed district court discretion to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x94and rejected a similar multipart standard of review in favor of abuse of discretion review.  The same conclusion follows naturally from the holding here: Because \xc2\xa7284 \xe2\x80\x9ccommits the determination\xe2\x80\x9d whether enhanced damages are appropriate to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat decision is to be reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___.  Nearly two centuries of enhanced damage awards have given substance to the notion that district courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion is limited, and the Federal Circuit should review their exercise of that discretion in light of longstanding considerations that have guided both Congress and the courts.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 additional arguments are unpersuasive.  They claim that Congress ratified the <i>Seagate</i> test when it reenacted \xc2\xa7284 in 2011 without pertinent change, but the reenacted language unambiguously confirmed discretion in the district courts.  Neither isolated snippets of legislative history nor a reference to willfulness in another recently enacted section reflects an endorsement of <i>Seagate</i>\xe2\x80\x99s test.  Respondents are also concerned that allowing district courts unlimited discretion to award enhanced damages could upset the balance between the protection of patent rights and the interest in technological innovation.  That concern\xe2\x80\x94while serious\xe2\x80\x94cannot justify imposing an artificial construct such as the <i>Seagate</i> test on the limited discretion conferred under \xc2\xa7284.

In <i>In\xc2\xa0re Seagate Technology, LLC</i>, 497 F.\xc2\xa03d 1360 (2007) (en banc), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit adopted a two-part test for determining when a district court may increase damages pursuant to \xc2\xa7284.  Under <i>Seagate</i>, a patent owner must first \xe2\x80\x9cshow by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1371.

We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Enhanced damages are as old as U.\xc2\xa0S. patent law.  The Patent Act of 1793 mandated treble damages in any successful infringement suit.  See Patent Act of 1793, \xc2\xa75,\n\n1Stat.\n322.  In the Patent Act of 1836, however, Congress changed course and made enhanced damages discretionary, specifying that \xe2\x80\x9cit shall be in the power of the court to render judgment for any sum above the amount found by [the] verdict .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not exceeding three times the amount thereof, according to the circumstances of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pat-ent Act of 1836, \xc2\xa714,\n\n5Stat.\n123.  In construing that new provision, this Court explained that the change was prompted by the \xe2\x80\x9cinjustice\xe2\x80\x9d of subjecting a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant who acted in ignorance or good faith\xe2\x80\x9d to the same treatment as the \xe2\x80\x9cwanton and malicious pirate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Seymour</i> v. <i>McCormick</i>, 16 How. 480, 488 (1854).  There \xe2\x80\x9cis no good reason,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy taking a man\xe2\x80\x99s property in an invention should be trebly punished, while the measure of damages as to other property is single and actual damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.  But \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the injury is wanton or malicious, a jury may inflict vindictive or exemplary damages, not to recompense the plaintiff, but to punish the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 489.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court followed the same approach in other decisions applying the 1836 Act, finding enhanced damages appropriate, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the wrong [had] been done, under aggravated circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Dean</i> v. <i>Mason</i>, 20 How. 198, 203 (1858), but not where the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cappeared in truth to be ignorant of the existence of the patent right, and did not intend any infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hogg</i> v. <i>Emerson</i>, 11 How. 587, 607 (1850).  See also <i>Livingston</i> v. <i>Woodworth</i>, 15 How. 546, 560 (1854) (\xe2\x80\x9cno ground\xe2\x80\x9d to inflict \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d where infringers were not \xe2\x80\x9cwanton\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1870, Congress amended the Patent Act, but preserved district court discretion to award up to treble damages \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the circumstances of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Patent Act of 1870, \xc2\xa759,\n\n16Stat.\n207.  We continued to describe enhanced damages as \xe2\x80\x9cvindictive or punitive,\xe2\x80\x9d which the court may \xe2\x80\x9cinflict\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances of the case appear to require it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tilghman</i> v. <i>Proctor</i>,\n\n125 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136\n\xe2\x80\x93144 (1888); <i>Topliff</i> v. <i>Topliff</i>,\n\n145 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156,\n174 (1892)\n (infringer knowingly sold copied technology of his former employer).  At the same time, we reiterated that there was no basis for increased damages where \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no pretence of any wanton and wilful breach\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnothing that suggests punitive damages, or that shows wherein the defendant was damnified other than by the loss of the profits which the plaintiff received.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cincinnati Siemens-Lungren Gas Illuminating Co.</i> v. <i>Western Siemens-Lungren Co.</i>,\n\n152 U.\xc2\xa0S. 200,\n204 (1894)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Courts of Appeals likewise characterized enhanced damages as justified where the infringer acted deliberately or willfully, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Baseball Display Co.</i> v. <i>Star Ballplayer Co.</i>, 35 F.\xc2\xa02d 1, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (CA3 1929) (increased damages award appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the deliberate and willful infringement\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> Power Specialty Co.</i> v. <i>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.</i>, 80 F.\xc2\xa02d 874, 878 (CA2 1936) (\xe2\x80\x9cwanton, deliberate, and willful\xe2\x80\x9d infringement); <i>Brown Bag Filling Mach.

See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Wooster</i>, 119 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322, 326 (1886) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here may be damages beyond\xe2\x80\x9d licensing fees \xe2\x80\x9cbut these are more properly the subjects\xe2\x80\x9d of enhanced damage awards).  Such statements, however, were not for the ages, in part because the merger of law and equity removed certain procedural obstacles to full compensation absent enhancement.  See generally 7 Chisum on Patents \xc2\xa720.03[4][b][iii], pp. 20\xe2\x80\x93343 to 20\xe2\x80\x93344 (2011).  In the main, moreover, the references to compensation concerned costs attendant to litigation.  See <i>Clark</i>, 119 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 326 (identifying enhanced damages as compensation for \xe2\x80\x9cthe expense and trouble the plaintiff has been put to\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Day</i> v. <i>Woodworth</i>, 13 How. 363, 372 (1852) (enhanced damages appropriate when defendant was \xe2\x80\x9cstubbornly litigious\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccaused unnecessary expense and trouble to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Teese</i> v. <i>Huntingdon</i>, 23 How. 2, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1860) (discussing enhanced damages in the context of \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel fees\xe2\x80\x9d).  That concern dissipated with the enactment in 1952 of\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7285, which authorized district courts to award reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to prevailing parties in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional cases\xe2\x80\x9d under the Patent Act.  See <i>Octane Fitness, LLC </i>v.<i> ICON Health &amp; Fitness Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is against this backdrop that Congress, in the 1952 codification of the Patent Act, enacted \xc2\xa7284.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe stated purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1952 revision \xe2\x80\x9cwas merely reorganization in language to clarify the statement of the statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aro Mfg.

The sort of conduct warranting enhanced damages has been variously described in our cases as willful, wanton, malicious, bad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, flagrant, or\xe2\x80\x94indeed\xe2\x80\x94characteristic of a pirate.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x935.  District courts enjoy discretion in deciding whether to award enhanced damages, and in what amount.  But through nearly two centuries of discretionary awards and review by appellate tribunals, \xe2\x80\x9cthe channel of discretion ha[s] narrowed,\xe2\x80\x9d Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.\xc2\xa0J. 747, 772 (1982), so that such damages are generally reserved for egregious cases of culpable behavior.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The <i>Seagate </i>test reflects, in many respects, a sound recognition that enhanced damages are generally appropriate under \xc2\xa7284 only in egregious cases.  That test, however, \xe2\x80\x9cis unduly rigid, and it impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Octane Fitness, </i>572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (construing \xc2\xa7285 of the Patent Act).  In particular, it can have the effect of insulating some of the worst patent infringers from any liability for enhanced damages.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The principal problem with <i>Seagate</i>\xe2\x80\x99s two-part test is that it requires a finding of objective recklessness in every case before district courts may award enhanced damages.  Such a threshold requirement excludes from discretionary punishment many of the most culpable offenders, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cwanton and malicious pirate\xe2\x80\x9d who intentionally infringes another\xe2\x80\x99s patent\xe2\x80\x94with no doubts about its validity or any notion of a defense\xe2\x80\x94for no purpose other than to steal the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s business.  <i>Seymour</i>, 16 How., at 488.  Under <i>Seagate</i>, a district court may not even consider enhanced damages for such a pirate, unless the court first determines that his infringement was \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively\xe2\x80\x9d reckless.  In the context of such deliberate wrongdoing, how-ever, it is not clear why an independent showing of objective recklessness\xe2\x80\x94by clear and convincing evidence, no less\xe2\x80\x94should be a prerequisite to enhanced damages.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our recent decision in <i>Octane Fitness</i> arose in a different context but points in the same direction.  In that case we considered \xc2\xa7285 of the Patent Act, which allows district courts to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to prevailing parties in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d cases.\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7285.  The Federal Circuit had adopted a two-part test for determining when a case qualified as exceptional, requiring that the claim asserted be both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.  We rejected that test on the ground that a case presenting \xe2\x80\x9csubjective bad faith\xe2\x80\x9d alone could \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  So too here.  The subjective willfulness of a patent infringer, intentional or knowing, may warrant enhanced damages, without regard to whether his infringement was objectively reckless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Seagate</i> test aggravates the problem by making dispositive the ability of the infringer to muster a reasonable (even though unsuccessful) defense at the infringement trial.  The existence of such a defense insulatesthe infringer from enhanced damages, even if he did not act on the basis of the defense or was even aware of it.  Under that standard, someone who plunders a patent\xe2\x80\x94in-fringing it without any reason to suppose his conduct is arguably defensible\xe2\x80\x94can nevertheless escape any come-uppance under \xc2\xa7284 solely on the strength of his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But culpability is generally measured against the knowledge of the actor at the time of the challenged conduct.  See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A (1965) (\xe2\x80\x9cintent\xe2\x80\x9d denotes state of mind in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe actor desires to cause consequences of his act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbelieves\xe2\x80\x9d them to be \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially certain to result from it\xe2\x80\x9d); W.

In <i>Safeco Ins. Co. of America</i> v. <i>Burr</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47 (2007)\n, we stated that a person is reckless if he acts \xe2\x80\x9c<i>knowing</i> or <i>having reason to know</i> of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize\xe2\x80\x9d his actions are unreasonably risky.  <i>Id.</i>, at 69 (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court found that the defendant had not recklessly violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act because the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation had \xe2\x80\x9ca foundation in the statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d and the defendant lacked \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit of guidance from the courts of appeals or the Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cmight have warned it away from the view it took.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 69\xe2\x80\x9370.  Nothing in <i>Safeco </i>suggests that we should look to facts that the defendant neither knew nor had reason to know at the time he acted.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 284 allows district courts to punish the full range of culpable behavior.  Yet none of this is to say that enhanced damages must follow a finding of egregious misconduct.  As with any exercise of discretion, courts should continue to take into account the particular circumstances of each case in deciding whether to award damages, and in what amount.  Section 284 permits district courts to exercise their discretion in a manner free from the inelastic constraints of the <i>Seagate</i> test.  Consistent with nearly two centuries of enhanced damages under patent law, however, such punishment should generally be reserved for egregious cases typified by willful misconduct.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The <i>Seagate</i> test is also inconsistent with \xc2\xa7284 because it requires clear and convincing evidence to prove recklessness.  On this point<i> Octane Fitness</i> is again instructive.<i> </i>There too the Federal Circuit had adopted a clear and convincing standard of proof, for awards of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa7285 of the Patent Act.  Because that provision supplied no basis for imposing such a heightened standard of proof, we rejected it.  See <i>Octane Fitness, </i>572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  We do so here as well.  Like \xc2\xa7285, \xc2\xa7284 \xe2\x80\x9cimposes no specific evidentiary burden, much less such a high one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And the fact that Congress expressly erected a higher standard of proof elsewhere in the Patent Act, see\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7273(b), but not in \xc2\xa7284, is telling.  Furthermore, nothing in historical practice supports a heightened standard.  As we explained in <i>Octane Fitness</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cpatent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  Enhanced damages are no exception.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, because we eschew any rigid formula for awarding enhanced damages under \xc2\xa7284, we likewise reject the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s tripartite framework for appellate review.  In <i>Highmark Inc.</i> v. <i>Allcare Health Management System, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), we built on our <i>Octane Fitness</i> holding to reject a similar multipart standard of review.  Because <i>Octane</i> <i>Fitness </i>confirmed district court discretion to award attorney fees, we concluded that such decisions should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  <i>Highmark,</i> 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same conclusion follows naturally from our holding here.  Section 284 gives district courts discretion in meting out enhanced damages. <i> </i>It \xe2\x80\x9ccommits the determination\xe2\x80\x9d whether enhanced damages are appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cto the discretion of the district court\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat decision is to be reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That standard allows for review of district court decisions informed by \xe2\x80\x9cthe considerations we have identified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Octane Fitness,</i> 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The appellate review framework adopted by the Federal Circuit reflects a concern that district courts may award enhanced damages too readily, and distort the balance between the protection of patent rights and the interest in technological innovation.  Nearly two centuries of exercising discretion in awarding enhanced damages in patent cases, however, has given substance to the notion that there are limits to that discretion.  The Federal Circuit should review such exercises of discretion in light of the longstanding considerations we have identified as having guided both Congress and the courts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For their part, respondents argue that Congress ratified the <i>Seagate</i> test when it passed the America Invents Act of 2011 and reenacted \xc2\xa7284 without pertinent change.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 14\xe2\x80\x931513 27 (citing <i>Lorillard</i> v. <i>Pons</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575,\n580 (1978)\n).  But the language Congress reenacted unambiguously confirmed discretion in the district courts.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s retention of \xc2\xa7284 could just as readily reflect an intent that enhanced damages be awarded as they had been for nearly two centuries, through the exercise of such discretion, informed by settled practices.  Respondents point to isolated snippets of legislative history referring to <i>Seagate</i> as evidence of congressional endorsement of its framework, but other morsels\xe2\x80\x94such as Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to adopt a proposed codification similar to <i>Seagate</i>\xe2\x80\x94point in the opposite direction.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, H.\xc2\xa0R. 1260, 111th Cong., 1st Sess. \xc2\xa75(e) (2009).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents also seize on an addition to the Act addressing opinions of counsel.  Section 298 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he failure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure of the infringer to present such advice to the court or jury, may not be used to prove that the accused infringer willfully infringed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7298.  Respondents contend that the reference to willfulness reflects an endorsement of <i>Seagate</i>\xe2\x80\x99s willfulness test.  But willfulness has always been a part of patent law, before and after <i>Seagate</i>.  Section 298 does not show that Congress ratified <i>Seagate</i>\xe2\x80\x99s particular conception of willfulness. <i> </i>Rather, it simply addressed the fallout from the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <i>Underwater Devices Inc.</i> v. <i>Morrison-Knudsen Co.</i>, 717 F.\xc2\xa02d 1380 (1983), which had imposed an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative duty\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain advice of counsel prior to initiating any possible infringing activity, <i>id.</i>, at 1389\xe2\x80\x931390.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 112\xe2\x80\x9398, pt. 1, p. 53 (2011).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>At the end of the day, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 main argument for retaining the <i>Seagate</i> test comes down to a matter of policy.  Respondents and their <i>amici</i> are concerned that allowing district courts unlimited discretion to award up to treble damages in infringement cases will impede innovation as companies steer well clear of any possible interference with patent rights.  They also worry that the ready availability of such damages will embolden \xe2\x80\x9ctrolls.\xe2\x80\x9d  Trolls, in the patois of the patent community, are entities that hold patents for the primary purpose of enforcing them against alleged infringers, often exacting outsized licensing fees on threat of litigation.</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents are correct that patent law reflects \xe2\x80\x9ca careful balance between the need to promote innovation\xe2\x80\x9d through patent protection, and the importance of facilitating the \xe2\x80\x9cimitation and refinement through imitation\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to invention itself and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bonito Boats, Inc.</i> v. <i>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141,\n146 (1989)\n.  That balance can indeed be disrupted if enhanced damages are awarded in garden-variety cases.  As we have explained, however, they should not be.  The seriousness of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 policy concerns cannot justify imposing an artificial construct such as the <i>Seagate</i> test on the discretion conferred under \xc2\xa7284.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"> Section 284 gives district courts the discretion to award enhanced damages against those guilty of patent infringement.

Those principles channel the exercise of discretion, limiting the award of enhanced damages to egregious cases of misconduct beyond typical infringement.  The <i>Seagate</i> test, in contrast, unduly confines the ability of district courts to exercise the discretion conferred on them.

But, as the Court notes, the relevant statutory provision,\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7284, nonetheless imposes limits that help produce uniformity in its application and maintain its consistency with the basic objectives of patent law.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\xe2\x80\x9d).  I write separately to express my own understanding of several of those limits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9cwillful misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d do not mean that a court may award enhanced damages simply because the evidence shows that the infringer knew about the patent <i>and nothing more. </i> <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[W]illfu[l]\xe2\x80\x99 is a \xe2\x80\x98word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Safeco Ins. Co. of America</i> v. <i>Burr</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47\n, 57 (2007).  Here, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, read as a whole and in context, explains that \xe2\x80\x9cenhanced damages are generally appropriate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>only in</i> <i>egregious cases</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (emphasis added); <i>ante,</i> at 11 (Enhanced damages \xe2\x80\x9cshould generally be reserved for <i>egregious cases</i> typified by willful misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  They amount to a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98punitive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d sanction for engaging in conduct that is either \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwanton.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8; compare <i>Aro Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Convertible Top Replacement Co.</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476,\n508 (1964)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cbad-faith infringement\xe2\x80\x9d), and <i>Seymour</i> v. <i>McCormick</i>, 16 How. 480, 488 (1854) (\xe2\x80\x9cmalicious pirate\xe2\x80\x9d), with <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cobjective recklessness\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court refers, by way of example, to a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wanton and malicious pirate\xe2\x80\x99 who intentionally infringes another\xe2\x80\x99s pat-ent\xe2\x80\x94with no doubts about its validity or any notion of a defense\xe2\x80\x94for no purpose other than to steal the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.  And while the Court explains that \xe2\x80\x9cintentional or knowing\xe2\x80\x9d infringement \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d warrant a punitive sanction, the word it uses is <i>may</i>, not <i>must</i>.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  It is \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstanc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that transforms simple knowledge into such egregious behavior, and that makes all the difference.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Court writes against a statutory background specifying that the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may not be used to prove that the accused infringer wilfully infringed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7298.  The Court does not weaken this rule through its interpretation of \xc2\xa7284.  Nor should it.  It may well be expensive to obtain an opinion of counsel.  See Brief for Public Knowledge et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 9 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]pinion[s] [of counsel] could easily cost up to $100,000 per patent\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Internet Companies as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 13 (such opinions cost \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands of dollars\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such costs can prevent an innovator from getting a small business up and running.  At the same time, an owner of a small firm, or a scientist, engineer, or technician working there, might, without being \xe2\x80\x9cwanton\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creckless,\xe2\x80\x9d reasonably determine that its product does not infringe a particular patent, or that that patent is probably invalid.  Cf. <i>Association for Molecular Pathology</i> v. <i>Myriad Genetics, Inc.</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13) (The \xe2\x80\x9cpatent[\xe2\x80\x99s] [own] descriptions highlight the problem[s] with its claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  I do not say that a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s informed opinion would be unhelpful.  To the contrary, consulting counsel may help draw the line between infringing and noninfringing uses.  But on the other side of the equation lie the costs and the consequent risk of discouraging lawful innovation.  Congress has thus left it to the potential infringer to decide whether to consult counsel\xe2\x80\x94without the threat of treble damages influencing that decision.  That is, Congress has determined that where both \xe2\x80\x9cadvice of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cincreased dam-ages\xe2\x80\x9d are at issue, insisting upon the legal game is not worth the candle.  Compare \xc2\xa7298 with \xc2\xa7284.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, as the Court explains, enhanced damages may not \xe2\x80\x9cserve to compensate patentees\xe2\x80\x9d for infringement-related costs or litigation expenses.  <i>Ante,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  That is because \xc2\xa7284 provides for the former <i>prior </i>to any enhancement.  \xc2\xa7284 (enhancement follows award of \xe2\x80\x9cdam-ages adequate to compensate for the infringement\xe2\x80\x9d); see <i>ante,</i> at 4.  And a different statutory provision, \xc2\xa7285, provides for the latter.  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>Octane Fitness, LLC</i> v. <i>ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938) (fee awards may be appropriate in a case that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exceptional\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to \xe2\x80\x9cthe unreasonable manner in which [it] was litigated\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I describe these limitations on enhanced damages awards for a reason.  Patent infringement, of course, is a highly undesirable and unlawful activity.  But stopping infringement is a means to patent law\xe2\x80\x99s ends.  Through a complex system of incentive-based laws, patent law helps to encourage the development of, disseminate knowledge about, and permit others to benefit from useful inventions.  Enhanced damages have a role to play in achieving those objectives, but, as described above, that role is limited.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider that the U.\xc2\xa0S. Patent and Trademark Office estimates that more than 2,500,000 patents are currently in force.  See Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, A. Marco, M. Carley, S. Jackson, &amp; A. Myers, The USPTO Historical Patent Files: Two Centuries of Invention, No. 2015\xe2\x80\x931, p.\xc2\xa032, fig. 6 (June 2015).  Moreover, Members of the Court have noted that some \xe2\x80\x9cfirms use patents .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. primarily [to] obtai[n] licensing fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>eBay Inc.</i> v. <i>MercExchange, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388,\n396 (2006)\n (Kennedy, J., concurring).  <i>Amici </i>explain that some of those firms generate revenue by sending letters to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tens of thousands of people asking for a license or settlement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on a patent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that may in fact not be warranted.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Internet Companies as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12; cf. Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper (Jan. 16, 1814), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 295 (H. Washington ed. 1854) (lamenting \xe2\x80\x9cabuse of the frivolous patents\xe2\x80\x9d).  How is a growing business to react to the arrival of such a letter, particularly if that letter carries with it a serious risk of<i> </i>treble dam-ages?  Does the letter put the company \xe2\x80\x9con notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the patent?  Will a jury find that the company behaved \xe2\x80\x9crecklessly,\xe2\x80\x9d simply for failing to spend considerable time, effort, and money obtaining expert views about whether some or all of the patents described in the letter apply to its activities (and whether those patents are even valid)?  These investigative activities can be costly.  Hence, the risk of treble damages can encourage the company to settle, or even abandon any challenged activity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To say this is to point to a risk: The more that busi-nesses, laboratories, hospitals, and individuals adopt this approach, the more often a patent will reach beyond its lawful scope to discourage lawful activity, and the more often patent-related demands will frustrate, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cpromote,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cProgress of Science and useful Arts.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08; see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Eon-Net LP</i> v. <i>Flagstar Bancorp</i>, 653 F.\xc2\xa03d 1314, 1327 (CA Fed. 2011) (patent holder \xe2\x80\x9cacted in bad faith by exploiting the high cost to defend [\xc2\xa0patent] litigation to extract a nuisance value settlement\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>In\xc2\xa0re MPHJ Technnology Invs., LLC</i>, 159 F.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0C. 1004, 1007\xe2\x80\x931012 (2015) (patent owner sent more than 16,000 letters demanding settlement for using \xe2\x80\x9ccommon office equipment\xe2\x80\x9d under a patent it never intended to litigate); Brief for Internet Companies as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15 (threat of enhanced damages hinders \xe2\x80\x9ccollaborative efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to set \xe2\x80\x9cindustry-wide\xe2\x80\x9d standards for matters such as internet protocols); Brief for Public Knowledge et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6 (predatory patent practices undermined \xe2\x80\x9ca new and highly praised virtual-reality glasses shopping system\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, in the context of enhanced damages, there are patent-related risks on both sides of the equation.  That fact argues, not for abandonment of enhanced damages, but for their careful application, to ensure that they only target cases of egregious misconduct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One final point: The Court holds that awards of enhanced damages should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  <i>Ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  I agree.  But I also believe that, in applying that standard, the Federal Circuit may take advantage of its own experience and expertise in patent law.  Whether, for example, an infringer truly had \xe2\x80\x9cno doubts about [the] validity\xe2\x80\x9d of a patent may require an assessment of the reasonableness of a defense that may be apparent from the face of that patent.  See <i>ante</i>, at 9.  And any error on such a question would be an abuse of discretion.  <i>Highmark Inc.</i> v. <i>Allcare Health Management System, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 4, n. 2) (\xe2\x80\x9cA district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Understanding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in the ways described above, I join its opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</i>\n</div>'
