S. 845</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Motion denied.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, who is confined in a California state prison, sought to file a petition <em>in forma pauperis</em> for a writ of injunction in the District Court below.  That court denied leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis,</em> holding that petitioner was not entitled to the benefits of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915 because he was no longer a "citizen," as required by that section.  The District Court reached that decision in reliance on California Penal Code, \xc2\xa7 2600, which provides that one sentenced to imprisonment for a term </p><p><a class="page-number" name="845">Page 339 U. S. 845</a></p><p> of years is deprived of his civil rights for the period of imprisonment.  The decision of the District Court is in error.  Citizenship, for the purpose of <em>in forma pauperis</em> proceedings in the federal courts, is solely a matter of federal law.  Congress has not specified criminal convictions, except for desertion and treason, as grounds for loss of citizenship.  8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 801.</p>\n<p>Petitioner thereafter filed a motion in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for allowance of an appeal from the order of the District Court.  The denial by a District Judge of a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> is an appealable order.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291; <em>see Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/case.html">337 U. S. 541</a></span> (1949).  The Court of Appeals, however, held that it had "no power to grant an application for allowance of an appeal," and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p>Finally, petitioner filed in this Court a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to the District Court.  Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, available only in rare cases.  <em>Ex parte Collett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/55/case.html">337 U. S. 55</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/55/case.html#72">337 U. S. 72</a></span> (1949), and cases there cited.  Because of the ambiguous state of this record, and the fact that a denial of this motion will not prejudice petitioner in further attempts to proceed <em>in forma pauperis,</em> the motion must be denied.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
