S. 289</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On considering the 30th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Court is of opinion that the provision as to taking depositions <em>de bene esse</em> does not apply to cases pending in this Court.  In terms, the provision refers to cases in the district and circuit courts.  Testimony by depositions can be regularly taken for this Court only under a commission issuing according to its rules.  A practice has hitherto prevailed to take depositions <em>de bene esse</em> in causes pending here, and, as no objection has been made at the bar, it has passed <em>sub silentio.</em>  Under such circumstances. we cannot say that the United States is in default in taking depositions according to the usual practice.  We shall therefore continue this cause to the next term to enable the parties, if they choose, to take testimony under commissions issued under the rules prescribed by this Court.</p>\n<p><em>Cause continued.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
