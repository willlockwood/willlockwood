Argued April 15, 2002-Decided June 10,2002*</p></blockquote><p>Under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 515 and 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) makes direct loans to private, nonprofit entities to develop and/or construct rural housing for the elderly and low- or middle-income individuals and families. Petitioners are property owners who entered into such loans before December 21, 1979. The promissory notes petitioners executed authorized "[p]repaymen[t] of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, ... at any time at the option of Borrower." On February 5, 1988, concerned about the dwindling supply of low- and middle-income rural housing in the face of increasing prepayments of mortgages by \xc2\xa7 515 borrowers, Congress enacted the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA), which amended the Housing Act of 1949 to impose permanent restrictions upon prepayment of \xc2\xa7 515 mortgages entered into before December 21, 1979. On May 30, 1997, the <i>Franconia </i>petitioners filed suit under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1491, charging that ELIHPA abridged the absolute prepayment right set forth in their promissory notes and thereby effected, <i>inter alia, </i>a repudiation of their contracts. In dismissing petitioners\' contract claims as untimely under \xc2\xa7 2501-which provides that a claim "shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues" -the Court of Federal Claims concluded that the claims first accrued on the ELIHPA regulations\' effective date. In affirming on statute of limitations grounds, the Federal Circuit ruled that, if the Government\'s continuing duty to allow petitioners to prepay their loans was breached, the breach occurred immediately upon ELIHPA\'s enactment date, over nine years before petitioners filed their suit. The court rejected petitioners\' argument that ELIHPA\'s passage qualified as a repudiation, so that their suit would be timely if filed within six years of either the date performance fell due (the date they tendered prepayment) or the date on which they elected to treat the repudiation as a present breach.

If that continuing duty was breached, the court maintained, the breach occurred <i>immediately, </i>totally, and definitively, when ELIHPA took away the borrowers\' unfettered right to prepay. In so ruling, the court incorrectly characterized the performance allegedly due from the Government under the promissory notes.

Pp. 141-144.</p><p>(c) The first of the Government\'s arguments to the contrary is unpersuasive. The Government contends that \xc2\xa7 2501\'s "first accrues" qualification is meant to ensure that suits against the United States are filed on the earliest possible date, thereby providing the Government with reasonably prompt notice of the fiscal implications of past enactments. However, \xc2\xa7 2501\'s text is unexceptional: A number of contemporaneous state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties also tie the commencement of the limitations period to the date a claim "first accrues." Equally telling, in its many years of applying and interpreting \xc2\xa7 2501, the Court of Federal Claims has never attributed to the words "first accrues" the meaning the Government now proposes. Instead, in other settings, that court has adopted the repudiation doctrine in its traditional form when evaluating the timeliness of suits governed by \xc2\xa7 2501. Two practical considerations reinforce the Court\'s conclusion. First, reading \xc2\xa7 2501 as the Government proposes would seriously distort the repudiation doctrine in Tucker Act suits because a party aggrieved by the Government\'s renunciation of a contractual obligation anticipating future performance would be compelled by the looming limitations bar to forgo the usual option of awaiting the time performance is due before filing suit for breach. Second, putting prospective plaintiffs to the choice of either bringing suit soon after the Government\'s repudiation or forever relinquishing their claims would surely proliferate litigation, forcing the Government to defend against highly speculative damages claims in a profusion of suits, most of which would never have been brought under a less novel interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2501. Pp. 144-147.</p><p>(d) The Court also rejects the premise, and therefore the conclusion, of the Government\'s second argument against application of the repudiation doctrine. The Government contends that a congressional enactment like ELIHPA that precludes the Government from honoring a contractual obligation anticipating future performance always constitutes a present breach because the agency or official responsible for administering the contract is not free to change its mind and render the requisite performance without violating binding federal law. However, just as Congress may announce the Government\'s intent to dishonor an obligation to perform in the future through a duly enacted law, so may it retract that renouncement prior to the time for performance, thereby enabling the agency or contracting official to perform as promised. Indeed, Congress changed its mind in just this manner before it enacted ELIHPA. In 1979 amendments to the National Housing Act, Congress</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="132">132</a></p><p>repudiated the promissory notes at issue here by conditioning prepayment of all \xc2\xa7 515 loans on the borrower\'s agreement to maintain the low-income use of its property for a specified period. One year later, Congress removed those conditions on pre-1979 loans, thereby retracting the repudiation. Hence, the fact that the Government\'s repudiation here rested upon the enactment of a new statute makes no significant difference. <i>Mobil Oil Exploration </i>&amp; <i>Producing Southeast, Inc. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/604/case.html">530 U.

In the suits that yielded the judgments before us, petitioners charged that Congress abridged that release right in the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA or Act), 101 Stat. 1877, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1472(c) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). That Act placed permanent restraints upon prepayment of FmHA loans. Petitioners asserted in their complaints that ELIHPA effected both a repudiation of their contracts and a taking of their property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p><p>The Federal Circuit held petitioners\' claims time barred under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2501, which prescribes that all Tucker Act claims must be filed within six years of the date they "first accrue[d]." In the Federal Circuit\'s view, passage of ELIHPA constituted an immediate breach of the FmHA loan agreements and therefore triggered the running of the limitations period. Petitioners filed suit not "within six years of," but over nine years after, ELIHPA\'s enactment. On that account, the Federal Circuit held their claims untimely, and their suits properly dismissed.</p><p>Accepting for purposes of this decision that the loan contracts guaranteed the absolute prepayment right petitioners allege, we reverse the Federal Circuit\'s judgment. ELIHPA\'s enactment, we conclude, qualified as a repudiation of the parties\' bargain, not a present breach of the loan agreements. Accordingly, breach would occur, and the sixyear limitations period would commence to run, when a borrower tenders prepayment and the Government then dishonors its obligation to accept the tender and release its control over use of the property that secured the loan.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="134">134</a></p><p align="center">\nI A</p><p>Under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 515 and 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, 76 Stat. 671, 82 Stat. 551, as amended, 42 U.

No other provision of the loan documents addressed prepayment.</p><p>In 1979, Congress found that many \xc2\xa7 515 participants had prepaid their mortgages, thus threatening the continued availability of affordable rural housing. Concerned that "these projects [remain] available to low and moderate income families for the entire original term of the loan," H. R. Rep. No. 96-154, p. 43 (1979), Congress amended the National Housing Act to stem the loss of low-cost rural housing due to prepayments, see Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1101. In these 1979 amendments, Congress prohibited the FmHA from accepting prepayment of any loan made before or after the date of enactment unless the owner agreed to maintain the lowincome use of the rental housing for a 15- year or 20- year period from the date of the loan. 93 Stat. 1134-1135.

The Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1614, provided that the prepayment restrictions would apply only to loans entered into after December 21, 1979, the date that amendment was enacted. \xc2\xa7 514, 94 Stat. 1671-1672.

Were ELIHPA so regarded, petitioners\' suit would be timely if filed within six years of either the date performance fell due (the date petitioners tendered prepayment) or the date on which petitioners elected to treat the repudiation as a present breach. "An anticipatory repudiation occurs," the Court of Appeals recognized, "when an obligor communicates to an obligee that he will commit a breach in the future." <i>Id., </i>at 1363 (internal quotation marks omitted). "The doctrine of anticipatory repudiation does not apply in this case," the court reasoned, because after ELIHPA revoked the promise to allow unrestricted prepayment, the Government owed no future performance under the contracts. <i>Id., </i>at 1364.</p><p>5 The Federal Circuit thus disagreed with the Court of Federal Claims in one respect: The former concluded that petitioners\' claims had accrued on the date of ELIHPA\'s enactment, while the latter held that those claims had accrued on the effective date of regulations implementing the Act. 240 F. 3d, at 1365, n. 3.

Petitioners contended that ELIHPA represented an emergency measure that curtailed prepayment rights only temporarily; the definitive legislative action, they maintained, occurred later, when the 1992 legislation made curtailment of their prepayment rights permanent. <i>Id., </i>at 1365. The Federal Circuit concluded that although Congress had designated certain provisions in ELIHPA "interim measures," <i>ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks omitted), "no similar language ... indicate[s] that [ELIHPA\'s] restrictions on FmHA loan prepayments were anything but permanent as to" borrowers in petitioners\' situation, <i>ibid.</i></p><p>7 The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the <i>Grass Valley </i>petitioners\' takings claims as untimely in a separate decision. 51 Fed.

For purposes of our disposition, the United States agrees, it may be assumed that petitioners obtained precisely the promise they allege-a promise that permits them an unfettered right to prepay their mortgages any time over the life of the loans, thereby gaining release from federal restrictions on the use of their property. See Brief for United States 18-19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30. The sole issue before us is thus cleanly presented: were petitioners\' complaints initiated within the six-year limitations period prescribed in 28 U. S.

C. \xc2\xa7 2501, depends upon when the Government breached the prepayment undertaking stated in the promissory notes. See 1 C.

Jaeger, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa7 2021A, p. 697 (3d ed. 1978) (same).</p><p>In declaring ELIHPA a present breach of petitioners\' loan contracts, the Federal Circuit reasoned that the Government had but one obligation under those agreements: "to continue to allow borrowers the unfettered right to prepay their loans at any time." 240 F. 3d, at 1363; see also 43 Fed. Cl., at 710 (Government\'s contractual duty was "to keep its promise to allow borrowers an unfettered prepayment right"). If that continuing duty was breached, the court maintained, the breach occurred <i>immediately, </i>totally, and definitively when ELIHPA took away the borrowers\' unfettered right to prepay. See 240 F. 3d, at 1363. The Court of Appeals so ruled despite petitioners\' insistence that "the government\'s performance obligation under the contracts was to <i>accept </i>prepayment" whenever tendered during the long life of the loans, even decades into the future. <i>Id., </i>at 1362 (emphasis added); see also 43 Fed. Cl., at 710.</p><p>The Federal Circuit, we are persuaded, incorrectly characterized the performance allegedly due from the Government under the promissory notes. If petitioners enjoyed a "right to prepay their loans at any time," 240 F. 3d, at 1363, then necessarily the Government had a corresponding obligation to accept prepayment and execute the appropriate releases. See Brief for Petitioners 5-6. Absent an obligation on the lender to accept prepayment, the obligation "to allow" borrowers to prepay would be meaningless. A loan contract of such incomplete design would be illusory. See J. Murray, Contracts \xc2\xa7 2, p. 5 (2d rev. ed. 1974) (promise required to create a binding contract must be an "undertaking or commitment to do or refrain from doing [some]thing in the future").</p><p>Once the Government\'s pledged performance is properly comprehended as an obligation to accept prepayment, the error in the Federal Circuit\'s reasoning becomes apparent. Failure by the promisor to perform at the time indicated for performance in the contract establishes an immediate</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="143">143</a></p><p>breach. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7 235(2) (1979) (hereinafter Restatement) ("When performance of a duty under a contract is due[,] any non-performance is a breach."); Murray, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 206, at 417. But the promisor\'s renunciation of a "contractual duty <i>before </i>the time fixed in the contract for ... performance" is a repudiation. 4 A. Corbin, Contracts \xc2\xa7 959, p. 855 (1951) (emphasis added); Restatement \xc2\xa7 250 (repudiation entails a statement or "voluntary affirmative act" indicating that the promisor "will commit a breach" when performance becomes due). Such a repudiation ripens into a breach prior to the time for performance only if the promisee "elects to treat it as such." See <i>Roehm </i>v. <i>Horst, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/178/1/case.html">178 U. S. 1</a>, 13 (1900) (repudiation "give[s] the promisee the right of electing either to ... wait till the time for [the promisor\'s] performance has arrived, or to act upon [the renunciation] and treat it as a final assertion by the promisor that he is no longer bound by the contract").</p><p>Viewed in this light, ELIHPA effected a repudiation of the FmHA loan contracts, not an immediate breach. The Act conveyed an announcement by the Government that it would not perform as represented in the promissory notes if and when, at some point in the future, petitioners attempted to prepay their mortgages. See Restatement \xc2\xa7 250, Comment <i>b </i>("[A] statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract constitutes a repudiation." (internal quotation marks omitted)); Murray, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 208, at 421. Unless petitioners treated ELIHPA as a present breach by filing suit prior to the date indicated for performance, breach would occur when a borrower attempted to prepay, for only at that time would the Government\'s responsive performance become due.8</p><p>8 The record indicates that at least one petitioner has attempted to prepay, see App. to Pet. for Cert. A157-A158, but contains no information about how many others have done so or when any such attempts took place, see 43 Fed. Cl., at 707. Application of our holding to each petitioner in light of such determinations is a task for the lower courts on remand.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="144">144</a></p><p>In sum, once it is understood that ELIHPA is most sensibly characterized as a repudiation, the decisions below lose force. To recapitulate, "[t]he time of accrual ... depends on whether the injured party chooses to treat the ... repudiation as a present breach." 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \xc2\xa7 7.2.1, p. 488 (1991). If that party "[e]lects to place the repudiator in breach before the performance date, the accrual date of the cause of action is accelerated from [the] time of performance to the date of such election." <i>Id., </i>at 488-489. But if the injured party instead opts to await performance, "the cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations commences to run, from the time fixed for performance rather than from the earlier date of repudiation." <i>Id., </i>at 488.</p><p>The Government draws no distinction "between a duty to allow petitioners to prepay and a duty to accept tendered prepayments"; "any such distinction," the Government acknowledges, "would be without significance." Brief for United States 33. Indeed, the Government recognizes, if petitioners had an "unfettered right to prepay," then, "of course," that right would be complemented by an "obligation to accept any prepayment tendered." <i>Ibid. </i>In defense of the judgment below, the Government relies on two other grounds.</p><p>First, the Government draws upon the text of \xc2\xa7 2501, which bars any claims not "filed within six years after [the] claim first accrues." The words "first accrues," the Government contends, are key. See <i>id., </i>at 11. Those words, according to the Government, convey Congress\' intent to guard the sovereign against claims that might be deemed timely under statutes of limitations applicable to private parties. <i>Id., </i>at 28. As the Government reads \xc2\xa7 2501, the "first accrues" qualification ensures that suits against the United States are filed on "the earliest possible date," <i>id., </i>at 17, thereby providing the Government with "reasonably prompt notice of the fiscal implications of past enactments," <i>id.,</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="145">145</a></p><p>at 16. See <i>ibid. </i>("[S]trict construction of [\xc2\xa7 2501] ... serves the salutary purpose of ensuring that a Congress close to the one that enacted the statute [alleged to have caused a breach of contract]-rather than a Congress serving perhaps many decades later-may and must address the consequences."); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46.</p><p>We do not agree that \xc2\xa7 2501 creates a special accrual rule for suits against the United States. Contrary to the Government\'s contention, the text of \xc2\xa7 2501 is unexceptional: A number of contemporaneous state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties also tie the commencement of the limitations period to the date a claim "first accrues." See J. Angell, Limitations of Actions 536-588 (6th ed. 1876) (quoting state statutes of limitations). Equally telling, in its many years of applying and interpreting \xc2\xa7 2501, the Court of Federal Claims has never attributed to the words "first accrues" the meaning the Government now proposes. Instead, in other settings, that court has adopted the repudiation doctrine in its traditional form when evaluating the timeliness of suits governed by \xc2\xa7 2501. See <i>Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related Cases </i>v. <i>United States, </i>37 Fed. Cl. 174, 183-184 (1997), aff\'d <i>sub nom. Ariadne Financial Services Pty. Ltd. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/133/874/">133 F.3d 874</a> <i>(CA </i>Fed. 1998). In line with our recognition that limitations principles should generally apply to the Government "in the same way that" they apply to private parties, <i>Irwin </i>v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/case.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 95 (1990), we reject the Government\'s proposed construction of \xc2\xa7 2501. That position, we conclude, presents an "unduly restrictiv[e]" reading of the congressional waiver of sovereign immunity, <i>Bowen </i>v. <i>City of New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/467/case.html">476 U. S. 467</a>, 479 (1986), rather than "a realistic assessment of legislative intent," <i>Irwin, </i>498 U. S., at 95.9</p><p>9 As petitioners observe, see Reply Brief 6, n. 6, the "first accrues" qualification might serve a meaningful purpose in the context of tolling of disabilities for successive claimants. In that context, the qualification would ensure that suit could be delayed only during the disability of the claim-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="146">146</a></p><p>Two practical considerations reinforce this conclusion.</p><p>Cf. <i>Crown Coat Front Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/503/case.html">386 U. S. 503</a>, 517 (1967) (the words "first accrues" must be interpreted "with due regard to those practical ends which are to be served by any limitation of the time within which an action must be brought" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Reading \xc2\xa7 2501 as the Government proposes would seriously distort the repudiation doctrine in suits brought under the Tucker Act. Assuming a claim could "first accrue" for limitations purposes on the date of repudiation, but see <i>supra, </i>at 144, a party aggrieved by the Government\'s renunciation of a contractual obligation anticipating future performance would be compelled by the looming limitations bar to forgo the usual option of awaiting the time performance is due before filing an action for breach. The Government\'s construction of \xc2\xa7 2501 would thus convert the repudiation doctrine from a shield for the promisee into a sword by which the Government could invoke its own wrongdoing to defeat otherwise timely suits. As Professor Corbin explained, "[t]he plaintiff should not be penalized for leaving to the defendant an opportunity to retract his wrongful repudiation; and he would be so penalized if the statutory period of limitation is held to begin to run against him immediately." Corbin, Contracts \xc2\xa7 989, at 967; see <i>Roehm </i>v. <i>Horst, </i>178 U. S., at 10 ("[I]t seems reasonable to allow an option to the injured party, either to sue immediately, or to wait till the time when the act was to be done, ... which may be advantageous to the innocent party.").</p><p>There is also reason to doubt that the Government\'s reading of \xc2\xa7 2501 would inure to the benefit of the United States. Putting prospective plaintiffs to the choice of either bringing suit soon after the Government\'s repudiation or forever relinquishing their claims would surely proliferate litigation.</p><p>ant to whom a right of action first accrued; successive claimants laboring under a disability would be unprotected by any tolling proviso.

Faced with the prospect of forever forgoing such a claim, even a borrower that had not previously wished to prepay might well conclude that early exit from the FmHA program is the only safe course. The Government would thus find itself defending against highly speculative damages claims in a profusion of lawsuits, most of which would never have been brought under a less novel interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2501. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.10</p><p>The Government also seeks to avoid the repudiation doctrine by attacking as "futile" petitioners\' "search for an exact parallel in contracts solely between private parties." Brief for United States 13. The law of repudiation does not govern here, the Government ultimately contends, because the "statement of intent not to perform" on which petitioners base their claim is an Act of Congress. <i>Id., </i>at 24.

The Court there rejected an interpretation of the Suits in Admiralty Act that would have given tort plaintiffs "an option as to when they will choose to start the period of limitation of an action against the United States." 342 U. S., at 27. The reasoning in that case does not apply to petitioners\' claims, which arise out of contracts in which the Government allegedly granted borrowers an option to demand performance, and thereby precipitate breach, at any time. See <i>supra, </i>at 141. And unlike the position rejected in <i>McMahon, </i>our ruling today ensures that suit must be brought within a fixed period after the date of injury-in this case, no later than six years after the Government\'s refusal to accept prepayment in accord with the terms of the promissory notes.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="148">148</a></p><p>"remai[n] free to change its mind and render the requisite performance" without violating binding federal law. <i>Id., </i>at 27. Accordingly, the Government concludes, the essential purpose of the repudiation doctrine-to avoid an unnecessary lawsuit by allowing the promisor an opportunity to adhere to its undertaking-is inapplicable.</p><p>We reject the Government\'s premise, and therefore its conclusion. Just as Congress may announce the Government\'s intent to dishonor an obligation to perform in the future through a duly enacted law, so may it retract that renouncement prior to the time for performance, thereby enabling the agency or contracting official to perform as promised. Indeed, Congress "change[d] its mind" in just this manner before it enacted ELIHPA. <i>Ibid. </i>In the 1979 amendments to the National Housing Act, Congress repudiated the promissory notes at issue here by conditioning prepayment of all \xc2\xa7 515 loans on the borrower\'s agreement to maintain the low-income use of its property for a specified period. See Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1134-1135. One year later, Congress removed those conditions on pre-1979 loans, thereby retracting the repudiation. See Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1671-1672; <i>supra, </i>at 135.</p><p>We comprehend no reason why an Act of Congress may not constitute a repudiation of a contract to which the United States is a party. Congress may renounce the Government\'s contractual duties without triggering an immediate breach because Congress may withdraw that repudiation if given the opportunity to do so.

S., at 620; see <i>id., </i>at 619 ("[I]f legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President is not a \'statement by the obligor\'" capable of triggering a repudiation, "it is difficult to imagine what would constitute such a statement."
