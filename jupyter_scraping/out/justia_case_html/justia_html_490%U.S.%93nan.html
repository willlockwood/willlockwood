Appellant States -- who are, at least in part, indirect purchasers of cement -- brought class actions against various cement producers in the appropriate federal courts seeking treble damages under the federal antitrust laws for an alleged nationwide conspiracy to fix cement prices and damages for alleged violations of their respective state antitrust laws, which arguably allow indirect purchasers to recover for all overcharges passed on to them by direct purchasers.

Second, claims under the state statutes will not reduce the incentives of direct purchasers to bring private federal antitrust actions by reducing their potential recoveries.  <em>Illinois Brick</em> was not concerned with the risk that a federal plaintiff might not be able to recover its entire damages award or might be offered less to settle.

The state statutes at issue pose no similar risk.  That direct purchasers\' recoveries may be reduced because they will have to share the settlement fund with indirect purchasers is not due to the impermissible operation of the state statutes, but is, rather, a function of the fact and form of the settlement, which was intended to dispose of all claimants, whether claiming under federal or state law and whether direct or indirect purchasers.  Third, claims under the state statutes will not contravene any express federal policy condemning multiple liability for antitrust defendants, since <em>Illinois Brick</em> and similar cases simply construed \xc2\xa7 4, and did not identify a federal policy against imposing state liability in addition to that imposed by federal law.

Illinois, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html">431 U. S. 720</a></span> (1977), the State of Illinois brought suit on its own behalf and on behalf </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 490 U.

The State and the local governments were all indirect purchasers of concrete block -- that is, they did not purchase concrete block directly from the price-fixing defendants, but rather purchased products or contracted for construction into which the concrete block was incorporated by a prior purchaser.  The Court held that, with limited exceptions, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] only overcharged direct purchasers, and not subsequent indirect purchasers, were persons "injured in [their] business or property" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 4, and that therefore the State of Illinois was not entitled to recover under federal law for the portion of the overcharge passed on to it.</p>\n<p>Appellants in the present case, the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, and Minnesota, brought suit in the appropriate federal courts on their own behalf and on behalf of classes of all governmental entities within each State, excluding the Federal Government, seeking treble damages under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act for an alleged nationwide conspiracy to fix prices of cement in violation of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act.  Appellants are, at least in part, indirect purchasers of cement, and so under <em>Illinois Brick,</em> like the State of Illinois in that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 490 U. S. 98</a></p><p> case, would not be entitled to recover on their indirect purchaser claims under \xc2\xa7 4 unless those claims fell within one of the exceptions.  In their complaints, however, appellants also alleged violations of their respective state antitrust laws under which, as a matter of state law, indirect purchasers arguably are allowed to recover for all overcharges passed on to them by direct purchasers. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The claims under these state indirect purchaser statutes are the focus of this case.</p>\n<p>Numerous similar actions were filed by other plaintiffs in various district courts, and the actions were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Arizona for coordinated pretrial proceedings.  <em>In re Cement and Concrete Antitrust Litigation,</em> 437 F.Supp. 750 (JPML 1977).  The District Court certified the actions as class actions and established a number of plaintiff classes.  Between July, 1979 and October, 1981, several major defendants settled </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 490 U.

Appellees, class members who are direct purchasers, objected.  When the District Court approved a plan for distributing the settlement fund, it refused to allow the claims against the fund pursuant to state indirect purchaser statutes.  According to the District Court,</p>\n<p>"[s]uch statutes are clear attempts to frustrate the purposes and objectives of Congress, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Illinois Brick,</em> and, accordingly, are preempted by federal law."</p>\n<p>App. to Juris. Statement A-31 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  <em>In re Cement and Concrete Antitrust Litigation,</em> 817 F.2d 1435 (1987).  The Court of Appeals identified "three purposes or objectives of federal antitrust law in this context," as defined by <em>Illinois Brick</em> and <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html">392 U. S. 481</a></span> (1968):  avoiding unnecessarily complicated litigation; providing direct purchasers with incentives to bring private antitrust actions; and avoiding multiple liability of defendants.  817 F.2d at 1445.  If state laws permitting indirect purchasers to recover were construed to restrict direct purchasers to suing only for the amount of any overcharge they have absorbed, the Court of Appeals was of the view that state law conflicted directly with federal law as construed in <em>Illinois Brick.</em>  Alternatively, if state law permitted indirect purchasers to bring claims for damages in addition to the claims brought by direct purchasers, it would "impermissibly interfere with the three policy goals outlined in <em>Hanover Shoe</em> and <em>Illinois Brick.</em>"  817 F.2d at 1445.  The Court of Appeals therefore held that state indirect purchaser claims that did not satisfy any exception to <em>Illinois Brick</em> were preempted. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 490 U. S. 100</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellants appealed to this Court, invoking our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(2).  We noted probable jurisdiction, 488 U.S. 814 (1988), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p>We should first make it clear exactly what the issue is before us.  These cases alleged violations of both the Sherman Act and state antitrust Acts.  The settlements, as we understand it, covered both the federal and the state law claims; the settlement fund was intended to be distributed in complete satisfaction of those claims.  Under federal law, no indirect purchaser is entitled to sue for damages for a Sherman Act violation, and there is no claim here that state law could provide a remedy for the federal violation that federal law forbids.  Had these cases gone to trial and a Sherman Act violation been proved, only direct purchasers would have been entitled to damages for that violation, and there is no suggestion by the parties that the same rule should not apply to distributing that part of the fund that was meant to settle the Sherman Act claims.  The issue before us is whether this rule limiting recoveries under the Sherman Act also prevents indirect purchasers from recovering damages flowing from violations of state law, despite express state statutory provisions giving such purchasers a damages cause of action.</p>\n<p>The path to be followed in preemption cases is laid out by our cases.  It is accepted that Congress has the authority, in exercising its Article I powers, to preempt state law.  In the absence of an express statement by Congress that state law is preempted, there are two other bases for finding preemption.  First, when Congress intends that federal law occupy a given field, state law in that field is preempted.  <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html">461 U. S. 190</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/190/case.html#212">461 U. S. 212</a></span>-213 (1983).  Second, even if Congress has not occupied the field, state law is nevertheless preempted to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law, that is, when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U. S. 142</a></span>-143 (1963), or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 490 U. S. 101</a></p><p> when the state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress," <em>Hines v. Davidowitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html">312 U.

S. 238</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/238/case.html#248">464 U. S. 248</a></span> (1984).</p>\n<p>In this case, in addition, appellees must overcome the presumption against finding preemption of state law in areas traditionally regulated by the States.  <em>See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/707/case.html">471 U. S. 707</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/707/case.html#716">471 U. S. 716</a></span> (1985).  When Congress legislates in a field traditionally occupied by the States,</p>\n<p>"we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span> (1947).  Given the long history of state common law and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] it is plain that this is an area traditionally regulated by the States.  <em>Cf. Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#146">373 U. S. 146</a></span> (regulation to "prevent the deception of consumers").</p>\n<p>In light of these principles, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the state indirect purchaser statutes are preempted.  There is no claim that the federal antitrust laws expressly preempt state laws permitting indirect purchaser recovery. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Moreover, appellees concede that Congress has not preempted the field of antitrust law.

Congress intended the federal antitrust laws to supplement, not displace, state antitrust remedies.  21 Cong.Rec. 2457 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Sherman); <em>see Cantor v.

And on several prior occasions, the Court has recognized that the federal antitrust laws do not preempt state law.  <em>See Watson v.

The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that such laws are inconsistent with, and stand as an obstacle to, effectuating the congressional purposes and policies identified in <em>Hanover Shoe</em> and <em>Illinois Brick.</em> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In this respect, the Court of Appeals has misunderstood both <em>Hanover Shoe</em> and <em>Illinois Brick.</em></p>\n<p>Neither of those cases addressed the preemptive force of the federal antitrust laws.  Neither case contains any discussion of state law or of the relevant standards for preemption of state law.  As we made clear in <em>Illinois Brick,</em> the issue </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 490 U. S. 103</a></p><p> before the Court in both that case and in <em>Hanover Shoe</em> was strictly a question of statutory interpretation -- what was the proper construction of \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html#736">431 U. S. 736</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is one thing to consider the congressional policies identified in <em>Illinois Brick</em> and <em>Hanover Shoe</em> in defining what sort of recovery federal antitrust law authorizes; it is something altogether different, and in our view inappropriate, to consider them as defining what federal law allows States to do under their own antitrust law.  As construed in <em>Illinois Brick,</em> \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act authorizes only direct purchasers to recover monopoly overcharges under federal law.  We construed \xc2\xa7 4 as not authorizing indirect purchasers to recover under federal law because that would be contrary to the purposes of Congress.  But nothing in <em>Illinois Brick</em> suggests that it would be contrary to congressional purposes for States to allow indirect purchasers to recover under their own antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also erred in concluding that state indirect purchaser statutes interfere with accomplishing the purposes of the federal law that were identified in <em>Illinois Brick.</em>  First, the Court of Appeals concluded that state indirect purchaser statutes interfere with the congressional purpose of avoiding unnecessarily complicated proceedings on federal antitrust claims.  But these state statutes cannot and do not purport to affect remedies available under federal law.  Furthermore, state indirect purchaser actions will not necessarily be brought in federal court.  817 F.2d at 1445.  Unlike the federal indirect purchaser claims asserted in <em>Illinois Brick,</em> which would have been exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 15(a), 26, claims under state indirect purchaser statutes could be brought in state courts, separately from federal actions brought by direct purchasers.  Moreover, federal courts have the discretion to decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over state indirect purchaser claims, even if those claims are brought in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 490 U. S. 104</a></p><p> the first instance in federal court.  <em>See Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html">383 U.

Since many state indirect purchaser actions would be heard in state courts, at least when the federal courts determined that hearing those claims would be overly burdensome, any complication of federal direct purchaser actions in federal court would be minimal.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court of Appeals reasoned that allowing state indirect purchaser claims could reduce the incentives of direct purchasers to bring antitrust actions by reducing their potential recoveries.  The presence of indirect purchaser claims would reduce settlement offers to direct purchasers, the Court of Appeals believed, and if the total liability were to exhaust a defendant\'s assets, the direct purchasers would have to share the defendant\'s estate in bankruptcy with indirect purchasers.  But the Court in <em>Illinois Brick</em> was not concerned with the risk that a plaintiff might not be able to recover its entire damages award or might be offered less to settle.  Indeed, taken to its extreme, the Court of Appeals\' logic would lead to the preemption of any state law claims against antitrust defendants, even if wholly unrelated, because the presence of other litigation could threaten the defendants with bankruptcy and reduce their willingness to settle.  <em>Illinois Brick</em> was concerned that requiring direct and indirect purchasers to apportion the recovery under a single statute -- \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act -- would result in no one plaintiff having a sufficient incentive to sue under that statute.  State indirect purchaser statutes pose no similar risk to the enforcement of the federal law.</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that, because the defendants in these antitrust actions have settled and there is a limited settlement fund, the indirect purchasers\' claims are preempted because those claims will likely reduce the amount that can be paid from the fund to direct purchasers. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  But as we said earlier, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 490 U. S. 105</a></p><p> the settlement covered both federal and state law claims, and whatever amount is allocable to federal claims will be distributed only to direct purchasers.  Indirect purchasers will participate only in distributing the funds available to claimants under state law.  Even if the settlement fund is not to be divided between state and federal law claimants, the settlement necessarily was intended to dispose of all claimants, whether claiming under federal or state law and whether direct or indirect purchasers.  That direct purchasers may have to share with indirect purchasers is a function of the fact and form of settlement, rather than the impermissible operation of state indirect purchaser statutes.</p>\n<p>Third, the Court of Appeals concluded that state indirect purchaser claims might subject antitrust defendants to multiple liability, in contravention of the "express federal policy" condemning multiple liability.  817 F.2d at 1446 (citing <em>Illinois Brick, Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v.

But <em>Illinois Brick,</em> as well as <em>Associated General Contractors</em> and <em>Blue Shield,</em> all were cases construing \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act; in none of those cases did the Court identify a federal policy against States imposing liability in addition to that imposed by federal law.  Ordinarily, state causes of action are not preempted solely because they impose liability over and above that authorized by federal law, <em>see Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,</em> 464 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/238/case.html#257">464 U. S. 257</a></span>-258; <em>California v.
