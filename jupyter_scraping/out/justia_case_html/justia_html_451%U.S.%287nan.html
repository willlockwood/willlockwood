An environmental organization and two private citizens (hereafter respondents) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] seek to enjoin the construction and operation of water diversion facilities which are part of the California Water Project (CWP).  They rely upon \xc2\xa7 10 of the Act, which prohibits</p>\n<p>"[t]he creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress; to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States. . . . [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>Since the Act does not explicitly create a private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 451 U. S. 290</a></p><p> enforcement mechanism, the initial question presented by these consolidated cases is whether such a private right of action can be implied on behalf of those allegedly injured by a claimed violation of \xc2\xa7 10.  Petitioner State of California also asks us to decide whether the Act requires permits for the state water allocation projects involved in these cases.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The California Water Project consists of a series of water storage and transportation facilities designed primarily to transport water from the relatively moist climate of northern California to the more arid central and southern portions of the State.  The water which will be used by the CWP is initially stored behind dams on the Sacramento River and, as needed, released into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  The CWP then diverts a quantity of this water from the Delta and directs it into canals and aqueducts which will carry it south.  The project has both federal and state components.  The federal component, the Central Valley Project, is designed in part to provide a constant source of water for irrigation to the Central Valley of California.  Water for this project is diverted from the Delta by the Tracy Pumping Plant into the 115-mile Delta-Mendota Canal, which transports the water to the Mendota Pool in California\'s Central Valley.  The State Water Project supplies water to both central and southern California by way of the California Aqueduct.  Water for this project is drawn from the Delta by the Delta Pumping Plant and deposited in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 451 U. S. 291</a></p><p> northern terminus of the California Aqueduct, through which it flows to its destinations in central and southern California.</p>\n<p>Under the present system, the quality of water captured in the north and released into the Delta may be degraded by intruding salt waters from the Pacific Ocean.  As a consequence, the water which is diverted from the Delta to the Delta-Mendota Canal or the California Aqueduct is potentially of a lesser quality than is the water which is transported to the Delta from storage facilities in the north and from there deposited in the Delta.  The State of California has proposed the construction of a 42-mile Peripheral Canal along the eastern edge of the Delta area, which would avoid any mixing of the water from the north with the saline water of the Delta.  Instead of depositing water in the Delta, the canal would carry high quality water directly to the Tracy and Delta Pumping Plants.</p>\n<p>Respondents commenced the present action in 1971 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  <em>Sierra Club v. Morton,</em> 400 F.Supp. 610 (1975).  Named as defendants were the various federal and state officials who administer the agencies responsible for overseeing the operation, construction, and regulation of the CWP facilities in question. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Petitioner water agencies, which had contracted with the State for water from the Delta and which had incurred extensive financial obligations in reliance thereon, were permitted to intervene. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The respondents alleged that present </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 451 U. S. 292</a></p><p> and proposed diversions of water from the Delta degraded the quality of Delta water, and that such diversion violated \xc2\xa7 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899.  They sought to enjoin further operation or construction of water diversion facilities until the consent of the Army Corps of Engineers was obtained, as required by the Act.</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that respondents could avail themselves of a "private cause of action" to enforce \xc2\xa7 10 of the Act, and ruled on the merits that approval of the Corps of Engineers was required by \xc2\xa7 10 for the Tracy and Delta Pumping Plants and the Peripheral Canal.  <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, supra.</em>  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed that a private cause of action to enforce the Act existed.  <em>Sierra Club v. Andrus,</em> 610 F.2d 581 (1979).  It reversed the District Court as to the Tracy Pumping Plant, however, ruling that Congress has consented to its construction and operation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We granted petitions for certiorari filed by the water agencies and the State of California.  449 U.S. 818 (1980).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span> (1975), outlined a "preferred approach for determining whether a private right of action should be implied from a federal statute. . . ."  <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html">444 U. S. 11</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html#26">444 U.

S. 677</a></span> (1979).  This approach listed four factors thought to be relevant to the inquiry:</p>\n<p>"First, is the plaintiff \'one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,\' . . . -- that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff?  Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? . . .  Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? . . .  And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?"</p>\n<p>422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span>.  Combined, these four factors present the relevant inquiries to pursue in answering the recurring question of implied causes of action.  Cases subsequent to <em>Cort</em> have explained that the ultimate issue is whether Congress intended to create a private right of action, <em>see Universities Research Assn., Inc. v. Coutu,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/754/case.html">450 U. S. 754</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/754/case.html#771">450 U.

Passman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html">442 U. S. 228</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#241">442 U. S. 241</a></span> (1979); <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v.

S. 27</a></span> (WHITE, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Under <em>Cort,</em> the initial consideration is whether the plaintiff is a member of a class for "<em>whose especial benefit the statute was enacted.\'"  <em>Cort v. Ash, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#80">422 U. S. 80</a></span>-82; <em>see Touche Ross &amp; Co. v.

Without analyzing either the language or legislative history of the Act, the Court of Appeals here concluded that the Act was designed for the especial benefit of private parties who may suffer "special injury" caused by an unauthorized obstruction </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 451 U. S. 294</a></em></p><p><em> to a navigable waterway.  It was apparently reasoned that, since Congress enacted a statute that forbids such obstructions in navigable waters, any person who would be "especially harmed" by an unauthorized obstruction was an especial beneficiary of the Act.  But such a definition of "especial" beneficiary makes this factor meaningless.  Under this view, a victim of any crime would be deemed an especial beneficiary of the criminal statute\'s proscription.  <em>Cort</em> did not adopt such a broad-gauge approach.  <em>Cort v. Ash, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#80">422 U. S. 80</a></span>-82.  The question is not simply who would benefit from the Act, but whether Congress intended to confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.  <em>See Cannon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#690">441 U. S. 690</a></span>-693, n. 13.\n</em></p>\n<p>In ascertaining this intent, the first consideration is the language of the Act.  Here, the statute states no more than a general proscription of certain activities; it does not unmistakably focus on any particular class of beneficiaries whose welfare Congress intended to further.  Such language does not indicate an intent to provide for private rights of action.</p>\n<p>"There would be far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons if Congress, instead of drafting Title IX [of the Education Amendments of 1972] with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class, had written it simply as a ban on discriminatory conduct by recipients of federal funds or as a prohibition against the disbursement of public funds to educational institutions engaged in discriminatory practices."</p>\n<p><em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#690">441 U. S. 690</a></span>-693; <em>see also Touche Ross  Co. v.

Ash, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#80">422 U. S. 80</a></span>-82.  Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act is the kind of general ban which carries with it no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.</p>\n<p>Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondents have identified anything in the legislative history suggesting that \xc2\xa7 10 was created for the especial benefit of a particular class.  On the contrary, the legislative history supports the view that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="295">Page 451 U. S. 295</a></p><p> the Act was designed to benefit the public at large by empowering the Federal Government to exercise its authority over interstate commerce with respect to obstructions on navigable rivers caused by bridges and similar structures.  In part, the Act was passed in response to this Court\'s decision in <em>Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/1/case.html">125 U. S. 1</a></span> (1888).  There the Court held that there was no federal common law "which prohibits obstructions and nuisances in navigable rivers."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/1/case.html#8">125 U. S. 8</a></span>.  Although <em>Willamette</em> involved private parties, the clear implication of the Court\'s opinion was that, in the absence of specific legislation, no party, including the Federal Government, would be empowered to take any action under federal law with respect to such obstructions.  The Act was intended to enable the Secretary of War to take such action. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>See</em> 21 Cong.Rec. 8603, 8605, and 8607 (1890); <em>see also United States v.

Congress was not concerned with the rights of individuals.</p>\n<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that there is no "indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one."  <em>Cort v.

The federal judiciary will not engraft a remedy on a statute, no matter how salutary, that Congress did not intend to provide.  Here consideration of the first two <em>Cort</em> factors is dispositive.  The language of the statute and its legislative history do not suggest that the Act was intended to create federal rights for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 451 U. S. 298</a></p><p> especial benefit of a class of persons, but rather that it was intended to benefit the public at large through a general regulatory scheme to be administered by the then Secretary of War.  Nor is there any evidence that Congress anticipated that there would be a private remedy.  This being the case, it is unnecessary to inquire further to determine whether the purpose of the statute would be advanced by the judicial implication of a private action or whether such a remedy is within the federal domain of interest.  These factors are only of relevance if the first two factors give indication of congressional intent to create the remedy.  <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v.

The creation of one explicit mode of enforcement is not dispositive of congressional intent with respect to other complementary remedies.  <em>See Cort v.

However, here, considering the clear focus of the legislative history on the need to enable the Government to respond to obstructions in navigable waterways, the creation of this enforcement mechanism and the absence of the remedy sought by respondents certainly reinforces the view that Congress was not concerned with private rights or remedies in designing this legislation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents suggest that the legislative history of the Act must be read in light of the historical context during which the measure was being considered.  <em>See Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#698">441 U. S. 698</a></span>-699 (1979).  That context, they argue, included a general awareness that the obstruction of any navigable stream could have been addressed through the common law of nuisance, and that this private remedy had been recognized at one time as federal in nature.  Furthermore, they argue that the contemporary legal climate recognized that the abrogation of this federal remedy in cases such as <em>Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/1/case.html">125 U. S. 1</a></span> (1888), did not undermine the accepted view that the enactment of any federal prohibition of obstructions on navigable streams would resurrect the federal private right of action.  Congressional silence as to private remedies should be interpreted, therefore, as acquiescing in the accepted view.</p>\n<p>For both of these positions, respondents rely heavily upon <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/54/518/case.html">Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co.,</a></span></em> 13 How. 518 (1852).  There, the State of Pennsylvania sought equitable relief from the construction of a bridge across the Ohio River.  The Court took the case under its original jurisdiction, a State being the plaintiff, and, having done so, held that it was empowered to consider all issues presented by the parties, state as well as federal.  Respondents suggest that the <em>Wheeling</em> Court held that federal courts were regularly available to entertain actions for nuisance brought by private parties with respect to obstructions on navigable rivers.  But nothing in the opinion supports that view.  The discussion in that case of the common law of nuisance is based on the Court\'s position that it was entitled to consider state, as well as federal, issues in the cause before it.  Indeed, that the opinion did not establish a general federal law of nuisance with respect to navigable waterways was a point reiterated in <em>Willamette, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/1/case.html#15">125 U. S. 15</a></span>-17.  In short, although there may have been a common law nuisance cause of action for obstructions of navigable waterways, <em>Wheeling Bridge</em> did not federalize that law.  Respondents have cited no decision by this Court that did.</p>\n<p>Equally unavailing is respondents\' assertion that <em>Wheeling Bridge</em> stands for the broad proposition that, if Congress legislated in this area, any prohibition of obstructions would automatically support a private right of action.  This position is extrapolated from discussions of the law of nuisance in both <em>Wheeling Bridge, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/54/518/case.html#604">54 U. S. 604</a></span>-607 and the subsequent <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/713/case.html">Gilman v. Philadelphia,</a></span></em> 3 Wall. 713,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/713/case.html#722">70 U. S. 722</a></span>-724 (1866).  In both cases, the Court merely expressed agreement with the proposition that a court of equity could enjoin a public nuisance in a case brought by a private person who had sustained specific injury.  Whether a congressional enactment prohibiting obstructions would automatically give rise to a private right of action was not an issue raised or discussed in either case.</p>\n<p>The most that may be legitimately concluded as to legislative understanding of the law preceding the enactment of this statute is that Congress was aware that the Supreme Court had held that there was no federal law which empowered anyone to contest obstructions to navigable rivers.  <em>See</em> 21 Cong.Rec. 8604-8607 (1890).  We cannot assume from legislative silence on private rights of action that Congress anticipated that a general regulatory prohibition of obstructions to navigable streams would provide an automatic basis for a private remedy in the nature of common law nuisance.  The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 was, no doubt, in part a legislative response to the <em>Willamette</em> decision.  But there is nothing to suggest that that response was intended to do anything more than empower the Federal Government to respond to obstructions on navigable rivers.  The broad view supported by respondents is without support.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>In 1888, this Court reversed a decree enjoining the construction of a bridge over a navigable river.  <em>Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/1/case.html">125 U. S. 1</a></span>.  The Court\'s opinion in that case did not question the right of the private parties to seek relief in a federal court; rather, the Court held that no federal rule of law prohibited the obstruction of the navigable waterway. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 451 U. S. 299</a></p><p> Congress responded to the <em>Willamette</em> case in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890 by creating a federal prohibition of such obstructions absent a permit from the Secretary of War.  26 Stat. 426, 454.  At the time the statute was enacted, I believe the lawyers in Congress simply assumed that private parties in a position comparable to that of the litigants in the <em>Willamette</em> case would have a remedy for any injury suffered by reason of a violation of the new federal statute. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  For at that time, the implication of private causes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 451 U. S. 300</a></p><p> of action was a well known practice at common law and in American courts. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Therefore, in my view, the Members of Congress merely assumed that the federal courts would follow the ancient maxim "<em>ubi jus, ibi remedium,</em>" and imply a private right of action.  <em>See Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/33/case.html">241 U. S. 33</a></span>. 39-40. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Accordingly, if I were writing on a clean slate, I would hold that an implied remedy is available to respondents under this statute. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 451 U. S. 301</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The slate, however, is not clean.  Because the problem of ascertaining legislative intent that is not expressed in legislation is often so difficult, the Court has wisely developed rules to guide judges in deciding whether a federal remedy is implicitly a part of a federal statute.  In <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>, all of my present colleagues subscribed to a unanimous formulation of those rules, and in <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a></span>, a majority of the Court joined my attempt to explain the application of those rules in that case.  The <em>Cort v. Ash</em> analysis is therefore a part of our law. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In these cases, I believe the Court correctly concludes that application of the <em>Cort v. Ash</em> analysis indicates that no private cause of action is available.  I think it is more important to adhere to the analytical approach the Court has adopted than to base my vote on my own opinion about what Congress probably assumed in 1890.  <em>Cf. Florida Dept. of Health &amp; Rehabilitation Services v. Florida Nursing Home Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/147/case.html">450 U.

I therefore join JUSTICE WHITE\'s opinion for the Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The <em>Willamette</em> Court explained the issue presented as follows:</p>\n<p>"The gravamen of the bill was the obstruction of the navigation of the Willamette River by the defendants by the erection of the bridge which they were engaged in building.  The defendants pleaded the authority of the state legislature for the erection of the bridge.  The court held that the work was not done in conformity with the requirements of the state law, but whether it were or not, it lacked the assent of Congress, which assent the court held was necessary in view of that provision in the act of Congress admitting Oregon as a State which has been referred to.  The court held that this provision of the act was tantamount to a declaration that the navigation of the Willamette River should not be obstructed or interfered with, and that any such obstruction or interference, without the consent of Congress, whether by state sanction or not, was a violation of the act of Congress, and that the obstruction complained of was in violation of said act.  And this is the principal and important question in this case, namely, whether the erection of a bridge over the Willamette River at Portland was a violation of said act of Congress.  If it was not, if it could not be, if the act did not apply to obstructions of this kind, then the case did not arise under the constitution or laws of the United States, unless under some other law referred to in the bill."</p>\n<p>125 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/1/case.html#7">125 U.

Surely it cannot be seriously argued that a mechanical application of the <em>Cort</em> analysis lends "predictability" to implied right of action jurisprudence:  including today\'s decision, five of the last six statutory implied right of action cases in which we have reviewed analysis by the Courts of Appeals after <em>Cort</em> have resulted in reversal of erroneous Court of Appeals decisions.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 451 U.
