The Louisville School District is coextensive with Winston County, Miss., which is the only county in which Highways 14 and 15 intersect.  Since 1960, the Louisville mayor and city aldermen appointed three of the five members of the District\'s Board of Trustees, and Winston County voters residing outside Louisville elected the other two members.  The county officials never implemented the 1964 statute.  Respondent Winston County voters filed an action against petitioner local officials in Mississippi Chancery Court seeking to enforce the 1964 statute.  The court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the statute violated the state constitutional bar against local legislation.  The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed and remanded, striking only the statute\'s reference to Highways 14 and 15 and upholding the remainder of the statute.  The Supreme Court, without comment, denied petitioners\' petition for rehearing in which they argued for the first time that the Chancery Court could not implement the reformed statute until the change had been precleared under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  On remand, the Chancery Court ordered an election pursuant to the redacted statute under procedures prescribed by the court, but directed petitioners to submit the election plan to the United States Attorney General for preclearance under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The Attorney General subsequently objected to the plan, and the Chancery Court ultimately concluded that its order would remain in force subject to compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

Until last December, the Louisville mayor and city aldermen appointed three of the five members of the District\'s Board of Trustees, and Winston County voters residing outside Louisville elected the other two members.</p>\n<p>In 1964, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a statute providing in part: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 457 U.

[I]n any county in which a municipal separate school district embraces the entire county in which Highways 14 and 15 intersect, one (1) trustee shall be elected from each supervisors district."</p>\n<p>1964 Miss. Gen. Laws, ch. 391, p. 563, codified, as amended, in Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 37-7-203(1)(Supp.1981).  Winston County is the only Mississippi county in which Highways 14 and 15 intersect.  Officials in that county never implemented \xc2\xa7 37-7-203(1), because they believed the statute\'s reference to Highways 14 and 15 violated a state constitutional prohibition against local, private, or special legislation. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1975, five Winston County voters filed an action in the Chancery Court of Winston County, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] seeking to enforce the neglected 1964 state statute. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  These plaintiffs, respondents here, named numerous Louisville and Winston County officials as defendants.  The Chancery Court dismissed respondents\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 457 U. S. 259</a></p><p> complaint, holding that the statute violated Mississippi\'s constitutional bar against local legislation.  The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed, striking only the specific reference to Highways 14 and 15 and upholding the remaining requirement that, "in any county in which a municipal separate school district embraces the entire county," each supervisors district must elect one trustee.  <em>Lovorn v. Hathorn,</em> 365 So.2d 947 (1979) (en banc).  The court then "remanded to the chancery court for further proceedings not inconsistent with [its] opinion."  <em>Id.</em> at 952.</p>\n<p>The local officials, petitioners here, filed a petition for rehearing, in which they argued for the first time that the Chancery Court could not implement the reformed statute until the change had been precleared under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  The Mississippi Supreme Court denied the petition without comment, and this Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.  <em>Hathorn v. Lovorn,</em> 441 U.S. 946 (1979).</p>\n<p>On remand, the Chancery Court ordered an election pursuant to the redacted statute.  The court set out detailed procedures governing the election, including the requirement that,</p>\n<p>"[i]f no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast at any of said elections . . a runoff election shall be held . . . between the two candidates receiving the highest vote [in the first election]."</p>\n<p>Record 143.  The court derived the latter requirement from Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 37-7-217 (Supp.1981), which mandates runoffs in elections conducted under \xc2\xa7 377-203(1).  <em>See</em> Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 37-7-209 (Supp.1981).  The Chancery Court also agreed with petitioners\' claim that the changes in election procedure fell within \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and directed petitioners to submit the election plan to the United States Attorney General for preclearance.  Record 141, 146-147. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="260">Page 457 U. S. 260</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Upon review of petitioners\' submission, the Attorney General objected to the proposed change in election procedure "insofar as it incorporate[d] a majority vote requirement."  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-8.  Because of the substantial black population in Winston County, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] an apparent pattern of racially polarized voting in the county, and the historical absence of blacks from various local governing boards, the Attorney General concluded that the runoff procedure could have a discriminatory effect.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents attempted to overcome this obstacle by both joining the Attorney General as a defendant and persuading the Chancery Court to hold the election without the runoff procedure.  The court, however, refused to join the Attorney General and held that state law unambiguously required runoff elections.  Buffeted by apparently conflicting state and federal statutes, the Chancery Court concluded that its decree calling for an election would "remain in force subject to compliance with the Federal Voters Rights Act [<em>sic</em>] as previously ordered by this Court."  Record 342.</p>\n<p>Failing to obtain an election from the Chancery Court, respondents once again appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court.  That court observed that its "prior decision, which the United States Supreme Court declined to reverse or alter in any respect, became and is the law of the case."  <em>Carter v. Luke,</em> 399 So.2d 1356, 1358 (1981).  The court explained that, because the prior decision upheld a statute referring to the statute requiring runoffs, and because both parties had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 457 U. S. 261</a></p><p> agreed during oral argument to abide by the runoff procedure, the Chancery Court properly enforced the law requiring runoffs and improperly conditioned the election on compliance with the Voting Rights Act.  Accordingly, the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the portion of the Chancery Court\'s decree referring to the Voting Rights Act and "remanded with directions for the lower court to call and require the holding of an election."  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari to decide whether the Mississippi Supreme Court properly ordered the election without insuring compliance with federal law.  454 U.S. 1122 (1981). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before addressing the federal question raised by the Mississippi Supreme Court\'s decision, we must consider respondents\' assertion that the lower court decision rests upon two adequate and independent state grounds.  First, respondents contend that the state court\'s reliance upon the law of the case bars review of the federal question.  It has long been established, however, that</p>\n<p>"[w]e have jurisdiction to consider all of the substantial federal questions determined in the earlier stages of [state proceedings], . . . and our right to reexamine such questions is not affected by a ruling that the first decision of the state court became the law of the case. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Reece v.

Because we cannot review a state court judgment until it is final, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] a contrary rule would insulate interlocutory state court rulings on important federal questions from our consideration.</p>\n<p>In this case, the Mississippi Supreme Court\'s first decision plainly did not appear final at the time it was rendered.  The court\'s remand "for further proceedings not inconsistent with [its] opinion," 365 So.2d at 952 (en banc), together with its failure to address expressly the Voting Rights Act issue, suggested that the Chancery Court could still consider the federal issue on remand.  Indeed, the Chancery Court interpreted its mandate in precisely this manner. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Under these circumstances, the Mississippi Supreme Court\'s subsequent reliance on the law of the case cannot prevent us from reviewing federal questions determined in the first appeal. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents also argue that the Mississippi Supreme Court pretermitted consideration of the Voting Rights Act because petitioners\' reliance upon the issue in a petition for rehearing was untimely.  We have recognized that the failure to comply with a state procedural rule may constitute an independent and adequate state ground barring our review of a federal question. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Our decisions, however, stress that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 457 U. S. 263</a></p><p> state procedural ground is not "adequate" unless the procedural rule is "strictly or regularly followed."  <em>Barr v. City of Columbia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/146/case.html">378 U. S. 146</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/146/case.html#149">378 U. S. 149</a></span> (1964).  State courts may not avoid deciding federal issues by invoking procedural rules that they do not apply evenhandedly to all similar claims.  Even if we construe the Mississippi Supreme Court\'s denial of petitioners\' petition for rehearing as the silent application of a procedural bar, we cannot conclude that the state court consistently relies upon this rule.</p>\n<p>Respondents cite two cases indicating that the Mississippi Supreme Court will consider an issue raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing "[o]nly in exceptional cases."  <em>New &amp; Hughes Drilling Co. v. Smith,</em> 219 So.2d 657, 661 (Miss.1969); <em>Rigdon v. General Box Co.,</em> 249 Miss. 239, 246, 162 So.2d 863, 864 (1964).  Although these opinions may summarize the court\'s practice prior to 1969, we have been unable to find any more recent decisions repeating or applying the rule. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  On the contrary, the Mississippi Supreme Court now regularly grants petitions for rehearing without mentioning any restrictions on its authority to consider issues raised for the first time in the petitions. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="264">Page 457 U. S. 264</a></p><p></p>\n<p>One particular decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court, decided only last year, demonstrates that the court does not consistently preclude consideration of issues raised for the first time on rehearing.  In <em>Quinn v. Brannin,</em> 404 So.2d 1018 (1981), the court held that part of a criminal statute violated the State Constitution\'s prohibition against local legislation.  Striking the offensive language, the court approved the rest of the statute and affirmed the underlying conviction.  The defendant then petitioned for rehearing, pointing out that the affidavit against him did not allege a crime under the reformed statute.  The court agreed with this contention, granted the petition in part, and reversed the conviction, all without mentioning the rule against consideration of new issues on rehearing.  The striking similarity between <em>Quinn</em> and this case, both involving issues that the parties could have foreseen but that arose with urgency only after the court upheld part of a challenged statute, persuades us that the Mississippi Supreme Court is not "strictly or regularly" following a procedural rule precluding review of issues raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing.  The denial of rehearing in this case, although not appearing sufficiently final to permit our immediate review, must have rested either upon a substantive rejection of petitioners\' federal claim or upon a procedural rule that the state court applies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 457 U. S. 265</a></p><p> only irregularly. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Thus, there are no independent and adequate state grounds barring our review of the federal issue.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents do not dispute that the change in election procedures ordered by the Mississippi courts is subject to preclearance under \xc2\xa7 5. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  They urge, however, that the Voting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="266">Page 457 U. S. 266</a></p><p> Rights Act deprives state courts of the power even to decide whether \xc2\xa7 5 applies to a proposed change in voting procedures. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Under their analysis of the Act, a state court asked to implement a change in the State\'s voting laws could not inquire whether the change was subject to \xc2\xa7 5.  Even if the change plainly fell within \xc2\xa7 5, the court would have to ignore that circumstance and enter a decree violating federal law.  Both the language and purposes of the Voting Rights Act refute this notion.</p>\n<p>Only last Term, we summarized the principles governing state court jurisdiction to decide federal issues.  <em>Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html">453 U. S. 473</a></span> (1981).  We begin, in every case, "with the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction" over those claims.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#478">453 U. S. 478</a></span>.  Only</p>\n<p>"an explicit statutory directive, [an] unmistakable implication from legislative history, or . . . a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests"</p>\n<p>will rebut the presumption.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Most important for our purposes, even a finding of exclusive federal jurisdiction over claims arising under a federal statute usually "will not prevent a state court from deciding a federal question collaterally."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#483">453 U.

S. 267</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondents rest their jurisdictional argument on three sections of the Act.  Section 14(b) provides that</p>\n<p>"[n]o court other than the District Court for the District of Columbia . . . shall have jurisdiction to issue any declaratory judgment pursuant to . . . section 5. . . ."</p>\n<p>79 Stat. 445, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 19731(b).  We have already held, however, that this provision governs only declaratory judgments approving proposed changes in voting procedure.  Other courts may decide the distinct question of whether a proposed change is subject to the Act.  <em>See Allen v. State Board of Elections,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/case.html">393 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  We need not resolve that question in this case, however, because respondents\' state suit fell within neither of these categories.  Instead, respondents\' initial suit was an action to compel compliance with a forgotten state law. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Nothing in \xc2\xa7 5 or \xc2\xa7 12 negates the presumption that, at least when the issue arises collaterally, state courts may decide whether a proposed change in election procedure requires preclearance under \xc2\xa7 5.</p>\n<p>The policies of the Act support the same result.

Fearing that covered jurisdictions would exercise their ingenuity to devise new and subtle forms of discrimination, Congress prohibited those jurisdictions from implementing any change in voting procedure without obtaining preclearance under \xc2\xa7 5.  Granting state courts the power to decide, as a collateral matter, whether \xc2\xa7 5 applies to contemplated changes in election procedures will help insure compliance with the preclearance scheme.

It is immaterial that the change sought by respondents derives from a statute that predates the Voting Rights Act, because \xc2\xa7 5 comes into play whenever a covered jurisdiction departs from an election procedure that was "<em>in fact</em> <em>in force or effect\' . . . on November 1, 1964."  <em>Perkins v.

We held only last Term that \xc2\xa7 5 applies to any change "reflecting the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people," even if a judicial decree constrains those choices.  <em>McDaniel v.

Although McDaniel involved a reapportionment plan drafted pursuant to a federal court\'s order, its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 5 is equally instructive here.  When state or local officials comply with a court order to enforce a state statute, there is no doubt that their actions "reflec[t] the policy choices of . . . elected representatives."  Indeed, if \xc2\xa7 5 did not encompass this situation, covered jurisdictions easily could evade the statute by declining to implement new state statutes until ordered to do so by state courts.  <em>Cf.

S. 151</a></span> (noting that "if covered jurisdictions could avoid the normal preclearance procedure by awaiting litigation challenging a refusal to redistrict after a census is completed, [\xc2\xa7 5] might have the unintended effect of actually encouraging delay in making obviously needed changes in district boundaries").  In light of <em>McDaniel,</em> we conclude that a state court decree directing compliance with a state election statute contemplates "administ[ration]" of the state statute within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 5.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents do not claim that Mississippi law restricts the state courts\' power to decide questions related to \xc2\xa7 5.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>We frequently permit state courts to decide "collaterally" issues that would be reserved for the federal courts if the cause of action arose directly under federal law.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/358/case.html">422 U. S. 358</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/358/case.html#373">422 U. S. 373</a></span>-374, n. 6 (1975).  Common notions of collateral estoppel suggest that the state proceedings similarly would not bind other interested persons who did not participate in them.  <em>See</em> Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa7 68 (Tent. Draft No. 4, Apr. 15, 1977).  Persons dissatisfied with a state court\'s collateral resolution of a \xc2\xa7 5 issue in proceedings involving other parties, therefore, are likely to be able to litigate the issue anew in federal court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>Our holding does not prevent state courts from attempting to accommodate both state and federal interests.  A state court, for example, might adopt the approach followed by the Chancery Court in this case, and order the parties to submit the proposed relief to the Attorney General.  If the Attorney General registers an objection, the court might then order the parties to seek a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, since the Attorney General objected only to the runoff procedure, the District Court simply might void the results of any runoff elections, permitting the candidates who gathered a plurality of votes in the general election to take those seats.  We, of course, intimate no view on the best form of relief, leaving that matter to the District Court\'s discretion.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The provisions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5, 12(f), and 14(b) of the Voting Rights Act, referred to in the opinion of the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/255/case.html#265">457 U. S. 265</a></span>-268, convince me that Congress did not intend the state courts to play a role in the enforcement of that Act.  In <em>Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html">453 U. S. 473</a></span> (1981), upon which the Court heavily relies for its contrary conclusion, we said:</p>\n<p>"The factors generally recommending exclusive federal court jurisdiction over an area of federal law include the desirability of uniform interpretation, the expertise of federal judges in federal law, and the assumed greater hospitality of federal courts to peculiarly federal claims."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#483">453 U. S. 483</a></span>-484 (footnotes omitted).  It seems to me that each of these factors counsels in favor of exclusive federal court jurisdiction, and I do not understand the Court to contend otherwise.</p>\n<p>From a practical point of view, I think the Court\'s decision is bound to breed conflicts between the state courts and the federal district courts sitting within the States, each of which may now determine whether or not a particular voting change must be precleared with the Attorney General before being enforced in a covered jurisdiction.  Indeed, the precursor of such conflict may well be found in the Court\'s concluding observations that the District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, in which the United States has pending a suit pertaining to the change involved in this case, should proceed to make determinations under the Voting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="272">Page 457 U. S. 272</a></p><p> Rights Act before the state court whose judgment we are reviewing renders further remedy in this case.  Exactly what is to be left to the States under this construction is more than a little problematical.</p>\n<p>I do not think that the goals of the Voting Rights Act will be materially advanced by the Court\'s somewhat tortured effort to make the state courts a third line of enforcement for the Act, after the District Court for the District of Columbia and other federal district courts.  The principal effect of today\'s decision will be to enable one or the other of parties such as those involved in this case, neither of whom were intended to be primary beneficiaries of the Voting Rights Act, to employ the Act as another weapon in their arsenal of litigation strategies.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
