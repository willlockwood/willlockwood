It was final as to them and their rights, and it was final also so far as the claimants and their rights are concerned as to the United States.  It left nothing to be litigated between these parties.  It awarded execution in favor of the libellants against the claimants.</p>\n<p>We think that such a decree in a prize cause must be regarded as final within the meaning of the Judiciary Acts, and that we have jurisdiction of the appeal from it.</p>\n<p>The appeals in <em>The Bermuda Case</em> and in the case of <em>The Alexander Cotton,</em> were of the same character with that now before us.  In neither of these cases had all matters arising upon the libel and the claims been finally disposed of.  In the first the appeal was by claimants of part of the property libeled, whose claims has been dismissed and the property claimed by them condemned.  In the other the appeal was by the United States from a decree of restitution in favor of a claimant of part of the property libeled, in the same consolidated cause from a decree in which, against another claimant, the appeal which we are now asked to dismiss was taken.</p>\n<p>It is true that in the cases just referred to no question of jurisdiction was made at the bar, but it existed necessarily in each cause, and was practically determined in favor of the jurisdiction, and, as we still think, rightly determined.</p>\n<p>The motion to dismiss is therefore denied.</p>\n<p>The motion to dismiss the appeal in <em>Le More v. United</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="822">Page 72 U. S. 822</a></p><p> <em>States</em> depends on like facts and the same principles with that just decided, and must also be denied.</p>\n<p>MR.
