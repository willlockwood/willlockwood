Among the bills, two were protested for nonacceptance, and two for nonacceptance and nonpayment.

It was further proved that the mail which left Washington on the 8th of the same month, arrived at New York at 35 minutes past 10 o\'clock A.M. on the 10th.  It was also proved that the said agent received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, dated at Washington, May 8th, 1815, directing him to give notice of the nonpayment of the second set of bills of exchange to the drawer and endorsers, and that they were notified on the 12th of the same month.

The letter of 7 December, 1814, must be considered as having been written on that day, and ought to have been put into the post office to come by the mail of the 8th, and, if so, it would have reached New York on the morning of the 10th.  That the letter of 8 May, 1815, should have been put into the post office to come by the mail of the 9th, and would have reached New York the morning of the 11th.

CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>That whatever doubts might be entertained as to the charge of the court below relating to the transactions in England (which it has not been though necessary to state) in respect to the protest and transmission of the bills, we think there is none as to what took place after their arrival at the Treasury of the United States.  The question was whether notice of the dishonor of the bills was transmitted to the party within the time prescribed by the general law in respect to bills of exchange.  The court was of opinion that there was negligence either at Washington or New York as to giving such notice, and that the notice actually given was too late to fix him with the responsibility.  The letter from the Treasury Department giving the notice was either not sent in due course of mail to New York or there was negligence at New York in not giving notice there as early as it should have been given after the letter arrived at that city.  Whether, therefore, the judge erred or not as to the first part of his charge in respect to the transmission of the bills from England in a reasonable time, there was no doubt that the United States had no right to recover on account of the neglect in giving due notice after the return of the bills.</p>\n<p>Upon this ground, the judgment of the circuit court was</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
