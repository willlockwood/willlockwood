In 1967, petitioner made a contract with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to provide scientific and management services to the United States in connection with the construction, alteration, and repair of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a high-energy physics research facility located in Kane and Du Page Counties, Ill.  Effective April, 1972, this contract was modified to provide that petitioner also would furnish personnel to administer and operate the Fermi Laboratory.  The contract was later assumed in turn by the AEC\'s successors, the Energy Research and Development Agency (ERDA) and the Department of Energy (DOE). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>At all relevant times, the funding for the Fermi Laboratory was supplied entirely by the United States through the AEC.  The contract, which tracked AEC procurement regulations, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] specified the rates of compensation to be paid certain classifications of employees; in addition, petitioner was required to obtain approval from the AEC prior to adopting new classifications of employees or making any changes in employee compensation.</p>\n<p>Article XXXIII of the contract expressly stated that it was not contemplated that petitioner would use its own employees to perform work that the AEC determined to be subject to the Act; such work, if any, was to be procured by subcontracts approved by the AEC and containing Davis-Bacon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="763">Page 450 U. S. 763</a></p><p> stipulations. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In a letter dated January 23, 1968, from the AEC to petitioner, the AEC stated that Art. XXXIII was included in the contract with the understanding that the contract would be modified to incorporate Davis-Bacon stipulations "[i]f presently unforeseen conditions" arose making it necessary that Davis-Bacon work be performed by petitioner with its own employees. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Another letter, dated April 6, 1972, with identical provisions was sent to petitioner by the AEC following the modification of the contract in 1972.  App. 63.  In order to implement Art. XXXIII, a committee of AEC officials was designated to review specific work projects and to make Davis-Bacon Act coverage determinations as was necessary. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 450 U. S. 764</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In April, 1975, respondent Stanley E. Coutu, a former employee of petitioner, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Tllinois on behalf of himself and other mechanics and laborers similarly situated, seeking more than $5 million in damages on the theory that petitioner had violated the Davis-Bacon Act by failing to pay prevailing wages for construction work performed by its employees under the contract with the AEC.  Respondent had been employed by petitioner as an electronics technician from Septembcr 25, 1372, ulltil September 10, 1975.  During that time, he was compensated in accordance with the wage schedules for the "technician" classification set forth in the contract.  Respondent\'s duties involved monitoring computers, providing assistance to scientific personnel. supervising accelerator operation, and recordkeeping.  He also would make minor repairs to malfunctioning equipment, assemble prefabricated items, and assist in connecting power sources to experimental equipment.  Respondent\'s supervisors typically were high-rated technicians, engineers, and physicists.  Respondent\'s complaint was in seven counts.  The first alleged that petitioner had failed to pay</p>\n<p>"the minimum wages </p><p><a class="page-number" name="765">Page 450 U. S. 765</a></p><p> required to be paid pursuant to the said contract and the prevailing wage determinations of the Secretary of Labor and the Davis-Bacon Act."</p>\n<p>App. 4.  The second alleged that the contract was within the purview of the Davis-Bacon Act and that the contract, by its terms, provided for payment "at the legal wage rate applicable to the work actually performed."  <em>Id.</em> at 7.  The remaining counts rested on common law bases, for which pendent federal jurisdiction was asserted.</p>\n<p>On October 8, 1975, the District Court dismissed respondent\'s first cause of action on the ground that it was not "totally borne out" by the contract.  <em>Id.</em> at 22.  The court, however, denied petitioner\'s motion to dismiss the second count and the pendent claims.  It relied on the Seventh Circuit\'s first decision in<em> McDaniel v. Universty of Chicago,</em> 512 F.2d 583 (<em>McDaniel I</em>), <em>vacated and remanded,</em> 423 U.S. 810 (1975),<em>j udgment reentered on remand,</em> 548 F.2d 689 (1977) (<em>McDaniel II</em>), <em>cert. denied,</em> 434 U.S. 1033 (1978).  <em>McDaniel I</em> held that the Davis-Bacon Act conferred an implied private right of action upon an employee seeking to enforce a contractor\'s commitment to pay prevailing wages. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="766">Page 450 U. S. 766</a></p><p> Court reasoned that the AEC letter of April 6, 1972, interpreting Art. XXXIII of the contract left open the possibility that petitioner\'s employees had performed work covered by the Act pursuant to proper determinations by the AEC.  The court accordingly gave respondent</p>\n<p>"leave to show that the Secretary of Labor through [AEC] has made Davis-Bacon Act determinations with respect to the alleged contract, and that [respondent] and the class have performed such work at [petitioner\'s] direction, pursuant to the contract."</p>\n<p>App. 25.</p>\n<p>After discovery, petitioner moved for summary judgment.  In support of its motion, petitioner submitted an affidavit of the chief legal counsel for the Fermi Laboratory which stated that</p>\n<p>"[n]o Davis-Bacon Act . . . stipulations requiring the payment of prevailing wages have ever been made a part of or incorporated in [the] Contract."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 31-32.  The District Court noted that respondent "as much concedes that the contract fails to include Davis-Bacon specifications," and it found that "[o]n the present state of the record, it is clear that no Davis-Bacon Act determinations have been made a part of this contract."  <em>Id.</em> at 32-33.  After reviewing the statutory and regulatory framework of the Act, the court concluded that</p>\n<p>"it would be improper for this court to declare in the first instance that this contract is now subject to the Davis-Bacon Act and to make appropriate wage determinations for the parties."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 34.  The court therefore dismissed the second count and, "in the exercise of its discretion," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="767">Page 450 U. S. 767</a></p><p> <em>ibid.,</em> declined to assume jurisdiction over the pendent state law claims.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded the case.  595 F.2d 396 (1979).  That court recognized that the affidavit submitted by petitioner tended to disprove that there were express Davis-Bacon Act stipulations in the contract; it determined, however, that summary judgment on the second count was not appropriate, since</p>\n<p>"there may have been other evidence that the contract was one for Davis-Bacon Act work, in which case the required stipulations arguably become a part of the contract by operation of law."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 398.  Reasoning from its prior opinions in <em>McDaniel I</em> and <em>II,</em> the court concluded that</p>\n<p>"if the [petitioner] actually performed [Davis-Bacon Act] work with its own employees at the Fermi Laboratory, [respondent and his class] became entitled to the prevailing wages in Kane County where the work was to be performed."</p>\n<p>595 F.2d at 399.  After rejecting petitioner\'s alternative argument that exhaustion of administrative remedies was required, the court remanded the case to allow respondent the opportunity on remand to demonstrate, if he could, that petitioner had used respondent and his class to perform Davis-Bacon construction work at the Fermi Laboratory.  <em>Id.</em> at 402.</p>\n<p>Because of the importance of the implied right of action issue, we granted certiorari.  445-U.S. 925 (1980).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before us, petitioner makes two major arguments.  It contends first that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to make coverage, classification, or wage determinations under the Davis-Bacon Act.  Alternatively, petitioner contends that Congress did not intend that the Davis-Bacon Act be enforced through private actions.  Because we conclude that the Act does not confer a private right of action for back wages under a contract that administratively has been determined </p><p><a class="page-number" name="768">Page 450 U. S. 768</a></p><p> not to call for Davis-Bacon work, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] we find it unnecessary to reach the broacler question whether federal courts have any jurisdiction to review agency coverage and classification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 450 U. S. 769</a></p><p> determillation. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Similarly, we do not decide whether the Act creates an implied rivate right of action to enforce a contract that contains specific Davis-Bacon Act stipulations. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="770">Page 450 U. S. 770</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Relying on <em>McDaniel,</em> [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] respondent argues that it must be assumed that no statutory relief is available to him, and that therefore the implication of a private right of action is necessary to effectuate the purpose of Congress in passing the Act.  But as the Court\'s recent opinions have made clear, the question whether a statute creates a private right of action is ultimately</p>\n<p>"one of congressional intent, not one of whether this Court thinks that it can improve upon the statutory scheme that Congress enacted into law."</p>\n<p><em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v.

Section 1 of the Act states that the advertised specifications for every federal construction contract in excess of the specified amount "shall contain" a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid laborers and contractors, which wages shall be based on those the Secretary determines to be prevailing in the locality.  Section 1 further provides that "every contract based upon these specifications shall contain a stipulation" that the contractor shall pay wages "not less than those stated in the advertised specifications."</p>\n<p>The Court\'s previous opinions have recognized that, "[o]n its face, the Act is a minimum wage law designed for the benefit of construction workers."  <em>United States v.

But the fact that an enactment is designed to benefit a particular class does not end the inquiry; instead, it must also be asked whether the language of the statute indicates that Congress intended that it be enforced through private litigation.  <em>See Transamerica,</em> 444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html#17">444 U.

Conversely, it has noted that there "would be far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons" where Congress, rather than drafting the legislation "with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class," instead has framed the statute simply as a general prohibition or a command to a federal agency.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#690">441 U.

Section 1 of the Davis-Bacon Act requires that certain stipulations be placed in federal construction contracts for the benefit of mechanics and laborers, but it does not confer rights directly on those individuals.  Since \xc2\xa7 1 is simply "phrased as a directive to federal agencies engaged in the disbursement of public funds."  441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#693">441 U.

S. 773</a></p><p> language provides no support for the implication of a private remedy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, \xc2\xa7 3 of the Act demonstrates that,, in this context, as in others, "when Congress wished to provide a private damages remedy, it knew how to do so, and did so expressly."  <em>Touche Ross,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#572">442 U. S. 572</a></span>.  Under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act, the contracting agency is entitled to withhold "so much of accrued payments" as may be considered necessary to pay to laborers and mechanics the difference between "the rates of wages required by the contract" and the rates actually paid.  If the wages so withheld are insufficient to reimburse the laborers and mechanics, then \xc2\xa7 3 confers on them the same "right of action and/or intervention" conferred by the Miller Act on laborers and materialmen.  The absence of a comparable provision authorizing a suit for back wages where there are no prevailing wage stipulations in the contract buttresses our conclusion that Congress did not intend to create such a remedy. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history of the Davis-Bacon Act provides further support for the result we reach.  The Act was "designed to protect local wage standards by preventing contractors from basing their bids on wages lower than those prevailing in the area."  House Committee on Education and Labor, Legislative History of the Davis-Bacon Act, 87th </p><p><a class="page-number" name="774">Page 450 U. S. 774</a></p><p> Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (Comm.Print 1962) (Legislative History).  Passage of the Act was spurred by the ecoomic conditions of the early 1930\'s, which gave rise to an oversupply of labor and increased the importance of federal building programs, since private construction was limited.  <em>See</em> Thieblot, at 7; Elisburg, Wage Protection Under the Davis-Bacon Act, 28 Lab.L.J. 323, 324 (1977); S.Rep. No. 1445, 71st Cong., 3d Sess., 1 (1931).  In the words of Representative Bacon, the Act was intended to combat the practice of</p>\n<p>"certain itinerant, irresponsible contractors, with itinerant, cheap, bootleg labor, [who] have been going around throughout the country \'picking\' off a contact here and a contract there."</p>\n<p>The purpose of the bill was "simply to give local labor and the local contractor a fair opportunity to participate in this building program."  74 Cong.Rec. 6510 (1931). [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>As originally enacted in 1931, ch. 411, 46 Stat 1494, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 450 U. S. 775</a></p><p> Act required that every federal contract in excess of $5,000 in amount for "construction, alteration, and/or repair of any public buildings" contain a provision stating that the rate of wages paid laborers and mechanics would not be less than the prevailing rate for similar work in the locality; the Act further required that every contract contain a provision stating that disputes as to what the prevailing wage  as on any given project were to be conclusively determined by the Secretary if the contracting officer was unable to resolve the controversy.  The original Act thus did not provide for predetermination of prevailing wages by the Secretary; it also did not establish any enforcement mechanism. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress soon concluded however, that the Act as originally drafted was inadequate.  Discontent focused on the lack of effective enforcement provisions and the "postdetermination" of the prevailing wage.  Legislative History 2.  Contractors called for predetermination of prevailing wages, claiming that they had been put to unexpected expense by postcontract determinations that the prevailing wage was higher than the rate upon which they had based their hids.  <em>Ibid.;</em> Hearings on H.R. 12 <em>et al.</em> before the House Committee on Labor, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 8, 12, 14 50-51, 54-55, 58, 65 (1932).  While the labor movement was divided on this issue, most of the national leadership opposed predetermination.  Legislative History 2.  <em>See</em> 75 Cong.Rec. 12379 (1932) (remarks of Rep. Ramspeck); Hearings on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="776">Page 450 U. S. 776</a></p><p> H.R. 12, at 24, 114, 116, 122-123.  Labor was united, however, in calling for the establishment of an enforcement mechanism.  Legislative History 2.  <em>See</em> Hearings on H.R. 12, at 122-123; 75 Cong.Rec. 12379 (1932) (remarks of Rep. Ramspeck).</p>\n<p>In 1932, both Houses of Congress passed an amendment to the Act providing for predetermination of prevailing wages by the Secretary and for penalties for failure to pay the rate "stated in the advertised specifications and made a part of the contract."  <em>See</em> S. 3847, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932).  The bill, however, was vetoed by the President.  <em>See</em> Veto Message, S. Doc. No. 134, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932).  But in 1935, Congress succeeded in adding the predetermination and enforcement provisions found in the current statute.  Act of Aug. 30, 1935, 49 Stat. 1011.</p>\n<p>The legislative history accompanying these amendments is significant in two respects.  First, it indicates that Congress amended the Act to provide for predetermination of wages not only in order to end abuses, [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] but "so that the contractor may know definitely in advance of submitting his bid what his approximate labor costs will be."  S.Rep. No. 1155, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1935); H.R.Rep. No. 1756, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1935).  Second, it demonstrates that Congress intended to give laborers and mechanics only "the same right of action against the contractor and his sureties in court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="777">Page 450 U. S. 777</a></p><p> which is now conferred by the bond tatute."  S.Rep. No. 1155, at 2; H.R.Rep. No. 1756, at 2. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  To imply a private right of action here would be to defeat each of these congressional objectives.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the 1964 amendment to the Act also cuts against respondent\'s position.  In 1964, Congress considered and passed H.R. 6041, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., a bill to amend the Act in order to include fringe benefits within the definition of wages.  Pub.L. 88-349, \xc2\xa7 1, 78 Stat. 238.  While H.R. 6041 was under consideration, Representative Goodell introduced a bill that would have amended the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="778">Page 450 U. S. 778</a></p><p> Act to provide for judicial review of the Secretary\'s wage determinations at the behest of any aggrieved person, and that also would have conferred a private right of action on any laborer or mechanic who claimed that his employer had "refused or failed to pay the wages that he is required to pay by reason of a wage determination issued by the Secretary of Labor."  H.R. 9590, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7 2, p. 4 (1964).  Representative Goodell sought to have the substance of H.R. 9590 considered during the House debate on H.R. 6041.  After extended debate on the merits of judicial review of Davis-Bacon determinations, however, the House invoked its rule against nongermane amendments, and therefore refused to consider Mr. Goodell\'s proposals. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  110 Cong.Rec. 1194-1204 (1964).</p>\n<p>Since the Goodell amendments were not defeated on their merits, it cannot be said that Congress has flatly rejected the proposition that judicial review should be available under the Act.  Nor can the views of this later Congress be treated as determinative of the question whether the Act\'s drafters intended to preclude any form of judicial review.  Nonetheless, we think it significant that both the proponents and opponents of the Goodell amendments assumed that the Act did not contemplate judicial review of determinations made by the Secretary; they differed only over whether the Act should be amended to permit such review.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Further, although much of the debate centered on the desirability of permitting judiciai review of wage determinations, [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] respondent errs in contending that that was the sole topic of discussion, for several speakers expressed their view that the Act did not permit judicial review of any determination under the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 450 U. S. 779</a></p><p> Act whatsoever. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  In particular, Representative Bell pointed out that workers could not seek judicial review of the Secretary\'s determination that certain work was "<em>the installation of equipment,\' and not the type of construction work which was subject to Davis-Bacon," and "neither employers nor employees have any recourse except to beg the mercy of the Secretary or prevail upon their Congressman to intercede." [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] <em>Id.</em> at 1201-1202.  Thus, while not dispositive, the debate on the Goodell amendments reinforces the conclusion that it </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="780">Page 450 U. S. 780</a></em></p><p><em> would be inappropriate for this Court to find that the Act implicitly creates the right of action contended for here.\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent, however, asserts that a contrary inference must be drawn from the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 84, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 251 <em>et seq.</em>   Relying on the analysis set forth in <em>McDaniel II,</em> 548 F.2d at 694, respondent points out that \xc2\xa7 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 61 Stat. 87, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 255(a), imposes a 2-year limitation on any cause of action for nonwillful "unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime compensation, or liquidated damages" under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 201 <em>et seq.,</em> the Walsh-Healey Act, 41 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 35 <em>et seq.,</em> or the Davis-Bacon Act.  Since the Miller Act imposes a 1-year limitation on suits on the contractor\'s bond, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 270b(b), respondent contends that the 2-year statute of limitations set forth in the Portal-to-Portal Act not only affirms the existence of a private cause of action under the Act, but excludes the proposition that that cause of action is limited to a suit on the Miller Act bond.</p>\n<p>We agree with <em>amicus</em> United States, however, that this argument reads too much into the Portal-to-Portal Act.  That statute was intended to curtail the numerous suits for unpaid compensation and liquidated damages under the FLSA that were filed after this Court\'s decision in <em>Anderson v. Mount Clemens Pottery Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/680/case.html">328 U. S. 680</a></span> (1946).  <em>See Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/59/case.html">345 U. S. 59</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/59/case.html#61">345 U. S. 61</a></span> (1953).  Although no portal-to-portal suits had been filed under the Davis-Bacon or Walsh-Healey Acts, <em>see</em> 93 Cong.Rec. 2088 (1947) (remarks of Sens. Donnell and McGrath), Congress chose to include those statutes within the scope of the Portal-to-Portal Act on the ground that they, like the FLSA, related to minimum wages, and were therefore affected by the <em>Mount Clemens</em> decision.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 71, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1947); 93 Cong.Rec. 2088 (1947) (remarks of Sen. Donnell).  The legislative history of the bills that became the Portal-to-Portal Act makes clear, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 450 U. S. 781</a></p><p> that Congress simply did not recognize that it had created two incompatible statutes of limitations under the Davis-Bcon Act. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  Moreover, even if the Portal-to-Portal Act had been intended to create a longer statute of limitations for actions under the Davis-Bacon Act than that applicable to suits on the Miller Act bond, respondent has pointed to nothing in the legislative history of the Portal-to-Portal Act that suggests that Congress believed that the Davis-Bacon Act conferred a private right of action for back wages under a contract lacking prevailing wage stipulations; to the contrary, Congress\' concern was to foreclose the possibility of portal-to-portal suits for back vages under contracts that did contain Davis-Bacon Act provisions. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 450 U. S. 782</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, the underlying purpose of the legislative scheme indicates that Congress did not intend to create the right of action asserted by respondent.  As noted above, the 1935 amendments added two key features to the Act:  administrative predetermination of the minimum wages that the contractor must pay his laborers and mechanics, and a means whereby laborers and mechanics could recover back wages under a contract containing prevailing wage stipulations.  The Act thus carefully balances the interests of contractors and their employees.  The contractor is able to "know definitely in advance of submitting his bid what his approximate labor costs will be," [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] S.Rep. No. 1155, at 2, while the laborer or mechanic is given a right of action to enforce the stipulated wages.  To imply a private right of action to sue for Davis-Bacon wages under a contract that does not contain prevailing wage stipulations would destroy this careful balance.</p>\n<p>In addition, as petitioner and <em>amicus</em> United States point out, the implication of a private right of action where there has been no Davis-Bacon determination would introduce substantial uncertainty into Government contracting.  In the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 450 U. S. 783</a></p><p> case of cost-plus contracts, federal budgeting would be disrupted by a postcontract judicial determination that wages higher than those set forth in the contract ust be paid.  Fixed-price contracting also would be adversely affected, since it is likely that contractors would submit inflated bids to take into account the possibility that they would have to pay wages higher than those set forth in the specifications. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Finally, post-contract challenges would disrupt timely and efficient performance of Government contracts, and might well provoke jurisdictional disputes between construction unions and unions representing nonconstruction workers. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>The implication of a private right of action here would undercut as well the elaborate administrative scheme promulgated pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 14.  The goal of that plan was to introduce consistency into the administration and enforcement of the Act and related statutes; to that end, the Secretary and contracting agencies have issued detailed regulations governing, among other things, coverage determinations.  The uniformity fostered by those regulations would be short-lived if courts were free to make post-contract coverage rulings.  Respondent, however, replies that no administrative functions would be disrupted by judicial intervention, since Davis-Bacon stipulations are incorporated by operation of law into every federal construction contract, regardless of whether the contracting agency has made a coverage determination.  But this assertion ignores the fact </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 450 U. S. 784</a></p><p> that the Act does not define the terms "construction, alteration, and/or repair," "public buildings or public works," and "mechanics and/or laborers." [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  A number of commentators have noted the difficulty of determining whether particular work constitutes "construction" within the meaning of the Act, particularly when the work is performed in the context of an AEC contract involving a nuclear facility. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Like other contracting agencies, AEC and its successors have developed detailed guidelines for determining whether particular work is covered by the Act.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F15" name="T15">n</a> 15, <em>supra.</em>  Whatever may be the merits of allowing judicial review of these complex coverage determinations prior to contracting, it clearly would be inappropriate for a court to substitute its judgment for that of the contracting agency in a private action brought after the contract was let.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In sum, to imply a private right of action under these circumstances would severely disrupt federal contracting.  Nothing in the language, history, or purpose of the Davis-Bacon Act suggests that Congress intended that result.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 1(a) reads:</p>\n<p>"(a) The advertised specifications for every contract in excess of $2,000, to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party, for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public works of the United States or the District of Columbia within the geographical limits of the States of the Union, or the District of Columbia, and which requires or involves the employment of mechanics and/or laborers shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics which shall be based upon the wages that will be determined by the Secretary of Labor to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the city, town, village, or other civil subdivision of the State, in which the work is to be performed, or in the District of Columbia if the work is to be perfolmed there; and every contract based upon these specifications shall contain a stipulation that the contractor or his subcontractor shall pay all mechanics and laborers employed directly upon the site of the work, unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, the full amounts accrued at time of payment, computed at wage rates not less than those stated in the advertised specifications, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor or subcontractor and such laborers and mechanics, and that the scale of wages to be paid shall be posted by the contractor in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work; and the further stipulation that there may be withheld from the contractor so much of accrued payments as may be considered necessary by the contracting officer to pay to laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the difference between the rates of wages required by the contract to be paid laborers and mechanics on the work and the rates of wages received by such laborers and mechanics and not refunded to the contractor, subcontractors, or their agents."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Act also applies to contracts entered into without advertising for proposals, if the Act would be otherwise applicable.

In <em>McDaniel,</em> however, the plaintiff alleged that the contract contained prevailing wage stipulations, and, for the purpose of the summary judgment motion, the defendant did not deny that allegation.  <em>See</em> 512 F.2d at 584; 548 F.2d at 695.  Defendant also did not contravene the plaintiff\'s allegation that the express remedies provided by the Act were unavailable.  512 F.2d at 587.  Assuming these facts to be true, the Court of Appeals held in <em>McDaniel I</em> that, inasmuch as the statutory remedies provided in the Act had proved ineffective, "we should be especially <em>alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose,\'" <em>ibid.,</em> quoting <em>J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/426/case.html">377 U. S. 426</a></span> (1964).  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint stated a cause of action under the Act.\n</em></p>\n<p>This Court subsequently granted certiorari, and vacated and remanded <em>McDaniel I</em> for reconsideration in the light of <em>Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/412/case.html">421 U. S. 412</a></span> (195), and <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span> (1975).  On remand, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its earlier opinion, again stressing that</p>\n<p>"the plaintiffs-appellants allege that the government contract with appellee <em>did</em> contain the prevailing wage requirement, and appellee does not deny it."</p>\n<p>548 F.2d at 695 (emphasis in original).  Thereafter, defendant petitioned for certiorari; as indicated in the text, certiorari was denied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent contends tht the isssue of an implied right of action under the Act was not raised in the District Court and the Court of appeals, and that, therefore, it is not properly before this Court.  In addition, he asserts that the AEC viewed this contract as one covered by the Act, and thus that the case does not present the question whether the Act confers an implied right of action on an employee under a contract that has been predetermined administratively not to call for Davis-Bacon work.  We find both contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p>First, our reading of the record leads us to conclude that the question we decide today was raised and passed upon by the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  In its answer to the complaint, petitioner alleged as an affirmative defense that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because of respondent\'s failure to allege a contract containing Davis-Bacon provisions or wage stipulations.  App. 17.  In opposition to petitioner\'s motion for summary judgment, respondent argued that the absence of Davis-Bacon Act stipulations in the contract was itself a violation of the Act that should not serve to shield petitioner from the implied right ot action found in <em>McDaniel.</em>  App. 32.  In ruling upon petitioner\'s motion for summary judgment, the District Court characterized the issue as</p>\n<p>"whether plaintiff class can proceed in this ation under the Davis-Bacon Act absent any showing that the government and [petitioner] have made a determination that the contract is subject to the Act\'s provisions."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 33.  Finally, the Court of Appeals stated:  "Our decision in the preent case flows directly from the <em>McDaniel</em> opinions," which, the court noted, had held that "employees have an implied right of action to sue for wages under the Act."  595 F.2d at 397.  "[C]omplications" arose "only from the procedural posture" of this case and from petitioner\'s "renewed attempt to establish an exhaustion requirement."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We are similarly unconvinced by respondent\'s contention that the contracting agency viewed the contract as one covered by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Respondent points out that Art. XXXIII of the contract states that the Davis-Bacon work is to be subcontracted, and that the AEC letters construing that clause stipulate that, if petitioner\'s employees do perform Davis-Bacon work, the contract will be modified to include Davis-Bacon Act determinations.  But rather than showing that the AEC considered this contract to be one for Davis-Bacon Act work, these provisions demonstrate precisely the opposite.  Since the District Court found that the contract was not modified to include Davis-Bacon stipulations, it is clear that the contracting agency did not view the contract as covered by the Act.  Thus, this case presents the issue that was not raised in <em>McDaniel I</em> and <em>II.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>As noted above, it is settled that the correctness of wage determinations of the Secretary are not subject to judicial review.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Compare McDaniel</em> (Act confers implied private right of action to enforce prevailing wage stipulations) <em>with United States ex rel.

Further, we note that there is some question whether that isue is properly before us in light of the following colloquy at oral argument:</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Mr. Mann [attorney for petitioner], could I just be sure I understand your position.  Assume here there had been a predetermination that some part of the construction work on the laboratory would be covered by Davis-Bacon.  And the laboratory did not pay those -- and it was performed by their own people.  And supposing an employee didn\'t know about that till the contract was performed and then he had gotten less than the Davis-Bacon Act provided, would he have, in your view of the law . . . , a private cause of action against your client for the difference between what he was paid and what he actually should have been paid?"</p>\n<p>"MR. MANN:  We have taken the position on that question . . . that there is under the Act no private right of action at all, even to recover under express provisions.  There may be a right of action in  a tate court, under a state common law theory of third-party beneficiary, but not in federal court, because there\'s no real federal question there; it\'s a contract question involved there.  So we\'ve taken the position that even if there were an express contract that there would not be  private right to go to court."</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Did you take that position in the 7th Circuit?"</p>\n<p>"MR. MANN:  . . .  [T]hat question was not asked in the 7th Circuit, and the issue was not actually before us."</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  But yoll didn\'t raise that in the 7th Circuit?"</p>\n<p>"MR. MANN:  That\'s correct."</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Or in the trial court?"</p>\n<p>"MR. MANN:  In the trial court, the question of the private right of action <em>per se</em> was raised in the context of the jurisdiction of the court to revise the contract.  That is, we didn\'t really address the issue whether, in general, there is a private right to enforce a specific clause, but whether there is a private right to obtain the court determination of the fundamental issues of coverage, of classification, of rate, that was the issue presented to the trial court."</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>McDaniel,</em> the Court of Appeals accepted as true respondent\'s allegation that no funds had been withheld by the Government contracting agency and that no Miller Act payment bond had been filed.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F16" name="T16">n</a> 16, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Given this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to consider the fourth <em>Cort</em> factor, <em>i.e.,</em> whether the cause of action is "one traditionally relegated to state law." <em>Cort v.

At the time of the 1935 amendments to the Davis-Bacon Act, it was well established that the failure to supply a contrnctor\'s bond did not give rise to a private right of action under the Heard Act.  <em>See United States ex rel. Zambetti v. American Fence Constr. Co.,</em> 15 F.2d 450 (CA2 1926); <em>Strong v. American Fence Constr. Co.,</em> 245 N.Y. 48, 156 N.E. 92 (1927).  In <em>Strong,</em> then Chief Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous court:</p>\n<p>"Congress has said that contractors shall be liable to materialmen and laborers in an amount to be made determinate by the giving of the bond.  The statutory liability, which, in turn, is inseparably linked to the statutory remedy, assumes the existence of a bond as an indispensable condition.  Till then, there is neither Federal jurisdiction nor any right of action that can rest upon the statute."</p>\n<p>While <em>Strong</em> held that laborers and materialmen might recover as third-party beneficiaries in state court if the contractor had breached a <em>promise</em> to provide a bond, <em>id.</em> at 93, it stressed that no cause of action existed under the Heard Act unless a bond in fact had been filed.  The Miller Act, which was originally passed by the same Contress that enacted the 1935 amendments to the Davis-Bacon Act, also has been so construed.  <em>See Harry F. Ortlip Co. of Pa. v. Alvey Ferguson Co.,</em> 223 F.Supp. 893, 894-895 (ED Pa. 1963); <em>Gallaher &amp; Speck, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</em> 226 F.2d 728, 731 (CA7 1955).  It would be anomalous to assume that Contress intended that the failure to include Davis-Bacon stipulations in a contract would give rise to a private cause of action when the failure to file the Heard Act bond had been held to confer no such right.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>The House subsequently defeated Representative Goodell\'s attempt to introduce amendments providing for judicial review of fringe benefits determinations.  110 Cong.Rec. 1227-1229 (1964).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., id.</em> at 1198 (remarks of Rep.

The report itself triggered disagreement between contractors\' associations and construction trade unions, on the one hand, and manufacturers and industrial unions, on the other.  BNA Dail Labor Pep. No. 51, pp. A-7 to A-10 (Mar. 14, 1962).  In response, the minority members of the House Labor Committee made clear they intended to sponsor an amendment to the Act that would provide for judicial review of coverage determinations.  <em>Id.</em> at A-11.  <em>See also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 308, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 23-29 (1963) (dissenting views).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T33" name="F33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>The Senate bill S. 70, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), would have amended only the FLSA "to exempt employers from liability for portal-to-portal wages."  S.Rep. No. 37, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947).  In contrast, the House bill, H.R. 2157, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), would have limited portal-to-portal actions under the Davis-Bacon Act and the Walsh-Healy Act as well.  The Senate Committee Report on H.R. 2157 acceeded to the wider coverage of the House bill; however, rather than adopting the 1-year limitations period set forth in H.R. 2157 -- which was compatible with the 1-year limitations period of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 270b(b) -- the Senate Committee Report retained the 2-year limitations period of S. 70.  S.Rep. No. 48, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 50-51 (1947).  The 2-year limitations period was recommended by the Conference Committee, H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 326, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 13-14 (1947), and was enacted.</p>\n<p>The Senate Report accompanying H.R. 2157, like the Senate debate that followed, suggests that Congress was not aware that it had created two inconsistent statutes of limitations under the Davis-Bacon Act.  The Senate Report erroneously stated that "there is no limitation provision in either the Walsh-Healey or the Bacon-Davis Acts."  S.Rep. No. 48, 80th Cong., 1st Sess, 42 (1947).  The same unfamiliarity with the Davis-Bacon Act was manifested during the debate on the bill.  Senator Donnell, who introduced the bill in the Senate, stated that the Davis-Bacon Act had not been mentioned in the Senate subcommittee hearings on the legislation.  93 Cong.Rec. 2124 (1947).  <em>See also id.</em> at 2250, 2253 (remarks of Sen. McGrath); <em>id.</em> at 2352-2353 (remarks of Sen. Barkley).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T34" name="F34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>McGrath argued that the 2-year statute of limitations was unfair to workers, since the</p>\n<p>"administrative procedures which are necessary to determine the validity of the workman\'s claim for back wages under the Davis-Bacon Act frequently take a considerable length of time which mav very easily run for a period of more than 2 years."</p>\n<p>93 Cong.Rec. 2252 (1947).  As the United States argues, Senator McGrath\'s statement strongly suggests that the limitations period of the Portal-to-Portal Act was designed to apply to the explicit statutory remedy set forth in the Davis-Bacon Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>It is clear, however, that the Secretary\'s prevailing wage determinations do not constitute a represent.ation that the "specified minima will in fact be the prevailing rates."  <em>United States v. Binghamton Constr. Co.,</em> 347 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/17/case.html">347 U. S. 17</a></span>.  The 1935 amendments were designed to prevent only a post-contract determination that the prevailing rate was higher than that on which the successful contractor had based his bid.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T36" name="F36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p>Significnntly, the Comptroller General had recommended that the original Act provide for predetermination of wages precisely because he "feared that contractors would inflate their bids to provide a reserve against higher post-determinations."   Legislative History 2.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T37" name="F37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>The history of the construction of missile sites during the early 1960\'s reveals that the inclusion of Davis-Bacon stipulations in a contract may give rise to a jurisdictionnl dispute.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F32" name="T32"> n</a> 32, <em>supra.</em>  Hearings on Work Stoppages Missile Bases, before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 13, 501, 584, 594 (1961).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T38" name="F38">Footnote 38</a>]</p>\n<p>Accordingly, as petitioner points out, respondent\'s reliance on cases such as <em>G.
