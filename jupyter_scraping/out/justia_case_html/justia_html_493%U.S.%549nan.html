After Bouknight violated the order\'s conditions, the court granted BCDSS\' petition to remove Maurice from her control and held her in civil contempt when she failed to produce the child as ordered.  Rejecting her subsequent claim that the contempt order violated the Fifth Amendment\'s guarantee against self-incrimination, the court stated that the contempt would be purged by the production of Maurice and was issued not because Bouknight refused to testify but because she failed to obey the production order.

We hold that she may not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Maurice M. is an abused child.  When he was three months old, he was hospitalized with a fractured left femur, and examination revealed several partially healed bone fractures and other indications of severe physical abuse.  In the hospital, respondent Bouknight, Maurice\'s mother, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 493 U. S. 552</a></p><p> was observed shaking Maurice, dropping him in his crib despite his spica cast, and otherwise handling him in a manner inconsistent with his recovery and continued health.  Hospital personnel notified Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS), petitioner in No. 88-1182, of suspected child abuse.  In February, 1987, BCDSS secured a court order removing Maurice from Bouknight\'s control and placing him in shelter care.  Several months later, the shelter care order was inexplicably modified to return Maurice to Bouknight\'s custody temporarily.  Following a hearing held shortly thereafter, the Juvenile Court declared Maurice to be a "child in need of assistance," thus asserting jurisdiction over Maurice and placing him under BCDSS\'s continuing oversight.  BCDSS agreed that Bouknight could continue as custodian of the child, but only pursuant to extensive conditions set forth in a court-approved protective supervision order.  The order required Bouknight to "cooperate with BCDSS," "continue in therapy," participate in parental aid and training programs, and "refrain from physically punishing [Maurice]."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a.  The order\'s terms were "all subject to the further Order of the Court."  <em>Id.</em> at 87a.  Bouknight\'s attorney signed the order, and Bouknight in a separate form set forth her agreement to each term.</p>\n<p>Eight months later, fearing for Maurice\'s safety, BCDSS returned to Juvenile Court.  BCDSS caseworkers related that Bouknight would not cooperate with them and had in nearly every respect violated the terms of the protective order.  BCDSS stated that Maurice\'s father had recently died in a shooting incident and that Bouknight, in light of the results of a psychological examination and her history of drug use, could not provide adequate care for the child.  App. 33-34.  On April 20, 1988, the Court granted BCDSS\'s petition to remove Maurice from Bouknight\'s control for placement in foster care.  BCDSS officials also petitioned for judicial relief from Bouknight\'s failure to produce Maurice or reveal where he could be found.  <em>Id.</em> at 36-39.  The petition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 493 U. S. 553</a></p><p> recounted that, on two recent visits by BCDSS officials to Bouknight\'s home, she had refused to reveal the location of the child or had indicated that the child was with an aunt whom she would not identify.  The petition further asserted that inquiries of Bouknight\'s known relatives had revealed that none of them had recently seen Maurice and that BCDSS had prompted the police to issue a missing persons report and referred the case for investigation by the police homicide division.  Also on April 20, the Juvenile Court, upon a hearing on the petition, cited Bouknight for violating the protective custody order and for failing to appear at the hearing.  Bouknight had indicated to her attorney that she would appear with the child, but also expressed fear that, if she appeared, the State would "snatch the child."  <em>Id.</em> at 42, 54.  The court issued an order to show cause why Bouknight should not be held in civil contempt for failure to produce the child.  Expressing concern that Maurice was endangered or perhaps dead, the court issued a bench warrant for Bouknight\'s appearance.  <em>Id.</em> at 51-57.</p>\n<p>Maurice was not produced at subsequent hearings.  At a hearing one week later, Bouknight claimed that Maurice was with a relative in Dallas.  Investigation revealed that the relative had not seen Maurice.  The next day, following another hearing at which Bouknight again declined to produce Maurice, the Juvenile Court found Bouknight in contempt for failure to produce the child as ordered.  There was and has been no indication that she was unable to comply with the order.  The court directed that Bouknight be imprisoned until she "purge[d] herself of contempt by either producing [Maurice] before the court or revealing to the court his exact whereabouts."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a.</p>\n<p>The Juvenile Court rejected Bouknight\'s subsequent claim that the contempt order violated the Fifth Amendment\'s guarantee against self-incrimination.  The court stated that the production of Maurice would purge the contempt and that</p>\n<p>"[t]he contempt is issued not because she refuse[d] to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 493 U. S. 554</a></p><p> testify in any proceeding . . . [but] because she has failed to abide by the Order of this Court, mainly [for] the production of Maurice M."</p>\n<p>App. 150.  While that decision was being appealed, Bouknight was convicted of theft and sentenced to 18 months\' imprisonment in separate proceedings.  The Court of Appeals of Maryland vacated the Juvenile Court\'s judgment upholding the contempt order.  <em>In re Maurice M.,</em> 314 Md. 391, 550 A.2d 1135 (1988).  The Court of Appeals found that the contempt order unconstitutionally compelled Bouknight to admit through the act of production "a measure of continuing control and dominion over Maurice\'s person" in circumstances in which "Bouknight has a reasonable apprehension that she will be prosecuted."  <em>Id.</em> at 403-404, 550 A.2d at 1141.  Chief Justice REHNQUIST granted BCDSS\'s application for a stay of the judgment and mandate of the Maryland Court of Appeals, pending disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari.  488 U.S. 11301 (1988) (in chambers).  We granted certiorari, 490 U.S. 1003 (1989), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Fifth Amendment provides that "No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."  U.S. Const., Amdt. 5.  The Fifth Amendment\'s protection "applies only when the accused is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is incriminating."  <em>Fisher v.

The courts below concluded that Bouknight could comply with the order through the unadorned act of producing the child, and we thus address that aspect of the order.  When the government demands that an item be produced, "the only thing compelled is the act of producing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 493 U. S. 555</a></p><p> the [item]."  <em>Fisher, supra,</em> 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#410">425 U.

The Fifth Amendment\'s protection may nonetheless be implicated because the act of complying with the government\'s demand testifies to the existence, possession, or authenticity of the things produced.  <em>See Doe II, supra,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/case.html#209">487 U.

But a person may not claim the Amendment\'s protections based upon the incrimination that may result from the contents or nature of the thing demanded.  <em>Doe I,</em> 465 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/605/case.html#612">465 U.

Bouknight therefore cannot claim the privilege based upon anything that examination of Maurice might reveal, nor can she assert the privilege upon the theory that compliance would assert that the child produced is in fact Maurice (a fact the State could readily establish, rendering any testimony regarding existence or authenticity insufficiently incriminating, <em>see Fisher, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#411">425 U. S. 411</a></span>).  Rather, Bouknight claims the benefit of the privilege because the act of production would amount to testimony regarding her control over and possession of Maurice.  Although the State could readily introduce evidence of Bouknight\'s continuing control over the child -- <em>e.g.,</em> the custody order, testimony of relatives, and Bouknight\'s own statements to Maryland officials before invoking the privilege -- her implicit communication of control over Maurice at the moment of production might aid the State in prosecuting Bouknight.</p>\n<p>The possibility that a production order will compel testimonial assertions that may prove incriminating does not, in all contexts, justify invoking the privilege to resist production.  <em>See infra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#556">493 U. S. 556</a></span>-558.  Even assuming that this limited testimonial assertion is sufficiently incriminating and "sufficiently testimonial for purposes of the privilege," <em>Fisher, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#411">425 U. S. 411</a></span>, Bouknight may not invoke the privilege to resist the production order because she has assumed custodial duties related </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 493 U. S. 556</a></p><p> to production and because production is required as part of a noncriminal regulatory regime.</p>\n<p>The Court has on several occasions recognized that the Fifth Amendment privilege may not be invoked to resist compliance with a regulatory regime constructed to effect the State\'s public purposes unrelated to the enforcement of its criminal laws.  In <em>Shapiro v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/1/case.html">335 U. S. 1</a></span> (1948), the Court considered an application of the Emergency Price Control Act and a regulation issued thereunder which required licensed businesses to maintain records and make them available for inspection by administrators.  The Court indicated that no Fifth Amendment protection attached to production of the "required records," which the "<em>defendant was required to keep, not for his private uses, but for the benefit of the public, and for public inspection.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/1/case.html">335 U.

The Court\'s discussion of the constitutional implications of the scheme focused upon the relation between the Government\'s regulatory objectives and the Government\'s interest in gaining access to the records in Shapiro\'s possession:\n</em></p>\n<p>"It may be assumed at the outset that there are limits which the Government cannot constitutionally exceed in requiring the keeping of records which may be inspected by an administrative agency and may be used in prosecuting statutory violations committed by the recordkeeper himself.  But no serious misgiving that those bounds have been overstepped would appear to be evoked when there is a sufficient relation between the activity sought to be regulated and the public concern so that the Government can constitutionally regulate or forbid the basic activity concerned, and can constitutionally require the keeping of particular records, subject to inspection by the Administrator."</p>\n<p>335 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/1/case.html#32">335 U.

Once Maurice was adjudicated a child in need of assistance, his care and safety became the particular object of the State\'s regulatory interests.  <em>See</em> 314 Md. at 404, 550 A.2d at 1141; Md.Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3-801(e), 3-804(a) (Supp. 1989); <em>see also</em> App. 105 ("This court has jurisdiction to require at all times to know the whereabouts of the minor child.  We asserted jurisdiction over that child in the spring of 1987 . . . ").  Maryland first placed Maurice in shelter care, authorized placement in foster care, and then entrusted responsibility for Maurice\'s care to Bouknight.  By accepting care of Maurice subject to the custodial order\'s conditions (including requirements that she cooperate with BCDSS, follow a prescribed training regime, and be subject to further court orders), Bouknight submitted to the routine operation of the regulatory system and agreed to hold Maurice in a manner consonant with the State\'s regulatory interests and subject to inspection by BCDSS.  <em>Cf. Shapiro v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/1/case.html">335 U. S. 1</a></span> (1948).  In assuming the obligations attending custody Bouknight "has accepted the incident obligation to permit inspection."  <em>Wilson,</em> 221 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/361/case.html#382">221 U.

The State imposes and enforces that obligation as part of a broadly directed, noncriminal regulatory regime governing children cared for pursuant to custodial orders.   <em>See</em> Md. Cts. of Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-802(a) (1984) (setting forth child protective purposes of subtitle, including "provid[ing] for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle"); <em>see also</em> Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-820(b), (c) (Supp.1989); <em>In re Jessica M.,</em> 312 Md. 93, 538 A.2d 305 (1988).</p>\n<p>Persons who care for children pursuant to a custody order, and who may be subject to a request for access to the child, are hardly a "<em>selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\'"  <em>Marchetti,</em> 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html#57">390 U.

The Juvenile Court may place a child within its jurisdiction with social service officials or "under supervision in his own home or in the custody or under the guardianship of a relative or other fit person, upon terms the court deems appropriate."  Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-820(c)(1)(i) (Supp.1989).  Children may be placed, for example, in foster care, in homes of relatives, or in the care of state officials.  <em>See, e.g., In re Jessica M., supra; In re Arlene G.,</em> 301 Md. 355, 483 A.2d 39 (1984); <em>Maryland Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Prince George\'s County Dept. of Social Services,</em> 47 Md.  App. 436, 423 A.2d 589 (1980).  Even when the court allows a parent to retain control of a child within the court\'s jurisdiction, that parent is not one singled out for criminal conduct, but rather has been deemed to be, without the State\'s assistance, simply "unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and his problems."  Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-801(e) (Supp.1989); <em>see In re Jertrude O.,</em> 56 Md.  App. 83, 466 A.2d 885 (1983), <em>cert. denied,</em> 298 Md. 309, 469 A.2d 863 (1984).  The provision that authorized the Juvenile Court\'s efforts to gain production of Maurice reflects this broad applicability.  <em>See</em> Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-814(c) (1984) ("If a parent, guardian, or custodian fails to bring the child before the court when requested, the court may issue a writ of attachment directing that the child be taken into custody and brought before the court.  The court may proceed against the parent, guardian, or custodian for contempt").  This provision "fairly may be said to be directed at . . . parents, guardians, and custodians who accept placement of juveniles in custody."  314 Md. at 418, 550 A.2d at 1148 (McAuliffe, J., dissenting).\n</em></p>\n<p>Similarly, BCDSS\'s efforts to gain access to children, as well as judicial efforts to the same effect, do not "focu[s] almost exclusively on conduct which was criminal."  <em>Byers,</em> 402 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html#454">402 U. S. 454</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).  Many orders will arise in circumstances entirely devoid of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 493 U. S. 561</a></p><p> criminal conduct.  Even when criminal conduct may exist, the court may properly request production and return of the child, and enforce that request through exercise of the contempt power, for reasons related entirely to the child\'s wellbeing and through measures unrelated to criminal law enforcement or investigation.  <em>See</em> Maryland Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-814(c) (1984).  This case provides an illustration:  concern for the child\'s safety underlay the efforts to gain access to and then compel production of Maurice.  <em>See</em> App. 33-39, 53-55, 150, 155-158; <em>see also</em> 314 Md. at 419, 550 A.2d at 1149 (McAuliffe, J., dissenting).  Finally, production in the vast majority of cases will embody no incriminating testimony, even if in particular cases the act of production may incriminate the custodian through an assertion of possession, the existence, or the identity of the child.  <em>Cf. Byers,</em> 402 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html#430">402 U. S. 430</a></span>-431; <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html#458">402 U. S. 458</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).  These orders to produce children cannot be characterized as efforts to gain some testimonial component of the act of production.  The government demands production of the very public charge entrusted to a custodian, and makes the demand for compelling reasons unrelated to criminal law enforcement and as part of a broadly applied regulatory regime.  In these circumstances, Bouknight cannot invoke the privilege to resist the order to produce Maurice.</p>\n<p>We are not called upon to define the precise limitations that may exist upon the State\'s ability to use the testimonial aspects of Bouknight\'s act of production in subsequent criminal proceedings.  But we note that imposition of such limitations is not foreclosed.  The same custodial role that limited the ability to resist the production order may give rise to corresponding limitations upon the direct and indirect use of that testimony.  <em>See Braswell,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/99/case.html#118">487 U.

Although Bouknight surrendered physical custody of her child during the pendency of the proceedings to determine whether Maurice was a "child in need of assistance" (CINA) within the meaning of the Maryland Code, \xc2\xa7 3-801(e), Maurice\'s placement in shelter care was only temporary, and did not extinguish her legal right to custody of her son.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 3-801(r).  When the CINA proceedings were settled, Bouknight regained physical custody of Maurice and entered into an agreement with the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS).  In that agreement, which was approved by the juvenile court, Bouknight promised, among other things, to "cooperate with BCDSS," App. 28, but she retained legal custody of Maurice.</p>\n<p>A finding that a child is in need of assistance does not by itself divest a parent of legal or physical custody, nor does it transform such custody to something conferred by the State.  <em>See, e.g., In re Jertrude O.,</em> 56 Md.  App. 83, 97-98, 466 A.2d 885, 893 (1983) (proving a child is a CINA differs significantly from proving that the parent\'s rights to legal and physical custody should be terminated).  Thus, the parent of a CINA continues to exercise custody because she is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 493 U. S. 566</a></p><p> the child\'s parent, not because the State has delegated that responsibility to her.  Although the State has obligations "[t]o provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children" who are in need of assistance, Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-802(a)(1) (1984), these duties do not eliminate or override a parent\'s continuing legal obligations similarly to provide for her child.</p>\n<p>In light of the statutory structure governing a parent\'s relationship to a CINA, Bouknight is not acting as a custodian in the traditional sense of that word, because she is not acting on behalf of the State.  In reality, she continues to exercise her parental duties, constrained by an agreement between her and the State.  That agreement, which includes a stipulation that Maurice was a CINA, allows the State, in certain circumstances, to intercede in Bouknight\'s relationship with her child.  It does not, however, confer custodial rights and obligations on Bouknight in the same way corporate law creates the custodial status of a corporate agent.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the rationale for denying a corporate custodian Fifth Amendment protection for acts done in her representative capacity does not apply to this case.  The rule for a custodian of corporate records rests on the well established principle that a collective entity, unlike a natural person, has no Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  <em>See Hale v. Henkel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/201/43/case.html">201 U. S. 43</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/201/43/case.html#69">201 U.

Because an artificial entity can act only through its agents, a custodian of such an entity\'s documents may not invoke her personal privilege to resist producing documents that may incriminate the entity, even if the documents may also incriminate the custodian.  <em>Wilson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/361/case.html">221 U.

Rather, they assume the rights, duties and privileges of the artificial entity or association of which they are agents or officers and they are bound by its obligations. . . .  And the official records and documents of the organization that are held by them <em>in a representative, rather than in a personal, capacity</em> cannot be the subject of the personal privilege against self-incrimination, even though production of the papers might tend to incriminate them personally."</p>\n<p>322 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/694/case.html#699">322 U. S. 699</a></span> (citations omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Jacqueline Bouknight is not the agent for an artificial entity that possesses no Fifth Amendment privilege.  Her role as Maurice\'s parent is very different from the role of a corporate custodian who is merely the instrumentality through whom the corporation acts.  I am unwilling to extend the collective entity doctrine into a context where it denies individuals, acting in their personal rather than representative capacities, their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision rests as well on cases holding that</p>\n<p>"the ability to invoke the privilege may be greatly diminished when invocation would interfere with the effective operation of a generally applicable, civil regulatory requirement."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#557">493 U. S. 557</a></span>.  The cases the Court cites have two common features:  they concern civil regulatory systems not primarily intended to facilitate criminal investigations, and they target the general public.   <em>See California v. Byers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html">402 U. S. 424</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html#430">402 U. S. 430</a></span>-431 (1971) (determining that a "hit and run" statute that required a driver involved in an accident to stop and give certain information was primarily civil).  In contrast, regulatory regimes that are directed at a "<em>selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities,\'" <em>Marchetti,</em> 390 U.S. at 57 (quoting <em>Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/70/case.html">382 U. S. 70</a></span>, 79 (1965)), do not result in a similar diminution of the Fifth Amendment privilege. </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 493 U. S. 568</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>1\n</em></p>\n<p>Applying the first feature to this case, the Court describes Maryland\'s juvenile protection scheme as "a broadly directed, noncriminal regulatory regime governing children cared for pursuant to custodial orders."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#559">493 U. S. 559</a></span>.  The Court concludes that Bouknight cannot resist an order necessary for the functioning of that system.  The Court\'s characterization of Maryland\'s system is dubious, and highlights the flaws inherent in the Court\'s formulation of the appropriate Fifth Amendment inquiry.  Virtually any civil regulatory scheme could be characterized as essentially noncriminal by looking narrowly or, as in this case, <em>solely</em> to the avowed noncriminal purpose of the regulations.  If one focuses instead on the practical effects, the same scheme could be seen as facilitating criminal investigations.  The fact that the Court holds Maryland\'s juvenile statute to be essentially noncriminal, notwithstanding the overlapping purposes underlying that statute and Maryland\'s criminal child abuse statutes, proves that the Court\'s test will never be used to find a relationship between the civil scheme and law enforcement goals significant enough to implicate the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The regulations embodied in the juvenile welfare statute are intimately related to the enforcement of state criminal statutes prohibiting child abuse, Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27, \xc2\xa7 35A (1987).  State criminal decisions suggest that information supporting criminal convictions is often obtained through civil proceedings and the subsequent protective oversight by BCDSS.  <em>See, e.g., Lee v. State,</em> 62 Md.App. 341, 489 A.2d 87 (1985).  <em>See also</em> 3 Code of Md.Regs. 07.02.07.08(A)(1) and 07.02.07.08(C)(1)(b) (1988) (requiring Social Services Administration to maintain a Child Abuse Central Registry and allowing law enforcement officials access to the Registry).  In this respect, Maryland\'s juvenile protection system resembles the revenue system at issue in <em>Marchetti,</em> which required persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers to provide certain information about their activities to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 493 U. S. 569</a></p><p> Federal Government.  Focusing on the effects of the regulatory scheme, the Court held that this revenue system was not the sort of neutral civil regulatory scheme that could trump the Fifth Amendment privilege.  Even though the Government\'s "principal interest [was] evidently the collection of revenue," 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html#57">390 U. S. 57</a></span>, the information sought would increase the "likelihood that any past or present gambling offenses [would] be discovered and successfully prosecuted," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html#52">390 U. S. 52</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In contrast to <em>Marchetti,</em> the Court here disregards the practical implications of the civil scheme and holds that the juvenile protection system does not "<em>focu[s] almost exclusively on conduct which was criminal.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#560">493 U. S. 560</a></span>(quoting <em>Byers, supra,</em> 402 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html#454">402 U. S. 454</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment)).  <em>See also Byers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/424/case.html#430">402 U. S. 430</a></span> (plurality opinion) (determining statute at issue to be "essentially regulatory, not criminal").  I cannot agree with this approach.  The State\'s goal of protecting children from abusive environments through its juvenile welfare system cannot be separated from criminal provisions that serve the same goal.  When the conduct at which a civil statute aims -- here, child abuse and neglect -- is frequently the same conduct subject to criminal sanction, it strikes me as deeply problematic to dismiss the Fifth Amendment concerns by characterizing the civil scheme as "unrelated to criminal law enforcement investigation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#561">493 U. S. 561</a></span>.  A civil scheme that <em>inevitably</em> intersects with criminal sanctions may not be used to coerce, on pain of contempt, a potential criminal defendant to furnish evidence crucial to the success of her own prosecution.\n</em></p>\n<p>I would apply a different analysis, one that is more faithful to the concerns underlying the Fifth Amendment.  This approach would target the respondent\'s particular claim of privilege, the precise nature of the testimony sought, and the likelihood of self-incrimination caused by this respondent\'s compliance.</p>\n<p>"To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 493 U. S. 570</a></p><p> which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result."</p>\n<p><em>Hoffman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html">341 U. S. 479</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#486">341 U.

S. 11</a></span>-12 (1964).  This analysis unambiguously indicates that Bouknight\'s Fifth Amendment privilege must be respected to protect her from the serious risk of self-incrimination.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#563">493 U. S. 563</a></span>-564.</p>\n<p>An individualized inquiry is preferable to the Court\'s analysis because it allows the privilege to turn on the concrete facts of a particular case, rather than on abstract characterizations concerning the nature of a regulatory scheme.  Moreover, this particularized analysis would not undermine any appropriate goals of civil regulatory schemes that may intersect with criminal prohibitions.  Instead, the ability of a State to provide immunity from criminal prosecution permits it to gather information necessary for civil regulation, while also preserving the integrity of the privilege against self-incrimination.  The fact that the State throws a wide net in seeking information does not mean that it can demand from the few persons whose Fifth Amendment rights are implicated that they participate in their own criminal prosecutions.  Rather, when the State demands testimony for its citizens, it should do so with an explicit grant of immunity.</p>\n<p><em>2\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s approach includes a second element; it holds that a civil regulatory scheme cannot override Fifth Amendment protection unless it is targeted at the general public.  Such an analysis would not be necessary under the particularized approach I advocate.  Even under the Court\'s test, however, Bouknight\'s right against self-incrimination should not be diminished because Maryland\'s juvenile welfare scheme clearly is <em>not</em> generally applicable.  A child is considered in need of assistance because</p>\n<p>"[h]e is mentally handicapped </p><p><a class="page-number" name="571">Page 493 U. S. 571</a></p><p> capped or is not receiving ordinary and proper care and attention, and . . . [h]is parents . . are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and his problems."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 3-801(e).  The juvenile court has jurisdiction only over children who are alleged to be in need of assistance, not over all children in the State.  <em>See</em> Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3-804(a) (Supp.1989).  It thus has power to compel testimony only from those parents whose children are alleged to be CINAs.  In other words, the regulatory scheme that the Court describes as "broadly directed," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#559">493 U. S. 559</a></span>, is actually narrowly targeted at parents who, through abuse or neglect, deny their children the minimal reasonable level of care and attention.  Not all such abuse or neglect rises to the level of criminal child abuse, but parents of children who have been so seriously neglected or abused as to warrant allegations that the children are in need of state assistance are clearly "a selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities."  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/549/case.html#567">493 U. S. 567</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the end, neither line of precedents relied on by the Court justifies riding roughshod over Bouknight\'s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.  The Court cannot accurately characterize her as a "custodian" in the same sense as the Court has used that word in the past.  Nor is she the State\'s "agent," whom the State may require to act on its behalf.  Moreover, the regulatory scheme at issue here is closely intertwined with the criminal regime prohibiting child abuse and applies only to parents whose abuse or neglect is serious enough to warrant state intervention.</p>\n<p>Although I am disturbed by the Court\'s willingness to apply inapposite precedent to deny Bouknight her constitutional right against self-incrimination, especially in light of the serious allegations of homicide that accompany this civil proceeding, I take some comfort in the Court\'s recognition that the State may be prohibited from using any testimony given by Bouknight in subsequent criminal proceedings.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 493 U.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Because I am not content to deny Bouknight the constitutional protection required by the Fifth Amendment now in the hope that she will not be convicted later on the basis of her own testimony, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court claims that the principle espoused in the collective entity cases was "extend[ed] well beyond the corporate context" in <em>Shapiro v.

S. 558</a></span>.  <em>Shapiro,</em> however, did not rest on the existence of an agency relationship between a collective entity and the custodian of its records.  Instead, the petitioner was denied the Fifth Amendment privilege because the records sought were kept as part of a generalized regulatory system that required all businesses, unincorporated as well as incorporated, to retain records of certain transactions.  <em>See</em> 335 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/1/case.html#22">335 U.

Although the statute applies only to testimony "in a criminal prosecution or a proceeding before a grand jury of the State," Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 9-123(b)(1) (Supp.1989), the State represented to this Court that</p>\n<p>"[a]s a matter of law, [granting limited use immunity for the testimonial aspects of Bouknight\'s compliance with the production order] would now be possible,"</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.
