The process through which these exhibits are put is called by some \'polishing;\' not polishing by means of rubbing, but it is done by friction, by the shaking of them up, by the rolling of the nails in the barrel.  The length of time they are rolled depends upon what color you want to get on them; sometimes an hour, sometimes two hours, and sometimes it takes longer.  I roll them until I get the color I want.

S. 376</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Upon this record, it is apparent that these nails did not fall within the first of the three paragraphs, as they are referred to in the evidence as made of sheet brass.  Counsel produced in argument some nails with wrought iron shanks and brass heads which he claimed were the same as those in question, but they were not before us as exhibits, and moreover appeared to be in the nature of brass ornamentation.</p>\n<p>Nor did the nails come within the second of the paragraphs, "Britannia ware, and plated and gilt articles and wares of all kinds," unless the principle of commercial designation could be properly applied, and such designation was made out, for we concur in the view that gilt articles and wares, taken in connection with Britannia and plated ware, mean articles actually gilded by overlaying, and not merely made to look gilt by rolling them in a secret chemical solution.  We are not prepared to hold that under such circumstances, this paragraph would be applicable, even if nails thus manipulated were commercially designated as "gilt nails," but if applicable, we are still of opinion that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p>It has just been held that the usage from which it may be inferred that Congress intended to use particular words in a particular sense in a tariff act must be definite, uniform, and general, and that such designation is to be determined as of the date of the act.  <em>Maddock v. Magone, ante,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/152/368/case.html">152 U. S. 368</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Tested by this rule, the evidence was entirely insufficient to show such a usage in respect of denominating this class of nails "gilt nails," contemporaneous with the Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>True, plaintiff testified that the articles "are known in trade and commerce as gilt nails, and are bought and sold as such," but his testimony on cross-examination practically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 152 U. S. 377</a></p><p> limited his personal knowledge of usage in the trade to his own practice.  He could not say that they were not bought and sold in trade and commerce as upholstery nails, and he admitted that they were sometimes so bought and sold as French, chair, and furniture nails.  The evidence of a definite, general, and uniform usage was so slight, if any at all, that a verdict based upon it would be set aside, and the circuit court committed no error in striking it out and in directing a verdict for defendant as to these particular nails.</p>\n<p>Something was said about the lack of precision in the motion "to strike out the testimony as to the fact that they were called <em>gilt nails\'" and the effect of not making it until the conclusion of the testimony of the witness, but as no further evidence was offered, the motion practically amounted to a demurrer to evidence, and if it was not sufficiently comprehensive, that was cured by the direction of the verdict.  The circuit court was right, and the judgment is\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY was not present at the argument, and took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
