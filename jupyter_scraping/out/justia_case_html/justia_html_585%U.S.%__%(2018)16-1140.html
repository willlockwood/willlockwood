The FACT Act requires clinics that primarily serve pregnant women to provide certain notices.  Clinics that are licensed must notify women that California provides free or low-cost services, including abortions, and give them a phone number to call.  Its stated purpose is to make sure that state residents know their rights and what health care services are available to them.  Unlicensed clinics must notify women that California has not licensed the clinics to provide medical services.  Its stated purpose is to ensure that pregnant women know when they are receiving health care from licensed professionals.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x94two crisis pregnancy centers, one licensed and one unlicensed, and an organization of crisis pregnancy centers\xe2\x80\x94filed suit.  They alleged that both the licensed and the unlicensed notices abridge the freedom of speech protected by the\n \nFirst Amendment.  The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Holding that petitioners could not show a likelihood of success on the merits, the court concluded that the licensed notice survived a lower level of scrutiny applicable to regulations of \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional speech,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the unlicensed notice satisfied any level of scrutiny.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The licensed notice likely violates the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Content-based laws \xe2\x80\x9ctarget speech based on its communicative content\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9care presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Town of Gilbert</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The licensed notice is a content-based regulation.  By compelling petitioners to speak a particular message, it \xe2\x80\x9calters the content of [their] speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i> v. <i>National Federation of Blind of N.\xc2\xa0C., Inc.</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 781, 795.  For example, one of the state-sponsored services that the licensed notice requires petitioners to advertise is abortion\xe2\x80\x94the very practice that petitioners are devoted to opposing.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Although the licensed notice is content-based, the Ninth Circuit did not apply strict scrutiny because it concluded that the notice regulates \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this Court has never recognized \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional speech\xe2\x80\x9d as a separate category of speech subject to different rules.  Speech is not unprotected merely because it is uttered by professionals.  The Court has afforded less protection for professional speech in two circumstances\xe2\x80\x94where a law requires professionals to disclose factual, noncontroversial information in their \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial speech,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <i>e.g., Zauderer</i> v. <i>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 626, 651, and where States regulate professional conduct that incidentally involves speech, see, <i>e.g</i>., <i>Ohralik</i> v. <i>Ohio State Bar Assn.</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447, 456.  Neither line of precedents is implicated here.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Unlike the rule in <i>Zauderer, </i>the licensed notice is not limited to \xe2\x80\x9cpurely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. services will be available,\xe2\x80\x9d 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 651.  California\xe2\x80\x99s notice requires covered clinics to disclose information about <i>state</i>-sponsored services\xe2\x80\x94including abortion, hardly an \xe2\x80\x9cuncontroversial\xe2\x80\x9d topic.  Accordingly, <i>Zauderer</i> has no application here.  P.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Nor is the licensed notice a regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have long drawn a line between speech and conduct.  In <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833, for example, the joint opinion rejected a free-speech challenge to an informed-consent law requiring physicians to \xe2\x80\x9cgive a woman certain information as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 884.  But the licensed notice is neither an informed-consent requirement nor any other regulation of professional conduct.  It applies to all interactions between a covered facility and its clients, regardless of whether a medical procedure is ever sought, offered, or performed.  And many other facilities providing the exact same services, such as general practice clinics, are not subject to the requirement.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0Outside of these two contexts, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have long protected the\n \nFirst Amendment rights of professionals.  The Court has applied strict scrutiny to content-based laws regulating the noncommercial speech of lawyers, see <i>Reed</i>, <i>supra, </i>at ___, professional fundraisers, see <i>Riley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 798, and organizations providing specialized advice on international law, see<i> Holder</i> v. <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  And it has stressed the danger of content-based regulations \xe2\x80\x9cin the fields of medicine and public health, where information can save lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552, 566.  Such dangers are also present in the context of professional speech, where content-based regulation poses the same \xe2\x80\x9crisk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or information,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622, 641.  When the government polices the content of professional speech, it can fail to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCullen</i> v. <i>Coakley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  Professional speech is also a difficult category to define with precision.  See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 786, 791.  If States could choose the protection that speech receives simply by requiring a license, they would have a powerful tool to impose \xe2\x80\x9cinvidious discrimination of disfavored subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cincinnati</i> v. <i>Discovery Network, Inc.</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410, 423, n.\xc2\xa019.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Although neither California nor the Ninth Circuit have advanced a persuasive reason to apply different rules to professional speech, the Court need not foreclose the possibility that some such reason exists because the licensed notice cannot survive even intermediate scrutiny.  Assuming that California\xe2\x80\x99s interest in providing low-income women with information about state-sponsored service is substantial, the licensed notice is not sufficiently drawn to promote it.  The notice is \xe2\x80\x9cwildly underinclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</i>, <i>supra, </i>at 802, because it applies only to clinics that have a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cproviding family planning or pregnancy-related services\xe2\x80\x9d while excluding several other types of clinics that also serve low-income women and could educate them about the State\xe2\x80\x99s services.  California could also inform the women about its services \xe2\x80\x9cwithout burdening a speaker with unwanted speech,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Riley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 800, most obviously through a public-information campaign.  Petitioners are thus likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The unlicensed notice unduly burdens protected speech.  It is unnecessary to decide whether <i>Zauderer</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>standard applies here, for even under <i>Zauderer, </i>a disclosure requirement cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cunjustified or unduly burdensome.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 651.  Disclosures must remedy a harm that is \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially real not purely hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ibanez</i> v. <i>Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136, 146, and can extend \xe2\x80\x9cno broader than reasonably necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>In re R. M. J.</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 191, 203.  California has not demonstrated any justification for the unlicensed notice that is more than \xe2\x80\x9cpurely hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only justification put forward by the state legislature was ensuring that pregnant women know when they are receiving medical care from licensed professionals, but California denied that the justification for the law was that women did not know what kind of facility they are entering when they go to a crisis pregnancy center.  Even if the State had presented a nonhypothetical justification, the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.  It imposes a government-scripted, speaker-based disclosure requirement that is wholly disconnected from the State\xe2\x80\x99s informational interest.  It requires covered facilities to post California\xe2\x80\x99s precise notice, no matter what the facilities say on site or in their advertisements.  And it covers a curiously narrow subset of speakers: those that primarily provide pregnancy-related services, but not those that provide, <i>e.g.,</i> nonprescription birth control.  Such speaker-based laws run the risk that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State has left unburdened those speakers whose messages are in accord with its own views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sorrell, supra, </i>at 580.  For these reasons, the unlicensed notice does not satisfy <i>Zauderer</i>, assuming that standard applies.

Crisis pregnancy centers\xe2\x80\x94according to a report commissioned by the California State Assembly, App. 86\xe2\x80\x94are \xe2\x80\x9cpro-life (largely Christian belief-based) organizations that offer a limited range of free pregnancy options, counseling, and other services to individuals that visit a center.\xe2\x80\x9d  Watters et\xc2\xa0al., Pregnancy Resource Centers: Ensuring Access and Accuracy of Information 4 (2011).  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nfortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d the author of the FACT Act stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are nearly 200 licensed and unlicensed\xe2\x80\x9d crisis pregnancy centers in California.  App. 84.  These centers \xe2\x80\x9caim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 85.  The author of the FACT Act observed that crisis pregnancy centers \xe2\x80\x9care commonly affiliated with, or run by organizations whose stated goal\xe2\x80\x9d is to oppose abortion\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cthe National Institute of Family and Life Advocates,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the petitioners here.  <i>Ibid.</i>  To address this perceived problem, the FACT Act imposes two notice requirements on facilities that provide pregnancy-related services\xe2\x80\x94one for licensed facilities and one for unlicensed facilities.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The first notice requirement applies to \xe2\x80\x9clicensed covered facilit[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7123471(a).  To fall under the definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicensed covered facility,\xe2\x80\x9d a clinic must be a licensed primary care or specialty clinic or qualify as an intermittent clinic under California law.  <i>Ibid. </i>(citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71204, 1206(h)).  A licensed covered facility also must have the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cproviding fam- ily planning or pregnancy-related services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7123471(a).

Clinics operated by the United States or a federal agency are excluded, as are clinics that are \xe2\x80\x9cenrolled as a Medi-Cal provider\xe2\x80\x9d and participate in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program\xe2\x80\x9d (Family PACT program).  \xc2\xa7123471(c).

Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7123472(a)(1).  The notice states that \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women.  To determine whether you qualify, contact the county social services office at [insert the telephone number].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  This notice must be posted in the waiting room, printed and distributed to all clients, or provided digitally at check-in.  \xc2\xa7123472(a)(2).

Some Courts of Appeals have recognized \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional speech\xe2\x80\x9d as a separate category of speech that is subject to different rules.  See, <i>e.g., King </i>v. <i>Governors of New Jersey</i>, 767 F.\xc2\xa03d 216, 232 (CA3 2014); <i>Pickup </i>v. <i>Brown</i>, 740 F.\xc2\xa03d 1208, 1227\xe2\x80\x931229 (CA9 2014); <i>Moore-King</i> v. <i>County of Chesterfield</i>, 708 F.\xc2\xa03d 560, 568\xe2\x80\x93570 (CA4 2014).

First, our precedents have applied more deferential review to some laws that require professionals to disclose factual, noncontroversial information in their \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial speech.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> </i>See, <i>e.g., Zauderer</i> v. <i>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 626, 651 (1985); <i>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 229, 250 (2010); <i>Ohralik</i> v. <i>Ohio State Bar Assn.</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447, 455\xe2\x80\x93456 (1978).  Second, under our precedents, States may regulate professional conduct, even though that conduct incidentally involves speech.  See, <i>e.g., id.</i>, at 456; <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833, 884 (1992) (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  But neither line of precedents is implicated here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have applied a lower level of scrutiny to laws that compel disclosures in certain contexts.  In <i>Zauderer</i>, for example, this Court upheld a rule requiring lawyers who advertised their services on a  contingency-fee basis to disclose that clients might be re- quired to pay some fees and costs.  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 650\xe2\x80\x93653.  Noting that the disclosure requirement governed only \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial advertising\xe2\x80\x9d and required the disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9cpurely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. services will be available,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained that such requirements should be upheld unless they are \xe2\x80\x9cunjustified or unduly burdensome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 651.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Zauderer</i> standard does not apply here.  Most obviously, the licensed notice is not limited to \xe2\x80\x9cpurely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. services will be available.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 651; see also <i>Hurley</i> v. <i>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 573 (1995) (explaining that <i>Zauderer</i> does not apply outside of these circumstances).  The notice in no way relates to the services that licensed clinics provide.  Instead, it requires these clinics to disclose information about <i>state</i>-sponsored services\xe2\x80\x94including abortion, anything but an \xe2\x80\x9cuncontroversial\xe2\x80\x9d topic.  Accordingly, <i>Zauderer</i> has no application here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to disclosure requirements under <i>Zauderer</i>, this Court has upheld regulations of professional conduct that incidentally burden speech.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he\n \nFirst Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552, 567 (2011), and professionals are no exception to this rule, see<i> Ohralik</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 456.  Longstanding torts for professional malpractice, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cfall within the traditional purview of state regulation of professional conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Button</i>,\n\n371 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415, 438 (1963); but cf. <i>id.,</i> at 439 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] State may not, under the guise of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  While drawing the line between speech and conduct can be difficult, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have long drawn it, see<i>, e.g., Sorrell</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 567; <i>Giboney</i> v. <i>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co.</i>,\n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490, 502 (1949), and the line is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98long familiar to the bar,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Stevens</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460, 468 (2010) (quoting <i>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.</i> v. <i>Members of N.\xc2\xa0Y State Crime Victims Bd.</i>,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 105, 127 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </i>v. <i>Casey</i>, for example, this Court upheld a law requiring physicians to obtain informed consent before they could perform an abortion.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 884 (joint opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  Pennsylvania law required physicians to inform their patients of \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion and childbirth, and the \xe2\x80\x98probable gestational age of the unborn child.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 881.  The law also required physicians to inform patients of the availability of printed materials from the State, which provided information about the child and various forms of assistance.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The joint opinion in <i>Casey</i> rejected a free-speech challenge to this informed-consent requirement.  <i>Id.</i>, at 884.  It described the Pennsylvania law as \xe2\x80\x9ca requirement that a doctor give a woman certain information as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cfor constitutional purposes, [was] no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The joint opinion explained that the law regulated speech only \xe2\x80\x9cas part of the <i>practice</i> of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  Indeed, the requirement that a doctor obtain informed consent to perform an operation is \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly entrenched in American tort law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cruzan</i> v. <i>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health</i>,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 261, 269 (1990); see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Schloendorff</i> v. <i>Society of N.\xc2\xa0Y.

(explaining that \xe2\x80\x9ca surgeon who performs an operation without his patient\xe2\x80\x99s consent commits an assault\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The licensed notice at issue here is not an informed-consent requirement or any other regulation of professional conduct.  The notice does not facilitate informed consent to a medical procedure.  In fact, it is not tied to a procedure at all.  It applies to all interactions between a covered facility and its clients, regardless of whether a medical procedure is ever sought, offered, or performed.  If a covered facility does provide medical procedures, the notice provides no information about the risks or benefits of those procedures.  Tellingly, many facilities that provide the exact same services as covered facilities\xe2\x80\x94such as general practice clinics, see \xc2\xa7123471(a)\xe2\x80\x94are not required to provide the licensed notice.  The licensed notice regulates speech as speech.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Outside of the two contexts discussed above\xe2\x80\x94disclosures under <i>Zauderer</i> and professional conduct\xe2\x80\x94this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have long protected the\n \nFirst Amendment rights of professionals.  For example, this Court has applied strict scrutiny to content-based laws that regulate the noncommercial speech of lawyers, see <i>Reed</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (discussing <i>Button</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 438); <i>In re Primus</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412, 432 (1978); professional fundraisers, see <i>Riley</i>, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 798; and organizations that provided specialized advice about international law, see<i> Holder</i> v. <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (2010).  And the Court emphasized that the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s statements in <i>Zauderer</i> would have been \xe2\x80\x9cfully protected\xe2\x80\x9d if they were made in a context other than advertising.  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637, n.\xc2\xa07.  Moreover, this Court has stressed the danger of content-based regulations \xe2\x80\x9cin the fields of medicine and public health, where information can save lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sorrell</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 566.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dangers associated with content-based regulations of speech are also present in the context of professional speech.  As with other kinds of speech, regulating the content of professionals\xe2\x80\x99 speech \xe2\x80\x9cpose[s] the inherent risk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Turner Broadcasting,</i> 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 641.  Take medicine, for example.  \xe2\x80\x9cDoctors help patients make deeply personal decisions, and their candor is crucial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wollschlaeger </i>v. <i>Governor of Florida</i>, 848 F.\xc2\xa03d 1293, 1328 (CA11 2017) (en banc) (W. Pryor, J. concurring).  Throughout history, governments have \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulat[ed] the content of doctor-patient discourse\xe2\x80\x9d to increase state power and suppress minorities:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, during the Cultural Revolution, Chinese physicians were dispatched to the countryside to convince peasants to use contraception.  In the 1930s, the Soviet government expedited completion of a construction project on the Siberian railroad by ordering doctors to both reject requests for medical leave from work and conceal this government order from their patients.  In Nazi Germany, the Third Reich systematically violated the separation between state ideology and medical discourse.  German physicians were taught that they owed a higher duty to the \xe2\x80\x98health of the Volk\xe2\x80\x99 than to the health of individual patients.  Recently, Nicolae Ceausescu\xe2\x80\x99s strategy to increase the Romanian birth rate included prohibitions against giving advice to patients about the use of birth control devices and disseminating information about the use of condoms as a means of preventing the transmission of AIDS.\xe2\x80\x9d  Berg, Toward a\n \nFirst Amendment Theory of Doctor-Patient Discourse and the Right To Receive Unbiased Medical Advice, 74 B.\xc2\xa0U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 201, 201\xe2\x80\x93202 (1994) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, when the government polices the content of professional speech, it can fail to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCullen</i> v. <i>Coakley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  Professionals might have a host of good-faith disagreements, both with each other and with the government, on many topics in their respective fields.  Doctors and nurses might disagree about the ethics of assisted suicide or the benefits of medical marijuana; lawyers and marriage counselors might disagree about the prudence of prenuptial agreements or the wisdom of divorce; bankers and accountants might disagree about the amount of money that should be devoted to savings or the benefits of tax reform.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Abrams</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n250 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting), and the people lose when the government is the one deciding which ideas should prevail.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cProfessional speech\xe2\x80\x9d is also a difficult category to define with precision.  See <i>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 791.  As defined by the courts of appeals, the professional-speech doctrine would cover a wide array of individuals\xe2\x80\x94doctors, lawyers, nurses, physical therapists, truck drivers, bartenders, barbers, and many others.  See Smolla, Professional Speech and the\n \nFirst Amendment, 119 W.\xc2\xa0Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 67, 68 (2016).  One court of appeals has even applied it to fortune tellers.  See <i>Moore-King</i>, 708 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 569.  All that is required to make something a \xe2\x80\x9cprofession,\xe2\x80\x9d according to these courts, is that it involves personalized services and requires a professional license from the State.  But that gives the States unfettered power to reduce a group\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFirst Amendment rights by simply imposing a licensing requirement.  States cannot choose the protection that speech receives under the\n \nFirst Amendment, as that would give them a powerful tool to impose \xe2\x80\x9cinvidious discrimination of disfavored subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cincinnati</i> v. <i>Discovery Network, Inc.</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410, 423\xe2\x80\x93424, n.\xc2\xa019 (1993); see also <i>Riley</i>, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 796 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tate labels cannot be dispositive of [the] degree of\n \nFirst Amendment protection\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <i>Bigelow</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 809, 826 (1975)).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, neither California nor the Ninth Circuit has identified a persuasive reason for treating professional speech as a unique category that is exempt from ordinary\n \nFirst Amendment principles.  We do not foreclose the possibility that some such reason exists.  We need not do so because the licensed notice cannot survive even intermediate scrutiny.  California asserts a single interest to justify the licensed notice: providing low-income women with information about state-sponsored services.  Assuming that this is a substantial state interest, the licensed notice is not sufficiently drawn to achieve it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If California\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to educate low-income women about the services it provides, then the licensed notice is \xe2\x80\x9cwildly underinclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 802.  The notice applies only to clinics that have a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cproviding family planning or pregnancy-related services\xe2\x80\x9d and that provide two of six categories of specific services.  \xc2\xa7123471(a).  Other clinics that have another primary purpose, or that provide only one category of those services, also serve low-income  women and could educate them about the State\xe2\x80\x99s services.  According to the legislative record, California has \xe2\x80\x9cnearly 1,000 community clinics\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cfederally designated community health centers, migrant health centers, rural health centers, and frontier health centers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cserv[e] more than 5.6 million patients .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. annually through over 17 million patient encounters.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 58.  But most of those clinics are excluded from the licensed notice requirement without explanation.  Such \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nderinclusive- ness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 802.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The FACT Act also excludes, without explanation, federal clinics and Family PACT providers from the licensed-notice requirement.  California notes that those clinics can enroll women in California\xe2\x80\x99s programs themselves, but California\xe2\x80\x99s stated interest is informing women that these services exist in the first place.  California has identified no evidence that the exempted clinics are more likely to provide this information than the covered clinics.  In fact, the exempted clinics have long been able to enroll women in California\xe2\x80\x99s programs, but the FACT Act was premised on the notion that \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of women remain unaware of [them].\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Legis. Serv., \xc2\xa71(b).  If the goal is to maximize women\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of these programs, then it would seem that California would ensure that the places that can immediately enroll women also provide this information.  The FACT Act\xe2\x80\x99s exemption for these clinics, which serve many women who are pregnant or could become pregnant in the future, demonstrates the disconnect between its stated purpose and its actual scope.  Yet \xe2\x80\x9c[p]recision .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must be the touchstone\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to regulations of speech, which \xe2\x80\x9cso closely touc[h] our most precious freedoms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Button</i>, 371 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 438.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, California could inform low-income women about its services \xe2\x80\x9cwithout burdening a speaker with unwanted speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i>, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 800.  Most obvi- ously, it could inform the women itself with a public-information campaign.  See <i>ibid.</i> (concluding that a compelled disclosure was unconstitutional because the  government could \xe2\x80\x9citself publish .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d).  Califor- nia could even post the information on public property near crisis pregnancy centers.  California argues that it has already tried an advertising campaign, and that many women who are eligible for publicly-funded healthcare have not enrolled.  But California has identified no evidence to that effect.  And regardless, a \xe2\x80\x9ctepid response\xe2\x80\x9d does not prove that an advertising campaign is not a sufficient alternative.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 803, 816 (2000).  Here, for example, individuals might not have enrolled in California\xe2\x80\x99s services because they do not want them, or because California spent insufficient resources on the advertising campaign.  Either way, California cannot co-opt the licensed facilities to deliver its message for it.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he\n \nFirst Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 795; accord, <i>Arizona Free Enterprise Club\xe2\x80\x99s Freedom Club PAC</i> v. <i>Bennett</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 721, 747 (2011).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the licensed notice.  Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, <i>post</i>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Breyer, J.), we do not question the legality of health and safety warnings long considered permissible, or purely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial  products.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We next address the unlicensed notice.  The parties dispute whether the unlicensed notice is subject to deferential review under <i>Zauderer</i>.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  We need not decide whether the <i>Zauderer </i>standard applies to the unlicensed notice.  Even under <i>Zauderer</i>, a disclosure requirement cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cunjustified or unduly burdensome.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 651.  Our precedents require disclosures to remedy a harm that is \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially real not purely hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ibanez</i> v. <i>Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136, 146 (1994), and to extend \xe2\x80\x9cno broader than reasonably necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>In\xc2\xa0re R.

Otherwise, they risk \xe2\x80\x9cchilling\xe2\x80\x9d protected speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 651.  Importantly, California has the burden to prove that the unlicensed notice is neither unjustified nor unduly burdensome.  See <i>Ibanez</i>, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146.  It has not met its burden.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We need not decide what type of state interest is sufficient to sustain a disclosure requirement like the unlicensed notice.  California has not demonstrated any justification for the unlicensed notice that is more than \xe2\x80\x9cpurely hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The only justification that the California Legislature put forward was ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9cpregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals.\xe2\x80\x9d  2015 Cal. Legis. Serv., \xc2\xa71(e).  At oral argument, however, California denied that the justification for the FACT Act was that women \xe2\x80\x9cgo into [crisis pregnancy centers] and they don\xe2\x80\x99t realize what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. of Oral Arg. at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Indeed, California points to nothing suggesting that pregnant women do not already know that the covered facilities are staffed by unlicensed medical professionals.  The services that trigger the unlicensed notice\xe2\x80\x94such as having \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteers who collect health information from clients,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cadvertis[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pregnancy options counseling,\xe2\x80\x9d and offering over-the-counter \xe2\x80\x9cpregnancy testing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7123471(b)\xe2\x80\x94do not require a medical license.  And California already makes it a crime for individuals without a medical license to practice medicine.  See Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72052.  At this preliminary stage of the litigation, we agree that petitioners are likely to prevail on the question whether California has proved a justification for the unlicensed notice.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if California had presented a nonhypothetical justification for the unlicensed notice, the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.  The unlicensed notice imposes a government-scripted, speaker-based disclosure requirement that is wholly disconnected from California\xe2\x80\x99s informational interest.  It requires covered facilities to post California\xe2\x80\x99s precise notice, no matter what the facilities say on site or in their advertisements.  And it covers a curiously narrow subset of speakers.  While the licensed notice applies to facilities that provide \xe2\x80\x9cfamily planning\xe2\x80\x9d services and \xe2\x80\x9ccontraception or contraceptive methods,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7123471(a), the California Legislature dropped these triggering conditions for the unlicensed notice.  The unlicensed notice applies only to facilities that primarily provide \xe2\x80\x9cpregnancy-related\xe2\x80\x9d services.  \xc2\xa7123471(b).  Thus, a facility that advertises and provides pregnancy tests is covered by the unlicensed notice, but a facility across the street that advertises and provides nonprescription contraceptives is excluded\xe2\x80\x94even though the latter is no less likely to make women think it is licensed.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents are deeply skeptical of laws that \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguis[h] among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Citizens United</i> v. <i>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310, 340 (2010).  Speaker-based laws run the risk that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State has left unburdened those speakers whose messages are in accord with its own views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sorrell</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 580.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The application of the unlicensed notice to advertisements demonstrates just how burdensome it is.  The notice applies to all \xe2\x80\x9cprint and digital advertising materials\xe2\x80\x9d by an unlicensed covered facility.  \xc2\xa7123472(b).  These materials must include a government-drafted statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7123472(b)(1).  An unlicensed facility must call attention to the notice, instead of its own message, by some method such as larger text or contrasting type or color.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7123472(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  This scripted language must be posted in English and as many other languages as California chooses to require.  As California conceded at oral argument, a billboard for an unlicensed facility that says \xe2\x80\x9cChoose Life\xe2\x80\x9d would have to surround that two-word statement with a 29-word statement from the government, in as many as 13 different languages.  In this way, the unlicensed notice drowns out the facility\xe2\x80\x99s own message.  More likely, the \xe2\x80\x9cdetail required\xe2\x80\x9d by the unlicensed notice \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively rules out\xe2\x80\x9d the possibility of having such a billboard in the first place.  <i>Ibanez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 146.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b></b>For all these reasons, the unlicensed notice does not satisfy <i>Zauderer</i>, assuming that standard applies.  California has offered no justification that the notice plausibly furthers. It targets speakers, not speech, and imposes an unduly burdensome disclosure requirement that will chill their protected speech.  Taking all these circumstances together, we conclude that the unlicensed notice is unjustified and unduly burdensome under <i>Zauderer</i>.  We express no view on the legality of a similar disclosure requirement that is better supported or less burdensome.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We hold that petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the FACT Act violates the\n \nFirst Amendment.

See <i>ante</i>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa02.  The Court, in my view, is correct not to reach this question.  It was not sufficiently developed, and the rationale for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today suffices to resolve the case.  And had the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis been confined to viewpoint discrimination, some legislators might have inferred that if the law were reenacted with a broader base and broader coverage it then would be upheld.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It does appear that viewpoint discrimination is inherent in the design and structure of this Act.  This law is a paradigmatic example of the serious threat presented when government seeks to impose its own message in the place of individual speech, thought, and expression.  For here the State requires primarily pro-life pregnancy centers to promote the State\xe2\x80\x99s own preferred message advertising abortions.  This compels individuals to contradict their most deeply held beliefs, beliefs grounded in basic philosophical, ethical, or religious precepts, or all of these.  And the history of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage and its underinclusive application suggest a real possibility that these individuals were targeted because of their beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The California Legislature included in its official history the congratulatory statement that the Act was part of California\xe2\x80\x99s legacy of \xe2\x80\x9cforward thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 38\xe2\x80\x9339.

It is forward thinking to begin by reading the\n \nFirst Amendment as ratified in 1791; to understand the history of authoritarian government as the Founders then knew it; to confirm that history since then shows how relentless authoritarian regimes  are in their attempts to stifle free speech; and to carry those lessons onward as we seek to preserve and teach the necessity of freedom of speech for the generations to come.  Governments must not be allowed to force persons to express a message contrary to their deepest convictions.  Freedom of speech secures freedom of thought and belief.

The second requires <i>un</i>licensed facilities offering somewhat similar services to make clear that they are unlicensed.

The majority now reverses the Court of Appeals on the ground that the petitioners have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, <i>i.e.</i>, that the statute likely violates the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 free speech rights and is unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Before turning to the specific law before us, I focus upon the general interpretation of the\n \nFirst Amendment that the majority says it applies.  It applies heightened scru- tiny to the Act because the Act, in its view, is \xe2\x80\x9ccontent based.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy compelling individuals to speak a particular message,\xe2\x80\x9d it adds, \xe2\x80\x9csuch notices \xe2\x80\x98alte[r] the content of [their] speech.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7 (quoting <i>Riley</i> v. <i>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 781, 795 (1988)) (alteration in original).  \xe2\x80\x9cAs a general matter,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority concludes, such laws are \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptively unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d and are subject to \xe2\x80\x9cstringent\xe2\x80\x9d review.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority recognizes exceptions to this general rule: It excepts laws that \xe2\x80\x9crequire professionals to disclose factual, noncontroversial information in their \xe2\x80\x98commercial speech,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>provided that</i> the disclosure \xe2\x80\x9crelates to the services that [the regulated entities] provide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  It also excepts laws that \xe2\x80\x9cregulate professional conduct\xe2\x80\x9d <i>and</i> only \xe2\x80\x9cincidentally burden speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This constitutional approach threatens to create serious problems.  Because much, perhaps most, human behavior takes place through speech and because much, perhaps most, law regulates that speech in terms of its content, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach at the least threatens considerable litigation over the constitutional validity of much, perhaps most, government regulation.  Virtually every disclosure law could be considered \xe2\x80\x9ccontent based,\xe2\x80\x9d for virtually every disclosure law requires individuals \xe2\x80\x9cto speak a particular message.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Reed </i>v. <i>Town of Gilbert</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (listing regulations that inevitably involve content discrimination, ranging from securities disclosures to signs at petting zoos).  Thus, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, if taken literally, could radically change prior law, perhaps placing much securities law or consumer protection law at constitutional risk, depending on how broadly its exceptions are interpreted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many ordinary disclosure laws would fall outside the majority\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions for disclosures related to the professional\xe2\x80\x99s own services or conduct.  These include numerous commonly found disclosure requirements relating to the medical profession.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \xc2\xa727363.5 (West 2014) (requiring hospitals to tell parents about child seat belts); Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7123222.2 (requiring hospitals to ask incoming patients if they would like the facility to give their family information about patients\xe2\x80\x99 rights and responsibilities); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7131E\xe2\x80\x9379.2 (2017) (requiring hospitals to tell parents of newborns about pertussis disease and the available vaccine).  These also include numerous disclosure requirements found in other areas.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0C. Rules &amp; Regs., tit. 1, \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x9301 (2018) (requiring signs by elevators showing stair locations); San Francisco Dept. of Health, Director\xe2\x80\x99s Rules &amp; Regs., Garbage and Refuse (July 8, 2010) (requiring property owners to inform tenants about garbage disposal procedures).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority, at the end of Part II of its opinion, perhaps recognizing this problem, adds a general disclaimer.  It says that it does not \xe2\x80\x9cquestion the legality of health and safety warnings long considered permissible, or purely factual and uncontroversial disclosures about commercial products.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But this generally phrased disclaimer would seem more likely to invite litigation than to provide needed limitation and clarification.  The major- ity, for example, does not explain why the Act here, which is justified in part by health and safety considerations, does not fall within its \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d category.  <i>Ante,</i> at 14; see also <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </i>v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833, 882\xe2\x80\x93884 (1992) (joint opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.) (reasoning that disclosures related to fetal development and childbirth are related to the health of a woman seeking an abortion). <i> </i>Nor does the majority opinion offer any reasoned basis that might help apply its disclaimer for distinguishing lawful from unlawful disclosures.  In the absence of a reasoned explanation of the disclaimer\xe2\x80\x99s meaning and rationale, the disclaimer is unlikely to withdraw the invitation to litigation that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s general broad \xe2\x80\x9ccontent-based\xe2\x80\x9d test issues.  That test invites courts around the Nation to apply an unpredictable\n \nFirst Amendment to ordinary social and economic regulation, striking down disclosure laws that judges may disfavor, while upholding others, all without grounding their decisions in reasoned principle. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notably, the majority says nothing about limiting its language to the kind of instance where the Court has traditionally found the\n \nFirst Amendment wary of content-based laws, namely, in cases of viewpoint discrimination.  \xe2\x80\x9cContent-based laws merit this protection because they present, albeit sometimes in a subtler form, the same dangers as laws that regulate speech based on viewpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reed, </i>576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1).  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9c[l]imiting speech based on its \xe2\x80\x98topic\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98subject\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d can favor \xe2\x80\x9cthose who do not want to disturb the status quo.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>But the mine run of disclosure requirements do nothing of that sort.  They simply alert the public about child seat belt laws, the location of stairways, and the process to have their garbage collected, among other things.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Precedent does not require a test such as the majority\xe2\x80\x99s.  Rather, in saying the Act is not a longstanding health and safety law, the Court substitutes its own approach\xe2\x80\x94without a defining standard\xe2\x80\x94for an approach that was reasonably clear.  Historically, the Court has been wary of claims that regulation of business activity, particularly health-related activity, violates the Constitution.  Ever since this Court departed from the approach it set forth in <i>Lochner </i>v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n198 U.\xc2\xa0S. 45 (1905), ordinary economic and social legislation has been thought to raise little constitutional concern.  As Justice Brandeis wrote, typically this Court\xe2\x80\x99s function in such cases \xe2\x80\x9cis only to determine the reasonableness of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the existence of evils and in the effectiveness of the remedy provided.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  New State Ice Co. </i>v. <i>Liebmann</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 262, 286\xe2\x80\x93287 (1932) (dissenting opinion); see<i> Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</i>,\n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483, 486\xe2\x80\x93488 (1955) (adopting the approach of Justice Brandeis).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court has taken this same respectful approach to economic and social legislation when a\n \nFirst Amendment claim like the claim present here is at issue.

The Court took the view that a State may condition the practice of medicine on any number of requirements, and physicians, in exchange for following those reasonable requirements, could receive a license to practice medicine from the State.  Medical professionals do not, generally speaking, have a right to use the Constitution as a weapon allowing them rigorously to control the content of those reasonable conditions.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Dent</i> v. <i>West Virginia</i>,\n\n129 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114 (1889) (upholding medical licensing requirements); <i>Hawker</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n170 U.\xc2\xa0S. 189 (1898) (same); <i>Collins</i> v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n223 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288, 297\xe2\x80\x93298 (1912) (recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9cright of the State to adopt a policy even upon medical matters concerning which there is difference of opinion and dispute\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Lambert</i> v. <i>Yellowley</i>,\n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581, 596 (1926) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no right to practice medicine which is not subordinate to the police power of the States\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Graves </i>v. <i>Minnesota</i>,\n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 425, 429 (1926) (statutes \xe2\x80\x9cregulating the practice of medicine\xe2\x80\x9d involve \xe2\x80\x9cvery different considerations\xe2\x80\x9d from those applicable to \xe2\x80\x9ctrades [such as] locomotive engineers and barbers\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Semler</i> v. <i>Oregon Bd. of Dental Examiners</i>,\n\n294 U.\xc2\xa0S. 608, 612 (1935) (upholding state regulation of dentistry given the \xe2\x80\x9cvital interest of public health\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the name of the\n \nFirst Amendment, the majority today treads into territory where the pre-New Deal, as well as the post-New Deal, Court refused to go.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court, in justification, refers to widely accepted\n \nFirst Amendment goals, such as the need to protect the Nation from laws that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98suppress unpopular ideas or information\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or inhibit the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313; see <i>New York Times Co.</i> v. <i>Sullivan</i>,\n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254, 269 (1964).  The concurrence highlights similar\n \nFirst Amendment interests.  <i>Ante,</i> at 2.  I, too, value this role that the\n \nFirst Amendment plays\xe2\x80\x94in an appropriate case.  But here, the majority enunciates a general test that reaches far beyond the area where this Court has examined laws closely in the service of those goals.  And, in suggesting that heightened scrutiny applies to much economic and social legislation, the majority pays those\n \nFirst Amendment goals a serious disservice through dilution.  Using the\n \nFirst Amendment to strike down economic and social laws that legislatures long would have thought themselves free to enact will, for the American public, obscure, not clarify, the true value of protecting freedom of speech. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Still, what about this specific case?  The disclosure at issue here concerns speech related to abortion.  It involves health, differing moral values, and differing points of view.  Thus,  rather than set forth broad, new,\n \nFirst Amendment principles, I believe that we should focus more directly upon precedent more closely related to the case at hand.  This Court has more than once considered disclosure laws relating to reproductive health.  Though those rules or holdings have changed over time, they should govern our disposition of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I begin with <i>Akron </i>v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 416 (1983).  In that case the Court considered a city ordinance requiring a doctor to tell a woman contemplating an abortion about the</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cstatus of her pregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the physical and emotional complications that may result from an abortion, and the availability of agencies to provide her with assistance and information with respect to birth control, adoption, and childbirth[, and] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98the particular risks associated with her own pregnancy and the abortion technique to be employed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 442 (quoting Akron Codified Ordinances \xc2\xa71870.06(C) (1978)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The ordinance further required a doctor to tell such a woman that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Akron</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 444 (quoting Akron Codified Ordinances \xc2\xa71870.06(B)(3)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs claimed that this ordinance violated a woman\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to obtain an abortion.  And this Court agreed.  The Court stated that laws providing for a woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinformed consent\xe2\x80\x9d to an abortion were normally valid, for they helped to protect a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health.  <i>Akron,</i> 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 443\xe2\x80\x93444.  Still, the Court held that the law at issue went \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond permissible limits\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of the information required [was] designed not to inform the woman\xe2\x80\x99s consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 444.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the city had placed unreasonable \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obstacles in the path of the doctor upon whom [the woman is] entitled to rely for advice in connection with her decision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 445 (quoting <i>Whalen </i>v. <i>Roe</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 589, 604, n.\xc2\xa033 (1977)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Several years later, in <i>Thornburgh </i>v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</i>,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 747 (1986), the Court considered a Pennsylvania statute that \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe[d] in detail the method for securing \xe2\x80\x98informed consent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to an abortion.  <i>Id.,</i> at 760.  The statute required the doctor to tell the patient about health risks associated with abortion, possibly available benefits for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care, and agencies offering alternatives to abortion.  <i>Id.,</i> at 760\xe2\x80\x93761.  In particular it required the doctor to give the patient printed materials that, among other things, said:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you to carry your child to term, and to assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or place her or him for adoption.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania strongly urges you to contact them before making a final decision about abortion.  The law requires that your physician or his agent give you the opportunity to call agencies like these before you undergo an abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 761 (quoting 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa73208(a)(1) (1982)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court, as in <i>Akron</i>, held that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s information requirements violated the Constitution.  They were designed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not to inform the woman\xe2\x80\x99s consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Thornburgh</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 762 (quoting <i>Akron</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 444).  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, insistence on telling the patient about the availability of \xe2\x80\x9cmedical assistance benefits\xe2\x80\x9d if she decided against an abortion was a \xe2\x80\x9cpoorly disguised elemen[t] of discouragement for the abortion decision,\xe2\x80\x9d and the law was the \xe2\x80\x9cantithesis of informed consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Thornburgh, supra</i>, at 763\xe2\x80\x93764.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These cases, however, whatever support they may have given to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, are no longer good law.  In <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </i>v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833 (1992), the Court again considered a state law that required doctors to provide information to a woman deciding whether to proceed with an abortion.  That law required the doctor to tell the woman about the nature of the abortion procedure, the health risks of abortion and of childbirth, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98probable gestational age of the unborn child,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the availability of printed materials describing the fetus, medical assistance for childbirth, potential child support, and the agencies that would provide adoption services (or other alternatives to abortion).  <i>Id.,</i> at 881 (joint opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.) (quoting 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa73205 (1990)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This time a joint opinion of the Court, in judging whether the State could impose these informational requirements, asked whether doing so imposed an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d upon women seeking an abortion.  <i>Casey</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882\xe2\x80\x93883.  It held that it did not.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Hence the statute was constitutional.  <i>Id.,</i> at 874.  The joint opinion stated that the statutory requirements amounted to \xe2\x80\x9creasonable measure[s] to ensure an informed choice, one which might cause the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 883.  And, it \xe2\x80\x9coverruled\xe2\x80\x9d portions of the two cases, <i>Akron</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i>, that might indicate the contrary.  <i>Id.,</i> at 882.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In respect to overruling the earlier cases, it wrote:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent <i>Akron I</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i> find a constitutional violation when the government requires, as it does here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about the nature of the procedure, the attendant health risks and those of childbirth, and the \xe2\x80\x98probable gestational age\xe2\x80\x99 of the fetus, those cases go too far, are inconsistent with <i>Roe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life, and are overruled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The joint opinion specifically discussed the\n \nFirst Amendment, the constitutional provision now directly before us.  It concluded that the statute did not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment.  It wrote:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is left of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument is an asserted\n \nFirst Amendment right of a physician not to provide information about the risks of abortion, and childbirth, in a manner mandated by the State.  To be sure, the physician\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFirst Amendment rights not to speak are implicated, see <i>Wooley </i>v. <i>Maynard</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 705 (1977), but only as part of the practice of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State, cf. <i>Whalen </i>v. <i>Roe</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 589, 603 (1977).  We see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated by the State here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Casey</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 884.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the Court considered the State\xe2\x80\x99s statutory requirements, including the requirement that the doctor must inform his patient about where she could learn how to have the newborn child adopted (if carried to term) and how she could find related financial assistance.  <i>Id.,</i> at 881.  To repeat the point, the Court then held that the State\xe2\x80\x99s requirements did <i>not</i> violate either the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s protection of free speech or its protection of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose to have an abortion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Taking <i>Casey </i>as controlling,<i> </i>the law\xe2\x80\x99s demand for evenhandedness requires a different answer than that perhaps suggested by <i>Akron </i>and <i>Thornburgh</i>.  If a State can lawfully require a doctor to tell a woman seeking an abortion about adoption services, why should it not be able, as here, to require a medical counselor to tell a woman seeking prenatal care or other reproductive healthcare about childbirth and abortion services?  As the question suggests, there is no convincing reason to distinguish between information about adoption and information about abortion in this context.  After all, the rule of law embodies evenhandedness, and \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is sauce for the goose is normally sauce for the gander.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Heffernan</i> v. <i>City of Paterson</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6).  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority tries to distinguish<i> Casey </i>as concerning a regulation of professional conduct that only incidentally burdened speech.  <i>Ante, </i>at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  <i>Casey</i>, in its view, applies only when obtaining \xe2\x80\x9cinformed consent\xe2\x80\x9d to a medical procedure is directly at issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This distinction, however, lacks moral, practical, and legal force.  The individuals at issue here are all medical personnel engaging in activities that directly affect a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health\xe2\x80\x94not significantly different from the doctors at issue in <i>Casey</i>.  After all, the statute here applies only to \xe2\x80\x9cprimary care clinics,\xe2\x80\x9d which provide \xe2\x80\x9cservices for the care and treatment of patients for whom the clinic accepts responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \xc2\xa775026(a); see Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7123471(a), 1204, 1206(h).  And the persons responsible for patients at those clinics are all persons \xe2\x80\x9clicensed, certified or registered to provide\xe2\x80\x9d pregnancy-related medical services.  Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \xc2\xa775026(c).  The petitioners have not, either here or in the District Court, provided any example of a covered clinic that is not operated by licensed doctors or what the statute specifies are equivalent professionals.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a (identifying two obstetrician/gynecologists, a radiologist, an anesthesiologist, a certified nurse midwife, a nurse practitioner, 10 nurses, and two registered diagnostic medical sonographers on staff).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act requires these medical professionals to disclose information about the possibility of abortion (including potential financial help) that is as likely helpful to granting \xe2\x80\x9cinformed consent\xe2\x80\x9d as is information about the possibility of adoption and childbirth (including potential financial help).  That is why I find it impossible to drive any meaningful legal wedge between the law, as interpreted in <i>Casey</i>, and the law as it should be applied in this case.  If the law in <i>Casey </i>regulated speech \xe2\x80\x9conly \xe2\x80\x98as part of the <i>practice </i>of medicine,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 11 (quoting <i>Casey</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 884), so too here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority contends that the disclosure here is unrelated to a \xe2\x80\x9cmedical procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d unlike that in <i>Casey</i>, and so the State has no reason to inform a woman about alternatives to childbirth (or, presumably, the health risks of childbirth).  <i>Ante, </i>at 11.  Really?  No one doubts that choosing an abortion is a medical procedure that involves certain health risks.  See <i>Whole Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Health</i> v. <i>Hellerstedt</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 30) (identifying the mortality rate in Texas as 1 in 120,000 to 144,000 abortions).  But the same is true of carrying a child to term and giving birth.  That is why prenatal care often involves testing for anemia, infections, measles, chicken pox, genetic disorders, diabetes, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, preeclampsia, and hosts of other medical conditions.  Childbirth itself, directly or through pain management, risks harms of various kinds, some connected with caesarean or surgery-related deliveries, some related to more ordinary methods of delivery.  Indeed, nationwide \xe2\x80\x9cchildbirth is 14 times more likely than abortion to result in\xe2\x80\x9d the woman\xe2\x80\x99s death.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Health considerations do not favor disclosure of alternatives and risks associated with the latter but not those associated with the former.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any case, informed consent principles apply more broadly than only to discrete \xe2\x80\x9cmedical procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Prescription drug labels warn patients of risks even though taking prescription drugs may not be considered a \xe2\x80\x9cmedical procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.56 (2017).  In California, clinics that screen for breast cancer must post a sign in their offices notifying patients that, if they are diagnosed with breast cancer, their doctor must provide \xe2\x80\x9ca written summary of alternative efficacious methods of treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d a notification that does not relate to the <i>screening </i>procedure at issue.  Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7109277.  If even these disclosures fall outside the majority\xe2\x80\x99s cramped view of <i>Casey </i>and informed consent, it undoubtedly would invalidate the many other disclosures that are routine in the medical context as well.  <i>Supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also finds it \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ellin[g]\xe2\x80\x9d that general practice clinics\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>paid clinics\xe2\x80\x94are not required to provide the licensed notice.  <i>Ante, </i>at 11.  But the lack-of-information problem that the statute seeks to ameliorate is a problem that the State explains is commonly found among low-income women.  See Brief for State Respondents 5\xe2\x80\x936.  That those with low income might lack the time to become fully informed and that this circumstance might prove disproportionately correlated with income is not intuitively surprising.  Nor is it surprising that those with low income, whatever they choose in respect to pregnancy, might find information about financial assistance particularly useful.  There is \xe2\x80\x9cnothing inherently suspect\xe2\x80\x9d about this distinction, <i>McCullen </i>v. <i>Coakley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 15), which is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the content of [the advocacy] each group offers,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. </i>v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622, 658\xe2\x80\x93659 (1994), but upon the patients the group generally serves and the needs of that population.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Separately, finding no\n \nFirst Amendment infirmity in the licensed notice is consistent with earlier Court rulings.  For instance, in <i>Zauderer</i> we upheld a requirement that attorneys disclose in their advertisements that clients might be liable for significant litigation costs even if their lawsuits were unsuccessful.  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 650.  We refused to apply heightened scrutiny, instead asking whether the disclosure requirements were \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing deception of consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 651.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority concludes that <i>Zauderer </i>does not apply because the disclosure \xe2\x80\x9cin no way relates to the services that licensed clinics provide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  But information about state resources for family planning, prenatal care, and abortion <i>is </i>related to the services that licensed clinics provide.  These clinics provide counseling about contraception (which is a<i> </i>family-planning service), ultrasounds or pregnancy testing (which is prenatal care), or abortion.  Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7123471(a).  The required disclosure is related to the clinic\xe2\x80\x99s services because it provides information about state resources for the very same services.  A patient who knows that she can receive free prenatal care from the State may well prefer to forgo the prenatal care offered at one of the clinics here.  And for those interested in family planning and abortion services, information about such alternatives is relevant information to patients offered prenatal care, just as <i>Casey </i>considered information about adoption to be relevant to the abortion decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Regardless, <i>Zauderer </i>is not so limited.  <i>Zauderer </i>turned on the \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 650.  A disclosure requirement does not prevent speakers \xe2\x80\x9cfrom conveying information to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9conly require[s] them to provide somewhat more information than they might otherwise be inclined to present.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Where a State\xe2\x80\x99s requirement to speak \xe2\x80\x9cpurely factual and uncontroversial information\xe2\x80\x9d does not attempt \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it does not warrant heightened scrutiny.  <i>Id.,</i> at 651 (quoting <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed. </i>v. <i>Barnette</i>,\n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 642 (1943)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Zauderer</i>, the Court emphasized the reason that the\n \nFirst Amendment protects commercial speech at all: \xe2\x80\x9cthe value to consumers of the information such speech provides.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 651.  For that reason, a professional\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally protected interest in <i>not </i>providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>But this rationale is not in any way tied to advertisements about a professional\xe2\x80\x99s own services.  For instance, it applies equally to a law that requires doctors, when discharging a child under eight years of age, to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide to and discuss with the parents .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information on the current law requiring child passenger restraint systems, safety belts, and the transportation of children in rear seats.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \xc2\xa727363.5(a).  Even though child seat belt laws do not directly relate to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s own services, telling parents about such laws does nothing to undermine the flow of factual information.  Whether the context is advertising the professional\xe2\x80\x99s own services or other commercial speech, a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFirst Amendment interest in not providing factual information to patients is the same: minimal, because his professional speech is protected precisely because of its informational value to patients.  There is no reason to subject such laws to heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on cases that prohibit rather than require speech is misplaced.  <i>Ante, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  I agree that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the fields of medicine and public heath, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information can save lives,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but the licensed disclosure <i>serves </i>that informational interest by requiring clinics to notify patients of the availability of state resources for family planning services, prenatal care, and abortion, which\xe2\x80\x94unlike the majority\xe2\x80\x99s examples of normative statements, <i>ante, </i>at 13\xe2\x80\x94is truthful and nonmisleading information.  Abortion is a controversial topic and a source of normative debate, but the availability of state resources is not a normative statement or a fact of debat- able truth.  The disclosure includes information about resources available should a woman seek to continue her pregnancy or terminate it, and it expresses no official preference for one choice over the other.  Similarly, the majority highlights an interest that often underlies our decisions in respect to speech prohibitions\xe2\x80\x94the marketplace of ideas.  But that marketplace is fostered, not hindered, by providing information to patients to enable them to make fully informed medical decisions in respect to their pregnancies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, one might take the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to mean that speech about abortion is special, that it involves in this case not only professional medical matters, but also views based on deeply held religious and moral beliefs about the nature of the practice.  To that extent, arguably, the speech here is different from that at issue in <i>Zauderer</i>.  But assuming that is so, the law\xe2\x80\x99s insistence upon treating like cases alike should lead us to reject the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that I have discussed.  This insistence, the need for evenhandedness, should prove particularly weighty in a case involving abortion rights.  That is because Americans hold strong, and differing, views about the matter.  Some Americans believe that abortion involves the death of a live and innocent human being.  Others believe that the ability to choose an abortion is \xe2\x80\x9ccentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Casey</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 851, and note that the failure to allow women to choose an abortion involves the deaths of innocent women.  We have previously noted that we cannot try to adjudicate who is right and who is wrong in this moral debate.  But we can do our best to interpret American constitutional law so that it applies fairly within a Nation whose citizens strongly hold these different points of view.  That is one reason why it is particularly important to interpret the\n \nFirst Amendment so that it applies evenhandedly as between those who disagree so strongly.  For this reason too a Constitution that allows States to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of adoption should also allow States similarly to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of abortion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It is particularly unfortunate that the majority, through application of so broad and obscure a standard, see <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x937, declines to reach remaining arguments that the Act discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.  <i>Ante, </i>at 6, n.\xc2\xa02.  The petitioners argue that it unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of viewpoint because it primar- ily covers facilities with supporters, organizers, and employees who are likely to hold strong pro-life views.  They contend that the statute does not cover facilities likely to hold neutral or pro-choice views, because it exempts facilities that enroll patients in publicly funded programs that include abortion.  In doing so, they say, the statute unnecessarily imposes a disproportionate burden upon facilities with pro-life views, the very facilities most likely to find the statute\xe2\x80\x99s references to abortion morally abhorrent.  Brief for Petitioners 31\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem with this argument lies in the record.  Numerous <i>amicus</i> briefs advance the argument.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Scharpen Foundation, Inc., et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6\xe2\x80\x9310; Brief for American Center for Law &amp; Justice et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7\xe2\x80\x9313.  Some add that women who use facilities that are exempt from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirements (because they enroll patients in two California state-run medical programs that provide abortions) may still need the information provided by the disclosure, Brief for CATO Institute as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15, a point the majority adopts in concluding that the Act is underinclusive, <i>ante,</i> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But the key question is whether these exempt clinics are significantly more likely than are the pro-life clinics to tell or to have told their pregnant patients about the existence of these programs\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of any statutory compulsion.  If so, it may make sense\xe2\x80\x94in terms of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s informational objective\xe2\x80\x94to exempt them, namely if there is no need to cover them.  See FACT Act, \xc2\xa71(d) (suggesting in general terms that this is so).  But, if there are not good reasons to exempt these clinics from coverage, <i>i.e., </i>if, for example, they too frequently do not tell their patients about the availability of abortion services, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim of viewpoint discrimination becomes much stronger.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The petitioners, however, did not develop this point in the record below.  They simply stated in their complaint that the Act exempts \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities which provide abortion services, freeing them from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements, while leaving pro-life facilities subject to them.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 104a.  And in the District Court they relied solely on the allegations of their complaint, provided no supporting declarations, and contended that discovery was unnecessary.  <i>Id.,</i> at 47a, 50a, 68a.  The District Court concluded that the reason for the Act\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions was that those clinics \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the entire spectrum of services required of the notice,\xe2\x80\x9d and that absent discovery, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no evidence to suggest the Act burdens only\xe2\x80\x9d pro-life conduct.  <i>Id.</i>, at 68a.  Similarly, the petitioners pressed the claim in the Court of Appeals.  <i>Id.</i>, at 20a\xe2\x80\x9322a.  But they did not supplement the record.  Consequently, that court reached the same conclusion.  Given the absence of evidence in the record before the lower courts, the \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoint discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d claim could not justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The second statutory provision covers pregnancy-related facilities that provide women with certain medical-type services (such as obstetric ultrasounds or sonograms, pregnancy diagnosis, counseling about pregnancy options, or prenatal care), are not licensed as medical facilities by the State, and do not have a licensed medical provider on site.  Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7123471(b)(1).  The statute says that such a facility must disclose that it is not \xe2\x80\x9clicensed as a medical facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7123472(b).  And it must make this disclosure in a posted notice and in advertising.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority does not question that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest (ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9cpregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals\xe2\x80\x9d) is the type of informational interest that <i>Zauderer </i>encompasses.  <i>Ante,</i> at 5, 17.  Nor could it.  In <i>Riley</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 781, the Court noted that the\n \nFirst Amendment would permit a requirement for \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional fundraisers to disclose their professional status\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94nearly identical to the unlicensed disclosure at issue here.  <i>Id.,</i> at 799 and n.\xc2\xa011; see also <i>id.,</i> at 804 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that this requirement was not aimed at combating deception).  Such informational interests have long justified regulations in the medical context.  See, <i>e.g., Dent</i>, 129 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 122 (upholding medical licensing requirements that \xe2\x80\x9ctend to secure [a State\xe2\x80\x99s citizens] against the consequences of ignorance and incapacity, as well as of deception and fraud\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Semler</i>, 294 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 611 (upholding state dentistry regulation that \xe2\x80\x9cafford[ed] protection against ignorance, incapacity and imposition\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nevertheless, the majority concludes that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest is \xe2\x80\x9cpurely hypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d because unlicensed clinics provide innocuous services that do not require a medical license.  <i>Ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  To do so, it applies a searching standard of review based on our precedents that deal with speech <i>restrictions</i>, not <i>disclosures</i>.  <i>Ante, </i>at 17 (citing, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>In\xc2\xa0re R.</i>\xc2\xa0<i>M.\xc2\xa0J.</i>, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203; <i>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy </i>v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 748, 772, n. 24 (1976); <i>Bates </i>v. <i>State Bar of Ariz.</i>,\n\n433 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350, 384 (1977); and <i>Zauderer</i>, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 649 (portion of opinion considering speech restrictions, not disclosures)).  This approach is incompatible with <i>Zauderer</i>.  See <i>Zauderer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 651 (upholding attorney disclosure requirements where \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Milavetz</i>, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 250\xe2\x80\x93253 (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is no basis for finding the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical.\xe2\x80\x9d  The legislature heard that information-related delays in qualified healthcare negatively affect women seeking to terminate their pregnancies as well as women carrying their pregnancies to term, with delays in qualified prenatal care causing life-long health problems for infants.  Reproductive FACT Act: Hearing on Assembly B. 775 before the Senate Health Committee, 2015 Cal. Leg. Sess.  Even without such testimony, it is \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that patients might think they are receiving qualified medical care when they enter facilities that collect health information, perform obstetric ultrasounds or sonograms, diagnose pregnancy, and provide counseling about pregnancy options or other prenatal care.  <i>Milavetz</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 251.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to that effect is certainly reasonable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also suggests that the Act applies too broadly, namely, to all unlicensed facilities \xe2\x80\x9cno matter what the facilities say on site or in their advertisements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 18.  But the Court has long held that a law is not unreasonable merely because it is overinclusive.  For instance, in <i>Semler</i> the Court upheld as reasonable a state law that prohibited licensed dentists from advertising that their skills were superior to those of other dentists.  294 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 609.  A dentist complained that he was, in fact, better than other dentists.  <i>Id.,</i> at 610.  Yet the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n framing its policy, the legislature was not bound to provide for determinations of the relative proficiency of particular practitioners.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 612.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he legislature was entitled to consider the general effects of the practices which it described, and if these effects were injurious in facilitating unwarranted and misleading claims, to counteract them by a general rule, even though in particular instances there might be no actual deception or misstatement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 613.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Relatedly, the majority suggests that the Act is suspect because it covers some speakers but not others.  <i>Ante, </i>at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  I agree that a law\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions can reveal viewpoint discrimination (although the majority does not reach this point).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A]n exemption from an otherwise permissible regulation of speech may represent a governmental \xe2\x80\x9cattempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCullen</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting <i>City of Ladue </i>v. <i>Gilleo</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43, 51 (1994)).  Such speaker-based laws warrant heightened scrutiny \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they reflect the Government\xe2\x80\x99s preference for the substance of what the favored speakers have to say (or aversion to what the disfavored speakers have to say).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</i>, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658.  Accordingly, where a law\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate speech on only one side of the abortion debate,\xe2\x80\x9d there is a \xe2\x80\x9cclear form of viewpoint discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCullen, supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 18).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is no cause for such concern here.  The Act does not, on its face, distinguish between facilities that favor pro-life and those that favor pro-choice points of view.  Nor is there any convincing evidence before us or in the courts below that discrimination was the purpose or the effect  of the statute.  Notably, California does not single out pregnancy-related facilities for this type of disclosure require- ment.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72053.6 (West 2012) (unlicensed providers of alternative health services must disclose that \xe2\x80\x9che or she is not a licensed physician\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe services to be provided are not licensed by the state\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it is unremarkable that the State excluded the provision of family planning and contraceptive services as triggering conditions.  <i>Ante,</i> at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  After all, the State was seeking to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cpregnant women in California know when they are getting medical care from licensed professionals,\xe2\x80\x9d and pregnant women generally do not need contraceptive services.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the majority concludes that the Act is overly burdensome.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  I agree that \xe2\x80\x9cunduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the\n \nFirst Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Zauderer</i>, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 651.  But these and similar claims are claims that the statute could be applied unconstitutionally, not that it is unconstitutional on its face.  Compare <i>New York State Club Assn., Inc.</i> v. <i>City of New York</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 14 (1988) (a facial overbreadth challenge must show \xe2\x80\x9cfrom actual fact\xe2\x80\x9d that a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial number of instances exist in which the Law cannot be applied constitutionally\xe2\x80\x9d), with <i>Chicago </i>v. <i>Morales</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41, 74 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (an as-applied challenge asks whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute is unconstitutional as applied to <i>this </i>party, in the circumstances of <i>this </i>case\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it will be open to the petitioners to make these claims if and when the State threatens to enforce the statute in this way.  But facial relief is inappropriate here, where the petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cfail\xe2\x80\x9d even \xe2\x80\x9cto describe [these] instances of arguable overbreadth of the contested law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Washington State Grange </i>v. <i>Washington State Republican Party</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442, 449\xe2\x80\x93450, n.\xc2\xa06 (2008), where \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o record was made in this respect,\xe2\x80\x9d and where the petitioners thus have not shown \xe2\x80\x9cfrom actual fact\xe2\x80\x9d that a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial number of instances exist in which the Law cannot be applied constitutionally,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>New York State Club Assn.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For instance, the majority highlights that the statute requires facilities to write their \xe2\x80\x9cmedical license\xe2\x80\x9d disclaimers in 13 languages.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  As I understand the Act, it would require disclosure in no more than two languages\xe2\x80\x94English and Spanish\xe2\x80\x94in the vast majority of California\xe2\x80\x99s 58 counties.  The exception is Los Angeles County, where, given the large number of different-language speaking groups, expression in many languages may prove necessary to communicate the message to those whom that message will help.  Whether the requirement of 13 different languages goes too far and is unnecessarily burdensome in light of the need to secure the statutory objectives is a matter that concerns Los Angeles County alone, and it is a proper subject for a Los Angeles-based as applied challenge in light of whatever facts a plaintiff finds relevant.  At most, such facts might show a need for fewer languages, not invalidation of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons I would not hold the California statute unconstitutional on its face, I would not require the District Court to issue a preliminary injunction forbidding its enforcement, and I respectfully dissent from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
