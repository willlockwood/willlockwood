S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if that deadline is not met, \xc2\xa73162(a)(2).  As relevant here, the Act automatically excludes from the 70-day period \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from \xe2\x80\xa6 proceedings concerning the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73161(h)(1) (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court to exclude \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from a continuance\xe2\x80\x9d it grants, provided the court makes findings required by \xc2\xa73161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsection (h)(7)).  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s indictment on federal firearm and drug possession charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006.  After petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to file pretrial motions by September 13.  On September 7, the court granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to extend that deadline, but on the new due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial motions.  On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver voluntary and intelligent.  Over the next three months, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial was delayed several times, often at petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s instigation.  On February 19, 2007\xe2\x80\x94179 days after he was indicted\xe2\x80\x94he moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day limit had elapsed.  In denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from September 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time.  At trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to concurrent prison terms.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7 through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The time granted to <em>prepare </em>pretrial motions is not automatically excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1).  Such time may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7).  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The delay at issue is governed by subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)), the enumerated category that renders automatically excludable \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  This provision communicates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that pretrial motion-related delay is automatically excludable <em>only</em> from the time a pretrial motion is filed through a specified hearing or disposition point, and that other pretrial motion-related delay is excludable only if it results in a continuance under subsection (h)(7).  This limitation is significant because Congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired.  Although the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically excludable.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] specific provision\xe2\x80\x9d (here, subparagraph (D)) \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols one[s] of more general application\xe2\x80\x9d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).  <em>Gozlon-Peretz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/395/index.html">498 U. S. 395</a>, 407.  A contrary result would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  Subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d does not show that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of proceedings, but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph expressly addressed to that category.  That would confuse the illustrative nature of the subsection\xe2\x80\x99s list of categories with the contents of the categories themselves.  Reading the \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction principles by ignoring subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s structure and grammar and in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous.  See generally <em>id., </em>at 410.  Subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s context supports this Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Subsection (h)(7) provides that delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from a continuance granted by any judge\xe2\x80\x9d <em>may</em> be excluded, but only if the judge finds that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,\xe2\x80\x9d and records those findings.  In setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection (h)(7) continuance, Congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(B)(ii), 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the delay at issue is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1).  See <em>Zedner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/489/index.html">547 U. S. 489</a>, 502.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Act does not force a district court to choose between rejecting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial.  A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings.  Subsection (h)(7) provides \xe2\x80\x9c[m]uch of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zedner</em>, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion \xe2\x80\xa6 to accommodate limited delays for case-specific needs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 499.  The Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the necessary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit.  But dismissal need not represent a windfall.  If the court dismisses the charges <em>without</em> <em>prejudice</em>, the Government may refile charges or reindict.  In ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should consider, <em>inter alia,</em> the party responsible for the delay.

After observing petitioner commit several traffic violations, the officers stopped the vehicle.  They approached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s lap.  After the officers read petitioner his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, petitioner made inculpatory statements.  See <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966).  Petitioner denied any association with the apartment building where the car had been parked, but his girlfriend admitted that she lived there and consented to a search of her residence.  The officers who conducted the search uncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, including an identification card, cocaine, three firearms, ammunition, and a bulletproof vest.  The police arrested petitioner the next day.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a)(1).  The August 24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day clock.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73161(c)(1).  After petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arraignment on September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling order requiring, <em>inter alia</em>, that the parties file pretrial motions by September 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the deadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to September 21.  The Magistrate Judge granted the motion and extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request, to September 25.  On September 25, however, petitioner filed a \xe2\x80\x9cWaiver of Pretrial Motions\xe2\x80\x9d advising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial motions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to consider petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver,\xe2\x80\x9d at which petitioner confirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial motions.  After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the next three months, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial was delayed for several reasons.  Though these delays are not directly relevant to the question presented here, we recount them to explain the full context in which that question arises.  On November 8, petitioner moved to continue the trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional time to prepare for trial.  The District Court granted the motion and reset the trial for December 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties then met informally and prepared a plea agreement, which they provided to the court.  The District Court scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20.  At the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement the agreement and requested a new attorney.  The District Court rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent motion to withdraw, and appointed new counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 19, 2007\xe2\x80\x94179 days after petitioner was indicted\xe2\x80\x94petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day limit had elapsed.  The District Court denied the motion.  In calculating how many of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the District Judge excluded the period from September 7 through October 4 as \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the extension of time granted to file pretrial motions.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Order in No. 4:06CR518\xe2\x80\x93SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s docket, which required the court to reschedule petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  After obtaining the consent of the parties and finding that a continuance would serve the public interest, the District Court continued petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s 2-day trial began on that date.  The jury found petitioner guilty on both counts and the District Court later sentenced him to concurrent 30-year terms of\nimprisonment.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the Eighth Circuit, which affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation.  As relevant, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the time from September 7 (the original deadline for filing pretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court held a hearing on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s decision to waive the right to file pretrial motions) was excludable from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day limit.  Although the District Court did not identify which provision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of Appeals held that \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion preparation time\xe2\x80\x9d is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x94which covers \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as long as \xe2\x80\x9cthe [district] court specifically grants time for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  534 F.\xc2\xa03d,\xc2\xa0at 897.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In reaching this conclusion, the Eighth Circuit joined seven other Courts of Appeals that interpret subsection (h)(1) the same way.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Two Courts of Appeals, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits, interpret subsection (h)(1) differently, holding that time for preparing pretrial motions is outside subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial commence within 70 days of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from the 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay.  Section 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are excludable from the calculation.  Some of these delays are excludable only if the district court makes certain findings enumerated in the statute.  See \xc2\xa73161(h)(7).  Other delays are automatically excludable, <em>i.e.</em>, they may be excluded without district court findings.  As relevant here, subsection (h)(1) requires the automatic exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d periods of delay resulting from eight enumerated subcategories of proceedings.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Government contends that the time the District Court granted petitioner to prepare his pretrial motions is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1).  We disagree, and conclude that such time may be excluded only when a district court enters appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The eight subparagraphs in subsection (h)(1) address the automatic excludability of delay generated for certain enumerated purposes.  Thus, we first consider whether the delay at issue in this case is governed by one of these subparagraphs.  It is.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner sufficient time to file pretrial motions.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)) renders automatically excludable \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Read, as it must be, in the context of subsection (h), this text governs the automatic excludability of delays \xe2\x80\x9cresulting\xe2\x80\x9d from a specific category of \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings concerning the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, proceedings involving pretrial motions.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Because the delay at issue here results from a decision granting time to prepare pretrial motions, if not from a pretrial motion itself (the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional time), it is governed by subparagraph (D).  But that does not make the delay at issue here automatically excludable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay to automatic exclusion.  Instead, it renders automatically excludable only the delay that occurs \xe2\x80\x9c<em>from the</em> <em>filing</em> of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of\xe2\x80\x9d the motion.  (Emphasis added.)  In so doing, the provision communicates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that delay resulting from pretrial motions is automatically excludable, <em>i.e</em>., excludable without district court findings, <em>only</em> from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point specified in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pretrial motion-related delay are excludable only when accompanied by district court findings.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This limitation is significant because Congress knew how to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion broadly when it so desired.  Subsection (h)(1)(A) (hereinafter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the automatic exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any proceeding, <em>including </em>any examinations, to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  With the word \xe2\x80\x9cincluding,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress indicated that other competency-related proceedings besides \xe2\x80\x9cexaminations\xe2\x80\x9d might fall within subparagraph (A)\xe2\x80\x99s automatic exclusion.  In subparagraph (D), by contrast, Congress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term such as \xe2\x80\x9cincluding,\xe2\x80\x9d and provided instead that only pretrial motion-related delay \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the filing\xe2\x80\x9d of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically excludable from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day limit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, although the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay may be automatically excluded.  The result is that the pretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is not automatically excludable.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into automatic excludability because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] specific provision\xe2\x80\x9d (here, subparagraph (D)) \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols one[s] of more general application\xe2\x80\x9d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).  <em>Gozlon-Peretz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/395/index.html">498 U.

In arguing that this principle applies, but requires a result different from the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government and several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more specific than the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d language in subsection (h)(1), <em>post</em>, at 2, 6, or that \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons, Inc.</em> v. <em>Popkin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/204/index.html">285 U. S. 204</a>, 208 (1932).  We part company with the dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D) governs the period of delay at issue in this case.  The dissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground that it is foreclosed by the statute.  See <em>post, </em>at 5 (asserting that the delay at issue in this case is \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily\xe2\x80\x9d covered by subparagraph (D)).  Instead, it joins the Government in asserting that the Act is amenable to another interpretation that would avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cstrange result\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner may be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because his attorney persuaded a Magistrate Judge to give the defense additional time to prepare pretrial motions and thus delayed the commencement of his trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1.  This argument takes aim at an exaggerated target.  Because we conclude that the type of delay at issue here is excludable under subsection (h)(7), courts can in future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries, a result that is not certain even in this case.  See <em>infra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  And even if dismissal is ultimately required on remand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify reading subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to \xe2\x80\x9cother proceedings concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d) to permit automatic exclusion of delay resulting from virtually any decision to continue a deadline.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because the provision\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclusion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated subparagraphs.  See <em>post</em>, at 3; see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oberoi</em>, 547 F.\xc2\xa03d 436, 450 (CA2 2008).  This argument confuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s list of categories of excludable delay (each of which is represented by a subparagraph) with the contents of the categories themselves.  That the list of categories is illustrative rather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclusion that a delay that falls <em>within </em>the category of delay addressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits in that subparagraph.  The \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d clause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to modify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list itself.  As noted, such a reading would violate settled principles of statutory construction because it would ignore the structure and grammar of subsection (h)(1), and in so doing render even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous.

The problem with this reading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection (h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding concerning the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus threatens the Act\xe2\x80\x99s manifest purpose of ensuring speedy trials by construing the Act\xe2\x80\x99s automatic exclusion exceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day rule.  This approach is not justified, much less compelled, by the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon which the dissent relies.  Nor is it justified by the prospect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in this case.  Hence our conclusion that the text and structure of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion of the delay at issue in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion is further supported by subsection (h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7).  Subsection (h)(7) provides that delays \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from a continuance granted by any judge\xe2\x80\x9d <em>may</em> be excluded, but only if the judge finds that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial\xe2\x80\x9d and records those findings.  In setting forth the statutory factors that justify a continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time.  See \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court to consider whether the \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex\xe2\x80\x9d nature of a case makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable to expect <em>adequate preparation</em> for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(B)(iv) (requiring a district court to consider in other cases \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether the failure to grant such a continuance . . . would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the <em>reasonable time necessary for effective preparation</em>, taking into account the exercise of due diligence\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Our determination that the delay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where district court makes findings justifying the exclusion.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Cf<em>. post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (construing subsection (h)(1) in a manner that could encompass, and govern, delays expressly within subsection (h)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s purview).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, our Speedy Trial Act precedents support our reading of subsection (h)(1).  We recently explained that the Act serves not only to protect defendants, but also to vindicate the public interest in the swift administration of justice.  We thus held that a defendant may not opt out of the Act even if he believes it would be in his interest; \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine the Act because there are many cases . . . in which the prosecution, the defense, and the court would all be happy to opt out of the Act, to the detriment of the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zedner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/489/index.html">547 U. S. 489</a>, 502 (2006).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to provide defendants adequate time to build their defense.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v.<em> Mobile Materials, Inc.</em>, 871 F. 2d 902, 913 <em>(per curiam)</em>, opinion supplemented on other grounds on rehearing, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 866 (CA10 1989) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Yet these same courts have recognized that reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude <em>all</em> time for preparing pretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a speedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have recognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or both parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it.  See <em>Zedner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 502.  To avoid a result so inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid creating a big loophole in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> United States </em>v.<em> Tibboel</em>, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985)\xe2\x80\x94these courts have found it necessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion for pretrial motion preparation time that their interpretation of subsection (h)(1) otherwise would allow.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid.</em> (stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be automatically excluded under subsection (h)(1) only when<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c<em>the judge has expressly granted a party time for that purpose</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Oberoi</em>, 547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 450 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis . . . qualification prevents abuse.  Without it, either party \xe2\x80\x98could delay trial indefinitely merely by working on pretrial motions right up to the eve of trial\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that courts reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on excludability to avoid \xe2\x80\x9ccreating a big loophole in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Tibboel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 610, underscores the extent to which their interpretation\xe2\x80\x94and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94strays from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose.  As noted, subsection (h)(7) expressly accounts for the possibility that a district court would need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate preparation time.  An exclusion under subsection (h)(7) is not automatic, however, and requires specific findings.  Allowing district courts to exclude automatically such delays would redesign this statutory framework.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also note that some of the Courts of Appeals that have interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a contrary reading of that provision would lay \xe2\x80\x9ca trap for trial judges\xe2\x80\x9d by forcing them to risk a Speedy Trial Act violation if they wish to grant a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional time to prepare a pretrial motion, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson</em>, 835 F.\xc2\xa02d 1440, 1444 (CADC 1987); see also <em>Oberoi</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 450.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to interpret the Speedy Trial Act to \xe2\x80\x9ctrap\xe2\x80\x9d district courts for accommodating a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions, particularly in a case like this.    Petitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for the final continuance from February 26 to March 5.  And the record clearly shows that the Magistrate Judge and the District Court diligently endeavored to accommodate petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s requests\xe2\x80\x94granting his motion for an extension of time to decide whether to file pretrial motions, his motion for a continuance, and his motion for a new attorney and for time to allow this new attorney to become familiar with the case.  Fortunately, we can abide by the limitations Congress imposed on the statutory rights at issue here without interpreting the Act in a manner that would trap trial courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons we explained above, neither subparagraph (D) nor subsection (h)(1) automatically excludes time granted to prepare pretrial motions.  This conclusion does not lay a \xe2\x80\x9ctrap for trial judges\xe2\x80\x9d because it limits (in a way the statute requires) only automatic exclusions.  In considering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of time will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to devote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay are justified, given both the statutory and constitutional requirement of speedy trials.  Placing these reasons in the record does not add an appreciable burden on these judges.  Neither are district courts forced to choose between rejecting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial.  Instead, a district court may exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it grants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings \xe2\x80\x9cthat the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Subsection (h)(7) provides \xe2\x80\x9c[m]uch of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zedner</em>, 547 U. S., at 498, and gives district courts \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion\xe2\x80\x94within limits and subject to specific procedures\xe2\x80\x94to accommodate limited delays for case-specific needs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 499.  The statutory scheme thus ensures that district courts may grant necessary pretrial motion preparation time without risking dismissal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a district court may fail to make the findings necessary for an exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day limit.  Dismissal, however, need not represent a windfall.  A district court may dismiss the charges <em>without</em> <em>prejudice</em>, thus allowing the Government to refile charges or reindict the defendant.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73162(a)(1).  In ruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district court should consider, among other factors, the party responsible for the delay.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cIn determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the [district] court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; <em>the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal</em>; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/326/index.html">487 U. S. 326</a>, 343 (1988) (\xe2\x80\x9cSeemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respondent, as well as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s own illicit contribution to the delay\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period from September 7 through October 4, which includes the additional time granted by the District Court for pretrial motion preparation, is not automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1).  The Court of Appeals did not address whether any portion of that time might have been otherwise excludable.  Nor did the Government assert in its merits brief that another provision of the Act could support exclusion, presenting the argument that September 25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in its brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argument.  We therefore do not consider whether any other exclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period.  Instead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The excludability of delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from . . . proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d under subsection (h)(1) is \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that a district court must exclude such delay from a Speedy Trial Act calculation without any further analysis as to whether the benefit of the delay outweighs its cost.

That is because the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d leaves ample room to conclude that the delay at issue here is \xe2\x80\x9ca consequence of\xe2\x80\x9d the category of proceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay \xe2\x80\x9cas a consequence of\xe2\x80\x9d a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or \xe2\x80\x9cas a consequence of\xe2\x80\x9d a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for additional time).  At bottom, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position is not that our interpretation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is preferable.  We disagree because the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, among other things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsection (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)\xe2\x80\x99s text, but also from its structure.  As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the 70-day period \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this case, the comma after the first phrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of excludable delay referred to in the first.  Thus, subparagraph (D)\xe2\x80\x99s automatic exclusion for delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d a pretrial motion is limited to delay that occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identified in the provision.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Whether the defendant actually files a pretrial motion for which he requests additional time is irrelevant to this analysis.  Even if he files such a motion, that filing may not be used to bootstrap into the period of automatically excludable delay <em>pre</em>-filing preparation time that subparagraph (D) does not render automatically excludable.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent argues that the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d in this case is the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for additional time to file pretrial motions.  See <em>post</em>, at 2.  If that were correct, any order disposing of a motion\xe2\x80\x94including a pretrial motion under subparagraph (D)\xe2\x80\x94would be a separate \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d and any resulting delay would be automatically excludable.   The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading renders superfluous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the exclusion of time necessary for \xe2\x80\x9cadequate preparation for pretrial proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(B)(ii), and \xe2\x80\x9ceffective preparation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(B)(iv).

As noted, subsection (h)(7) twice refers to preparation time to explain the kinds of continuances that a court may grant in the interests of justice.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(B)(ii), (h)(7)(B)(iv).   Congress easily could have referred to preparation time similarly in subsection (h)(1).  See, <em>e.g</em>., Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, H.\xc2\xa0R. 3630, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa75(c) (1979) (proposing to exclude under subparagraph (D) all \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from <em>the preparation</em> and service of pretrial motions and responses and from hearings thereon\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Congress did not do so, and we are bound to enforce only the language that Congress and the President enacted.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Our interpretation of the Act accords with this and other precedents in a way the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not.<em> </em>In <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/321/index.html">476 U.

Such careful parsing would seem unnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not conclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the category of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay may simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963150">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nGINSBURG, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nBLOATE V.

I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the understanding that nothing in the opinion bars the Eighth Circuit from considering, on remand, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the indictment, and convictions under it, remain effective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bloate moved, on September 7, 2006, to extend the deadline for filing pretrial motions.  The Magistrate Judge granted Bloate\xe2\x80\x99s request that same day, extending the deadline from September 13 to September 25.  Having gained more time, Bloate decided that pretrial motions were unnecessary after all.  Accordingly, on September 25, he filed a proposed waiver of his right to file such motions.  On October 4, the Magistrate Judge accepted the waiver following a hearing at which the judge found the waiver knowing and voluntary.  As urged by the Government, even if the clock continued to run from September 7,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cit stopped on September 25, when [Bloate] filed a pleading advising the court that he had decided not to raise any issues by pretrial motion. . . . Although not labeled a pretrial motion, that pleading required a hearing . . . and served essentially as a motion for leave to waive the right to file pretrial motions. . . . The [Speedy Trial Act] clock thus stopped . . . under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. 3161(h)(1)[(D)] until the matter was heard by the court on October 4, 2006.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBy the Government\xe2\x80\x99s measure, excluding the time from September 25 through October 4 would reduce the number of days that count for Speedy Trial Act purposes to 65, 5 days short of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day threshold.  See <em>id.,</em> at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government reiterated this contention at oral argument.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if the time starting on September 7th [i]s not excluded,\xe2\x80\x9d counsel said, Bloate\xe2\x80\x99s September 25 filing \xe2\x80\x9ctrigger[ed] its own exclusion of time\xe2\x80\x9d until the hearing held by the Magistrate Judge on October 4.

As a court of ultimate review, we are not positioned to determine, in the first instance, and without full briefing and argument, whether the time from September 25 to October 4 should be excluded from the Speedy Trial Act calculation.

Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, petitioner may be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because his attorney persuaded a Magistrate Judge to give the defense additional time to prepare pretrial motions and thus delayed the commencement of his trial.  The Speedy Trial Act does not require this strange result.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Speedy Trial Act generally requires a federal criminal trial to begin within 70 days after the defendant is charged or appears in court, but certain pretrial periods are excluded from the 70-day calculation.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa73161 (2000 ed. and Supp. 2009).  The provision at issue here, \xc2\xa73161(h)(1) (Supp. 2009), automatically excludes \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d eight specific types of delay that are set out in subparagraphs (A)\xe2\x80\x93(H).  Eight Courts of Appeals have held[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]\xe2\x80\x94and I agree\xe2\x80\x94that a delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for additional time to complete pretrial motions is a delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from [a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d and is thus automatically excluded under \xc2\xa73161(h)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In considering the question presented here, I begin with the general language of \xc2\xa73161(h)(1), which, as noted, automatically excludes any \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  (For convenience, I will refer to this portion of the statute as \xe2\x80\x9csubsection (h)(1).\xe2\x80\x9d)  The delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial motions falls comfortably within the terms of subsection (h)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the granting of such a defense request qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  A court proceeding is defined as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n act or step that is part of a larger action\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can act done by the authority or direction of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1324 (9th ed. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law).  The granting of a defense request for an extension of time to prepare pretrial motions constitutes both \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n act or step that is part of [the] larger [criminal case]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can act done by the authority or direction of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, delay caused by the granting of such an extension is obviously \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from\xe2\x80\x9d the successful extension request.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not contend that the granting of a defense request for time to prepare pretrial motions falls outside the plain meaning of subsection (h)(1), but the Court holds that \xc2\xa73161(h)(1)(D) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)) narrows the meaning of subsection (h)(1).  Subparagraph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that are specifically identified as \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from [a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d but as noted, this list is preceded by the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen \xe2\x80\x98include\xe2\x80\x99 is utilized, it is generally improper to conclude that entities not specifically enumerated are excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d  2A N. Singer &amp; J.\xc2\xa0Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa747.23, p. 417 (7th ed. 2007).

And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the additional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnot limited to\xe2\x80\x9d reinforces this point.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Tibboel</em>, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to show that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the general rule set out in subsection (h)(1).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that subparagraph (D) governs not just \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73161(h)(1)(D), but also delay resulting from \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings <em>involving</em> pretrial motions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, and n.\xc2\xa09 (emphasis added), and \xe2\x80\x9call pretrial motion-<em>related</em> delay,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 8 (emphasis added).  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, Congress has expressed a judgment that if a period of \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related delay\xe2\x80\x9d does not fall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it is \xe2\x80\x9cexcludable only when accompanied by district court findings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  Thus, since subparagraph (D) does not provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for more time to prepare pretrial motions, the Court holds that such delay is not excluded from the 70-day calculation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, is not supported by either the text of subparagraph (D) or the circumstances that gave rise to its enactment.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument would have some force if it were clear that the delay involved in the present case is \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from [a] pretrial motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73161(h)(1)(D).  It could then be argued that subparagraph (D) reflects a legislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion of delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay occurs during the period \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is at least doubtful, however, that the delay at issue in the present case is delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from [a] pretrial motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</em>  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cproceed[ing], spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect, or conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1937 (1971).  Thus, delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d a pretrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion.  The type of delay involved in the present case, however, does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial motion; rather, it occurs as a consequence of the court\xe2\x80\x99s granting of a defense request for an extension of time.  The particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this point because petitioner never filed pretrial motions.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is telling that the Court elides the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d and substitutes a broader phrase of its own invention.  The Court writes that \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related delay\xe2\x80\x9d that is not captured by subparagraph (D)\xe2\x80\x99s text is \xe2\x80\x9cexcludable only when accompanied by district court findings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cSubparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay to automatic exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly pretrial motion-related delay \xe2\x80\x98from the filing\xe2\x80\x99 of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically excludable\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa014 (\xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related delay\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  But \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related delay\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d a pretrial motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9crelated [to],\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 9, there are at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading.  First, because subparagraphs (A)\xe2\x80\x93(H) are meant to be illustrative, those provisions should not be interpreted as limiting unless the limitation is very clear.  Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of subparagraph (D) leads to an anomalous result that Congress is unlikely to have intended.  Because subparagraph (D) automatically excludes \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion,\xe2\x80\x9d it is clear that subparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting from the granting of <em>a prosecution request</em> for additional time to respond to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial motions.  The Court has not identified any reason why Congress might have wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay resulting from the granting of a prosecution request for additional time to respond to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial motions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional time to prepare those very motions.  Since there is nothing to suggest that Congress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should be rejected.  Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply only to delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from [a] pretrial motion,\xe2\x80\x9d and because the delay involved here does not result from a pretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that subparagraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the scope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the current version of subparagraph (D) in 1979 point to the same conclusion.  That language was adopted to <em>expand</em> the reach of the exclusion.  As originally enacted, the relevant provision of the Act excluded only \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from hearings on pretrial motions,\xe2\x80\x9d 88 Stat. 2078, and courts had interpreted this language literally to exclude only time actually devoted to hearings.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, 425 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1166, 1171 (Conn. 1977); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Conroy</em>, No. 77 Cr. 607 (CHT), 1978 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 19296, *4 (SDNY, Mar. 1, 1978); accord, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Simms</em>, 508 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1175, 1177\xe2\x80\x931178 (WD La. 1979).  The House Judiciary Committee stated that the language on which the Court now relies was added \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation of the exclusion as extending only to the actual time consumed in a pretrial hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  H. R. Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x93390, p. 10 (1979).  Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed frustration with what it described as the courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessarily inflexible\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of the Act.  S. Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x93212, p. 18 (1979) (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0Rep.).  See also <em>id.,</em> at 26.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expansion of the exclusion set out in subparagraph (D) so that it covers, not just the time taken up by hearings on pretrial motions, but all delay resulting from pretrial motions does not support the inference that Congress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to count against the Speedy Trial Act\xe2\x80\x99s 70-day period.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contending that Congress could have been more explicit if it \xe2\x80\x9cwished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation time automatically,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court cites as an example a legislative proposal by the Department of Justice to provide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pretrial motions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa013.  The Court is correct that Congress did not choose this option, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument misses the point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it bears emphasizing that the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a successful defense request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions.  That is the delay in dispute here.  Instead, the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s proposal excluded all \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses from hearings thereon.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. 961, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa75 (1979) (as introduced).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the reasons given in the Senate Judiciary Committee report for rejecting the Justice Department proposal do not apply when the delay results from the granting of a defense request such as the one at issue here.  The Senate Committee report noted that, when excluding time for the preparation of pretrial motions, it will be \xe2\x80\x9cquite difficult to determine a point at which preparation actually begins.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep., at 34.  But when a district court grants a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion for time to prepare pretrial motions, that concern is not present.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oberoi</em>, 547 F. 3d 436, 451 (CA2 2008) (noting the importance of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s expressly stopping the speedy trial clock to create a point from which to measure preparation time).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In addition, the Committee expressed the view that \xe2\x80\x9cin routine cases, preparation time should not be excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 34.  However, cases in which a district court accedes to a defense request for more than the usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial motions are by definition not routine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there is no reason why Congress should have supposed that the language that Congress and the President enacted did not reach delay resulting from the granting of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions.  As explained above, <em>supra,</em> at 2, 4\xe2\x80\x936, such delay results from a proceeding concerning\nthe defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, (1) delay resulting from the granting of a defense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial motions falls within the general rule, set out in subsection (h)(1), that automatically excludes delay \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from [a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant;\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the subparagraphs that follow, which are preceded by the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincluding but not limited to,\xe2\x80\x9d are illustrative, not exhaustive; and (3) neither the text of subparagraph (D) nor the circumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an intent to narrow the scope of the general rule set out in subsection (h)(1).  For these reasons, I would hold that the delay in question here is automatically excluded.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court advances several additional arguments in support of its analysis, but none is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two of these arguments hinge on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unjustifiably broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), <em>i.e.</em>, that it covers all \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, the Court reasons that under a contrary interpretation, \xe2\x80\x9ca court could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that the incursion on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness guarantee is justified, the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the Act sets a default limit of 70 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 13.  But the same is true of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Even under an interpretation that automatically excludes delay \xe2\x80\x9c<em>only</em> from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9, there appears to be no reason why a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the automatically excludable period of time under subparagraph (D) through any number of means, including: (1) extending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Latham</em>, No. 82\xe2\x80\x93CR\xe2\x80\x93890, 1983 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 14219, *1\xe2\x80\x93*3 (ND Ill., Aug. 30, 1983); (3) allowing pre-hearing supplemental briefing, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Faison</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x934332, 2007 U. S. App. LEXIS 23298, *6\xe2\x80\x93*9 (CA4, Oct. 4, 2007); (4) deferring the hearing on a pretrial motion, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Riley</em>, 991 F. 2d 120, 124 (CA4 1993); (5) conducting multiple hearings on the motion or motions, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Boone</em>, Crim. No. 00\xe2\x80\x933, 2002 WL 31761364, *20, n. 12 (D NJ, Dec. 6, 2002); or (6) allowing the filing of post hearing submissions, see <em>Henderson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/321/index.html">476 U. S. 321</a>, 324 (1986).  Indeed, in <em>Henderson</em> we held that 295 days of delay resulting from the filing of a pretrial motion were automatically excludable, and we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress was aware of the breadth of the exclusion it was enacting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 327.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary to protect the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctimeliness guarantee,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, is illusory.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For a similar reason, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is not supported by the rule of construction that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] specific provision\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98controls one[s] of more general application.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 10.  This rule applies only when specific and general statutory provisions conflict.  <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Gulf Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/327/index.html">534 U. S. 327</a>, 335\xe2\x80\x93336 (2002).  Here, there is no conflict because, even if subparagraph (D) governs \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no basis for concluding that subparagraph (D) governs all \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial motion-related delay.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim, its decision is not supported by \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(A), which excludes \xe2\x80\x9cdelay resulting from a continuance\xe2\x80\x9d provided that the trial court \xe2\x80\x9csets forth, in the record of the case, \xe2\x80\xa6 its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  One might argue that a trial judge grants a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuance\xe2\x80\x9d whenever the judge postpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the direct result of a proceeding that falls squarely within the language of subsection (h)(1) or one of the specific illustrative subparagraphs that follow.  See \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny period of delay resulting from a continuance\xe2\x80\x9d).  But such a reading would render subsection (h)(1) and subparagraphs (A)\xe2\x80\x93(H) meaningless if it were true that all continuances required ends-of-justice findings.  The plain terms of subsection (h)(1) refute this interpretation and show that Congress intended for some periods of delay that postpone the trial date to be automatically excludable.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewed in their proper context, subsection (h)(1) and its subparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(A) requiring ends-of-justice findings for continuances.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aviles-Alvarez</em>, 868 F.\xc2\xa02d 1108, 1112 (CA9 1989) (noting that when pretrial motion delay is automatically excluded, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not have to make findings or consider any factors\xe2\x80\x9d).  A period of delay resulting from a continuance requires ends-of-justice findings only when it does not also fall within the subset of automatically excludable delay defined by subsection (h)(1).  When a period of delay resulting from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclusion, a court ordinarily should give effect to the more specific provisions of subsection (h)(1).  See <em>Gozlon-Peretz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/395/index.html">498 U. S. 395</a>, 407 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cA specific provision controls over one of more general application\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons discussed, see <em>supra</em>, at 2, the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial motions is a \xe2\x80\x9cproceedin[g] concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of subsection (h)(1).  It may also qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuance\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa73161(h)(7)(A) if the delay has the effect of pushing back the trial date.  But a court should resolve the conflict by applying the more specific provision of subsection (h)(1).  This result is faithful not only to the plain language of the statute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of exceptions to the general rule that continuances require ends-of-justice findings.  And it also recognizes that when defense counsel argues that adequate pretrial motions cannot be completed within the time allotted and is granted an extension, it will generally go without saying that the judge has considered whether the ends of justice will be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to recite this determination on the record will often be an empty exercise.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not believe that its interpretation will have serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by making the on-the-record findings required under \xc2\xa73161(h)(7), may exclude delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial motions.  As this case illustrates, however, there will be cases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges will fail to make those findings, and indictments will be dismissed for no good reason.  If requiring findings on the record were cost- and risk-free, Congress would not have provided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category of delay encompassed by \xc2\xa73161(h)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation occurs because of delay caused by an extension requested by the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment without prejudice.  But as we have recognized, even when a new indictment may be obtained, \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial delay may well make reprosecution . . . unlikely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/326/index.html">487 U. S. 326</a>, 342 (1988).
