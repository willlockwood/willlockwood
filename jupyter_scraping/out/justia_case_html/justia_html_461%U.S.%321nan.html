His parents are Mexican citizens who reside in Reynosa, Mexico.  He left Reynosa in 1977 and returned to McAllen to live with his sister, petitioner Oralia Martinez, for the primary purpose of attending </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 461 U. S. 323</a></p><p> school in the McAllen Independent School District.  Although Martinez is now his custodian, she is not -- and does not desire to become -- his guardian. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  As a result, Morales is not entitled to tuition-free admission to the McAllen schools.  Sections 21.031(b) and (c) of the Texas Education Code would require the local school authorities to admit him if he or "his parent, guardian, or the person having lawful control of him" resided in the school district, Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 21.031(b) and (c) (Supp.1982), but \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) denies tuition-free admission for a minor who lives apart from a "parent, guardian, or other person having lawful control of him under an order of a court" if his presence in the school district is "for the primary purpose of attending the public free schools." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Respondent McAllen Independent School District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 461 U. S. 324</a></p><p> therefore denied Morales\' application for admission in the fall of 1977.</p>\n<p>In December, 1977, Martinez, as next friend of Morales, and four other adult custodians of school-age children instituted the present action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the Texas Commissioner of Education, the Texas Education Agency, four local School Districts, and various local school officials in those Districts.  Plaintiffs initially alleged that \xc2\xa7 21.031(d), both on its face and as applied by defendants, violated certain provisions of the Constitution, including the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Plaintiffs also sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied a preliminary injunction in August, 1978.  It found</p>\n<p>"that the school boards . . . have been more than liberal in finding that certain children are not living away from parents and residing in the school district for the sole purpose of attending school."</p>\n<p>App. 20a.  The evidence "conclusively" showed</p>\n<p>"that children living within the school districts with someone other than their parents or legal guardians will be admitted to school if <em>any</em> reason exists for such situation other than that of attending school only."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="325">Page 461 U. S. 325</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs subsequently amended the complaint to narrow their claims.  They now seek only "a declaration that . . . \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) is unconstitutional on its face," <em>id.</em> at 3a, an injunction prohibiting defendants from denying the children admission to school pursuant to \xc2\xa7 21.031(d), restitution of certain tuition payments, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] costs, and attorney\'s fees.  App. 3a, 7a.  After a hearing on the merits, the District Court granted judgment for the defendants.  <em>Arredondo v. Brockette,</em> 482 F.Supp. 212 (1979).  The court concluded that \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) was justified by the State\'s</p>\n<p>"legitimate interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its educational system and the right of its own bona fide residents to attend state schools on a preferred tuition basis."</p>\n<p>482 F.Supp. at 222.  In an appeal by two plaintiffs, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  648 F.2d 425 (1981).  In view of the importance of the issue, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] we granted certiorari.  457 U.S. 1131 (1982).  We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court frequently has considered constitutional challenges to residence requirements.  On several occasions, the Court has invalidated requirements that condition receipt of a benefit on a minimum period of residence within a jurisdiction, but it always has been careful to distinguish such durational residence requirements from bona fide residence requirements.  In <em>Shapiro v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html">394 U. S. 618</a></span> (1969), for example, the Court invalidated one-year durational residence requirements that applicants for public assistance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 461 U. S. 326</a></p><p> benefits were required to satisfy despite the fact that they otherwise had "met the test for residence in their jurisdictions," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html#627">394 U. S. 627</a></span>.  JUSTICE BRENNAN, writing for the Court, stressed that "[t]he residence requirement and the one-year waiting-period requirement are distinct and independent prerequisites for assistance," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html#636">394 U. S. 636</a></span>, and carefully</p>\n<p>"impl[ied] no view of he validity of waiting period or residence requirements determining eligibility to vote, eligibility for tuition-free education, to obtain a license to practice a profession, to hunt or fish, and so forth,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html#638">394 U.

S. 330</a></span> (1972), the Court similarly invalidated Tennessee laws requiring a prospective voter to have been a state resident for one year and a county resident for three months, but it explicitly distinguished these durational residence requirements from bona fide residence requirements, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html#334">405 U.

JUSTICE MARSHALL, writing for the Court, again emphasized that "States have the power to require that voters be bona fide residents of the relevant political subdivision."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html#343">405 U.

A bona fide residence requirement simply requires that the person does establish residence before demanding the services that are restricted to residents.</p>\n<p>There is a further, independent justification for local residence requirements in the public school context.

S. 717</a></span> (1974):</p>\n<p>"No single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for public schools and to quality of the educational process. . . .  [L]ocal control over the educational process affords citizens an opportunity to participate in decisionmaking, permits the structuring of school programs to fit local needs, and encourages \'experimentation, innovation, and a healthy competition for educational excellence.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/717/case.html#741">418 U.

The provision of primary and secondary education, of course, is one of the most important functions of local government.  Absent residence requirements, there can be little doubt that the proper planning and operation of the schools would suffer significantly. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The State thus has a substantial interest in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 461 U. S. 330</a></p><p> imposing bona fide residence requirements to maintain the quality of local public schools.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The central question we must decide here is whether \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) is a bona fide residence requirement. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Although the meaning may vary according to context, "residence" generally requires both physical presence and an intention to remain. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As the Supreme Court of Maine explained over a century ago: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 461 U. S. 331</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"When . . . a person voluntarily takes up his abode in a given place, with intention to remain permanently, or for an indefinite period of time; or, to speak more accurately, when a person takes up his abode in a given place, without any present intention to remove therefrom, such place of abode becomes his residence. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Inhabitants of Warren v. Inhabitants of Thomaston,</em> 43 Me. 406, 418 (1857).  This classic two-part definition of residence has been recognized as a minimum standard in a wide range of contexts time and time again. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Vlandis v. Kline,</em> we approved a more rigorous domicile test as a "reasonable standard for determining the residential status of a student."  412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/441/case.html#454">412 U. S. 454</a></span>.  That standard was described as follows:</p>\n<p>"\'In reviewing a claim of in-state status, the issue becomes essentially one of domicile.  In general, the domicile of an individual is his true, fixed and permanent home and place of habitation.  It is the place to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (quoting Opinion of the Attorney General of the State of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 461 U. S. 332</a></p><p> Connecticut Regarding Non-Resident Tuition, Sept. 6, 1972); <em>cf.</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra.</em>  This standard could not be applied to school-age children in the same way that it was applied to college students.  But at the very least, a school district generally would be justified in requiring school-age children or their parents to satisfy the traditional, basic residence criteria -- <em>i.e.,</em> to live in the district with a bona fide intention of remaining there [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] -- before it treated them as residents.</p>\n<p>Section 21.031 is far more generous than this traditional standard.  It compels a school district to permit a child such as Morales to attend school without paying tuition if he has a bona fide intention to remain in the school district indefinitely, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] for he then would have a reason for being there other than his desire to attend school:  his intention to make his home in the district. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Thus, \xc2\xa7 21.031 grants the benefits of residency to all who satisfy the traditional requirements.  The statute goes further and extends these benefits to many </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 461 U. S. 333</a></p><p> children even if they (or their families) do not intend to remain in the district indefinitely.  As long as the child is not living in the district for the sole purpose of attending school, he satisfies the statutory test.  For example, if a person comes to Texas to work for a year, his children will be eligible for tuition-free admission to the public schools.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 37.  Or if a child comes to Texas for six months for health reasons, he would qualify for tuition-free education.  <em>See id.</em> at 31.  In short, \xc2\xa7 21.031 grants the benefits of residency to everyone who satisfies the traditional residence definition and to some who legitimately could be classified as nonresidents.  Since there is no indication that this extension of the traditional definition has any impermissible basis, we certainly cannot say that \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Constitution permits a State to restrict eligibility for tuition-free education to its bona fide residents.  We hold that \xc2\xa7 21.031 is a bona fide residence requirement that satisfies constitutional standards.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals accordingly is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 51.02(4) of the Texas Family Code defines "custodian" as "the adult with whom the child resides."  Tex.Fam.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 51.02(4) (1975).  "Guardian" is defined as "the person who, under court order, is the guardian of the person of the child or the public or private agency with whom the child has been placed by a court."  \xc2\xa7 51.02(3).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 21.031 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p>"(b) Every child in this state . . . who is over the age of five years and not over the age of 21 years on the first day of September of the year in which admission is sought shall be permitted to attend the public free schools of the district in which he resides or in which his parent, guardian, or the person having lawful control of him resides at the time he applies for admission."</p>\n<p>"(c) The board of trustees of any public free school district of this state shall admit into the public free schools of the district free of tuition all persons . . . who are over five and not over 21 years of age at the beginning of the scholastic year if such person or his parent, guardian or person having lawful control resides within the school district."</p>\n<p>"(d) In order for a person under the age of 18 years to establish a residence for the purpose of attending the public free schools separate and apart from his parent, guardian, or other person having lawful control of him under an order of a court, it must be established that his presence in the school district is not for the primary purpose of attending the public free schools.  The board of trustees shall be responsible for determining whether an applicant for admission is a resident of the school district for purposes of attending the public schools."</p>\n<p>Although the "special purpose" test was not codified in \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) until 1977, it had been a feature of Texas common law since at least 1905.  <em>See, e.g., De Leon v.

In upholding the statute, the Court does not pass on its validity as applied to children in a range of specific factual contexts.  In particular, the Court does not decide whether the statute is constitutional as applied to Roberto Morales, a United States citizen whose parents are nonresident aliens.  If this question were before the Court, I believe that a different set of considerations would be implicated which might affect significantly an analysis of the statute\'s constitutionality. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 461 U. S. 334</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Roberto Morales reached his eighth birthday, he left his parents\' home in Reynosa, Mexico, and returned to his birthplace, McAllen, Tex.  He planned to make his home there with his married sister (petitioner) in order to attend school and learn English.  Morales has resided with his sister in McAllen for the past five years, and intends to remain with her until he has completed his schooling.  The Texas statute grants free public education to every shool-age child who resides in Texas except for one who lives apart from his parents or guardian for educational purposes.  Accordingly, Morales has been refused free admission to the schools in the McAllen district.</p>\n<p>The majority upholds the classification embodied in the Texas statute on the ground that it applies only to the class of children who are considered nonresidents.  The majority\'s approach reflects a misinterpretation of the Texas statute, a misunderstanding of the concept of residence, and a misapplication of this Court\'s past decisions concerning the constitutionality of residence requirements.  In my view, the statutory classification, which deprives some children of an education because of their motive for residing in Texas, is not adequately justified by the asserted state interests.  Because I would hold the statute unconstitutional on its face under the Equal Protection Clause, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the outset, it is important to make clear that the statute upheld by the Court is not the statute actually before us.  Petitioner challenges the constitutionality of the classification created by the Texas statutes governing eligibility for admission to the local free schools.  Under Texas law, a child who lives in the State may generally attend school where he lives.  Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 21.031(b) (Supp.1982-1983).  This is true whether the child lives with his parents or guardian, or lives apart from them under the care and control of a "custodian," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 461 U. S. 335</a></p><p> who is a responsible adult other than a parent or guardian to whom the child may or may not be related.  Tex.Fam.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 51.02(4) (1975). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Section 21.031 creates an exception, however, for children whose "presence in the school district is . . . for the primary purpose of attending the public free schools."  \xc2\xa7 21.031(d).  Those children must reside with "[a] parent, guardian, or other person having lawful control," <em>ibid.,</em> to receive free education.  If they reside with a custodian, they are denied free public education.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Court does not address the constitutionality of the classification contained in the statute.  Instead, it upholds as constitutional on its face a statute that denies free public education only to a portion of the children actually described in the Texas statute:  children who reside in the State solely for the purpose of attending the local schools <em>and</em> who also intend to leave the district after the completion of their education.  By inferring that children will not be excluded from the local free schools if they "intend to remain indefinitely" in the district, the Court is able to characterize the Texas statute as imposing a "traditional residency standard."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#332">461 U. S. 332</a></span>, and n. 13.  Having characterized the statute in this fashion, the Court then reasons that, because a bona fide residence requirement has been upheld in numerous contexts, the Texas statute is <em>a fortiori</em> permissible, since it does not deny free education to "resident" children, but only to nonresident children whose presence is motivated by the availability of free education.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#332">461 U. S. 332</a></span>-333.</p>\n<p>By its terms, the Texas statute applies to <em>any</em> child whose presence in the district is motivated primarily by a desire to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 461 U. S. 336</a></p><p> obtain free education.  The statute draws no further distinction between those who intend to leave upon the completion of their education and those who do not.  No Texas court has adopted the narrowing interpretation on which this Court relies. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Certainly the manner in which the statute has been applied until now would not support this interpretation. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Moreover, the courts below never addressed the question of the constitutionality of this statute as presently interpreted by the majority.  It is contrary to the settled practice of this Court to address the constitutionality of a state statute which, as newly interpreted at this late date, has never been considered by a lower court.  The proper course in such a situation would be to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, <em>see The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/180/case.html">359 U.

Moreno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/458/case.html">441 U. S. 458</a></span> (1979) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>The Court nevertheless proceeds to address the constitutionality of the statute as newly interpreted. For the reasons elaborated below, I believe the majority errs in its approach to that question.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the Court\'s view, because the Texas statute employs a "traditional" residence requirement in a uniform fashion, and indeed is even more generous, since it permits some "nonresidents" to obtain free education, the statute need be subjected only to the most minimal judicial scrutiny normally accorded bona fide residence requirements.  For the reasons stated below, this conclusion rests on a number of false assumptions and misconceptions.  The Court mistakenly equates the Texas statute with a residence requirement, when in fact the statute, as reinterpreted by the Court, imposes a standard even more difficult to meet than a domicile requirement for access to public education.  Moreover, even if it were permissible to provide free public education only to those residents who intend to remain in the State, the Texas statute does not impose that restriction uniformly.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority errs in reasoning that, because "intent to remain indefinitely" in a State is a "traditional" component of many state residence requirements, the imposition of that restriction on free public education is presumptively valid.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#330">461 U.

Although this Court\'s prior cases suggest that, as a general matter, a State may reserve its educational resources for its residents, there is no support for the view that a State may close its schools to all but <em>domiciliaries.</em></p>\n<p>A difference between the concepts of residence and domicile has long been recognized.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/350/case.html">88 U.

Traditionally, an individual has been said to acquire a new domicile when he resides in a State with "the absence of any intention to live elsewhere," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/619/case.html#624">232 U.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority errs in assuming that, as a general matter, States are free to close their schools to all but domiciliaries of the State.  To begin with, it is clear that <em>residence,</em> not domicile, is the traditional standard of eligibility for lower school education, [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] just as residence often has been used to determine </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 461 U.

[<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Moreover, this Court\'s prior decisions which speak of the constitutionality of a bona fide <em>residence</em> standard provide no support for the majority\'s assumption.  Although this Court has referred to a domicile requirement with approval in the context of higher education, it is incumbent upon the State of Texas to demonstrate that the classification transplanted from another statutory scheme is justified by "<em><em>the purposes for which the state desires to use it.</em>\'"  <em>Plyler v.

As interpreted by the Court, the Texas statute denies free public education to any child who intends to leave the district at some point in the future.  Yet such an intention does not preclude an individual from being considered a domiciliary under the prevailing conception of domicile.</p>\n<p>When a person lives in a single geographical area, which is the center of his domestic, social, and civil life, that place has all the indicia of his domicile, and will generally be so regarded irrespective of his intent to make a home somewhere else in the distant future.

Under Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 21.031 (Supp.1982-1983), the public free schools of Texas are generally open to any child who is a resident of the State.  Admission is not limited to residents who intend to remain indefinitely in Texas.  <em>See Brownsville Independent School Dist. v. Gamboa,</em> 498 S.W.2d 448, 450 (Tex.Civ.App.1973).

Those children, unlike all others, must intend to remain indefinitely in a particular school district in the State in order to attend its schools.</p>\n<p>Because the intent requirement is applied to only one class of children, it cannot be characterized as a bona fide residence requirement.

This premise underlies decisions striking down state statutes which create a presumption that particular classes of individuals are not residents because of either where they live in the State, <em>see Evans v. Cornman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/419/case.html">398 U. S. 419</a></span> (1970), or what jobs they hold.  <em>See Carrington v.

As the foregoing has demonstrated, \xc2\xa7 21.031 is neither a bona fide residence requirement nor one which is uniformly applied to all school-age children living in Texas.  Quite the contrary, \xc2\xa7 21.031 denies free public education to some persons who satisfy the traditional tests not only of residence but also of domicile.  In my view, \xc2\xa7 21.031 should be subjected to careful judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The interest adversely affected by \xc2\xa7 21.031, a child\'s education, is one which I continue to regard as fundamental.  <em>See San Antonio Independent School District v.

Therefore, simply on the ground that \xc2\xa7 21.031 significantly impedes access to education, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] I would subject the statutory classification to careful scrutiny. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 461 U. S. 347</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Texas statute is not narrowly tailored to achieve a substantial state interest.  The State of Texas does not attempt to justify the classification by reference to its interest in the safety and wellbeing of children within its boundaries.  The State instead contends that the principal purpose of the classification is to preserve educational and financial resources for those most closely connected to the State.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#329">461 U. S. 329</a></span>-330, n. 9. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  The classification of children according to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 461 U. S. 348</a></p><p> their motive for residing in the State cannot be justified as a narrowly tailored means of limiting public education to children "closely connected" with the State.  Under the Texas scheme, some children who are "residents" of the State in every sense of that word are nevertheless denied an education.  Other children whose only connection with the State is their physical presence are entitled to free public education as long as their presence is not motivated by a desire to obtain a free education.  A child residing in the State for <em>any other reason,</em> no matter how ephemeral, will receive a free education, even if he plans to leave before the end of the school year.  Whatever interest a State may have in preserving its educational resources for those who have a sufficiently close connection with the State, that interest does not justify a crude statutory classification which grants and withholds public education on a basis which is related only in a haphazard way to the extent of that child\'s connection with the State.  <em>Cf. Plyler v. Doe, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/202/case.html#227">457 U. S. 227</a></span>.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, the statute is not carefully designed to reserve state resources only for those who will have the most enduring connection with the State. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  As a general matter, the State concededly enrolls "school-age children [who intend] to remain only six months" in Texas.  <em>Plyler v. Doe, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/202/case.html#227">457 U. S. 227</a></span>, n. 22.  For example, "if a child comes to Texas for six months for health reasons, he would qualify for tuition-free education."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#333">461 U. S. 333</a></span>.  Yet the State excludes from its schools a child who enters the district at the age of seven with the intent to remain for at least 10 more years in order to complete his education.</p>\n<p>The State also seeks to justify \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) as a means of preventing undesirable fluctuations in the student population from year to year.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#329">461 U. S. 329</a></span>, n. 9.  The classification of students based on their motive for residing in the State cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 461 U. S. 349</a></p><p> be justified on this basis.  To begin with, Texas may not rely on a vague, unsubstantiated fear that, in the absence of a barrier to migration, children throughout the State and from outside the State will leave their parents and relocate within Texas solely to attend the school of a particular district, and that they will do so in numbers that are wholly unpredictable.  There is no evidence whatsoever that the migration of school-age children in unpredictable numbers has caused administrative problems, and the mere conjecture that such problems would arise in the absence of \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) cannot be the basis for upholding a classification that singles out some children who reside in the State and denies them a public education.  <em>Cf.

[<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if such evidence were available, \xc2\xa7 21.031 cannot be justified as a means of preventing interdistrict migration of students whose parents live in Texas, since the provision was not enacted with that general problem in mind.  <em>See Schlesinger v. Ballard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/498/case.html">419 U.

S. 270</a></span> (1973) (the challenged classification must further "some legitimate, <em>articulated</em> state purpose") (emphasis added).  As the Court of Appeals of Texas acknowledged, "\xc2\xa7 21.031(d) was enacted in response to litigation regarding the rights of <em>alien</em> children to attend Texas schools."  <em>Jackson v. Waco Independent School Dist.,</em> 629 S.W.2d 201, 205 (1982) (emphasis added).  Indeed, \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) is not needed to redress the problems caused by interdistrict migration, since school </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 461 U. S. 350</a></p><p> districts have authority quite apart from that provision for requiring students to attend the school in the district within the State in which their parents reside.  <em>Ibid.,</em> citing Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 23.26 (1972).  Because "the statutory provisions at issue were shaped by forces other than" a general concern with student migration within the State, <em>Trimble v. Gordon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/762/case.html">430 U. S. 762</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/762/case.html#775">430 U. S. 775</a></span> (1977), that broad concern cannot provide a basis for upholding the statute.  Rather, to the extent that concern over fluctuations in student populations underlies \xc2\xa7 21.031(d), it must be a concern over the migration into Texas of children from other States and from other countries.  There is simply no basis for concluding, however, that interstate migration has or will cause serious problems related to fluctuations in the number of students in each school district. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, whatever the magnitude of the problems associated with fluctuations in the student population because of migration from without the State, the motive requirement of \xc2\xa7 21.031(d) is simply not narrowly tailored to further the state interest in minimizing fluctuations.  Just as there is nothing to suggest that the number of children who enter Texas for educational purposes will vary significantly from year to year, there is certainly nothing to suggest that their number will vary to a greater extent than the number who enter for all other purposes.  Moreover, once children enter the State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 461 U. S. 351</a></p><p> for educational purposes, they are likely to be the among the most stable members of the school-age population.  It is, by definition, a matter of primary importance to such children that they remain in the district until they complete their schooling.  All other children, to whom attending the local schools is a matter of comparative unimportance, may have little tie to the State or to a particular district within the State during their school years.  Indeed, under the Texas statute, a child who resides in the State for any purpose other than to attend the local schools is entitled to free education even if he expressly intends to remain for less than a year.  Yet a child who resides in the State in order to attend its schools is denied an education even if he intends to remain until he has completed 12 full years of primary and secondary education.  This disparate treatment cannot be justified by any alleged state concern over fluctuating student populations.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, I reject the majority\'s conclusion that the Texas statute may be upheld on the ground that it is far more generous than a traditional residence requirement for public education.  To the contrary, the statute is less generous, since it excludes a class of children who ordinarily would be regarded as Texas residents.

The question in that case was whether a person who had lived and worked in various different towns during the previous five years had established a residence in defendant town for the purposes of state pauper laws.  The court indicated that the individual would have acquired a residence if he lived in the town "without any present intention to remove therefrom," 43 Me. at 418, even if he later left the town for extended periods of time.  The court did not hold, however, that an individual cannot also establish a residence for the purpose of state pauper laws if he lived in a town with the intent to remain for a fixed, but relatively long period of time.  In fact, the court suggested just the opposite when it stated that "[t]o reside is to dwell permanently, <em>or for a length of time,</em>" <em>id.</em> at 417 (emphasis added).  As the Maine Supreme Court stated in <em>North Yarmouth v. West Gardiner,</em> 58 Me. 207, 211 (1870),</p>\n<p>"so far as intention is a necessary element of a \'residence,\' it will be conclusively inferred from an actual presence accompanied with such circumstances as usually surround a home."</p>\n<p>The Court\'s reliance on various other state decisions, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html#331">461 U.

These cases do not involve the traditional or common law concept of residence at all, but involve that term as specifically defined under a particular state statute.  For example, in <em>Estate of Schoof v. Schoof,</em> 193 Kan. 611, 614, 396 P.2d 329, 331 (1964), the court expressly interpreted the term "residence" to refer to the common law concept of "domicile" for the purposes of a state statute involving probate of a will, for which one State or county necessarily must be given priority.  Similarly, in <em>Hughes v. Illinois Public Aid Comm\'n,</em> 2 Ill.2d 374, 380-381, 118 N.E.2d 14, 18 (1954), the court considered a statute which defined a "resident" as one who has "made his or her permanent home in this State for a continuous period of one year."  <em>See generally</em> Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7 11, Comment <em>k</em> (1971).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, in order to avoid conflicts of laws or jurisdictions, the law of an individual\'s domicile generally governs such matters as the distribution of his property after death, and the probate of a will and the appointment of an administrator generally occur in the domicile of the deceased.

One child, an American citizen by reason of birth in Texas, had lived in Mexico since infancy with parents who were Mexican citizens.  At the age of six, he left his parents\' home and came to live with his maternal aunt in Brownsville for the purpose of attending the public free schools.  He lived in his aunt\'s home as part of her household for 16 months with only a single brief interruption.  She was appointed the child\'s guardian.

We stated that the State may not conclusively presume that members of a particular profession are transient inhabitants, but must instead apply the "more precise tests to determine the <em>bona fides</em> of an individual claiming to have actually made his home in the State long enough to vote," just as it applies those tests to all others seeking to vote in the State.  380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/89/case.html#95">380 U.

But we do not perceive why a mother who is seeking to make a new life for herself and her children should be regarded as less deserving because she considers, among other factors, the level of a State\'s public assistance.  <em>Surely such a mother is no less deserving than a mother who moves into a particular State in order to take advantage of its better educational facilities.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html#631">394 U.
