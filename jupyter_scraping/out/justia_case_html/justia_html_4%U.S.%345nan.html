Plea in bar, a former bill in equity, for the same cause, filed by the complainant on the 24th of April 1792; demurrer to the bill, and joinder in demurrer; and a decree, in April term 1796, pronouncing the demurrer to be sufficient, and dismissing the bill; which decree remains unreversed and in full force. 2d. Plea in bar, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, (a competent tribunal) upon the agreement, reference, and report, which judgment remains still in force; with an averment that the complainant did not, within six months after making, or filing, the report, nor after the exceptions were over-ruled (which exceptions contained all the matter alleged in the bill) and the judgment rendered, pay, or offer to pay, to the defendant, the said sum of 3646l. 6s. 2 3/4d. or any part thereof. 3d. Answer, That the judgment was fairly obtained; that the defendant did not submit to the referees any books, accounts, or statements, that were untrue, or fraudulent, nor suppress any material documents; that on the 26th of September 1796, the complainant\'s son came to him with a bank bill; but never before that time; and that the defendant had been exposed to all intermediate expenses and casualties, &amp;c. </p><p> A general replication was filed; and, after argument, the following opinion was delivered, Judge PETERS, declining to take a part in the decision: </p><p></p><p> PATERSON, Justice. </p><p> The great rule of interpretation, with respect to deeds and contracts, is to put such a construction upon them as will effectuate the intention of the parties, if such intention be consistent with the principles of law. In the present case, there is no difficulty in coming at the intention, as it is clearly and forcibly expressed in the agreement, and is capable of receiving one construction only. The time of payment is made a substantial, and not a mere formal, circumstance; it enters into the essence of the contract; and, therefore, must be observed. The Court cannot decree against the legal and express stipulation of the parties themselves. The situation of the parties, the nature of the property, and the speculative spirit of the project, were powerful inducements for drawing up the agreement, in the plainest and strongest terms, so as to leave no doubt as to the intention, and to render the time of performance a cardinal point. </p><p> Again, if the agreement would admit of another construction, the complainant, under the circumstances of the case, comes too late to avail himself of it. The door of equity cannot remain open for ever. The complainant did not make a tender of the money, till a lapse of five years after the termination of the time limited by the contract. So far was he from using legal diligence, that he has been guilty of gross delay. In cases of the present kind, equity will not suffer a party to lie by till the event of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 4 U.S. 345, 348</a></p><p> experiment shall enable him to make his election with certainty of profit one way, and without loss any way. This mode of procedure is unfair; contrary to natural justice, and in exclusion of mutuality. </p><p> There is a strange mixture of legal and equitable powers, in the Courts of law of this state. This arises from the want of a distinct forum to exercise chancery jurisdiction; and, therefore, the common law Courts equities as far as possible. Whether, if relief be proper, the Supreme Court of this state could have extended it to the complainant, it is unnecessary to determine. Thus much, however, might and ought to have been done, on the part of the complainant; he ought, when notice was given for him to show cause why judgment should not be entered, to have laid the equity of the case before the judges of that Court, who, if they thought proper, might have deferred the entering of judgment, or ordered it to be entered on terms, to wit, to be vacated on payment of the awarded sum, by a limited period. But the complainant, although he had previous notice, did not avail himself of an appeal to the discretion of the Court; but suffered judgment to pass against him, without making any objection. </p><p> There being no equity in the complainant\'s case, his bill must be dismissed, with costs.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
