In 1980, Congress passed the Boren Amendment to the Act, which requires provider reimbursement according to rates that the "State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary," are "reasonable and adequate" to meet the costs of "efficiently and economically operated facilities."  The State must also assure the Secretary that individuals have "reasonable access" to facilities of "adequate quality."  Virginia\'s Plan, under which providers are reimbursed according to a prospective formula, was approved by the Secretary in 1982 and again in 1986 after an amendment.  In 1986, respondent, a nonprofit corporation composed of public and private hospitals operating in Virginia, filed suit against petitioner state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, alleging that the State Plan violates the Act because its reimbursement rates are not "reasonable and adequate."  The District Court denied petitioners\' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, which was based on the claim that \xc2\xa7 1983 does not afford respondent a cause of action.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that providers may sue state official for declaratory and injunctive relief under \xc2\xa7 1983 to assure compliance with the Boren Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em>  The Boren Amendment is enforceable in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by health care providers.

Petitioners\' contention that Congress did not intend to require States to adopt rates that actually are reasonable and adequate is contrary to the statutory language, which requires the State to <em>find</em> that its rates satisfy these requirements and entitles the Secretary to reject a state plan upon concluding that the assurances given are unsatisfactory, and would render those requirements, and thus the entire reimbursement provision, essentially meaningless.  Petitioners\' contention is quickly dispelled by a review of the Amendment\'s background and the legislative history, which demonstrate that the Amendment was passed to free the States from restrictive reimbursement requirements previously imposed by the Secretary, and not to relieve them of their fundamental obligation to pay reasonable rates, and that Congress intended to retain providers\' preexisting right to challenge rates as unreasonable in injunctive suits under \xc2\xa7 1983.  Furthermore, a State\'s flexibility to adopt rates that it finds to be reasonable and adequate does not, as petitioners contend, render the obligation imposed by the Amendment too "vague and amorphous" to be judicially enforceable.  <em>See Golden State, supra,</em> 493 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/case.html#106">493 U.

The statute and the Secretary\'s regulations set out factors which a State must consider in adopting its rates, and the statute requires the State, in making its findings, to judge the rates\' reasonableness against the objective benchmark of an "efficiently and economically operated facility" while ensuring "reasonable access" to eligible participants.  Although some knowledge of the hospital industry might be required to evaluate a State\'s findings, such an inquiry is well within the competence of the Judiciary.

Although participation in the program is voluntary, participating States must comply with certain requirements imposed by the Medicaid Act (Act) and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary).  To qualify for federal assistance, a State must submit to the Secretary and have approved "a plan for medical assistance," 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a), that contains a comprehensive statement describing the nature and scope of the State\'s Medicaid program.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 430.10 (1989).

Under the Plan, health care providers are reimbursed for services according to a prospective formula -- that is, reimbursement rates for various types of medical services and procedures are fixed in advance.

We granted certiorari. <em>Virginia Hospital Assn. v. Baliles,</em> 493 U.S. 808 (1989). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In order to determine whether the Boren Amendment is enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983, it is useful first to consider the history of the reimbursement provision.  When enacted in 1965, the Act required States to provide reimbursement for the "reasonable cost" of hospital services actually provided, measured according to standards adopted by the Secretary.  Pub.L. 89-97, \xc2\xa7 1902(13)(B), 79 Stat. 346.  Congress became concerned, however, that the Secretary wielded too much control over reimbursement rates.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 92231, p. 100 (1971).  Congress therefore amended the Act in 1972 to give States more flexibility to develop methods and standards for reimbursement, but Congress retained the ultimate requirement that the rates reimburse the "reasonable cost" of the services provided.  The new law required States to pay</p>\n<p>"the reasonable cost of inpatient hospital services . . . as determined in accordance with methods and standards </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 496 U. S. 506</a></p><p> which shall be developed by the State and reviewed and approved by the Secretary."</p>\n<p>Pub.L. 92-603, \xc2\xa7 232(a), 86 Stat. 1410-1411.</p>\n<p>In response to rapidly rising Medicaid costs, Congress in 1981 extended the Boren Amendment to hospitals, <em>see</em> n. 2, <em>supra,</em> as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub.L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 808. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Congress blamed mounting Medicaid costs on the complexity and rigidity of the Secretary\'s reimbursement regulations.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 97-158, Vol. 2, pp. 292-293 (1981); S.Rep. No. 96-471, pp. 28-29 (1979).  Although the previous version of the Act in theory afforded States some degree of flexibility to adopt their own methods for determining reimbursement rates, Congress found that, in fact, the regulations promulgated by the Secretary had essentially forced States to adopt Medicaid rates based on Medicare "reasonable cost" principles.  Congress</p>\n<p>"recognize[d] the inflationary nature of the [then] current cost reimbursement system and intend[ed] to give States greater latitude in developing and implementing alternative reimbursement methodologies that promote the efficient and economical delivery of such services."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep.

The Amendment</p>\n<p>"delete[d] the current provision requiring States to reimburse hospitals on a reasonable cost basis [and] substitute[d] a provision requiring States to reimburse hospitals at rates . . . that are reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to meet applicable laws and quality and safety standards."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 97-139, p. 478 (1981), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1981, p. 744.  Thus, while Congress affirmed its desire that state reimbursement rates be "reasonable," it afforded States greater flexibility in calculating those "reasonable rates."  For example, Congress explained that States would be free to establish statewide or classwide rates, establish rates based on a prospective </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 496 U. S. 507</a></p><p> cost, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] or include incentive provisions to encourage efficient operation.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 97-158, <em>supra</em> at 292-293; S.Rep. 96-471, <em>supra</em> at 29.  Flexibility was ensured by limiting the oversight role of the Secretary.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 97139, <em>supra</em> at 478, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1981, p. 744.  Thus, the Boren Amendment provides that a State must reimburse providers according to rates that it "finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary," are "reasonable and adequate" to meet the costs of "efficiently and economically operated facilities."  The State must also assure the Secretary that individuals have "reasonable access" to facilities of "adequate quality."</p>\n<p>The Act does not define these terms, and the Secretary has declined to adopt a national definition, concluding that States should determine the factors to be considered in determining what rates are "reasonable and adequate" to meet the costs of "efficiently and economically operated facilit[ies]."  <em>See</em> 48 Fed.Reg. 56049 (1983).  The regulations require a State to make a finding at least annually that its rates are "reasonable and adequate," <em>see</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 447.253(b)(1) (1989), though the State is required to submit assurances to that effect to the Secretary only when it makes a change in its reimbursement rates.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 447.253(a); 48 Fed.Reg. 56047 (1983).  According to the Secretary, the Boren Amendment "places the responsibility for the development of reasonable and adequate payment rates with the States."  <em>Id.</em> at 56050.  Thus, he reviews only the reasonableness of the assurances provided by a State, and not the State\'s findings themselves.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 496 U. S. 508</a></p><p> <em>See</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 447.256(2) (1989).  The Secretary\'s review focuses "on the assurances which attest to the fact that States\' findings do indeed indicate that the payment rates are reasonable," and judges "whether the assurances are satisfactory."  48 Fed.Reg. 56051 (1983).  Therefore the Secretary does not require States to submit the findings themselves or the underlying data.

A plaintiff alleging a violation of a federal statute will be permitted to sue under \xc2\xa7 1983 unless (1) "the statute [does] not create enforceable rights, privileges, or immunities within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983," or (2) "Congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself."  <em>Wright v.

Such an inquiry turns on whether "the provision in question was intend[ed] to benefit the putative plaintiff."  <em>Ibid.</em> (citations and internal quotations omitted).  If so, the provision creates an enforceable right unless it reflects merely a "congressional preference" for a certain kind of conduct rather than a binding obligation on the governmental unit, <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.

That section, entitled "bill of rights," declares that Congress had made certain "findings respecting the rights of persons with developmental disabilities," namely that such persons have a right to "appropriate treatment" in the least restrictive environment and that federal and state governments have an obligation to ensure that institutions failing to provide "appropriate treatment" do not receive federal funds.  451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#13">451 U.

The Court concluded that the context of the entire statute and its legislative history revealed that Congress intended neither to create new substantive rights nor to require States to recognize such rights; instead, Congress intended only to indicate a preference for "appropriate treatment."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#22">451 U.

The Brooke Amendment limits the amount of rent a public housing tenant can be charged, and the regulations adopted pursuant to the statute require inclusion of a "reasonable" allowance for utilities in the rent.  479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#420">479 U.

The Boren Amendment is cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms:  the state plan "<em>must</em>" "provide for payment . . . of hospital[s]" according to rates the State finds are reasonable and adequate.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added).  Moreover, provision of federal funds is expressly conditioned on compliance with the Amendment, and the Secretary is authorized to withhold funds for noncompliance with this provision.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396c (1982 ed.).  The Secretary has expressed his intention to withhold funds if the state plan does not comply with the statute or if there is "noncompliance in practice."  <em>See</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 430.35 (1989) ("A question of noncompliance in practice may arise from the State\'s failure to actually comply with a Federal requirement, regardless of whether the plan itself complies with that requirement").</p>\n<p>"The [Boren Amendment\'s] language succinctly sets forth a congressional command, which is wholly uncharacteristic of a mere suggestion or \'nudge.\'"</p>\n<p><em>West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v.

Petitioners also concede, as they must, that a State is required to find that its rates are reasonable and adequate and to make assurances to that effect to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 496 U.

[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The dissent, although acknowledging that the State has these obligations, apparently would hold that the only right enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983 is the right to compel compliance with these bare procedural requirements.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#527">496 U. S. 527</a></span>-528.  We think the Amendment cannot be so limited.  Any argument that the requirements of findings and assurances are procedural requirements only and do not require the State to adopt rates that are actually reasonable and adequate is nothing more than an argument that the State\'s findings and assurances need not be correct. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 496 U. S. 514</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We reject that argument because it would render the statutory requirements of findings and assurances, and thus the entire reimbursement provision, essentially meaningless.  It would make little sense for Congress to require a State to make findings without requiring those findings to be correct.  In addition, there would be no reason to require a State to submit assurances to the Secretary if the statute did not require the State\'s findings to be reviewable in some manner by the Secretary.  We decline to adopt an interpretation of the Boren Amendment that would render it a dead letter.  <em>See Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#412">397 U. S. 412</a></span>-415 (1970); <em>see also</em> 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7 45.12 (4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p>Petitioners acknowledge that a State may not make, or submit assurances based on, a patently false finding, <em>see</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, but insist that Congress left it to the Secretary, and not the federal courts, to ensure that the State\'s rates are not based on such false findings. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  To the extent that this argument bears on the question whether the Boren Amendment creates enforceable rights (as opposed to whether Congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of the statute pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1983, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#520">496 U. S. 520</a></span>-523), it supports the conclusion that the provision does create enforceable rights.  If the Secretary is entitled to reject a state plan upon concluding that a State\'s assurances of compliance are unsatisfactory, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#512">496 U. S. 512</a></span>, a State is on notice that it cannot adopt any rates it chooses and that the requirement that it make "findings" is not a mere formality.  <em>Cf. Pennhurst,</em> 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#24">451 U. S. 24</a></span>.  Rather, the only plausible interpretation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 496 U. S. 515</a></p><p> of the Amendment is that, by requiring a State to <em>find</em> that its rates are reasonable and adequate, the statute imposes the concomitant obligation to adopt reasonable and adequate rates.</p>\n<p>Any doubt that Congress intended to require States to adopt rates that actually are reasonable and adequate is quickly dispelled by a review of the legislative history of the Boren Amendment.  The primary objective of the Amendment was to free States from reimbursement according to Medicare "reasonable cost" principles as had been required by prior regulation.  The Amendment</p>\n<p>"delete[d] the . . . provision requiring States to reimburse hospitals on a reasonable cost basis.  It substitute[d] a provision <em>requiring States to reimburse hospitals at rates . . . that are reasonable and adequate</em> to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to meet applicable laws and quality and safety standards."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 97-139, <em>supra,</em> at 478, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1981, p. 744 (emphasis added).  In passing the Boren Amendment, Congress sought to decentralize the method for determining rates, but not to eliminate a State\'s fundamental obligation to pay reasonable rates.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 96-471, <em>supra,</em> at 29 (flexibility given to States "not intended to encourage arbitrary reductions in payment that would adversely affect the quality of care").  In other words, while Congress gave States leeway in adopting a method of computing rates -- they can choose between retrospective and prospective rate-setting methodologies, for example -- Congress retained the underlying requirement of "reasonable and adequate" rates. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 496 U. S. 516</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By reducing the Secretary\'s role in establishing the rates, Congress intended only that the primary responsibility for developing rates be transferred to the States; the Secretary was still to ensure compliance with the provision.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 97-139, <em>supra</em> at 478, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1981, p. 744 ("The committee expects that the Secretary will keep regulatory and other requirements to the <em>minimum necessary to assure proper accountability,</em> and not to overburden the States and facilities with unnecessary and burdensome paperwork requirements") (emphasis added); H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 96-1479, p. 154 (1980) ("[T]he Secretary retains final authority to review the rates and to disapprove [them] if they do not meet the requirements of the statute").  If petitioners were right that state findings were not required to be correct, there would be little point in requiring the Secretary to review the State\'s assurances.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is clear that, prior to the passage of the Boren Amendment, Congress intended that health care providers be able to sue in federal court for injunctive relief to ensure that they were reimbursed according to reasonable rates.  During the 1970\'s, provider suits in the federal court were commonplace. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In addition, in response to several States\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 496 U. S. 517</a></p><p> freezing their Medicaid payments to health care providers, Congress amended the Act in 1975 to require States to waive any Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit for violations of the Act.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1122, p. 4 (1976); <em>see also</em> 121 Cong.Rec. 42259 (1975) (remarks of Sen. Taft).  Congress believed the waiver necessary because the existing means of enforcement -- noncompliance procedures instituted by the Secretary or suits for injunctive relief by health care providers -- were insufficient to deal with the problem of outright noncompliance because they included no compensation for past underpayments.  <em>See</em> H.R. Rep. 94-1122, <em>supra,</em> at 4.  The amendment required the Secretary to withhold 10% of federal Medicaid funds from any State that had not executed a waiver of its immunity by March 31, 1976.  Pub.L. 94-182, \xc2\xa7 111, 89 Stat. 1054.  The provision generated a great deal of opposition from the States, and was repealed in the next session of Congress.  Pub.L. 94-552, 90 Stat. 2540; <em>see</em> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1122, <em>supra,</em> at 4; S.Rep. No. 94-1240, pp. 3-4 (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 5649-5651; 122 Cong.Rec. 13492 (1976) (remarks of Rep. Rogers).  But Congress explained that it did not intend the repeal to</p>\n<p>"be construed as in any way contravening or constraining the rights of the providers of Medicaid services, the State Medicaid agencies, or the Department to seek prospective, injunctive relief in a federal or state judicial forum.  Neither should the repeal of [the waiver section] be interpreted as placing constraints on the rights of the parties </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 496 U. S. 518</a></p><p> involved to seek prospective, injunctive relief."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 94-1240, <em>supra,</em> at 4, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 5651. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>This experience demonstrates clearly that Congress and the States both understood the Act to grant health care providers enforceable rights both before and after repeal of the ill-fated waiver requirement. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Given this background, it is implausible to conclude that, by substituting the requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 496 U. S. 519</a></p><p> of "findings" and "assurances," Congress intended to deprive health care providers of their right to challenge rates under \xc2\xa7 1983.  Instead, as the legislative history shows, the requirements of "findings" and "assurances" prescribe the respective roles of a State and the Secretary, and do not, as petitioners suggest, eliminate a State\'s obligation to adopt reasonable rates.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, petitioners argue that, because the Boren Amendment gives a State flexibility to adopt any rates it finds are reasonable and adequate, the obligation imposed by the Amendment is too "vague and amorphous" to be judicially enforceable.  We reject this argument.  As in <em>Wright,</em> the statute and regulation set out factors which a State must consider in adopting its rates. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  In addition, the statute requires the State, in making its findings, to judge the reasonableness of its rates against the objective benchmark of an "efficiently and economically operated facility" providing care in compliance with federal and state standards while at the same time ensuring "reasonable access" to eligible participants.  That the Amendment gives the States substantial discretion in choosing among reasonable methods of calculating rates may affect the standard under which a court reviews whether the rates comply with the Amendment, but it does not render the Amendment unenforceable by a court.  While </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 496 U. S. 520</a></p><p> there may be a range of reasonable rates, there certainly are some rates outside that range that no State could ever find to be reasonable and adequate under the Act. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Although some knowledge of the hospital industry might be required to evaluate a State\'s findings with respect to the reasonableness of its rates, such an inquiry is well within the competence of the judiciary.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners also argue that Congress has foreclosed enforcement of the Medicaid Act under \xc2\xa7 1983.  We find little merit in this argument.  "<em>We do not lightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on \xc2\xa7 1983 as a remedy\' for the deprivation of a federally secured right."  <em>Wright,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#423">479 U.

In the absence of such an express provision, we have found private enforcement foreclosed only when the statute itself creates a remedial scheme that is "sufficiently comprehensive . . . to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under \xc2\xa7 1983."  <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v.

In <em>Sea Clammers, supra,</em> we held that the comprehensive enforcement scheme found in the the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251 <em>et seq.,</em> -- which granted the Environmental Protection Agency considerable enforcement power through the use of noncompliance orders, civil suits, and criminal penalties, and which included two citizen-suit provisions -- evidenced a congressional intent to foreclose reliance on \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>See</em> 453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#13">453 U.

Robinson, supra,</em> 468 U.S. at 1010-1011, we held that the elaborate administrative scheme set forth in the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1400 <em>et seq.,</em> manifested Congress\' desire to foreclose private reliance on \xc2\xa7 1983 as a remedy.  The EHA contained a "carefully tailored administrative and judicial mechanism," 468 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html#1009">468 U.

Instead, the Act authorizes the Secretary to withhold approval of plans, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1316(a), or to curtail federal funds to States whose plans are not in compliance with the Act.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396c (1982 ed.).  In addition, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 496 U.

By regulation, the States are required to adopt an appeals procedure by which individual providers may obtain administrative review of reimbursement rates.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 447.253(c) (1989).  The Commonwealth of Virginia has adopted a three-tiered administrative scheme within the state Medicaid agency to comply with these regulations.  App. 32-43.</p>\n<p>This administrative scheme cannot be considered sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a congressional intent to withdraw the private remedy of \xc2\xa7 1983.  In <em>Wright,</em> we concluded that the "generalized powers" of HUD to audit and cut off federal funds were insufficient to foreclose reliance on \xc2\xa7 1983 to vindicate federal rights.  479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#428">479 U. S. 428</a></span>.  We noted that HUD did not exercise its auditing power frequently, and the statute did not require, nor did HUD provide, any mechanism for individuals to bring problems to the attention of HUD.  <em>Ibid; see also Rosado,</em> 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#420">397 U.

Such a conclusion is even more appropriate in the context of the Medicaid Act, since, as explained above, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#515">496 U. S. 515</a></span>-518, a primary purpose of the Boren Amendment was to reduce the role of the Secretary in determining methods for calculating payment rates.  It follows that the Secretary\'s limited oversight is insufficient to demonstrate an intent to foreclose relief altogether in the courts under \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 496 U. S. 523</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We also reject petitioners\' argument that the existence of administrative procedures whereby health care providers can obtain review of individual claims for payment evidences an intent to foreclose a private remedy in the federal courts.  The availability of state administrative procedures ordinarily does not foreclose resort to \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/case.html">457 U.

Nor do we find any indication that Congress specifically intended that this administrative procedure replace private remedies available under \xc2\xa7 1983.  The regulations allow States to limit the issues that may be raised in the administrative proceeding.  42 CFR, \xc2\xa7 447.253(c) (1989).  Most States, including Virginia, do not allow health care providers to challenge the overall method by which rates are determined. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  <em>See</em> Brief for American Health Care Association as <em>Amicus Curiae et al.</em> 20-24, and App. A and B.  Such limited state administrative procedures cannot be considered a "comprehensive" scheme that manifests a congressional intent to foreclose reliance on \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>See Wright,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#429">479 U.

The figures for the median cost of care in 1982 were calculated by determining the <em>per diem</em> median cost of care for a Medicaid patient in the year 1981 and then adjusting for inflation through the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Until 1986, to determine the annual reimbursement rates, the 1982 baseline figures were adjusted by the CPI.  In 1986, however, the Plan was amended so that these baseline figures are adjusted by an inflation index that is tied to medical care costs.  App. 24-26.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that this method of calculating the payment rates is not tied to the costs incurred by an efficient and economical hospital.  More specifically, respondent challenges:  (1) the method of computing the baseline median costs for 1982; (2) the use of the CPI rather than an index tied to medical care costs to adjust the rates in the years 1982-1986; and (3) the way in which the medical care cost index was used after 1986.

Since the passage of the Boren Amendment in 1981, however, most States have adopted plans that are prospective in nature, whereby providers are paid in advance and payments are calculated according to the State\'s formula for what such care should cost.  The Virginia Plan is a typical prospective plan.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The state Medicaid agency must submit the following information with the assurances:  (1) the amount of the estimated average proposed payment rate for each type of provider, (2) the amount by which the rate is increased or decreased in relation to the preceding year, and (3) an estimate of the short-term, and to the extent feasible, long-term, effect the new rate will have on the availability of services, the type of care furnished, the extent of provider participation, and the degree to which costs are covered in hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low income patients.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 447.255 (1989).  The Secretary may, however, request a State to provide additional background information if he believes it is necessary for a complete review of the State\'s assurances.  48 Fed.Reg. 56050 (1983).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>This is a different inquiry than that involved in determining whether a private right of action can be implied from a particular statute.  <em>See Cort v.

The test reflects a concern, grounded in separation of powers, that Congress rather than the courts controls the availability of remedies for violations of statutes.  <em>See e.g., Thompson v.

Because \xc2\xa7 1983 provides an "alternative source of express congressional authorization of private suits," <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v.

Consistent with this view, we recognize an exception to the general rule that \xc2\xa7 1983 provides a remedy for violation of federal statutory rights only when Congress has affirmatively withdrawn the remedy.  <em>See Golden State Transit Corp. v.

By contrast, under the Medicaid program, the Federal Government provides funds to cover between 50% and 83% of the cost of patient care.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396d(b) (1982 ed., Supp. 111).  In 1988, the federal contribution to the Medicaid program totalled approximately 529 billion.  Brief for United States, as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States, as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argues that the statute requires only that a State provide assurances to the Secretary that its rates comply with the statute, and that assurances do not give rise to enforceable rights.  Brief for United States, as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16 ("By its terms, therefore, [the Boren Amendment] vests ratemaking discretion in the States, subject only to the condition that they make "assurances" satisfactory to the Secretary").  This interpretation ignores the language of the statute that requires a State to find that its rates are "reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities" and to assure that eligible individuals have "reasonable access" to services.  <em>See also</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 447.253(b) (1989); 48 Fed. Reg. 56051 (1983) ("The statute requires that the States make a finding that their payment rates are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs of efficiently and economically operated facilities").  The requirement that a State make such a finding is a necessary prerequisite to the subsequent requirement that the State provide "assurances" to the Secretary.  That the requirements are separate obligations is apparent from the Secretary\'s regulations.  A State must make findings at least annually, but does not need to make assurances unless the state plan is amended.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 447.253(a), (b) (1989).  Moreover, the Secretary\'s interpretation of his role under the statute -- that he will review the reasonableness of the assurances presented by a State rather than the findings themselves -- is based entirely on his understanding that a State has the responsibility to find that its rates are adequate before making assurances to the Secretary.  <em>See</em> 48 Fed.Reg. 56050 (1983) ("Because of the explicit statutory responsibility of the State agency to make its findings that the method and standards result in reasonable and adequate payment rates, we doubt that requiring further detailed reporting would add substantially to our evaluation of States\' assurances").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners suggest that health care providers might be able to bring a challenge against the Secretary\'s decision to approve a plan under the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 701-706.  The Solicitor General, however, argues that there would be no remedy under the APA because the decision to accept a States\' assurances is entrusted to the agency\'s discretion.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19.

If a State errs in finding that its rates are reasonable and adequate, or in supplying assurances to that effect to the Secretary, then a provider is entitled to have the court invalidate the current state plan and order the State to promulgate a new plan that complies with the Act.  We note that the Courts of Appeals generally agree that, when the State has complied with the procedural requirements imposed by the Amendment and regulations, a federal court employs a deferential standard of review to evaluate whether the rates comply with the substantive requirements of the Amendment.  <em>See, e.g., AMISUB, supra,</em> at 795-801; <em>Casey, supra,</em> at 23-24; <em>Dunning, supra,</em> at 1294; <em>Wisconsin Hospital Ass\'n v. Reivitz,</em> 733 F.2d 1226 (CA7 1981); <em>Mississippi Hospital Assn., supra,</em> at 516.  We express no opinion as to which of the cases contains the correct articulation of the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, this conclusion is even more apt given that Congress believed that a private judicial remedy existed before the passage of the Boren Amendment, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#516">496 U. S. 516</a></span>-518, when the administrative oversight scheme was more elaborate than it is today.</p>\n<p>For the same reasons, we reject the argument that the availability of an action against the Secretary under the APA forecloses \xc2\xa7 1983 as a remedy.  Putting aside the question whether an APA remedy is available, <em>see</em> <a href="#F12" name="T12">n</a> 12, <em>supra,</em> there is absolutely no indication that Congress intended such an action to be the sole method for health care providers to enforce the reimbursement provision.  Moreover, given that Congress believed that a private cause of action existed prior to the passage of the Boren Amendment and that the Amendment reduced the Secretary\'s oversight role, it is implausible to infer that Congress intended to replace the private judicial remedy under \xc2\xa7 1983 with a proceeding for judicial review under the APA.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>The Virginia procedure allows providers to dispute individual payments.  It excludes from appeal the following issues:  (1) the organization of the peer groups; (2) the use of the reimbursement rates established in the plan; (3) the calculation of the initial group ceilings as of 1982; (4) the use of the consumer price index; and (5) the time limits set forth in the state plan.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, we reject petitioners\' argument that the availability of judicial review under the Virginia Administrative Procedure Act is relevant to the question whether relief is available under \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>See Wright, supra,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#429">479 U.

The Court notes in its opinion, <em>ante</em> at 2516, that respondent seeks permanent relief under \xc2\xa7 1983 in the form of court-ordered reimbursement at new rates.  Respondent also seeks, as interim relief, reimbursement at rates commensurate with payments under the Medicare program.  Complaint; <em>see</em> App. 22.  And though respondent\'s prayer for relief is only one example of a good claim for relief under today\'s decision, every \xc2\xa7 1983 action hereafter brought by providers to enforce \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) will inevitably seek the substitution of a rate system preferred by the provider for the rate system chosen by the State.  Thus, whenever a provider prevails in such an action, the defendant State will be enjoined to implement a system of rates other than the rates "determined in accordance with methods and standards developed by the State," which the "State finds . . . are reasonable and adequate," and with respect to which the State made assurances to the Secretary that the Secretary found "satisfactory."  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. V).  The court orders entered in such actions therefore will require the States to adopt reimbursement rate systems different from those Congress expressly required them to adopt by the above-quoted language.</p>\n<p>The Court reasons that the policy underlying the Boren Amendment would be thwarted if judicial review under \xc2\xa7 1983 were unavailable to challenge the reasonableness and adequacy of rates established by States for reimbursing Medicaid services providers.  This sort of reasoning, however, has not hitherto been thought an adequate basis for deciding that Congress conferred an enforceable right on a party.</p>\n<p>Before <em>Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a></span> (1980), a plaintiff seeking to judicially enforce a provision in a federal statute was required to demonstrate that the statute contained an implied cause of action.  Satisfaction of the the now familiar standards from, <em>e.g., Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span> (1975), was the means for making the requisite showing.  The Court\'s general practice was "to imply a cause of action where the language of the statute explicitly conferred a right directly on a class of persons that included the plaintiff in the case."  <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#690">441 U. S. 690</a></span>, n. 13 (1979).  It was thus crucial to a demonstration of the existence of an implied action for the statute to contain a right "in favor of" the particular plaintiff.  <em>See Cort,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span> ("First, . . . does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff?").  The plaintiff then would have to satisfy three additional standards to establish that the statute contained an implied judicial remedy for vindicating that right.  <em>See ibid.</em>  In <em>Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> the Court essentially removed the burden of making the latter three showings by holding that \xc2\xa7 1983 generally (with an exception subsequently </p><p><a class="page-number" name="526">Page 496 U. S. 526</a></p><p> developed in <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html">453 U. S. 1</a></span> (1981)), supplies the remedy for vindication of rights arising from federal statutes.</p>\n<p>But while the Court\'s holding in <em>Thiboutot</em> rendered obsolete some of the case law pertaining to implied rights of action, a significant area of overlap remained.  For relief to be had either under \xc2\xa7 1983 or by implication under <em>Cort v. Ash, supra,</em> the language used by Congress must confer identifiable enforceable rights.  <em>See Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html">479 U. S. 418</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#432">479 U. S. 432</a></span>-433 (1987) (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting) ("Whether a federal statute confers substantive rights is not an issue unique to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.

In this regard, the Court in <em>Wright</em> said that a \xc2\xa7 1983 action does not lie where Congress did not intend for the statutory provision "to rise to the level of an enforceable right."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html#423">422 U.

S. 690</a></span>, n. 13.  This statement is suggestive of the traditional rule that the first step in our exposition of a statute always is to look to the statute\'s text and to stop there if the text fully reveals its meaning.  <em>See, e.g., American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/63/case.html">456 U. S. 63</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/63/case.html#68">456 U. S. 68</a></span> (1982) ("<em>[O]ur starting point must be the language employed by Congress,\' and we assume `that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used\'") (internal citations omitted).  There is no apparent reason to deviate from this sound rule when the question is whether a federal statute confers substantive rights on a \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff.  </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 496 U. S. 527</a></em></p><p><em> Yet the Court virtually ignores the relevant text of the Medicaid statute in this case.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Medicaid statute provides for appropriations of federal funds to States that submit, and have approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, "State plans for medical assistance."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396 (1982 ed., Supp. V).  The next provision in the statute specifies requirements for the contents of State medical assistance plans.  \xc2\xa7 1396a(a).  The provision in issue here, \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A), is simply a part of the thirteenth listed requirement for such plans.  In light of the placement of \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) within the structure of the statute, <em>see Pennhurst, supra,</em> 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#19">451 U. S. 19</a></span> (emphasizing the statutory "context" of the provision under review), one most reasonably would conclude that \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) is addressed to the States and merely establishes one of many conditions for receiving Federal Medicaid funds; the text does not clearly confer any substantive rights on Medicaid services providers.  This structural evidence is buttressed by the absence in the statute of any express "focus" on providers as a beneficiary class of the provision.  <em>See Wright, supra,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#430">479 U. S. 430</a></span> (finding a provision in the statute "focusing" on the plaintiff class dispositive evidence of Congress\' intent in the Brooke Amendment to create rights in favor of the plaintiff class).</p>\n<p>Even if one were to assume that the terms of \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A) confer a substantive right on providers in the nature of a guarantee of "reasonable and adequate" rates, the statute places its own limitation on that right in very plain language.  Section 1396a(a)(13)(A) establishes a procedure for establishing such rates of reimbursement.  The first step requires the States to make certain findings.  The second and only other step requires the States to make certain assurances to the Secretary and the Secretary -- not the courts -- to review those assurances.  Under the logic of our case law, respondent arguably may bring a \xc2\xa7 1983 actions to require that rates be set according to that process.  Indeed, establishment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 496 U. S. 528</a></p><p> of rates in accordance with that process is the only discernible right accruing to anyone under \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A).  But as this case illustrates, Medicaid providers bring \xc2\xa7 1983 actions to <em>avoid</em> the process, rather than to seek its implementation.  The Court approves such challenges despite the fact that a plaintiff\'s success in such a suit results in the displacement of rates created in accordance with the statutory process by rates established pursuant to court order.  To support its decision, the Court looks beyond the unambiguous terms of the statute and relies on policy considerations purportedly derived from legislative history and superseded versions of the statute.d  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#515">496 U. S. 515</a></span>-520.</p>\n<p>The court concludes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#519">496 U. S. 519</a></span>, that the contrary position equates with the proposition that the States are not obligated to adopt reasonable rates.  Indeed, the theme of much of the Court\'s argument is that without judicial enforceability, the States cannot be trusted to implement \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(13)(A)\'s command of creating rate systems that are reasonable and adequate.  The Court states at one point that</p>\n<p>"[i]t would make little sense for Congress to require a State to make findings without requiring those findings to be correct. . . .  We decline to adopt an interpretation of the Boren Amendment that would render it a dead letter."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html#514">496 U. S. 514</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The interpretation to which the Court refers, however, would scarcely render the Boren Amendment a "dead letter."  It is, instead, the Court\'s own reading that nullifies the "letter" of the Amendment.  Apart from its displacement of the statutory ratesetting process noted previously, the Court\'s suggestion that the States would deliberately disregard the requirements of the statute ignores the Secretary\'s oversight incorporated into the statute, and does less than justice to the States.  The Court itself recognizes that the basic purpose of the Boren Amendment was to allow the States more latitude in establishing Medicaid reimbursement rates.  In light of that fact, the Court\'s interpretation takes far more liberties </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 496 U.
