In 1942, he made a motion in that court to set aside the judgment of conviction on the grounds, among others, that the indictment did not state an offense against the United States, and that he had been denied the assistance of counsel at the trial.  The District Court denied the motion without taking testimony or making findings of fact, and denied an application for rehearing.  Petitioner lodged with the clerk of the District Court a petition for leave to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals <em>in forma pauperis.</em>  The clerk returned this to him by letter, stating,</p>\n<p>"Under the law, the petition to prosecute an appeal <em>in forma pauperis</em> should be submitted to the United States circuit court of appeals, and not the district court.  Therefore, your motion for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis</em> and order thereon are returned herewith."</p>\n<p>Petitioner then applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis,</em> which court denied the application.  He now seeks certiorari in this Court under \xc2\xa7 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 377 (<em>see In re 620 Church St. Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/24/case.html">299 U.

S. 40</a></p><p> review by reason of the refusal of the District Court to entertain his application to appeal <em>in forma pauperis</em> and the denial of a like application by the Circuit Court of Appeals.  Appeal from the District Court\'s order denying petitioner\'s motion to vacate the conviction is governed by \xc2\xa7 8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 230, which requires that proper application be made for allowance of an appeal.  <em>Wells v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/257/case.html">318 U. S. 257</a></span>, and cases cited.  But petitioner\'s filing of a motion for leave to appeal with the clerk of the District Court was a sufficient application, in view of the fact that an appeal may be allowed by either the District Court or the district judge.  <em>Ex parte Railroad Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/95/221/case.html">95 U.

The District Court declined to consider petitioner\'s application, apparently on the ground that the <em>in forma pauperis</em> statute required that his right to appeal as a poor person be determined by the Circuit Court of Appeals instead of by the District Court.</p>\n<p>The Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 866, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 832, granting the right to proceed <em>in forma pauperis,</em> provides that</p>\n<p>"Any citizen of the United States entitled to commence any suit or action, civil or criminal, in any court of the United States, may, upon the order of the court, commence and prosecute or defend to conclusion any suit or action . . . or an appeal to the circuit court of appeals . . . , including all appellate proceedings, unless the trial court shall certify in writing that in the opinion of the court such appeal . . . is not taken in good faith, without being required to prepay fees or costs. . . ."</p>\n<p>It is plain that, under these provisions, petitioner, being a poor person entitled to prosecute an appeal from the trial court to the Circuit Court of Appeals, was authorized to apply to the District Court for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis,</em> and that it was the duty of the District Court to entertain his application.  <em>See Wells v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 319 U. S. 41</a></p><p> <em>United States, supra.</em>  The statute authorizes the suit, including the appeal, to be prosecuted <em>in forma pauperis</em> upon order of the court in which the proceeding is commenced.  The right to appeal <em>in forma pauperis</em> from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals is not conditioned upon the consent of the Circuit Court of Appeals, even though it be assumed that that court could grant such permission.</p>\n<p>It follows that petitioner\'s application for appeal <em>in forma pauperis</em> should have been entertained by the District Court. and that opportunity should now be given to that court to act on the application before the consideration of other questions which the petitioner seeks to raise here by his application for certiorari.  We accordingly grant the motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> in this Court.  We also grant the petition for certiorari, and remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
