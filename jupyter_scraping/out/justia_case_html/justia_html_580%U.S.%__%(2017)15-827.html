The Court held that the Act guarantees a substantively adequate program of education to all eligible children, and that this requirement is satisfied if the child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP sets out an educational program that is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 207.

By fourth grade, Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents believed his academic and functional progress had stalled.  When the school district proposed a fifth grade IEP that resembled those from past years, Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents removed him from public school and enrolled him in a specialized private school, where he made significant progress.  School district representatives later presented Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents with a new fifth grade IEP, but they considered it no more adequate than the original plan.  They then sought reimbursement for Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s private school tuition by filing a complaint under the IDEA with the Colorado Department of Education.  Their claim was denied, and a Federal District Court affirmed that determination.  The Tenth Circuit also affirmed.  That court interpreted <i>Rowley </i>to establish a rule that a child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP is adequate as long as it is calculated to confer an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0educational benefit [that is] merely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. more than <i>de minimis,</i>\xe2\x80\x9d 798 F.\xc2\xa03d 1329, 1338 (internal quotation marks omitted), and concluded that Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s IEP had been \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0reasonably calculated to enable [him] to make <i>some</i> progress,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 1342 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The court accordingly held that Endrew had received a FAPE.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0To meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0<i>Rowley</i> and the language of the IDEA point to the approach adopted here.  The \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated\xe2\x80\x9d qualification reflects a recognition that crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials, informed by their own expertise and the views of a child\xe2\x80\x99s parents or guardians; any review of an IEP must appreciate that the question is whether the IEP is <i>reasonable</i>, not whether the court regards it as ideal.  An IEP must aim to enable the child to make progress; the essential function of an IEP is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement.  And the degree of progress contemplated by the IEP must be appropriate in light of the child\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, which should come as no surprise.  This reflects the focus on the particular child that is at the core of the IDEA, and the directive that States offer instruction \xe2\x80\x9c<i>specially</i> designed\xe2\x80\x9d to meet a child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<i>unique</i> needs\xe2\x80\x9d through an \xe2\x80\x9c[<i>i</i>]<i>ndividualized</i> education program.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(29), (14) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"><i>Rowley </i>sheds light on what appropriate progress will look like in many cases: For a child fully integrated in the regular classroom, an IEP typically should be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 204.  This guidance is grounded in the statutory definition of a FAPE.  One component of a FAPE is \xe2\x80\x9cspecial education,\xe2\x80\x9d defined as \xe2\x80\x9cspecially designed instruction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(9), (29).  In determining what it means to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet the unique needs\xe2\x80\x9d of a child with a disability, the provisions of the IDEA governing the IEP development process provide guidance.  These provisions reflect what the Court said in <i>Rowley </i>by focusing on \xe2\x80\x9cprogress in the general education curriculum.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A)(i) (I)(aa), (II)(aa), (IV)(bb).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"><i>Rowley </i>did not provide concrete guidance with respect to a child who is not fully integrated in the regular classroom and not able to achieve on grade level.  A child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP need not aim for grade-level advancement if that is not a reasonable prospect.  But that child\xe2\x80\x99s educational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances, just as advancement from grade to grade is appropriately ambitious for most children in the regular classroom.  The goals may differ, but every child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This standard is more demanding than the \xe2\x80\x9cmerely more than <i>de minimis</i>\xe2\x80\x9d test applied by the Tenth Circuit.  It cannot be right that the IDEA generally contemplates grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who are fully integrated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than <i>de minimis </i>progress for children who are not.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents argue that the Act goes even further and requires States to provide children with disabilities educational opportunities that are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially equal to the opportunities afforded children without disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 40.  But the lower courts in <i>Rowley</i> adopted a strikingly similar standard, and this Court rejected it in clear terms.  Mindful that Congress has not materially changed the statutory definition of a FAPE since <i>Rowley </i>was decided, this Court declines to interpret the FAPE provision in a manner so plainly at odds with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in that case.  P.\xc2\xa015.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The adequacy of a given IEP turns on the unique circumstances of the child for whom it was created.  This absence of a bright-line rule should not be mistaken for \xe2\x80\x9can invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U. S., at 206.  At the same time, deference is based on the application of expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities.  The nature of the IEP process ensures that parents and school representatives will fully air their respective opinions on the degree of progress a child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP should pursue; thus, by the time any dispute reaches court, school authorities will have had the chance to bring their expertise and judgment to bear on areas of disagreement.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414, 1415; <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U. S., at 208\xe2\x80\x93209.  At that point, a reviewing court may fairly expect those authorities to be able to offer a cogent and responsive explanation for their decisions that shows the IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the child to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances.

Her school district offered an IEP under which Amy would receive instruction in the regular classroom and spend time each week with a special tutor and a speech therapist.  The district proposed that Amy\xe2\x80\x99s classroom teacher speak into a wireless transmitter and that Amy use an FM hearing aid designed to amplify her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s words; the district offered to supply both components of this system.  But Amy\xe2\x80\x99s parents argued that the IEP should go further and provide a sign-language interpreter in all of her classes.  Contending that the school district\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to furnish an interpreter denied Amy a FAPE, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s parents initiated administrative proceedings, then filed a lawsuit under the Act.  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 184\xe2\x80\x93185.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court agreed that Amy had been denied a FAPE.

The school district, for its part, contended that the IDEA \xe2\x80\x9cdid not create substantive individual rights\xe2\x80\x9d; the FAPE provision was instead merely aspirational.

After all, the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfree appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x9d was expressly defined in the Act, even if the definition \xe2\x80\x9ctend[ed] toward the cryptic rather than the comprehensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 188.

Instead, the Court carefully charted a middle path.  Even though \xe2\x80\x9cCongress was rather sketchy in establishing substantive requirements\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act, <i>id., </i>at 206, the Court nonetheless made clear that the Act guarantees a substantively adequate program of education to all eligible children, <i>id.,</i> at 200\xe2\x80\x93202, 207; see <i>id.,</i> at 193, n.\xc2\xa015 (describing the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive standard .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. implicit in the Act\xe2\x80\x9d).

Although Endrew displayed a number of strengths\xe2\x80\x94his teachers described him as a humorous child with a \xe2\x80\x9csweet disposition\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cshow[ed] concern[\xc2\xa0] for friends\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he still \xe2\x80\x9cexhibited multiple behaviors that inhibited his ability to access learning in the classroom.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 182a; 798 F.\xc2\xa03d 1329, 1336 (CA10 2015).  Endrew would scream in class, climb over furniture and other students, and occasionally run away from school.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1336.  He was afflicted by severe fears of commonplace things like flies, spills, and public restrooms.  As Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents saw it, his academic and functional progress had essentially stalled: Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s IEPs largely carried over the same basic goals and objectives from one year to the next, indicating that he was failing to make meaningful progress toward his aims.<b> </b>His parents believed that only a thorough overhaul of the school district\xe2\x80\x99s approach to Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s behavioral problems could reverse the trend.  But in April 2010, the school district presented Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents with a proposed fifth grade IEP that was, in their view, pretty much the same as his past ones.  So his parents removed Endrew from public school and enrolled him at Firefly Autism House, a private school that specializes in educating children with autism.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Endrew did much better at Firefly.  The school developed a \xe2\x80\x9cbehavioral intervention plan\xe2\x80\x9d that identified Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s most problematic behaviors and set out particular strategies for addressing them.  See Supp. App. 198a\xe2\x80\x93201a.  Firefly also added heft to Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s academic goals.  Within months, Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s behavior improved significantly, permitting him to make a degree of academic progress that had eluded him in public school.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In November 2010, some six months after Endrew started classes at Firefly, his parents again met with representatives of the Douglas County School District.  The district presented a new IEP.  Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents considered the IEP no more adequate than the one proposed in April, and rejected it.  They were particularly concerned that the stated plan for addressing Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s behavior did not differ meaningfully from the plan in his fourth grade IEP, despite the fact that his experience at Firefly suggested that he would benefit from a different approach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In February 2012, Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents filed a complaint with the Colorado Department of Education seeking reimbursement for Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s tuition at Firefly.  To qualify for such relief, they were required to show that the school district had not provided Endrew a FAPE in a timely manner prior to his enrollment at the private school.  See \xc2\xa71412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents contended that the final IEP proposed by the school district was not \xe2\x80\x9creason-ably calculated to enable [Endrew] to receive educational benefits\xe2\x80\x9d and that Endrew had therefore been denied a FAPE.  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 207.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disagreed and denied relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents sought review in Federal District Court.  Giving \xe2\x80\x9cdue weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the decision of the ALJ, the District Court affirmed.  2014 WL 4548439, *5 (D Colo., Sept. 15, 2014) (quoting <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206).  The court acknowledged that Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s performance under past IEPs \xe2\x80\x9cdid not reveal immense educational growth.\xe2\x80\x9d  2014 WL 4548439, at *9.  But it concluded that annual modifications to Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s IEP objectives were \xe2\x80\x9csufficient to show a pattern of, at the least, minimal progress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Because Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s previous IEPs had enabled him to make this sort of progress, the court reasoned, his latest, similar IEP was reasonably calculated to do the same thing.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, that was all <i>Rowley </i>demanded.  2014 WL 4548439, at *9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals recited language from <i>Rowley </i>stating that the instruction and services furnished to children with disabilities must be calculated to confer \xe2\x80\x9c<i>some </i>educational benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d  798 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1338 (quoting <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 200; emphasis added by Tenth Circuit).  The court noted that it had long interpreted this language to mean that a child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP is adequate as long as it is calculated to confer an \xe2\x80\x9ceducational benefit [that is] merely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. more than <i>de minimis.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  798 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1338 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying this standard, the Tenth Circuit held that Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s IEP had been \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated to enable [him] to make <i>some </i>progress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1342 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, he had not been denied a FAPE.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari.  579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court in <i>Rowley </i>declined \xe2\x80\x9cto establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202.  The school district, however, contends that <i>Rowley </i>nonetheless established that \xe2\x80\x9can IEP need not promise any particular <i>level </i>of benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0reasonably calculated\xe2\x80\x99 to provide <i>some </i>benefit, as opposed to <i>none</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 15.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The district relies on several passages from <i>Rowley </i>to make its case.  It points to our observation that \xe2\x80\x9cany substantive standard prescribing the level of education to be accorded\xe2\x80\x9d children with disabilities was \xe2\x80\x9c[n]oticeably absent from the language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 189; see Brief for Respondent 14.  The district also emphasizes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the Act requires States to provide access to instruction \xe2\x80\x9csufficient to confer <i>some</i> educational benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoning that any benefit, however minimal, satisfies this mandate.  Brief for Respondent 15 (quoting <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 200).  Finally, the district urges that the Court conclusively adopted a \xe2\x80\x9csome educational benefit\xe2\x80\x9d standard when it wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthe intent of the Act was more to open the door of public education to handicapped children .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. than to guarantee any particular level of education.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 192; see Brief for Respond-ent 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These statements in isolation do support the school district\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  But the district makes too much of them.  Our statement that the face of the IDEA imposed no explicit substantive standard must be evaluated alongside our statement that a substantive standard was \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit<i> </i>in the Act<i>.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 193, n.\xc2\xa015.  Similarly, we find little significance in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s language concerning the requirement that States provide instruction calculated to \xe2\x80\x9cconfer some educational benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 200.  The Court had no need to say anything more particular, since the case before it involved a child whose progress plainly demonstrated that her IEP was designed to deliver more than adequate educational benefits.  See <i>id.,</i> at 202, 209\xe2\x80\x93210.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s principal concern was to correct what it viewed as the surprising rulings below: that the IDEA effectively empowers judges to elaborate a federal common law of public education, and that a child performing <i>better </i>than most in her class had been denied a FAPE.  The Court was not concerned with precisely articulating a governing standard for closer cases.  See <i>id.,</i> at 202.  And the statement that the Act did not \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee any particular level of education\xe2\x80\x9d simply reflects the unobjectionable proposition that the IDEA cannot and does not promise \xe2\x80\x9cany particular [educational] outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted).  No law could do that\xe2\x80\x94for any child.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More important, the school district\xe2\x80\x99s reading of these isolated statements runs headlong into several points on which <i>Rowley </i>is crystal clear.  For instance\xe2\x80\x94just after saying that the Act requires instruction that is \xe2\x80\x9csufficient to confer some educational benefit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94we noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he determination of when handicapped children are receiving <i>sufficient </i>educational benefits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. presents a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. difficult problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 200, 202 (emphasis added).  And then we expressly declined \xe2\x80\x9cto establish any one test for determining the <i>adequacy </i>of educational benefits\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  <i>Id.,</i> at 202<i> </i>(emphasis added).  It would not have been \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult\xe2\x80\x9d for us to say when educational benefits are sufficient if we had just said that <i>any</i> educational benefit was enough.  And it would have been strange to refuse to set out a test for the adequacy of educational benefits if we had just done exactly that.  We cannot accept the school district\xe2\x80\x99s reading of <i>Rowley</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While <i>Rowley </i>declined to articulate an overarching standard to evaluate the adequacy of the education provided under the Act, the decision and the statutory language point to a general approach: To meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated\xe2\x80\x9d qualification reflects a recognition that crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials.  <i>Id.,</i> at 207.  The Act contemplates that this fact-intensive exercise will be informed not only by the expertise of school officials, but also by the input of the child\xe2\x80\x99s parents or guardians.  <i>Id.,</i> at 208\xe2\x80\x93209.  Any review of an IEP must appreciate that the question is whether the IEP is <i>reasonable</i>, not whether the court regards it as ideal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 206\xe2\x80\x93207.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The IEP must aim to enable the child to make progress.  After all, the essential function of an IEP is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)\xe2\x80\x93(IV).  This reflects the broad purpose of the IDEA, an \xe2\x80\x9cambitious\xe2\x80\x9d piece of legislation enacted \xe2\x80\x9cin response to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 perception that a majority of handicapped children in the United States \xe2\x80\x98were either totally excluded from schools or [were] sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \xe2\x80\x9cdrop out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 179 (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93332, p.\xc2\xa02 (1975)).  A substantive standard not focused on student progress would do little to remedy the pervasive and tragic academic stagnation that prompted Congress to act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That the progress contemplated by the IEP must be appropriate in light of the child\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances should come as no surprise.  A focus on the particular child is at the core of the IDEA.  The instruction offered must be \xe2\x80\x9c<i>specially</i> designed\xe2\x80\x9d to meet a child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<i>unique </i>needs\xe2\x80\x9d through an \xe2\x80\x9c[<i>i</i>]<i>ndividualized </i>education program.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(29), (14) (emphasis added).  An IEP is not a form document.  It is constructed only after careful consideration of the child\xe2\x80\x99s present levels of achievement, disability, and potential for growth.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)\xe2\x80\x93(IV), (d)(3)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv).  As we observed in <i>Rowley</i>, the IDEA \xe2\x80\x9crequires participating States to educate a wide spectrum of handicapped children,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits obtainable by children at one end of the spectrum will differ dramatically from those obtainable by children at the other end, with infinite variations in between.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Rowley </i>sheds light on what appropriate progress will look like in many cases.  There, the Court recognized that the IDEA requires that children with disabilities receive education in the regular classroom \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever possible<i>.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing \xc2\xa71412(a)(5)).  When this preference is met, \xe2\x80\x9cthe system itself monitors the educational progress of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 202\xe2\x80\x93203.  \xe2\x80\x9cRegular examinations are administered, grades are awarded, and yearly advancement to higher grade levels is permitted for those children who attain an adequate knowledge of the course material.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 203. <i> </i>Progress through this system is what our society generally means by an \xe2\x80\x9ceducation.\xe2\x80\x9d  And access to an \xe2\x80\x9ceducation\xe2\x80\x9d is what the IDEA promises.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Accordingly, for a child fully integrated in the regular classroom, an IEP typically should, as <i>Rowley </i>put it, be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 203\xe2\x80\x93204.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This guidance is grounded in the statutory definition of a FAPE.  One of the components of a FAPE is \xe2\x80\x9cspecial education,\xe2\x80\x9d defined as \xe2\x80\x9cspecially designed instruction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(9), (29).  In determining what it means to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet the unique needs\xe2\x80\x9d of a child with a disability, the provisions governing the IEP development process are a natural source of guidance: It is through the IEP that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xe2\x80\x98free appropriate public education\xe2\x80\x99 required by the Act is tailored to the unique needs of\xe2\x80\x9d a particular child.  <i>Id.,</i>at 181.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The IEP provisions reflect <i>Rowley</i>\xe2\x80\x99s expectation that, for most children, a FAPE will involve integration in the reg-ular classroom and individualized special education calculated to achieve advancement from grade to grade.  Every IEP begins by describing a child\xe2\x80\x99s present level of achieve-ment, including explaining \xe2\x80\x9chow the child\xe2\x80\x99s disability affects the child\xe2\x80\x99s involvement and progress in the general education curriculum.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(aa).  It then sets out \xe2\x80\x9ca statement of measurable annual goals .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. designed to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum,\xe2\x80\x9d along with a description of specialized instruction and services that the child will receive.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II), (IV).  The instruction and services must likewise be provided with an eye toward \xe2\x80\x9cprogress in the general education curriculum.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)(bb).  Similar IEP requirements have been in place since the time the States began accepting funding under the IDEA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The school district protests that these provisions impose only procedural requirements\xe2\x80\x94a checklist of items the IEP must address\xe2\x80\x94not a substantive standard enforce-able in court.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  But the procedures are there for a reason, and their focus provides insight into what it means, for purposes of the FAPE definition, to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet the unique needs\xe2\x80\x9d of a child with a disability.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(9), (29).  When a child is fully integrated in the regular classroom, as the Act prefers, what that typically means is providing a level of instruction reasonablycalculated to permit advancement through the general curriculum.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Rowley </i>had no need to provide concrete guidance with respect to a child who is not fully integrated in the regular classroom and not able to achieve on grade level.  That case concerned a young girl who was progressing smoothly through the regular curriculum.  If that is not a reason-able prospect for a child, his IEP need not aim for grade-level advancement.  But his educational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances, just as advancement from grade to grade is appropriately ambitious for most children in the regular classroom.  The goals may differ, but every child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course this describes a general standard, not a formula.  But whatever else can be said about it, this standard is markedly more demanding than the \xe2\x80\x9cmerely more than <i>de minimis</i>\xe2\x80\x9d test applied by the Tenth Circuit.  It cannot be the case that the Act typically aims for grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who can be educated in the regular classroom, but is satisfiedwith barely more than <i>de minimis </i>progress for those who cannot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing \xe2\x80\x9cmerely more than <i>de minimis</i>\xe2\x80\x9d progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.  For children with disabilities, receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to \xe2\x80\x9csitting idly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. awaiting the time when they were old enough to \xe2\x80\x98drop out.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 179 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  The IDEA demands more.  It requires an educational program reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Endrew\xe2\x80\x99s parents argue that the Act goes even further.  In their view, a FAPE is \xe2\x80\x9can education that aims to provide a child with a disability opportunities to achieve academic success, attain self-sufficiency, and contribute to society that are substantially equal to the opportunities afforded children without disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 40.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This standard is strikingly similar to the one the lower courts adopted in <i>Rowley</i>, and it is virtually identical to the formulation advanced by Justice Blackmun in his separate writing in that case.  See 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 185\xe2\x80\x93186; <i>id.,</i> at 211 (opinion concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he question is whether Amy\xe2\x80\x99s program .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. offered her an opportunity to understand and participate in the classroom that was substantially equal to that given her non-handicapped classmates\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the majority rejected any such standard in clear terms.  <i>Id.,</i> at 198 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe requirement that States provide \xe2\x80\x98equal\xe2\x80\x99 educational opportunities would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. seem to present an entirely unworkable standard requiring impossible measurements and comparisons\xe2\x80\x9d).  Mindful that Congress (despite several intervening amendments to the IDEA) has not materially changed the statutory definition of a FAPE since <i>Rowley </i>was decided, we decline to interpret the FAPE provision in a manner so plainly at odds with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in that case.  Compare \xc2\xa71401(18) (1976 ed.) with \xc2\xa71401(9) (2012 ed.).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We will not attempt to elaborate on what \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d progress will look like from case to case.  It is in the nature of the Act and the standard we adopt to resist such an effort: The adequacy of a given IEP turns on the unique circumstances of the child for whom it was created.  This absence of a bright-line rule, however, should not be mistaken for \xe2\x80\x9can invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, deference is based on the application of expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities.  The Act vests these officials with responsibility for decisions of critical importance to the life of a disabled child.  The nature of the IEP process, from the initial consultation through state administrative proceedings, ensures that parents and school representatives will fully air their respective opinions on the degree of progress a child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP should pursue.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414, 1415; <i>id., </i>at<i> </i>208\xe2\x80\x93209.  By the time any dispute reaches court, school authorities will have had a complete opportunity to bring their expertise and judgment to bear on areas of disagreement.  A reviewing court may fairly expect those authorities to be able to offer a cogent and responsive explanation for their decisions that shows the IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the child to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The requirement was initially set out in the Education of the Handicapped Act, which was later amended and renamed the IDEA.
