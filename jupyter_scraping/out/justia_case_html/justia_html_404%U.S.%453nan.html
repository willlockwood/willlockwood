JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We are asked to determine whether the Federal Power Commission exceeded its statutory authorization when it asserted jurisdiction over the Florida Power &amp; Light Co.  Section 201(b) of the Federal Power Act, as amended, 49 Stat. 847, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824(b), grants the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over</p>\n<p>"the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and . . . the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but . . . not [over] any other sale of electric energy. . . ."</p>\n<p>Section 201(c) defines energy transmitted in interstate commerce as energy "transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/515/case.html">Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 404 U.

S. 515</a></span> (1945), we noted that, by this definition the initial jurisdictional determination "was to follow the flow of electric energy, an engineering and scientific, rather than a legalistic or governmental, test."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/515/case.html#529">324 U. S. 529</a></span>; <em>FPC v. Southern California Edison Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/205/case.html">376 U.

(FP&amp;L) generates energy that is transmitted in interstate commerce.  They therefore held the company subject to the Commission\'s jurisdiction.  Respondent FP&amp;L argues that an alternative model better represents the flow of its electricity; by use of this model, it purports to demonstrate that its power has not flowed in interstate commerce.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the FPC\'s tests as "not sufficient to prove the actual transmission of energy interstate."  430 F.2d 1377, 1383 (1970).  It did not approve FP&amp;L\'s test ("Both [the FPC and the FP&amp;L tests] suffer from the same vice," <em>id.</em> at 1385), but, because the FPC must shoulder the burden of proof, its finding of jurisdiction was set aside.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to determine if either of the FPC\'s tests provides an acceptable basis at law and a sufficient basis in fact, for the establishment of jurisdiction.  401 U.S. 907 (1971). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 404 U. S. 456</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>FP&amp;L is Florida\'s largest electric utility.  At the time relevant to this litigation, it served nearly one million customers, ranked ninth nationally among electric companies in revenues, 14th in investment in gross utility electric plant, and 16th in kilowatt-hour sales.  Despite this significant size, the peninsular nature of Florida, the concentration of the company\'s sales in the southern part of the State, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and the recurrent threat of hurricanes which might sever power lines combine to make the operations of the company unusually insular and independent of the operations of like companies in other States.  All of FP&amp;L\'s equipment, including transmission lines, is confined to Florida, and none of its lines directly connects with those of out-of-state companies.</p>\n<p>FP&amp;L does, however, indirectly connect with out-of-state companies.  As a member of the Florida Pool, it is interconnected with the Florida Power Corp. (Corp), [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the Tampa Electric Co., the Orlando Utilities Commission, and the City of Jacksonville.  These interconnected utilities and authorities coordinate their activities and exchange power as circumstances require. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In 1964, FP&amp;L transferred over 107 million kwh to Corp </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 404 U. S. 457</a></p><p> and received over 61 million kwh from Corp. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  If power from FP&amp;L flows in interstate commerce, it is because Corp interconnects just short of Florida\'s northern border with Georgia Power Co., [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and regularly exchanges power with it. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Georgia\'s lines transmit the power out of or into Florida.  There are numerous instances in which transfers between Georgia and Corp are recorded as coinciding with transfers between Corp and FP&amp;L. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Georgia-Corp interconnection serves another function.  Corp, FP&amp;L, and the other Florida Pool participants are members of the Interconnected Systems Group (ISG), a national interlocking of utilities that automatically provides power in case of emergencies.  In time of emergency, this power also would flow through Corp\'s links with Georgia.  To date, FP&amp;L has had no occasion to call for ISG power.  But when a midwestern utility sustained a 580-megawatt generating loss, a regularly scheduled 8-megawatt FP&amp;L contribution to the Florida Pool coincided with an 8-megawatt contribution from the pool to the ISG system. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 404 U. S. 458</a></p><p></p>\n<p>These relationships establish the focal issue in this case.  The FPC may exercise jurisdiction only if there is substantial evidentiary support for the Commission\'s conclusion that FP&amp;L power has reached Georgia via Corp or that Georgia\'s power has reached FP&amp;L because of exchanges with Corp.  What happens when FP&amp;L gives power to Corp and Corp gives power to Georgia (or vice versa)?  Is FP&amp;L power commingled with Corp\'s own supply, and thus passed on with that supply, as the Commission contends?  Or is it diverted to handle Corp\'s independent power needs, displacing a like amount of Corp power that is then passed on, as respondent argues?  Or, as the Commission also contends, do changes in FP&amp;L\'s load or generation, or that of others in the interconnected system, stimulate a reaction up and down the line by a signal or a chain reaction that is, in essence, electricity moving in interstate commerce?  Upon answer to these questions jurisdiction rides.</p>\n<p>If FP&amp;L were directly involved in power exchanges with Georgia, there would be no serious question about the resolution of this case.  Section 201 of the Federal Power Act owes its origin to the determination of this Court that a direct transfer of power from a utility in Rhode Island to a utility in Massachusetts is in interstate commerce.  <em>See Public Utilities Comm\'n v. Attleboro Steam &amp; Electric Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/83/case.html">273 U. S. 83</a></span> (1927).  "Part II [of the Act] is a direct result of <em>Attleboro.</em>"  <em>United States v. Public Utilities Comm\'n of California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/295/case.html">345 U. S. 295</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/295/case.html#311">345 U. S. 311</a></span> (1953).  There can be no doubt that \xc2\xa7 201 achieves its end and fills the "<em>Attleboro</em> gap" by giving the FPC jurisdiction over direct exchanges.  <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. FPC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/515/case.html">324 U. S. 515</a></span> (1945).</p>\n<p>Nor would there be any difficulty in resolving this case if the company or companies that stood between FP&amp;L and the out-of-state power companies could be shown to be sometimes no more than a funnel.  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 404 U. S. 459</a></p><p> <em>Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. FPC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/61/case.html">319 U. S. 61</a></span> (1943), the first of the major FPC jurisdictional cases to be considered by this Court, Jersey Central supplied power to the Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. (also a New Jersey company), which in turn had exchange arrangements with Staten Island Edison Corp. (a New York company).  The transfer from PSE&amp;G to Staten Island was effected through a "bus" -- a transmission line of three conductors into which a number of subsidiary lines connect.  The FPC showed through extensive sampling of the logs of the relevant companies that, on at least a dozen occasions when Staten Island drew power from the bus, only Jersey Central was supplying the bus.  Thus, the intermediate presence of PSE&amp;G was shown to be, in some circumstances, a null factor, and it was established that Jersey Central energy was moving in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>In the litigation before us, the record does not disclose situations in which Corp operated as a null or insufficient factor.  Thus, the FPC has not in this litigation demonstrated with the clarity and certainty obtaining in the Jersey Central case that the energy flows that are a prerequisite to jurisdiction occurred.</p>\n<p>This is not, however, the equivalent of saying that the flows did not occur, or that there was not substantial evidence for concluding that they did.  The Court of Appeals was hardly less emphatic than the Federal Power Commission in its conclusion that FP&amp;L\'s "proof" that the flows did not occur was unconvincing.  The court purported to have no opinion whether the flows had actually occurred.  The question that must be resolved, therefore, is whether the evidence presented, though not so certain and convincing as that which the FPC offered in <em>Jersey Central,</em> was nonetheless adequate to establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>We turn first to the conflicting contentions of the parties. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 404 U. S. 460</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Federal Power Commission followed alternate routes to its conclusion that FP&amp;L energy moved in interstate commerce.  The first course, based on what the Commission called the electromagnetic unity of response of interconnected electrical systems, is best represented in the words of the hearing examiner:</p>\n<p>"[N]one of the connected electric systems, including that of Florida, Corp, and Georgia, has any control over the actual transfers of power at each point of interconnection, because of the free flow characteristics of electric networks. . . ."</p>\n<p>"An electric utility system such as Florida [Power &amp; Light] is essentially an electromechanical system to which all operating generators on the interconnected network are interlocked electromagnetically.  This means that electric generators, under ordinary operating conditions, run either at exactly the same speed or at speeds which will result in a frequency of 60 cycles.  No operating generator can change its speed by itself as long as it operates connected to the network.  All generators connected to the same network must follow each other as to speed and frequency whenever there is a change in frequency, and the frequency of all interlocked generators is always exactly the same."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"If a housewife in Atlanta on the Georgia system turns on a light, every generator on Florida\'s system almost instantly is caused to produce some quantity of additional electric energy which serves to maintain the balance in the interconnected system between generation and load.  If sensitive enough instruments were available and were to be placed throughout Florida\'s system, the increase in generation by every generator on Florida [Power &amp; Light] could be precisely measured. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 404 U. S. 461</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The hearing examiner concluded:</p>\n<p>"The cause and effect relationship in electric energy occurring throughout every generator and point on the Georgia, Corp and Florida systems constitutes interstate transmission of electric energy by, to, and from Florida.  It is the electromagnetic unity of response of Florida, Corp, Georgia and other interconnecting systems that constitutes the interstate transmission of electric energy by Florida. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]"</p>\n<p>By this analysis, a change in FP&amp;L\'s load or generating pattern depletes or adds to the force available in out-of-state lines; therefore, FP&amp;L is transmitting energy in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>The alternative analysis by the Commission and its staff experts concentrates on power flow within the "Turner bus" -- the point of connection between Corp\'s and FP&amp;L\'s systems.  Power supplied to the bus from a variety of sources is said to merge at a point and to be commingled just as molecules of water from different sources (rains, streams, etc.) would be commingled in a reservoir.  On this basis, the FPC need only show (1) FP&amp;L power entering the bus and (2) power leaving the bus for out-of-state destinations at the same moment, in order to establish the fact that <em>some</em> FP&amp;L power goes out of State. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The FPC purported to make this demonstration by a series of tracing studies. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>FP&amp;L objects.  The first approach is said to be technologically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 404 U. S. 462</a></p><p> sound, but legally insufficient in that it does not demonstrate that any FP&amp;L power flows in interstate commerce, but only that it <em>affects</em> interstate commerce.  Congress, it is argued, could have chosen to grant the FPC jurisdiction over activities affecting commerce, but it clearly did not do so. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The second approach of the FPC purports to meet the standard at law, but, according to FP&amp;L, it is technologically unsound.  A bus is not a point, but rather a tangible, physical three-strand power line, in this case 225 feet in length.  It is argued that it is not a general reservoir.  Power, according to this argument, enters and is drawn off the line at discrete identifiable points.  Power from any given source will not flow further along the line than loads of wattage cumulatively equal to the wattage of the power source.  The distribution of entry lines and wattage loads on the Turner bus is said to demonstrate that all of the FP&amp;L\'s power will be exhausted by Corp\'s load lines before the point, further down the line, where Georgia\'s load intervenes.  When power flows in the opposite direction (<em>i.e.,</em> north to south), again the effect is one of displacement:  Georgia\'s power goes to Corp\'s loads, and the output of Corp\'s generators is thus displaced to FP&amp;L.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We do not find it necessary to approve or disapprove the Federal Power Commission\'s analysis based on unity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 404 U. S. 463</a></p><p> of electromagnetic response.  Its alternative assertion that energy commingles in a bus is, in our opinion, sufficient to sustain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>In evaluating this second approach, the courts are called upon to do no more than assess the Commission\'s judgment of technical facts.  If the Commission\'s conclusion of commingling is not overturned, then the legal consequences are clear.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the FPC that FP&amp;L energy commingled with that of Corp and was transmitted in commerce rested on the testimony of expert witnesses.  The major points expounded by these witnesses were probed, and, in our opinion, not undercut, by the hearing examiner\'s questions, FP&amp;L\'s cross-examination, and rebuttal testimony of FP&amp;L witnesses.  The hearing examiner found the testimony persuasive, and held that his conclusions could be independently reached upon it.  A majority of the Commission, reasoning similarly, endorsed these conclusions.</p>\n<p>A court must be reluctant to reverse results supported by such a weight of considered and carefully articulated expert opinion.  Particularly when we consider a purely factual question within the area of competence of an administrative agency created by Congress, and when resolution of that question depends on "engineering and scientific" considerations, we recognize the relevant agency\'s technical expertise and experience, and defer to its analysis unless it is without substantial basis in fact.  An appreciation of such different institutional capacities is reflected in the congressional directive defining the terms of judicial review of FPC action:  "The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive."  Federal Power Act \xc2\xa7 313(b), 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 8251(b).  <em>See Gainesville Utilities Dept. v. Florida Power Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/515/case.html">402 U. S. 515</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/515/case.html#526">402 U. S. 526</a></span>-529 (1971). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 404 U. S. 464</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals appears to have rejected the Commission\'s conclusions for two reasons.  First, it apparently regarded these conclusions as supported by mere speculation, rather than evidence.  In its view, expert opinion about the nature of reality, however logically compelling, is not fact. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Second, even if the Commission\'s views might be said to be supported by substantial evidence, the Court of Appeals apparently thought it important that the Commission acknowledged that its conclusions rest upon representations of a reality imperfectly understood.  From this, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was dealing with a "simplified characterization" that, despite the frequent use of that same characterization by other courts of appeals, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] was too uncertain in its application to any particular situation to be used as the basis for establishing jurisdiction. We reverse and reinstate the FPC\'s order because we do not think these points are well taken. As to the Court of Appeals\' first reservation, we hold that well reasoned expert testimony -- based on what is known and uncontradicted by empirical evidence -- may, in and of itself, be "substantial evidence" when first-hand evidence on the question (in this case, how electricity moves within </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 404 U. S. 465</a></p><p> a bus) is unavailable. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  This proposition has been so long accepted, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and indeed has been so often applied specifically to challenges to the FPC\'s determination of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 404 U. S. 466</a></p><p> technical matters, that we do not consider it fairly in dispute.  <em>See, e.g., FPC v. Southern California Edison Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/205/case.html">376 U. S. 205</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/205/case.html#209">376 U. S. 209</a></span> n. 5 (1964); <em>Travelers\' Indemnity Co. v.

As Judge Parker said in the Court of Appeals\' opinion in the latter case:</p>\n<p>"The [substantial evidence] rule is no different because the questions involve matters of scientific knowledge and the evidence consists largely of the opinion of experts.  The court may not, for that reason, ignore the conclusions of the experts and the Commission and put itself in the absurd position of substituting its judgment for theirs on controverted matters of hydraulic engineering.  It is in just such matters that the findings of the Commission, because of its experience and the assistance of its technical staff, should be accorded the greatest weight, and the courts should be most hesitant to substitute their judgment for that of the Commission."</p>\n<p>191 F.2d at 808.  On affirming, this Court noted,</p>\n<p>"[W]e cannot say, within the limited scope of review open to us, that the Commission\'s findings were not warranted.  Judgment upon these conflicting engineering and economic issues is precisely that which the Commission exists to determine, so long as it cannot be said, as it cannot, that the judgment which it exercised had no basis in evidence, and so was devoid of reason."</p>\n<p>345 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/153/case.html#171">345 U. S. 171</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The elusive nature of electrons renders experimental evidence that might draw the fine distinctions required by this case practically unobtainable.  That does not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 404 U. S. 467</a></p><p> mean that expert testimony is insubstantial and that FP&amp;L is beyond federal regulation.</p>\n<p>We think the second, related, concern expressed by the Court of Appeals exaggerates the standard of proof required in civil cases such as this.  The lower court would apparently require tracing studies showing an energy flow-through like that demonstrated in <em>Jersey Central.</em></p>\n<p>We do not think <em>Jersey Central</em> sets such high jurisdictional standards.  Special circumstances in that case (the occasional operation of PSE&amp;G as a null factor) permitted the FPC to present clear and compelling proof of interstate transactions.  But we assessed the FPC\'s determination not by the standards of certainty, but rather by the substantial evidence test. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The fact that the FPC was exceptionally convincing in that leading case does not raise the standard that it must meet in all future cases.</p>\n<p>Finding no reason in the case law for imposing a standard of certainty, we are not willing to construct one.  It is not true, as argued by respondent, that an engineering test of certainty is needed to reserve an area of state jurisdiction.  On top of the "engineering and scientific test" that controls this case, the Federal Power Act imposes a "legalistic or governmental" test.  Federal jurisdiction may not reach "facilities used in local distribution" of energy.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824(b).  Thus, state jurisdiction is clearly demarcated and preserved.  <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. FPC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/515/case.html">324 U.

The question is whether it has done so.</p>\n<p>The Examiner explains the "electromagnetic unity" theory and tells us in electrical engineering terms why that unasserted power of Congress exists:</p>\n<p>"An electric utility system such as [respondent\'s] is essentially an electromechanical system to which all operating generators on the interconnected network are interlocked electromagnetically.  This means that electric generators, under ordinary operating conditions, run either at exactly the same speed or at speeds which will result in a frequency of 60 cycles.  No operating generator can change its speed by itself as long as it operates connected to the network.  All generators connected to the same network must follow each other as to speed and frequency whenever there is a change in frequency, and the frequency of all interlocked generators is always exactly the same."</p>\n<p>"The electric systems of [respondent] and all other interconnected systems are essentially alike as to electrical, electromagnetic and electromechanical characteristics.  Because they are alike, it is possible to have presently existing interconnected operations on a very large scale, extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Canadian to the Mexican border."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"If a housewife in Atlanta on the Georgia system turns on a light, every generator on [respondent\'s] system almost instantly is caused to produce some quantity of additional electric energy which serves to maintain the balance in the interconnected system between generation and load."</p>\n<p>37 F.P.C. 544, 567-568. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 404 U.

S. 72</a></span> (1943), the Court avoids validating the FPC\'s electromagnetic unity theory as the jurisdictional hold over the respondent.  Instead, relying on the Commission\'s expertise, the Court purports to hold a narrower ground that actual flows of FP&amp;L\'s electricity were. in fact, measured passing out of Florida through the employment of the Commission\'s "commingled" tracing method.  Closer analysis of this latter wizardry, which had previously been rejected by the Commission, <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.,</em> 3 F.P.C. 132 (1942), reveals, however, that actual flows were not, in fact, measured but were simply hypothesized using an engineering model which, as the dissenting commissioners observed, "[assumed] the fact in issue, and thus [begged] . . . the question of jurisdiction."  The conventional tracing method previously used in cases such as this one reached an entirely different result -- that no actual interstate flow of FPL power had occurred.  <em>Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. FPC, supra; Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. FPC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/515/case.html">324 U. S. 515</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Commission\'s abandonment of the conventional test in favor of the commingled method will now mean that every privately owned interconnected facility in the United States (except for those isolated in Texas) is within the FPC\'s jurisdiction.  Both tracing methods assume that a momentary increase in FP&amp;L\'s generation over its local needs will be passed on to the interconnecting Florida Power Corp. (Corp) system located between FP&amp;L and the state line.  The conventional system assumes that such excesses will be absorbed by the first few loads reached in the Corp system, and therefore will never cross the state line.  On the other hand, the commingled approach assumes that the first load which the FP&amp;L excess </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 404 U. S. 472</a></p><p> reaches will continue to rely upon other utilities\' power to a large extent, and therefore will absorb only a part of the FP&amp;L excess.  The leftover FP&amp;L excess will then travel to the next load, but, again, will only supply part of those consumers\' needs, with the remainder passing on to the next load, and so on, until some fractional part of the original FP&amp;L excess crosses the state line.  Extending the assumption\'s application, it is clear that any momentary increase in output by any generator located at any point in the ISG grid will send a surge of power throughout the entire network.  If this assumption is approved, then it is difficult to perceive what remains of the <em>Jersey Central</em> proposition that "[m]ere connection determines nothing."</p>\n<p>These scientific facts are, of course, the basis for the grid systems, much in vogue these days.  But the Commission has no authority to order a company to enter a grid.  Unless it is done voluntarily, as was true here, the Commission, by virtue of \xc2\xa7 202(b) of the Federal Power Act, can act only [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] "upon application of any State commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy."  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a(b).</p>\n<p>A company transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce is subject to regulation by the Commission of its wholesale rates.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824(b).  But there is no claim here that wholesale selling is involved; and the minuscule nature of the "commingling" that has taken place and its incidental nature are doubtless the reasons why the Commission has not undertaken that phase of regulation.  The case is therefore unlike <em>Pennsylvana Water &amp; Power Co. v. FPC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/414/case.html">343 U.

All that is involved here is an effort to make respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 404 U. S. 473</a></p><p> follow the Commission\'s Uniform System of Accounts. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 825(a).</p>\n<p>Rather than the engineering battle over tracing method, the central question ought to be whether the "commingling" is so <em>de minimis</em> as to warrant the fastening of the federal bureaucracy on this local company.  The limited purpose of this legislation was stated clearly in the Senate Report:</p>\n<p>"The decision of the Supreme Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/273/83/case.html">Public Utilities Commission v.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>While federal regulation was to be pervasive, once fastened onto a company, Congress expressed an unambiguous policy to preserve and to rely upon effective and adequate state regulation:</p>\n<p>"<em>The revised bill would impose Federal regulation only over those matters which cannot effectively be controlled by the States.</em>  The limitation on the Federal Power Commission\'s jurisdiction in this regard has been inserted in each section in an effort to prevent the expansion of Federal authority over State matters."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 18 (emphasis supplied).  And this objective is presented in the statute\'s language:</p>\n<p>"It is hereby declared . . . that Federal regulation . . . is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States."</p>\n<p>Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, \xc2\xa7 201(a), 49 Stat. 847.  The Commission does not assert that Florida\'s regulation of FP&amp;L is inadequate.  Each year, the Florida Public Service Commission conducts field audits of electric utilities to ensure compliance with its accounting practices and depreciation rates. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Other than enhancing the slogan </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 404 U. S. 475</a></p><p> of "federal leadership" the Commission cites no function which it might better fulfill than the state regime.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s result also runs counter to the expressed desire of Congress to encourage voluntary interconnection.  <em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 202(a), 49 Stat. 848.  Interconnection between two local companies will now subject both to federal jurisdiction if either is also connected to a grid which at some point crosses a state line.  To avoid the costs associated with switching from state to federal regulation, a utility may now be induced to sever such interconnections.  As the dissenting commissioners recognized:</p>\n<p>"[I]nterconnections serve the objective of reliability, and . . . reliability is strongly in the public interest.  But with the present near universality of interconnections, it would seem that the Commission\'s opinion would as likely lead to present connections\' being broken as to new connections\' being established or existing connections strengthened."</p>\n<p>37 F.P.C. at 559 (1967).</p>\n<p>In light of these congressional purposes, I would not superimpose federal regulation on top of state regulation in case of <em>de minimis</em> transmissions not made by prearrangement or in case of wholesale transactions.

The record further supports the Examiner\'s findings that FPL normally has no control over the actual transfers of electric power and energy with any particular electric system with which it is interconnected; that, since electric energy can be delivered virtually instantaneously when needed on a system at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, such energy can be and is transmitted to FPL when needed from out-of-state generators, and in turn can be and is transmitted from FPL to help meet out-of-state demands; and, finally, that there is a cause and effect relationship in electric energy occurring throughout every generator and point on the FPL, Corp, Georgia, and Southern systems which constitutes interstate transmission of electric energy by, to, and from FPL."</p>\n<p>37 F.P.C. at 549.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, apart from the infinitesimal and sporadic exchanges, the Commission only found that "FPL [respondent] contributed 8 mw to ISG to assist a midwestern utility which had sustained a 580-mw generator loss."  <em>Ibid.</em>  And that single episode could be measured in terms of seconds only.  Such fleeting episodes are not, in my view, sufficient to displace a state regime with the federal one, since the Congress promised that as much as possible be left to the States.  I would not make that a hollow promise.</p>\n<p>If we allow federal preemption in this case, then we have come full cycle, leaving local authorities control of electric energy only insofar as municipal plants are concerned.  The federal camel has a tendency to occupy permanently any state tent.</p>\n<p>That may be a wise course, but, if so, Congress should make the decision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Apart from the exigencies of "war."  <em>See</em> 1 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a(c).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>This is not a case where State regulation has a hiatus that the federal regime fills.

It maintains a continuous examination of these reports and conducts continuing field audits on the company premises to verify the accuracy . . . to determine the compliance of the basic accounting records with the <em>Uniform System of Accounts prescribed in the Commission\'s Rules and Regulations.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Public Utilities Comm\'n v.
