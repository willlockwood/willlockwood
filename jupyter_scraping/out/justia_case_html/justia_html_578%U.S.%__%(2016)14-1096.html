An \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as any of numerous offenses listed in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43), each of which is typically identified either as an offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d a specific federal statute or by a generic label (<i>e.g., </i>\xe2\x80\x9cmurder\xe2\x80\x9d).

When immigration officials discovered his conviction, they initiated removal proceedings.  The Immigration Judge determined that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s arson conviction was for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d and held that Luna was therefore ineligible for discretionary relief.  The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.  It found the federal and New York arson offenses to be identical except for the former\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the crime have a connection to interstate or foreign commerce.  Because the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element serves only a jurisdictional function, the Board held, New York\xe2\x80\x99s arson offense is \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d the federal statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i), for purposes of determining whether an alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony.

State legislatures are not similarly constrained, and so state crimes do not need such a jurisdictional hook.  That discrepancy creates the issue here\xe2\x80\x94whether a state offense lacking a jurisdictional element but otherwise mirroring a particular federal offense can be said to be \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed\xe2\x80\x9d by that offense.  Dictionary definitions of the word \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed\xe2\x80\x9d do not clearly resolve this question one way or the other.  Rather, two contextual considerations decide this case: \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence and a well-established background principle that distinguishes between substantive and jurisdictional elements in criminal statutes.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence shows that Congress meant the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d to capture serious crimes regardless of whether they are made illegal by the Federal Government, a State, or a foreign country.  But Luna\xe2\x80\x99s view would substantially undercut that function by excluding from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage all state and foreign versions of any enumerated federal offense containing an interstate commerce element.  And it would do so in a particularly perverse fashion\xe2\x80\x94excluding state and foreign convictions for many of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s gravest crimes (<i>e.g., </i>most child pornography offenses), while reaching convictions for far less harmful offenses (<i>e.g.,</i> operating an unlawful gambling business).  Luna theorizes that such haphazard coverage might reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99s belief that crimes with an interstate connection are generally more serious than those without.  But it is implausible that Congress viewed the presence of an interstate commerce element as separating serious from non-serious conduct.  Luna\xe2\x80\x99s theory misconceives the function of interstate commerce elements and runs counter to the penultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x99s central message\xe2\x80\x94that the state, federal, or foreign nature of a crime is irrelevant.  And his claim that many serious crimes excluded for want of an interstate commerce element would nonetheless count as \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F) \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s] of violence\xe2\x80\x9d provides little comfort: That alternative would not include nearly all such offenses, nor even the worst ones.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The settled practice of distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements in federal criminal statutes also supports reading \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) to include state analogues that lack only an interstate commerce requirement.  Congress uses substantive and jurisdictional elements for different reasons and does not expect them to receive identical treatment.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Yermian</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 63\n.  And that is true where, as here, the judicial task is to compare federal and state offenses.

Immediately following that list, the Act provides that the referenced offenses are aggravated felonies irrespective of whether they are \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of Federal[,] State[,]\xe2\x80\x9d or foreign law.\n\n108 Stat.\n4322,\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  In this case, we must decide if a state crime counts as an aggravated felony when it corresponds to a specified federal offense in all ways but one\xe2\x80\x94namely, the state crime lacks the interstate commerce element used in the federal statute to establish legislative jurisdiction (<i>i.e., </i>Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to enact the law).  We hold that the absence of such a jurisdictional element is immaterial: A state crime of that kind is an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>The INA makes any alien convicted of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d after entering the United States deportable.  See \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  Such an alien is also ineligible for several forms of discretionary relief, including cancellation of removal\xe2\x80\x94an order allowing a deportable alien to remain in the country.  See \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  And because of his felony, the alien faces expedited removal proceedings.  See \xc2\xa71228(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p>The Act defines the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d by way of a long list of offenses, now codified at \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  In all, that provision\xe2\x80\x99s 21 subparagraphs enumerate some 80 different crimes.  In more than half of those subparagraphs, Congress specified the crimes by citing particular federal statutes.  According to that common formulation, an offense is an aggravated felony if it is \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in,\xe2\x80\x9d say,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72251 (relating to child pornography), \xc2\xa7922(g) (relating to unlawful gun possession), or, of particular relevance here, \xc2\xa7844(i) (relating to arson and explosives).  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(E), (I).  Most of the remaining subparagraphs refer to crimes by their generic labels, stating that an offense is an aggravated felony if, for example, it is \xe2\x80\x9cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A).  Following the entire list of crimes, \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  So, putting aside the 15-year curlicue, the penultimate sentence provides that an offense listed in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) is an aggravated felony whether in violation of federal, state, or foreign law.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Jorge Luna Torres, who goes by the name George Luna, immigrated to the United States as a child and has lived here ever since as a lawful permanent resident.  In 1999, he pleaded guilty to attempted arson in the third degree, in violation of New York law; he was sentenced to one day in prison and five years of probation.  Seven years later, immigration officials discovered his conviction and initiated proceedings to remove him from the country.  During those proceedings, Luna applied for cancellation of removal.  But the Immigration Judge found him ineligible for that discretionary relief because his arson conviction qualified as an aggravated felony.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a\xe2\x80\x9322a.</p>\n<p>The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirmed, based on a comparison of the federal and New York arson statutes.  See <i>id.,</i> at 15a\xe2\x80\x9317a.  The INA, as just noted, provides that \xe2\x80\x9can offense described in\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i), the federal arson and explosives statute, is an aggravated felony.  Section 844(i), in turn, makes it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously damage[\xc2\xa0] or destroy[\xc2\xa0], or attempt[\xc2\xa0] to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive, any building [or] vehicle .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  For its part, the New York law that Luna was convicted under prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally damag[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d or attempting to damage, \xe2\x80\x9ca building or motor vehicle by starting a fire or causing an explosion.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0Y. Penal Law Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7110, 150.10 (West 2010).  The state law, the Board explained, thus matches the federal statute element-for-element with one exception: The New York law does not require a connection to interstate commerce.  According to the Board, that single difference did not matter because the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, its function is to establish Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to legislate.  See App. to Pet for Cert. 16a\xe2\x80\x9317a.  Given that the two laws\xe2\x80\x99 substantive (<i>i.e., </i>non-jurisdictional) elements map onto each other, the Board held, the New York arson offense is \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Luna\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  See 764 F.\xc2\xa03d 152 (2014).  The court\xe2\x80\x99s decision added to a Circuit split over whether a state offense is an aggravated felony when it has all the elements of a listed federal crime except one requiring a connection to interstate commerce.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  We granted certiorari.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p>II</p>\n<p>The issue in this case arises because of the distinctive role interstate commerce elements play in federal criminal law.  In our federal system, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress cannot punish felonies generally,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>, 6 Wheat. 264, 428 (1821); it may enact only those criminal laws that are connected to one of its constitutionally enumerated powers, such as the authority to regulate interstate commerce.  As a result, most federal offenses include, in addition to substantive elements, a jurisdictional one, like the interstate commerce requirement of \xc2\xa7844(i).  The substantive elements \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily define[\xc2\xa0] the behavior that the statute calls a \xe2\x80\x98violation\xe2\x80\x99 of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Scheidler</i> v. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 9,\n18 (2006)\n\xe2\x80\x94or, as the Model Penal Code puts the point, they relate to \xe2\x80\x9cthe harm or evil\xe2\x80\x9d the law seeks to prevent, \xc2\xa71.13(10).  The jurisdictional element, by contrast, ties the substantive offense (here, arson) to one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional powers (here, its authority over interstate commerce), thus spelling out the warrant for Congress to legislate.  See <i>id.,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (explaining that Congress intends \xe2\x80\x9csuch statu-tory terms as \xe2\x80\x98affect commerce\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98in commerce\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as terms of art connecting the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) that grants Congress that authority\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, state criminal laws do not include the jurisdictional elements common in federal statutes.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  State legislatures, exercising their plenary police powers, are not limited to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers; and so States have no reason to tie their substantive offenses to those grants of authority.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Lopez</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 549,\n567 (1995)\n.  In particular, state crimes do not contain interstate commerce elements because a State does not need such a jurisdictional hook.  Accordingly, even state offenses whose substantive elements match up exactly with a federal law\xe2\x80\x99s will part ways with respect to interstate commerce.  That slight discrepancy creates the issue here: If a state offense lacks an interstate commerce element but otherwise mirrors one of the federal statutes listed in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43), does the state crime count as an aggravated felony?  Or, alternatively, does the jurisdictional difference reflected in the state and federal laws preclude that result, no matter the laws\xe2\x80\x99 substantive correspondence?</p>\n<p>Both parties begin with the statutory text most directly at issue, disputing when a state offense (here, arson) is \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d an enumerated federal statute (here,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i)).  Luna, armed principally with Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, argues that \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cset forth\xe2\x80\x9d in\xe2\x80\x94which, he says, requires the state offense to include each one of the federal law\xe2\x80\x99s elements.  Brief for Petitioner 15\xe2\x80\x9316.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  The Government, brandishing dictionaries of its own, contends that the statutory phrase has a looser meaning\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cdescribing entails .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not precise replication,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cconvey[ance of\xc2\xa0] an idea or impression\xe2\x80\x9d or of a thing\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccentral features.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  On that view, \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in,\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to the more precise \xe2\x80\x9cdefined in\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes found in statutes, denotes that the state offense need only incorporate the federal law\xe2\x80\x99s core, substantive elements.</p>\n<p>But neither of those claims about the bare term \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d can resolve this case.  Like many words, \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe\xe2\x80\x9d takes on different meanings in different contexts.  Consider two ways in which this Court has used the word.  In one case, \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe\xe2\x80\x9d conveyed exactness: A contractual provision, we wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cdescribes the subject [matter] with great particularity[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. giv[ing] the precise number of pounds [of tobacco], the tax for which each pound was liable, and the aggregate of the tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ryan</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 19 Wall. 514, 517 (1874).  In another case, not: \xe2\x80\x9cThe disclosure provision is meant,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cto describe the law to consumers in a manner that is concise and comprehensible to the layman\xe2\x80\x94which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CompuCredit Corp.</i> v. <i>Greenwood</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 95,\n102 (2012)\n.  So staring at, or even looking up, the words \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d cannot answer whether a state offense must replicate every last element of a listed federal statute, including its jurisdictional one, to qualify as an aggravated felony.  In considering that issue, we must, as usual, \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret the relevant words not in a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abramski </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 9).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p>\n<p>Here, two contextual considerations decide the matter.  The first is \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence, which shows that Congress meant the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d to capture serious crimes regardless of whether they are prohibited by federal, state, or foreign law.  The second is a well-established background principle distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements in federal criminal statutes.  We address each factor in turn.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>Section 1101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence, as noted above, provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  That sentence (except for the time limit on foreign convictions) declares the source of criminal law irrelevant: The listed offenses count as aggravated felonies regardless of whether they are made illegal by the Federal Government, a State, or a foreign country.  That is true of the crimes identified by reference to federal statutes (as here, an offense described in\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i)), as well as those employing generic labels (for example, murder).  As even Luna recognizes, state and foreign analogues of the enumerated federal crimes qual-ify as aggravated felonies.  See Brief for Petitioner 21 (contesting only what properly counts as such an analogue).  The whole point of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence is to make clear that a listed offense should lead to swift removal, no matter whether it violates federal, state, or foreign law.</p>\n<p>Luna\xe2\x80\x99s jot-for-jot view of \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d would substantially undercut that function by excluding from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage all state and foreign versions of any enumerated federal offense that (like \xc2\xa7844(i)) contains an interstate commerce element.  Such an element appears in about half of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s listed statutes\xe2\x80\x94defining, altogether, 27 serious crimes.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  Yet under Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading, only those federal crimes, and not their state and foreign counterparts, would provide a basis for an alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal\xe2\x80\x94because, as explained earlier, only Congress must ever show a link to interstate commerce.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  No state or foreign legislature needs to incorporate a commerce element to establish its jurisdiction, and so none ever does.  Accordingly, state and foreign crimes will never precisely replicate a federal statute containing a commerce element.  And that means, contrary to \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence, that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d would <i>not </i>apply to many of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s listed offenses irrespective of whether they are \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of Federal[,] State[, or foreign] law\xe2\x80\x9d; instead, that term would apply exclusively to the federal variants.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, Luna\xe2\x80\x99s view would limit the penultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x99s effect in a peculiarly perverse fashion\xe2\x80\x94excluding state and foreign convictions for many of the gravest crimes listed in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43), while reaching those convictions for less harmful offenses.  Consider some of the state and foreign crimes that would not count as aggravated felonies on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading because the corresponding federal law has a commerce element: most child pornography offenses, including selling a child for the purpose of manufacturing such material, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(I); demanding or receiving a ransom for kidnapping, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(H); and possessing a firearm after a felony conviction, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(E)(ii).  Conversely, the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s world would include state and foreign convictions for such comparatively minor offenses as operating an unlawful gambling business, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(J), and possessing a firearm not identified by a serial number, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(E)(iii), because Congress chose, for whatever reason, not to use a commerce element when barring that conduct.  And similarly, the term would cover any state or foreign conviction for such nonviolent activity as receiving stolen property, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(G), or forging documents, see \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(R), because the INA happens to use generic labels to describe those crimes.  This Court has previously refused to construe \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) so as to produce such \xe2\x80\x9chaphazard\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indeed, upside-down\xe2\x80\x94coverage.  <i>Nijhawan</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29,\n40 (2009)\n.  We see no reason to follow a different path here: Congress would not have placed an alien convicted by a State of running an illegal casino at greater risk of removal than one found guilty under the same State\xe2\x80\x99s law of selling a child.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]</p>\n<p>In an attempt to make some sense of his reading, Luna posits that Congress might have believed that crimes having an interstate connection are generally more serious than those lacking one\xe2\x80\x94for example, that interstate child pornography is \xe2\x80\x9cworse\xe2\x80\x9d than the intrastate variety.  Brief for Petitioner 35.  But to begin with, that theory cannot explain the set of crazy-quilt results just described: Not even Luna maintains that Congress thought local acts of selling a child, receiving explosives, or demanding a ransom are categorically less serious than, say, operating an unlawful casino or receiving stolen property (whether or not in interstate commerce).  And it is scarcely more plausible to view an interstate commerce element in any given offense as separating serious from non-serious conduct: Why, for example, would Congress see an alien who carried out a kidnapping for ransom wholly within a State as materially less dangerous than one who crossed state lines in committing that crime?  The essential harm of the crime is the same irrespective of state borders.  Luna\xe2\x80\x99s argument thus misconceives the function of interstate commerce elements: Rather than distinguishing greater from lesser evils, they serve (as earlier explained) to connect a given substantive offense to one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  And still more fundamentally, Luna\xe2\x80\x99s account runs counter to the penultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x99s central message: that the national, local, or foreign character of a crime has no bearing on whether it is grave enough to warrant an alien\xe2\x80\x99s automatic removal.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Luna (and the dissent, see <i>post, </i>at 6) must therefore fall back on a different defense: that his approach would exclude from the universe of aggravated felonies fewer serious state and foreign offenses than one might think.  To make that argument, Luna relies primarily on a part of the Act specifying that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d shall include \xe2\x80\x9ca crime of violence (as defined in [\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716]) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F); see\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716 (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as involving the use of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d against the person or property of another).  According to Luna, many state and foreign offenses failing to match the Act\xe2\x80\x99s listed federal statutes (for want of an interstate commerce element) would count as crimes of violence and, by that alternative route, trigger automatic removal.  A different statutory phrase, or so Luna says, would thus plug the holes opened by his construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d provisions.</p>\n<p>Luna\xe2\x80\x99s argument does not reassure us.  We agree that state counterparts of some enumerated federal offenses would qualify as aggravated felonies through the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  But not nearly all such offenses, and not even the worst ones.  Consider again some of the listed offenses described earlier.  See <i>supra,</i> at 10.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d provision would not pick up demanding a ransom for kidnapping.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7875(a) (defining the crime without any reference to physical force).  It would not cover most of the listed child pornography offenses, involving the distribution, receipt, and possession of such materials.  It would not reach felon-in-possession laws and other firearms offenses.  And indeed, it would not reach arson in the many States defining that crime to include the destruction of one\xe2\x80\x99s own property.  See <i>Jordison </i>v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 1134, 1135 (CA9 2007) (holding that a violation of California\xe2\x80\x99s arson statute does not count as a crime of violence for that reason);<i> </i>Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (Solicitor General agreeing with that interpretation).[<a href="#F10">10</a>]  So under Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading, state and foreign counterparts to a broad swath of listed statutes would remain outside \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage merely because they lack an explicit interstate commerce connection.  And for all the reasons discussed above, that result would significantly restrict the penultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x99s force and effect, and in an utterly random manner.[<a href="#F11">11</a>]</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>Just as important, a settled practice of distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements of federal criminal laws supports reading \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) to include state analogues lacking an interstate commerce requirement.  As already explained, the substantive elements of a federal statute describe the evil Congress seeks to prevent; the jurisdictional element connects the law to one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers, thus establishing legislative authority.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935; ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa71.13(10) (1962).  Both kinds of elements must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and because that is so, both may play a real role in a criminal case.  But still, they are not created equal for every purpose.  To the contrary, courts have often recognized\xe2\x80\x94including when comparing federal and state offenses\xe2\x80\x94that Congress uses substantive and jurisdictional elements for different reasons and does not expect them to receive identical treatment.</p>\n<p>Consider the law respecting <i>mens rea</i>.  In general, courts interpret criminal statutes to require that a defendant possess a <i>mens rea</i>, or guilty mind, as to every element of an offense.  See <i>Elonis</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).  That is so even when the \xe2\x80\x9cstatute by its terms does not contain\xe2\x80\x9d any demand of that kind.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>X-Citement Video, Inc.</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 64,\n70 (1994)\n.  In such cases, courts read the statute against a \xe2\x80\x9cbackground rule\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant must know each fact making his conduct illegal.  <i>Staples</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600,\n619 (1994)\n.  Or otherwise said, they infer, absent an express indication to the contrary, that Congress intended such a mental-state requirement.</p>\n<p>Except when it comes to jurisdictional elements.  There, this Court has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the federal statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Feola</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 671,\n677, n.\n9 (1975)\n; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yermian</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 63,\n68 (1984)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cJurisdictional language need not contain the same culpability requirement as other elements of the offense\xe2\x80\x9d); Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02.  So when Congress has said nothing about the mental state pertaining to a jurisdictional element, the default rule flips: Courts assume that Congress wanted such an element to stand outside the otherwise applicable <i>mens rea</i> requirement.  In line with that practice, courts have routinely held that a criminal defendant need not know of a federal crime\xe2\x80\x99s interstate commerce connection to be found guilty.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jinian</i>, 725 F.\xc2\xa03d 954, 964\xe2\x80\x93966 (CA9 2013); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lindemann</i>, 85 F.\xc2\xa03d 1232, 1241 (CA7 1996); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Blackmon</i>, 839 F.\xc2\xa02d 900, 907 (CA2 1988).  Those courts have recognized, as we do here, that Congress viewed the commerce element as distinct from, and subject to a different rule than, the elements describing the substantive offense.</p>\n<p>Still more strikingly, courts have distinguished between the two kinds of elements in contexts, similar to this one, in which the judicial task is to compare federal and state offenses.  The Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA),\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713(a), subjects federal enclaves, like military bases, to state criminal laws except when they punish the same conduct as a federal statute.  The ACA thus requires courts to decide when a federal and a state law are sufficiently alike that only the federal one will apply.  And we have held that, in making that assessment, courts should ignore jurisdictional elements: When the \xe2\x80\x9cdifferences among elements\xe2\x80\x9d of the state and federal crimes \xe2\x80\x9creflect jurisdictional, or other technical, considerations\xe2\x80\x9d alone, then the state law will have no effect in the area.  <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155,\n165 (1998)\n; see also <i>id.</i>, at 182 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (agreeing that courts should \xe2\x80\x9clook beyond .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. jurisdictional elements,\xe2\x80\x9d and focus only on substantive ones, in determining whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe elements of the two crimes are the same\xe2\x80\x9d).  In such a case, we reasoned\xe2\x80\x94just as we do now\xe2\x80\x94that Congress meant for the federal jurisdictional element to be set aside.</p>\n<p>And lower courts have uniformly adopted the same approach when comparing federal and state crimes in order to apply the federal three-strikes statute.  That law imposes mandatory life imprisonment on a person convicted on three separate occasions of a \xe2\x80\x9cserious violent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(c)(1).  Sounding very much like the INA, the three-strikes statute defines such a felony to include \xe2\x80\x9ca Federal or State offense, by whatever designation and wherever committed, consisting of\xe2\x80\x9d specified crimes (<i>e.g., </i>murder, manslaughter, robbery) \xe2\x80\x9cas described in\xe2\x80\x9d listed federal criminal statutes.  \xc2\xa73559(c)(2)(F).  In deciding whether a state crime of conviction thus corresponds to an enumerated federal statute, every court to have faced the issue has ignored the statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional element.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Rosario-Delgado</i>, 198 F.\xc2\xa03d 1354, 1357 (CA11 1999) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wicks</i>, 132 F.\xc2\xa03d 383, 386\xe2\x80\x93387 (CA7 1997).  Judge Wood, writing for the Seventh Circuit, highlighted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ca Federal or State offense, by whatever designation and wherever committed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the three-strikes law\xe2\x80\x99s version of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard to see why Congress would have used this language,\xe2\x80\x9d she reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cif it had meant that every detail of the federal offense, including its jurisdictional element[\xc2\xa0], had to be replicated in the state offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 386\xe2\x80\x93387.  Just so, too, in the INA\xe2\x80\x94whose \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d provisions operate against, and rely on, an established legal backdrop distinguishing between jurisdictional and substantive elements.[<a href="#F12">12</a>]</p>\n<p>Luna objects to drawing that line on the ground that it is too hard to tell the difference between the two.  See Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9328 (discussing, in particular, statutes criminalizing the destruction of federal property and sending threats via the Postal Service).  But that contention collides with the judicial experience just described.  Courts regularly separate substantive from jurisdictional elements in applying federal criminal statutes\xe2\x80\x99 <i>mens rea</i> requirements; so too in implementing other laws that require a comparison of federal and state offenses.  And from all we can see, courts perform that task with no real trouble: Luna has not pointed to any divisions between or within Circuits arising from the practice.  We do not deny that some tough questions may lurk on the margins\xe2\x80\x94where an element that makes evident Congress\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory power also might play a role in defining the behavior Congress thought harmful.  But a standard interstate commerce element, of the kind appearing in a great many federal laws, is almost always a simple jurisdictional hook\xe2\x80\x94and courts may as easily acknowledge that fact in enforcing the INA as they have done in other contexts.</p>\n<p>C</p>\n<p>Luna makes a final argument opposing our reading of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43): If Congress had meant for \xe2\x80\x9cordinary state-law\xe2\x80\x9d crimes like arson to count as aggravated felonies, it would have drafted the provision to make that self-evident.  Brief for Petitioner 20.  Congress, Luna submits, would have used the generic term for those crimes\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.</i>, \xe2\x80\x9carson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rather than demanding that the state law of conviction correspond to a listed federal statute.  See <i>id.,</i> at 20\xe2\x80\x9323.  Or else, Luna (and the dissent) suggests, see <i>id.,</i> at 24; <i>post, </i>at 13, Congress would have expressly distinguished between substantive and jurisdictional elements, as it did in an unrelated law mandating the pretrial detention of any person convicted of a federal offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in [a certain federal statute], or of a State or local offense that would have been an offense described in [that statute] if a circumstance giving rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73142(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>But as an initial matter, Congress may have had good reason to think that a statutory reference would capture more accurately than a generic label the range of state convictions warranting automatic deportation.  The clause of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) applying to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s case well illustrates the point.  By referring to\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i), that provision incorporates not only the garden-variety arson offenses that a generic \xe2\x80\x9carson\xe2\x80\x9d label would cover, but various explosives offenses too.  See Brief for Petitioner 23, n.\xc2\xa07 (conceding that had Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9carson,\xe2\x80\x9d it would have had to separately identify the explosives crimes encompassed in \xc2\xa7844(i)).  And the elements of generic arson are themselves so uncertain as to pose problems for a court having to decide whether they are present in a given state law.  See Poulos, The Metamorphosis of the Law of Arson, 51 Mo. L. Rev. 295, 364, 387\xe2\x80\x93435 (1986) (describing multiple conflicts over what conduct the term \xe2\x80\x9carson\xe2\x80\x9d includes).  Nor is the clause at issue here unusual in those respects: Section 1101(a)(43) includes many other statutory references that do not convert easily to generic labels.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(E)(ii) (listing federal statutes defining various firearms offenses).  To be sure, Congress used such labels to describe some crimes qualifying as aggravated felonies\xe2\x80\x94for example, \xe2\x80\x9cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A).  But what is good for some crimes is not for others.  The use of a federal statutory reference shows only that Congress thought it the best way to identify certain substantive crimes\xe2\x80\x94not that Congress wanted (in conflict with the penultimate sentence) to exclude state and foreign versions of those offenses for lack of a jurisdictional element.</p>\n<p>Still more, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s omission of statutory language specifically directing courts to ignore those elements cannot tip the scales in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  We have little doubt that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could have drafted [\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)] with more precision than it did.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Wilson</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409,\n422 (2005)\n.  But the same could be said of many (even most) statutes; as to that feature, \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) can join a well-populated club.  And we have long been mindful of that fact when interpreting laws.  Rather than expecting (let alone demanding) perfection in drafting, we have routinely construed statutes to have a particular meaning even as we acknowledged that Congress could have expressed itself more clearly.  See, <i>e.g., ibid.</i>;<i> Florida Dept. of Revenue</i> v. <i>Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33,\n41 (2008)\n; <i>Scarborough</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563\n\xe2\x80\x93571, 575 (1977).  The question, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated (or even did Congress elsewhere indicate) in more crystalline fashion that comparisons of federal and state offenses should disregard elements that merely establish legislative jurisdiction?  The question is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and fair reading of the statute before us?  And the answer to that question, given the import of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate sentence and the well-settled background rule distinguishing between jurisdictional and substantive elements, is yes.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>That reading of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) resolves this case.  Luna has acknowledged that the New York arson law differs from the listed federal statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i), in only one respect: It lacks an interstate commerce element.  See Pet. for Cert. 3.  And Luna nowhere contests that \xc2\xa7844(i)\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element\xe2\x80\x94featuring the terms \xe2\x80\x9cin interstate or foreign commerce\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caffecting interstate or foreign commerce\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is of the standard, jurisdictional kind.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 19; <i>Scheidler</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (referring to the phrases \xe2\x80\x9caffect commerce\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin commerce\xe2\x80\x9d as conventional \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional language\xe2\x80\x9d).  For all the reasons we have given, such an element is properly ignored when determining if a state offense counts as an aggravated felony under \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Compare <i>Espinal-Andrades</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 777 F.\xc2\xa03d 163 (CA4 2015) (finding an aggravated felony in that circumstance);<i> Spacek </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 688 F.\xc2\xa03d 536 (CA8 2012) (same); <i>Nieto Hernandez </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 592 F.\xc2\xa03d 681 (CA5 2009) (same); <i>Negrete-Rodriguez</i> v. <i>Mukasey</i>, 518 F.\xc2\xa03d 497 (CA7 2008) (same); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Castillo-Rivera</i>, 244 F.\xc2\xa03d 1020 (CA9 2001) (same), with <i>Bautista </i>v. <i>Attorney General</i>, 744 F.\xc2\xa03d 54 (CA3 2014) (declining to find an aggravated felony).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0That flat statement is infinitesimally shy of being wholly true.

Until its most recent amendment, \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(J\xc2\xa0) provided that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d included any \xe2\x80\x9coffense described in [\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71962] (relating to racketeer influenced corrupt organizations) for which a sentence of 5 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment or more may be imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(J\xc2\xa0) (1994 ed., Supp. I).  (That provision now incorporates two more federal crimes, and uses one year of prison as the threshold.)  The federal racketeering statute cited has an interstate commerce element; analogous state and foreign laws (per usual) do not, and therefore would fall outside \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(J\xc2\xa0) on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  But if Congress had meant to so exclude those state and foreign counterparts, then \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(J\xc2\xa0)\xe2\x80\x99s final clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor which a sentence of 5 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment may be imposed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would have been superfluous, because federal racketeering is <i>always</i> punishable by more than five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, see\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71963(a).

Claims the dissent: Even if Congress could not have viewed \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate crimes [as] worse than wholly intrastate crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d it might have thought that, say, \xe2\x80\x9carsons <i>prosecuted</i> as federal crimes are more uniformly serious than arsons <i>prosecuted</i> as state crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 14 (emphasis added).  But we see no call to suppose that Congress regarded state prosecutions as Grapefruit League versions of the Big Show.  Cf. <i>Mistretta</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361,\n427 (1989)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In our federal system, \xe2\x80\x9cStates possess primary authority for defining and enforcing\xe2\x80\x9d criminal laws, including those prohibiting the gravest crimes.  <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619,\n635 (1993)\n.  For that reason, even when U.\xc2\xa0S. Attorneys have jurisdiction, they are generally to defer to, rather than supplant, state prosecutions of serious offenses.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 Manual: Principles of Federal Prosecution \xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9327.240 (1997).  And still more obviously, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s theory fails with respect to foreign convictions.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 46 (Solicitor General noting that the categorical approach to comparing federal and state crimes produces that effect).  And contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <i>post, </i>at 6, n.\xc2\xa02, that would be true of the most dangerous arsons, as well as of less serious ones.  The dissent similarly fails to take into account the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous requirements when discussing a couple of the non-arson offenses discussed above.  (Still others, the dissent wholly ignores.)  It speculates that if the exact right state charge is filed, some of that conduct \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d qualify, through the crime-of-violence provision or some other route, as an aggravated felony.  <i>Ibid.  </i>\xe2\x80\x9cMay\xe2\x80\x9d is very much the operative word there, because\xe2\x80\x94depending on the elements of the state offense chosen\xe2\x80\x94that conduct also \xe2\x80\x9cmay not.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the dissent never explains why Congress would have left the deportation of dangerous felons to such prosecutorial happenstance.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T11">11</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The dissent well-nigh embraces those consequences, arguing that a narrow reading of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d would make more convicted criminals removable under <i>other</i> statutory provisions, all of which allow for relief at the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.

But what makes them relevantly so the dissent fails to explain.  First, the dissent errs in suggesting that the uniform judicial interpretation of the three-strikes law ignores only \xe2\x80\x9cplace-based jurisdiction elements\xe2\x80\x9d (because, so says the dissent, of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwherever committed\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Post, </i>at 13.  As Judge Wood\xe2\x80\x99s analysis indicates, that is a theory of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s own creation; the actual appellate decisions apply to <i>all </i>jurisdictional elements, not just territorial ones.  Next, the dissent goes wrong in claiming that the ACA is not pertinent because this Court adopted a different method for matching <i>substantive </i>elements under that law than under the INA.  See <i>post, </i>at 12.  For even as the Court made that choice, it unanimously agreed that, however substantive elements should be compared, jurisdictional elements should be disregarded.  See <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155,\n165 (1998)\n; <i>id.</i>, at 182 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  And finally, the dissent does nothing to undermine our point on <i>mens rea</i> by noting that Congress very occasionally dispenses with that requirement for substantive elements.  See <i>post, </i>at 11.  As just shown, the <i>default rule</i> respecting mental states flips as between jurisdictional and substantive elements, see <i>supra</i>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316\xe2\x80\x94reflecting the view (also at play in the three-strikes and ACA contexts) that Congress generally means to treat the two differently.  That leaves the dissent with nothing except its observation that when applying the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt and jury-trial requirements, the Court does not distinguish between jurisdictional and substantive elements.  See <i>post,</i> at 10.  But the dissent forgets that those commands are constitutional in nature; a principle of statutory interpretation distinguishing between the two kinds of elements, as best reflecting Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent, could not bear on those mandates.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3574263">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x931096</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">JORGE LUNA TORRES, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> LORETTA E.

Until today, the Court has always required the state offense to match <i>every</i> element of the listed \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kawashima</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4); see also <i>Moncrieffe</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935); <i>Carachuri-Rosendo</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563,\n580 (2010)\n; <i>Nijhawan</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29,\n33 (2009)\n; <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Duenas-Alvarez</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 183,\n185 (2007)\n; <i>Lopez</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47\n\xe2\x80\x9353 (2006); <i>Leocal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n8 (2004)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our ordinary methodology thus confirms that the federal arson statute does not describe the New York arson statute under which Luna was convicted.  As I have outlined above, see <i>supra</i>, at 1, the federal statute is more limited: It applies only to fires that involve \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate or foreign commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  The state statute contains no such limitation.  Thus, under the approach we have used in every case to date, the omission of the interstate commerce element means that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s state arson conviction was not an aggravated felony under the INA.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The plain language of the statute supports this straightforward approach.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe\xe2\x80\x9d means to \xe2\x80\x9cexpress,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cportray,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crepresent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 445 (6th ed. 1990); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986).  A description may be \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed\xe2\x80\x9d or it may be general, setting forth only the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizable features, or characteristic marks,\xe2\x80\x9d of the thing described while leaving the rest to the imagination.  4 Oxford English Dictionary 512 (2d ed. 1989).  For example, a Craigslist ad describing an apartment with \xe2\x80\x9cin-unit laundry, a dishwasher, rooftop access, central A/C, and a walk-in closet\xe2\x80\x9d may leave much to the imagination.  After all, the description does not mention the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s square footage, windows, or floor number.  But though the ad omits features, we would still call it a \xe2\x80\x9cdescription\xe2\x80\x9d because it accurately conveys the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizable features\xe2\x80\x9d of the apartment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">However, even the most general description cannot refer to features that the thing being described does not have.  The ad is only an accurate description if the apartment \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d it has <i>at least</i> the five features listed.  If the apartment only has four of the five listed features\xe2\x80\x94there is no rooftop access, say, or the walk-in closet is not so much walk-in as shimmy-in\xe2\x80\x94then the Craigslist ad no longer \xe2\x80\x9cdescribes\xe2\x80\x9d the apartment.  Rather, it <i>mis</i>describes it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So, too, with the statutes in this case.  The federal description can be general as long as it is still accurate\xe2\x80\x94that is, as long as the state law has at least all of the elements in the federal law.  But there is no meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe\xe2\x80\x9d that allows the Court to say \xc2\xa7844(i) \xe2\x80\x9cdescribes\xe2\x80\x9d the New York offense when the New York offense only has four of the five elements listed in \xc2\xa7844(i).  Section 844(i) misdescribes the New York offense just as surely as the too-good-to-be-true Craigslist ad misdescribes the real-life apartment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The structure of the INA confirms that conclusion and makes clear that we need not contort the ordinary, accepted meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in.\xe2\x80\x9d  The INA has many overlapping provisions that assign carefully calibrated consequences to various types of criminal convictions.  The Court thus need not interpret any provision\xe2\x80\x94and certainly none of the aggravated felony provisions, among the harshest in the INA\xe2\x80\x94as broadly as possible because the INA as a whole ensures that serious criminal conduct is adequately captured.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That overlapping structure is apparent throughout the INA.  First, the aggravated felony list itself has multiple fail-safe provisions.  Most serious offenses, for instance, will qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s] of violence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F), even if they are not covered by a more specific provision in the aggravated felony list.  Had his crime been charged as a more serious arson and had he been punished by one year of imprisonment instead of one day, Luna might have qualified as an aggravated felon under that provision.  See <i>Santana </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 714 F.\xc2\xa03d 140, 145 (CA2 2013) (second-degree arson in New York is a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, other sections of the INA provide intertwining coverage for serious crimes.  Some examples of provisions that encompass many offenses include those for the commission of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude,\xe2\x80\x9d a firearms offense, or a controlled substance offense, all of which will render a noncitizen removable, even if he or she has not committed an aggravated felony.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i), (C); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).  Cf. <i>Judulang</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 42,\n48 (2011)\n (commenting on the breadth of the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d provision).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And finally, in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s case or anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s, the Attorney General can exercise her discretion to deny relief to a serious criminal whether or not that criminal has been convicted of an aggravated felony.  See<i> Carachuri-Rosendo,</i> 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 581 (doubting that a narrow reading of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) will have \xe2\x80\x9cany practical effect on policing our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading, some serious conduct may not be captured by the INA.  But not nearly so much as the majority suggests.  By contrast, once the aggra-vated felony statute applies to a noncitizen, no provision in the INA\xe2\x80\x94and virtually no act by the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x94can prevent him or her from being removed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Looking for consistency in the aggravated felony provisions of the INA is often a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand.  See <i>Kawashima</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (slip op., at 9, n.\xc2\xa02) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting the absurdity of making a tax misdemeanor, but not driving while drunk and causing serious bodily injury, an aggravated felony).  But the structure of the INA gives the Court no reason to read the aggravated felony provisions as broadly as possible.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  That is why this Court has repeatedly cautioned against interpreting the aggravated felony section to sweep in offenses that\xe2\x80\x94like many state arson convictions\xe2\x80\x94may be neither aggravated nor felonies.  See <i>Carachuri-Rosendo</i>, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 574; Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (collecting state misdemeanor arson statutes).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority denies Luna the opportunity to present his case to the Attorney General based on two \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual considerations,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 7, and an intuition about how the statute ought to work.  None are sufficiently persuasive to overcome the most natural reading of the aggravated felony statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority first perceives a conflict between Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the INA and what it calls the \xe2\x80\x9cpenultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d of the aggravated felony statute.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpenultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d provides that an offense can be an aggravated felony \xe2\x80\x9cwhether in violation of Federal or State law\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of the law of a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  The majority claims that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the INA would vitiate the quoted proviso.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is true that, on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading, <i>some</i> of the aggra-vated felonies listed in the INA (including \xe2\x80\x9can offense de-scribed in\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7844(i)) will have no state or foreign analog.  But the proviso still applies to generic offenses, which constitute nearly half of the entries in the aggravated felony list.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A), (G), (M)(i).  And that already-large portion jumps to close to three-quarters of the offenses after counting those many listed federal statutes with no jurisdictional element.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(C), (E)(ii), (J).  In fact, it applies to the vast majority of offenses adjudicated under the INA given that most serious crimes are also \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And the majority must admit that its interpretation will also leave entries in the aggravated-felony section with no state or foreign analogs.  For instance, it seems unlikely that the proviso contemplates state analogs for the aggravated felony provisions regarding treason, levying war against the United States, or disclosing national defense information.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(L)(i), (P).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In other words, under Luna\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the \xe2\x80\x9cpenultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d applies to most, but not all, of the entries of the aggravated felony statute; under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the \xe2\x80\x9cpenultimate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d also applies to most, but not all, of the entries of the aggravated felony statute.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s first \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual consideration\xe2\x80\x9d thus supplies no reason to prefer one reading over the other.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Just as important, the majority suggests, is a \xe2\x80\x9csettled practice of distinguishing between substantive .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. elements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94those that define \xe2\x80\x9cthe evil Congress seeks to prevent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional element[s],\xe2\x80\x9d which merely \xe2\x80\x9cestablis[h] legislative authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  The majority admits that the Court does <i>not</i> distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional elements for many purposes, such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the rightto a jury trial.  <i>Ibid</i>.; see <i>Ring</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584,\n606 (2002)\n.  But it nonetheless insists on a standard distinction so entrenched that Congress must have intended it to apply even absent any particular indication in the INA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">None of the three examples that the majority proffers is evidence of such a strong norm.  First, the majority invokes our rules for interpreting criminal statutes.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Whereas our general assumption is that a de-fendant must know each fact making his conduct illegal, courts generally hold that a criminal defendant need not know the facts that satisfy the jurisdictional element of a statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But jurisdictional elements are not the only elements a defendant need not know.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9cdefault rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 18, n.\xc2\xa012, for interpreting so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpublic welfare\xe2\x80\x9d offenses, courts have held that a defendant need not know that the substance he possesses is a narcotic, that the device he possesses is unregistered, or that he reentered the United States after previously being deported.  See <i>Staples</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600\n\xe2\x80\x93609, 611 (1994) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint</i>,\n\n258 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250 (1922)\n, and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Freed</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 601 (1971)\n); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Burwell</i>, 690 F.\xc2\xa03d 500, 508\xe2\x80\x93509 (CADC 2012); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Giambro</i>, 544 F.\xc2\xa03d 26, 29 (CA1 2008); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Martinez-Morel</i>, 118 F.\xc2\xa03d 710, 715\xe2\x80\x93717 (CA10 1997).  But surely the majority would not suggest that if we agree with those holdings regarding <i>mens rea</i>, we must then ignore the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance\xe2\x80\x9d element of the drug trafficking aggravated felony, the \xe2\x80\x9cunregistered\xe2\x80\x9d element of the unregistered firearms aggravated felony, or the \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing deportation\xe2\x80\x9d element of the illegal reentry aggravated felony.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B), (E)(iii), (M)(i), (O).  So there is likewise no reason to believe that the \xe2\x80\x9cdefault rule\xe2\x80\x9d for assigning <i>mens rea</i> to jurisdictional elements is embedded in the INA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority next points to two of the many statutes that, like the INA, require comparing the elements of federal and state offenses.  But in each case, it is the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and context, not some \xe2\x80\x9csettled practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 15, that command the omission of the jurisdic-tional element.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s first example, <i>ante, </i>at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, is the Assimilative Crimes Act,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713(a), a gap-filling statute that incorporates state criminal law into federal enclaves if the \xe2\x80\x9cact or omission\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9cmade punishable by any enactment of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cwould be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court held that, in identifying such a gap, courts should ignore \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional, or other technical,\xe2\x80\x9d differences between a state and federal statute.  <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155,\n165 (1998)\n.  But the way courts match the elements of a state law to a federal analog under the Assimilative Crimes Act differs fundamentally from our INA inquiry.  The basic question under the Assimilative Crimes Act is whether \xe2\x80\x9cfederal statutes reveal an intent to occupy so much of the field as would exclude the use of the particular state statute at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 164.  Under the Assimilative Crimes Act, the state statute is not compared to a single federal statute, but rather to a complex of federal statutes that roughly cover the same general conduct and \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That statute thus has little to teach us about\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43): In interpreting the Assimilative Crimes Act, every Member of the Court rejected the simple elements-matching approach that the Court generally employs to construe the aggravated felony provisions of the INA.  See 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 182 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (allowing \xe2\x80\x9cslight differences\xe2\x80\x9d in definition between federal and state statute and using \xe2\x80\x9csame-elements inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d only as a \xe2\x80\x9cstarting point\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s analogy to the federal three strikes statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(c)(2)(F), <i>ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, is similarly unhelpful.  That provision counts as a predicate \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98serious violent felony\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Federal or State offense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.<i> wherever committed</i>, consisting of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d various crimes, including several \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as described in\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d federal statutes.  <i>Ante, </i>at 17. (emphasis added).  Though this Court has not construed the statute, the majority notes that courts of appeals disregard the jurisdictional element of federal statutes in assessing whether a state conviction is for a \xe2\x80\x9cserious violent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But nearly all of the statutes listed in \xc2\xa73559(c)(2)(F) contain place-based jurisdiction elements\xe2\x80\x94the crime must take place \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa71111(b), or within \xe2\x80\x9cthe special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa746502, and so on.  In the two cases cited by the majority, for instance, <i>ante,</i> at 17, Courts of Appeals concluded that a state robbery offense qualified as an offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in\xe2\x80\x9d the federal bank robbery statute even though the robbery did not take place in a bank.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Wicks</i>,<i> </i>132 F.\xc2\xa03d 383, 387 (CA7 1997); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Rosario-Delgado</i>, 198 F.\xc2\xa03d 1354, 1357 (CA11 1999).  In that statute, it is the \xe2\x80\x9cwherever committed,\xe2\x80\x9d not some loose construction of \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in,\xe2\x80\x9d that specifically instructs the courts that the location where a crime occurs does not matter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, in other statutes where Congress wants to exclude jurisdictional elements when comparing state and federal offenses, it ordinarily just says so.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73142(e)(2)(A) (requiring detention of defendant pending trial if \xe2\x80\x9cthe person has been convicted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of a State or local offense that would have been an offense described in subsection (f\xc2\xa0)(1) of this section if a circumstance giving rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72265A(b)(1)(B); \xc2\xa72426(b)(1)(B); \xc2\xa73142(f)(1)(D); \xc2\xa75032; 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7671(a)(15)(D)(ii)(I)\xe2\x80\x93(II); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75106a(b)(2)(B)(xvi)(I)\xe2\x80\x93(II).  Absent comparably clear language, the Court should not presume that the INA intended deportability to depend on a not-so-\xe2\x80\x9csettled practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 15, of occasionally distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the majority suggests that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiarly perverse,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 10, to adopt Luna\xe2\x80\x99s plain-text readingof the statute because it would draw a distinction among crimes based on a jurisdictional element that the majority assumes is wholly divorced from \xe2\x80\x9cthe evil Congress seeks to prevent,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 15.  The jurisdictional element of a federal statute, the majority asserts, is as trivial as the perfunctory warning on a new electronic device: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] person would say that she had followed the instructions for setting up an iPhone that are \xe2\x80\x98described in\xe2\x80\x99 the user\xe2\x80\x99s manual, even if she in fact ignored the one\xe2\x80\x9d instructing that she \xe2\x80\x9cbegin by \xe2\x80\x98read[ing] important safety information.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 7, n.\xc2\xa05; see also <i>ibid.</i> (comparing jurisdictional element to a \xe2\x80\x9cdetour\xe2\x80\x9d in a 3-week itinerary).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For instance, the majority assumes that it would not be \xe2\x80\x9cplausible,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 12, for Congress to have thought that interstate crimes are worse than wholly intrastate crimes.  Perhaps.  But when faced with an offense that, like arson, admits of a range of conduct, from the minor to the serious, Congress <i>could</i> plausibly have concluded that arsons prosecuted as federal crimes are more uniformly serious than arsons prosecuted as state crimes and counted only the former as aggravated felonies.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Klein et al., Why Federal Prosecutors Charge: A Comparison of Fed-eral and New York State Arson and Robbery Filings, 2006\xe2\x80\x932010, 51 Houston L. Rev. 1381, 1406, 1416\xe2\x80\x931419 (2014) (finding that arsons prosecuted federally involve more property damage and more injury than arsons prosecuted under state law).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is because, far from being token, \xe2\x80\x9cconventional jurisdictional elements\xe2\x80\x9d serve to narrow the kinds of crimes that can be prosecuted, not just to specify the sovereign that can do the prosecuting.  Take the federal statute at issue in this case.  Section 844(i) requires that the property destroyed be \xe2\x80\x9cused in interstate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9cstandard, jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d element, <i>ante,</i> at 21, demands the property\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cactive employment for commercial purposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connection to commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,\n855 (2000)\n.  As a result, the Court held that a defendant who threw a Molotov cocktail through the window of an owner-occupied residential house could not be guilty under \xc2\xa7844(i) because the house was not \xe2\x80\x9cactive[ly] used\xe2\x80\x9d in interstate commerce.  <i>Id</i>., at 851.  Surely, however, a New York prosecutor could have secured a conviction under N. Y.

Penal Law Ann. \xc2\xa7150.10 and an offense under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(i) is thus more than a technical consideration about which authority chooses to prosecute.

Against our standard method for comparing statutes and the text and structure of the INA, the majority stacks a supposed superfluity, a not-so-well-settled practice, and its conviction that jurisdictional elements are mere technicalities.  But an element is an element, andI would not so lightly strip a federal statute of one.
