Your petitioner then applied to this Honorable Court for a writ of error, which was awarded, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia was reversed at the last term of this Court, and this Court\'s mandate was sent to said Supreme Court of Appeals, directing it to reverse the judgment of said hustings court.  Your petitioner placed the mandate of this Court in the hands of Hon. L. L.

Nevertheless, up to this day, said Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of Virginia has taken no action in the matter, and the judgment and sentence of said Hustings Court of the City of Richmond against your petitioner remain in full force and unreversed.  Your petitioner prays therefore that this Honorable Court will take such action in the premises as will cause said judgment to be reversed.
