Argued April 28, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 28, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Padilla, a United States citizen, was brought to New York for detention in federal criminal custody after federal agents apprehended him while executing a material witness warrant issued by the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District) in connection with its grand jury investigation into the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks.  While his motion to vacate the warrant was pending, the President issued an order to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld designating Padilla an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy combatant\xe2\x80\x9d and directing that he be detained in military custody.  Padilla was later moved to a Navy brig in Charleston, S.\xc2\xa0C., where he has been held ever since.  His counsel then filed in the Southern District a habeas petition under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241, which, as amended, alleged that Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s military detention violates the Constitution, and named as respondents the President, the Secretary, and Melanie Marr, the brig\xe2\x80\x99s commander.  The Government moved to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Commander Marr, as Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s immediate custodian, was the only proper respondent, and that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over her because she is located outside the Southern District.  That court held that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s personal involvement in Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s military custody rendered him a proper respondent, and that it could assert jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York\xe2\x80\x99s long-arm statute, notwithstanding his absence from the District.  On the merits, the court accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the President has authority as Commander in Chief to detain as enemy combatants citizens captured on American soil during a time of war.  The Second Circuit agreed that the Secretary was a proper respondent and that the Southern District had jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York\xe2\x80\x99s long-arm statute.  The appeals court reversed on the merits, however, holding that the President lacks authority to detain Padilla militarily.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Because this Court answers the jurisdictional question in the negative, it does not reach the question whether the President has authority to detain Padilla militarily.

The federal habeas statute straightforwardly provides that the proper respondent is \xe2\x80\x9cthe person\xe2\x80\x9d having custody over the petitioner.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72242, \xc2\xa72243.  Its consistent use of the definite article indicates that there is generally only one proper respondent, and the custodian is \xe2\x80\x9cthe person\xe2\x80\x9d with the ability to produce the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s body before the habeas court, see Wales</em> v. <em>Whitney,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/114/564/index.html">114 U. S. 564</a>, 574.  In accord with the statutory language and <em>Wales</em>\xe2\x80\x99 immediate custodian rule, longstanding federal-court practice confirms that, in \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d habeas challenges to present physical confinement, the default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official.  No exceptions to this rule, either recognized or proposed, apply here.  Padilla does not deny the immediate custodian rule\xe2\x80\x99s general applicability, but argues that the rule is flexible and should not apply on the unique facts of this case.  The Court disagrees.  That the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of custody has broadened over the years to include restraints short of physical confinement does nothing to undermine the rationale or statutory foundation of the <em>Wales</em> rule where, in core proceedings such as the present, physical custody <em>is</em> at issue.  Indeed, that rule has consistently been applied in this core context.  The Second Circuit erred in taking the view that this Court has relaxed the immediate custodian rule with respect to prisoners detained for other than federal criminal violations, and in holding that the proper respondent is the person exercising the \xe2\x80\x9clegal reality of control\xe2\x80\x9d over the petitioner.  The statute itself makes no such distinction, nor does the Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law support a deviation from the immediate custodian rule here.  Rather, the cases Padilla cites stand for the simple proposition that the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms, does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges something other than his present physical confinement.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Braden</em> v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/484/index.html">410 U. S. 484</a>; <em>Strait</em> v. <em>Laird,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/341/index.html">406 U. S. 341</a>.  That is not the case here:\xc2\xa0Marr exercises day-to-day control over Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s physical custody.  The petitioner cannot name someone else just because Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s physical confinement stems from a military order by the President.  Identification of the party exercising legal control over the detainee only comes into play when there is no immediate physical custodian.  <em>Ex parte Endo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/283/index.html">323 U. S. 283</a>, 304\xe2\x80\x93305, distinguished.  Although Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s detention is unique in many respects, it is at bottom a simple challenge to physical custody imposed by the Executive.  His detention is thus not unique in any way that would provide arguable basis for a departure from the immediate custodian rule.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9313.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Southern District does not have jurisdiction over Commander Marr.  Section \xc2\xa72241(a)\xe2\x80\x99s language limiting district courts to granting habeas relief \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d requires \xe2\x80\x9cthat the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Braden, supra,</em> at 495.  Because Congress added the \xe2\x80\x9crespective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d clause to prevent judges anywhere from issuing the Great Writ on behalf of applicants far distantly removed, <em>Carbo</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/611/index.html">364 U. S. 611</a>, 617, the traditional rule has always been that habeas relief is issuable only in the district of confinement, <em>id.,</em> at 618.  This commonsense reading is supported by other portions of the habeas statute, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa72242, and by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(a).  Congress has also legislated against the background of the \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict of confinement\xe2\x80\x9d rule by fashioning explicit exceptions: <em>E.g.,</em> when a petitioner is serving a state criminal sentence in a State containing more than one federal district, \xe2\x80\x9cthe district . . . wherein [he] is in custody\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe district . . . within which the State court was held which convicted and sentenced him\xe2\x80\x9d have \xe2\x80\x9cconcurrent jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72241(d).  Such exceptions would have been unnecessary if, as the Second Circuit believed, \xc2\xa72241 permits a prisoner to file outside the district of confinement.  Despite this ample statutory and historical pedigree, Padilla urges that, under <em>Braden</em> and <em>Strait, </em>jurisdiction lies in any district in which the respondent is amenable to service of process.  The Court disagrees, distinguishing those two cases.  Padilla seeks to challenge his present physical custody in South Carolina.  Because the immediate-custodian rule applies, the proper respondent is Commander Marr, who is present in South Carolina.  There is thus no occasion to designate a \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d custodian and determine whether he or she is \xe2\x80\x9cpresent\xe2\x80\x9d in the same district as petitioner.  The habeas statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crespective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d proviso forms an important corollary to the immediate custodian rule in challenges to present physical custody under \xc2\xa72241.  Together they compose a simple rule that has been consistently applied in the lower courts, including in the context of military detentions: Whenever a \xc2\xa72241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge his present physical custody within the United States, he should name his warden as respondent and file the petition in the district of confinement.  This rule serves the important purpose of preventing forum shopping by habeas petitioners.  The District of South Carolina, not the Southern District of New York, was where Padilla should have brought his habeas petition.

We confront two questions: First, did Padilla properly file his habeas petition in the Southern District of New York; and second, did the President possess authority to detain Padilla militarily.  We answer the threshold question in the negative and thus do not reach the second question presented.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we do not decide the merits, we only briefly recount the relevant facts.  On May 8, 2002, Padilla flew from Pakistan to Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Hare International Airport.  As he stepped off the plane, Padilla was apprehended by federal agents executing a material witness warrant issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District) in connection with its grand jury investigation into the September 11th terrorist attacks.  Padilla was then transported to New York, where he was held in federal criminal custody.  On May 22, acting through appointed counsel, Padilla moved to vacate the material witness warrant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s motion was still pending when, on June 9, the President issued an order to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld designating Padilla an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy combatant\xe2\x80\x9d and directing the Secretary to detain him in military custody.  App. D to Brief for Petitioner 5a (June 9 Order).  In support of this action, the President invoked his authority as \xe2\x80\x9cCommander in Chief of the U. S. armed forces\xe2\x80\x9d and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, Pub. L. 107\xe2\x80\x9340, 115 Stat. 224 (AUMF),[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] enacted by Congress on September 18, 2001.  June 9 Order 5a.  The President also made several factual findings explaining his decision to designate Padilla an enemy combatant.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Based on these findings, the President concluded that it is \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with U. S. law and the laws of war for the Secretary of Defense to detain Mr. Padilla as an enemy combatant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 6a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That same day, Padilla was taken into custody by Department of Defense officials and transported to the Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston, South Carolina.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  He has been held there ever since.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On June 11, Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, claiming to act as his next friend, filed in the Southern District a habeas corpus petition under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241.  The petition, as amended, alleged that Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s military detention violates the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments and the Suspension Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl.\xc2\xa02, of the United States Constitution.  The amended petition named as respondents President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Melanie A. Marr, Commander of the Consolidated Naval Brig.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government moved to dismiss, arguing that Commander Marr, as Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s immediate custodian, is the only proper respondent to his habeas petition, and that the District Court lacks jurisdiction over Commander Marr because she is located outside the Southern District.  On the merits, the Government contended that the President has authority to detain Padilla militarily pursuant to the Commander in Chief Clause of the Constitution, Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01, the congressional AUMF, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html">317 U.

The court held that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal involvement\xe2\x80\x9d in Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s military custody renders him a proper respondent to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition, and that it can assert jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York\xe2\x80\x99s long-arm statute, notwithstanding his absence from the Southern District.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 581\xe2\x80\x93587.

The court agreed with the District Court that Secretary Rumsfeld is a proper respondent, reasoning that in cases where the habeas petitioner is detained for \xe2\x80\x9cother than federal criminal violations, the Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to the general practice of naming the immediate physical custodian as respondent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 704\xe2\x80\x93708.  The Court of Appeals concluded that on these \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d facts Secretary Rumsfeld is Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s custodian because he exercises \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal reality of control\xe2\x80\x9d over Padilla and because he was personally involved in Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s military detention.  <em>Id.,</em> at 707\xe2\x80\x93708.  The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that it has jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York\xe2\x80\x99s long-arm statute.  <em>Id.,</em> at 708\xe2\x80\x93710.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals held that the President lacks authority to detain Padilla militarily.  <em>Id.,</em> at 710\xe2\x80\x93724.  The court concluded that neither the President\xe2\x80\x99s Commander-in-Chief power nor the AUMF authorizes military detentions of American citizens captured on American soil.  <em>Id.,</em> at 712\xe2\x80\x93718, 722\xe2\x80\x93723.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals found in both our case law and in the Non-Detention Act, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa74001(a),[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] a strong presumption against domestic military detention of citizens absent explicit congressional authorization.  352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 710\xe2\x80\x93722.  Accordingly, the court granted the writ of habeas corpus and directed the Secretary to release Padilla from military custody within 30 days.  <em>Id.,</em> at 724.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rulings with respect to the jurisdictional\xc2\xa0 and the merits issues, both of which raise important questions of federal law.  540 U.

Neither Padilla, nor the courts below, nor Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 dissent deny the general applicability of the immediate custodian rule to habeas petitions challenging physical custody.  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  They argue instead that the rule is flexible and should not apply on the \xe2\x80\x9cunique facts\xe2\x80\x9d of this case. Brief for Respondents 44.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Padilla notes that the substantive holding of <em>Wales</em>\xe2\x80\x94that a person released on his own recognizance is not \xe2\x80\x9cin custody\xe2\x80\x9d for habeas purposes\xe2\x80\x94was disapproved in <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Municipal Court, San Jose&amp;nbhyph;Milpitas Judicial Dist., Santa Clara Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/345/index.html">411 U. S. 345</a>, 350, n. 8 (1973), as part of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s expanding definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d under the habeas statute.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Padilla seems to contend, and the dissent agrees, <em>post</em>, at 7, that because we no longer require physical detention as a prerequisite to habeas relief, the immediate custodian rule, too, must no longer bind us, even in challenges to physical custody.  That argument, as the Seventh Circuit aptly concluded, is a \xe2\x80\x9cnon sequitur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Al-Marri, supra,</em> at 711.  That our understanding of custody has broadened to include restraints short of physical confinement does nothing to undermine the rationale or statutory foundation of <em>Wales\xe2\x80\x99 </em>immediate custodian rule where physical custody <em>is</em> at issue.  Indeed, as the cases cited above attest, it has consistently been applied in this core habeas context within the United States.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view that we have relaxed the immediate custodian rule in cases involving prisoners detained for \xe2\x80\x9cother than federal criminal violations,\xe2\x80\x9d and that in such cases the proper respondent is the person exercising the \xe2\x80\x9clegal reality of control\xe2\x80\x9d over the petitioner, suffers from the same logical flaw.  352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 705, 707.  Certainly the statute itself makes no such distinction based on the source of the physical detention.  Nor does our case law support a deviation from the immediate custodian rule here.  Rather, the cases cited by Padilla stand for the simple proposition that the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms, does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges something other than his present physical confinement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Braden</em>, for example, an Alabama prisoner filed a habeas petition in the Western District of Kentucky.  He did not contest the validity of the Alabama conviction for which he was confined, but instead challenged a detainer lodged against him in Kentucky state court.  Noting that petitioner sought to challenge a \xe2\x80\x9cconfinement that would be imposed in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that petitioner was \xe2\x80\x9cin custody\xe2\x80\x9d in Kentucky by virtue of the detainer.  410 U. S., at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.  In these circumstances, the Court held that the proper respondent was not the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s immediate physical custodian (the Alabama warden), but was instead the Kentucky court in which the detainer was lodged.  This made sense because the Alabama warden was not \xe2\x80\x9cthe person who [held] him in what [was] alleged to be unlawful custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 494\xe2\x80\x93495 (citing <em>Wales, </em>114 U. S., at 574); <em>Hensley, supra,</em> at 351, n.\xc2\xa09 (observing that the petitioner in <em>Braden</em> \xe2\x80\x9cwas in the custody of Kentucky officials for purposes of his habeas corpus action\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under <em>Braden</em>, then, a habeas petitioner who challenges a form of \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d other than present physical confinement may name as respondent the entity or person who exercises legal control with respect to the challenged \xe2\x80\x9ccustody.\xe2\x80\x9d  But nothing in <em>Braden</em> supports departing from the immediate custodian rule in the traditional context of challenges to present physical confinement.  See <em>Al-Marri, supra,</em> at 711\xe2\x80\x93712; <em>Monk, supra,</em> at 369.<em> </em>To the contrary, <em>Braden</em> cited <em>Wales </em>favorably and reiterated the traditional rule that a prisoner seeking release from confinement must sue his \xe2\x80\x9cjailer.\xe2\x80\x9d  410 U. S., at 495 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reason, <em>Strait </em>v.<em> Laird</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/341/index.html">406 U. S. 341</a> (1972), does not aid Padilla.  <em>Strait</em> involved an inactive reservist domiciled in California who filed a \xc2\xa72241 petition seeking relief from his military obligations.  We noted that the reservist\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d custodian was a commanding officer in Indiana who had charge of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Army records.  <em>Id.</em>, at 344.  As in <em>Braden</em>, the immediate custodian rule had no application because petitioner was not challenging any present physical confinement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Braden</em> and <em>Strait</em>, the immediate custodian rule did not apply because <em>there was no</em> immediate physical custodian with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d being challenged.  That is not the case here: Commander Marr exercises day-to-day control over Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s physical custody.  We have never intimated that a habeas petitioner could name someone other than his immediate physical custodian as respondent simply because the challenged physical custody does not arise out of a criminal conviction.  Nor can we do so here just because Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s physical confinement stems from a military order by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows that neither <em>Braden</em> nor <em>Strait</em> supports the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Secretary Rumsfeld is the proper respondent because he exercises the \xe2\x80\x9clegal reality of control\xe2\x80\x9d over Padilla.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  As we have explained, identification of the party exercising legal control only comes into play when there is no immediate physical custodian with respect to the challenged \xe2\x80\x9ccustody.\xe2\x80\x9d  In challenges to present physical confinement, we reaffirm that the immediate custodian, not a supervisory official who exercises legal control, is the proper respondent.  If the \xe2\x80\x9clegal control\xe2\x80\x9d test applied to physical-custody challenges, a convicted prisoner would be able to name the State or the Attorney General as a respondent to a \xc2\xa72241 petition.  As the statutory language, established practice, and our precedent demonstrate, that is not the case.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At first blush <em>Ex parte Endo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/283/index.html">323 U. S. 283</a> (1944), might seem to lend support to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegal control\xe2\x80\x9d argument.  There, a Japanese-American citizen interned in California by the War Relocation Authority (WRA) sought relief by filing a \xc2\xa72241 petition in the Northern District of California, naming as a respondent her immediate custodian.  After she filed the petition, however, the Government moved her to Utah.  Thus, the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s immediate physical custodian was no longer within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  We held, nonetheless, that the Northern District \xe2\x80\x9cacquired jurisdiction in this case and that [Endo\xe2\x80\x99s] removal \xe2\x80\xa6 did not cause it to lose jurisdiction where a person in whose custody she is remains within the district.\xe2\x80\x9d 323 U. S.<em>,</em> at 306.  We held that, under these circumstances, the assistant director of the WRA, who resided in the Northern District, would be an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate respondent\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the District Court could direct the writ.  <em>Id.,</em> at 304\xe2\x80\x93305.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While <em>Endo</em> did involve a petitioner challenging her present physical confinement, it did not, as Padilla and Justice Stevens contend, hold that such a petitioner may properly name as respondent someone other than the immediate physical custodian.  <em>Post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (citing <em>Endo</em> as supporting a \xe2\x80\x9cmore functional approach\xe2\x80\x9d that allows habeas petitioners to name as respondent an individual with \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d over the petitioner).  Rather, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the writ could be directed to a supervisory official came not in our holding that the District Court initially acquired jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94it did so because Endo properly named her immediate custodian and filed in the district of confinement\xe2\x80\x94but in our holding that the District Court could effectively grant habeas relief despite the Government-procured absence of petitioner from the Northern District.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, <em>Endo</em> stands for the important but limited proposition that when the Government moves a habeas petitioner after she properly files a petition naming her immediate custodian, the District Court retains jurisdiction and may direct the writ to any respondent within its jurisdiction who has legal authority to effectuate the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s release.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Endo</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not help respondents here.  Padilla was moved from New York to South Carolina before his lawyer filed a habeas petition on his behalf.  Unlike the District Court in <em>Endo</em>, therefore, the Southern District never acquired jurisdiction over Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s argument reduces to a request for a new exception to the immediate custodian rule based upon the \xe2\x80\x9cunique facts\xe2\x80\x9d of this case.  While Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s detention is undeniably unique in many respects, it is at bottom a simple challenge to physical custody imposed by the Executive\xe2\x80\x94the traditional core of the Great Writ.  There is no indication that there was any attempt to manipulate behind Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s transfer\xe2\x80\x94he was taken to the same facility where other al Qaeda members were already being held, and the Government did not attempt to hide from Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer where it had taken him.  <em>Infra</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 and n.\xc2\xa017; <em>post</em>, at 5 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  His detention is thus not unique in any way that would provide arguable basis for a departure from the immediate custodian rule.  Accordingly, we hold that Commander Marr, not Secretary Rumsfeld, is Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s custodian and the proper respondent to his habeas petition.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn now to the second subquestion.  District courts are limited to granting habeas relief \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241(a).  We have interpreted this language to require \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more than that the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Braden, </em>410 U. S., at 495. Thus, jurisdiction over Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition lies in the Southern District only if it has jurisdiction over Commander Marr.  We conclude it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress added the limiting clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to the habeas statute in 1867 to avert the \xe2\x80\x9cinconvenient [and] potentially embarrassing\xe2\x80\x9d possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cevery judge anywhere [could] issue the Great Writ on behalf of applicants far distantly removed from the courts whereon they sat.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carbo</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/611/index.html">364 U. S. 611</a>, 617 (1961).  Accordingly, with respect to habeas petitions \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to relieve an individual from oppressive confinement,\xe2\x80\x9d the traditional rule has always been that the Great Writ is \xe2\x80\x9cissuable only in the district of confinement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 618.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other portions of the habeas statute support this commonsense reading of \xc2\xa72241(a).  For example, if a petitioner seeks habeas relief in the court of appeals, or from this Court or a Justice thereof, the petition must \xe2\x80\x9cstate the reasons for not making application to <em>the</em> district court of the district <em>in which the applicant is held</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72242 (emphases added).  Moreover, the court of appeals, this Court, or a Justice thereof \xe2\x80\x9cmay decline to entertain an application for a  writ of habeas corpus and may transfer the application \xe2\x80\xa6 to <em>the </em>district court having jurisdiction to entertain it.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>\xc2\xa72241(b) (emphasis added).  The Federal Rules similarly provide that an \xe2\x80\x9capplication for a writ of habeas corpus must be made to <em>the</em> appropriate district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has also legislated against the background of the \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict of confinement\xe2\x80\x9d rule by fashioning explicit exceptions to the rule in certain circumstances.  For instance, \xc2\xa72241(d) provides that when a petitioner is serving a state criminal sentence in a State that contains more than one federal district, he may file a habeas petition not only \xe2\x80\x9cin the district court for the district wherein [he] is in custody,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cin the district court for the district within which the State court was held which convicted and sentenced him;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceach of such district courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain the application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, until Congress directed federal criminal prisoners to file certain postconviction petitions in the sentencing courts by adding \xc2\xa72255 to the habeas statute, federal prisoners could litigate such collateral attacks only in the district of confinement.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hayman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/205/index.html">342 U. S. 205</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93219 (1952).  Both of these provisions would have been unnecessary if, as the Court of Appeals believed, \xc2\xa72241\xe2\x80\x99s general habeas provisions permit a prisoner to file outside the district of confinement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain language of the habeas statute thus confirms the general rule that for core habeas petitions challenging present physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district: the district of confinement.  Despite this ample statutory and historical pedigree, Padilla contends, and the Court of Appeals held, that the district of confinement rule no longer applies to core habeas challenges.  Rather, Padilla, as well as today\xe2\x80\x99s dissenters, <em>post,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, urge that our decisions in <em>Braden</em> and <em>Strait </em>stand for the proposition that jurisdiction will lie in any district in which the respondent is amenable to service of process.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to <em>Braden</em>, we had held that habeas jurisdiction depended on the presence of both the petitioner and his custodian within the territorial confines of the district court.  See <em>Ahrens</em> v. <em>Clark,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/188/index.html"></a><a href="/us/335/188/index.html">335 U. S. 188</a>, 190\xe2\x80\x93192 (1948).  By allowing an Alabama prisoner to challenge a Kentucky detainer in the Western District of Kentucky, <em>Braden</em> changed course and held that habeas jurisdiction requires only \xe2\x80\x9cthat the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian.\xe2\x80\x9d 410 U. S., at 495.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we fail to see how <em>Braden</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of jurisdiction over the respondent alters the district of confinement rule for challenges to present physical custody.  <em>Braden </em>itself did not involve such a challenge; rather, Braden challenged his future confinement in Kentucky by suing his Kentucky custodian.  We reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder these circumstances it would serve no useful purpose to apply the <em>Ahrens </em>rule and require that the action be brought in Alabama.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 499.  In habeas challenges to <em>present</em> physical confinement, by contrast, the district of confinement is <em>synonymous</em> with the district court that has territorial jurisdiction over the proper respondent.  This is because, as we have held, the immediate custodian rule applies to core habeas challenges to present physical custody.  By definition, the immediate custodian and the prisoner reside in the same district.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than focusing on the holding and historical context of <em>Braden</em>, Justice Stevens, <em>post, </em>at 8, like the Court of Appeals, seizes on dicta in which we referred to \xe2\x80\x9cservice of process\xe2\x80\x9d to contend that the Southern District could assert jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld under New York\xe2\x80\x99s long-arm statute.  See<em> Braden,</em> 410 U. S., at 495 (\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as the custodian can be reached by service of process, the court can issue a writ \xe2\x80\x98within its jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 even if the prisoner himself is confined outside the court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  But that dicta did not indicate that a custodian may be served with process <em>outside </em>of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the facts and holding of <em>Braden</em> dictate the opposite inference.  Braden served his Kentucky custodian in Kentucky.  Accordingly, we concluded that the Western District of Kentucky had jurisdiction over the petition \xe2\x80\x9csince the respondent was properly served <em>in that district</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 500 (emphasis added); see also <em>Endo, supra</em>, at 304\xe2\x80\x93305 (noting that the court could issue the writ to a WRA official \xe2\x80\x9cwhose office is at San Francisco, which is within the jurisdiction of the [Northern District of California]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, <em>Braden </em>in no way authorizes district courts to employ long-arm statutes to gain jurisdiction over custodians who are outside of their territorial jurisdiction.  See <em>Al-Marri</em>, 360 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 711; <em>Guerra</em>, 786 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 417.  Indeed, in stating its holding, <em>Braden</em> favorably cites <em>Schlanger </em>v. <em>Seamans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/487/index.html">401 U. S. 487</a> (1971), a case squarely holding that the custodian\xe2\x80\x99s absence from the territorial jurisdiction of the district court is fatal to habeas jurisdiction.  410 U. S.<em>, </em>at 500<em>.</em>  Thus, <em>Braden</em> does not derogate from the traditional district of confinement rule for core habeas petitions challenging present physical custody.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also thought <em>Strait</em> supported its long-arm approach to habeas jurisdiction.  But <em>Strait</em> offers even less help than <em>Braden</em>.  In <em>Strait, </em>we held that the Northern District of California had jurisdiction over Strait\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d custodian\xe2\x80\x94the commanding officer of the Army records center\xe2\x80\x94even though he was physically located in Indiana.  We reasoned that the custodian was \xe2\x80\x9cpresent\xe2\x80\x9d in California \xe2\x80\x9cthrough the officers in the hierarchy of the command who processed [Strait\xe2\x80\x99s] application for discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  406 U. S., at 345.  The <em>Strait </em>Court contrasted its broad view of \xe2\x80\x9cpresence\xe2\x80\x9d in the case of a nominal custodian with a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98commanding officer who is responsible for the day to day control of his subordinates,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who would be subject to habeas jurisdiction only in the district where he physically resides.  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Arlen</em> v. <em>Laird</em>, 451 F.\xc2\xa02d 684, 687 (CA2 1971)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, much like Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 dissent, reasoned that Secretary Rumsfeld, in the same way as Strait\xe2\x80\x99s commanding officer, was \xe2\x80\x9cpresent\xe2\x80\x9d in the Southern District through his subordinates who took Padilla into military custody.  352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 709\xe2\x80\x93710; <em>post</em>, at 8.  We think not.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Strait </em>simply has no application to the present case.  <em>Strait </em>predated <em>Braden</em>, so the then-applicable <em>Ahrens</em> rule required that both the petitioner and his custodian be present in California.  Thus, the only question was whether Strait\xe2\x80\x99s commanding officer was present in California notwithstanding his physical absence from the district.  Distinguishing <em>Schlanger, supra, </em>we held that it would \xe2\x80\x9cexalt fiction over reality\xe2\x80\x9d to require Strait to sue his \xe2\x80\x9cnominal custodian\xe2\x80\x9d in Indiana when Strait had always resided in California and had his only meaningful contacts with the Army there.  406 U. S., at 344\xe2\x80\x93346.  Only under these limited circumstances did we invoke concepts of personal jurisdiction to hold that the custodian was \xe2\x80\x9cpresent\xe2\x80\x9d in California through the actions of his agents.  <em>Id.,</em> at 345.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, by contrast, Padilla seeks to challenge his present physical custody in South Carolina.  Because the immediate-custodian rule applies to such habeas challenges, the proper respondent is Commander Marr, who is also present in South Carolina.  There is thus no occasion to designate a \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d custodian and determine whether he or she is \xe2\x80\x9cpresent\xe2\x80\x9d in the same district as petitioner.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Under <em>Braden</em> and the district of confinement rule, as we have explained, Padilla must file his habeas action in South Carolina.  Were we to extend <em>Strait</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limited exception to the territorial nature of habeas jurisdiction to the context of physical-custody challenges, we would undermine, if not negate, the purpose of Congress in amending the habeas statute in 1867.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proviso that district courts may issue the writ only \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d forms an important corollary to the immediate custodian rule in challenges to present physical custody under \xc2\xa72241.  Together they compose a simple rule that has been consistently applied in the lower courts, including in the context of military detentions: Whenever a \xc2\xa72241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge his present physical custody within the United States, he should name his warden as respondent and file the petition in the district of confinement.

We have addressed most of his contentions in the foregoing discussion, but we briefly touch on a few additional points.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apparently drawing a loose analogy to <em>Endo</em>, Justice Stevens<em> </em>asks us to pretend that Padilla and his immediate custodian were present in the Southern District at the time counsel filed the instant habeas petition, thus rendering jurisdiction proper.  <em>Post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The dissent asserts that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cdepart[ed] from the time-honored practice of giving one\xe2\x80\x99s adversary fair notice of an intent to present an important motion to the court,\xe2\x80\x9d when on June 9 it moved <em>ex parte</em> to vacate the material witness warrant and allegedly failed to immediately inform counsel of its intent to transfer Padilla to military custody in South Carolina.  <em>Ibid.</em>; cf. n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>.  Constructing a hypothetical \xe2\x80\x9cscenario,\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent contends that if counsel had been immediately informed, she \xe2\x80\x9cwould have filed the habeas petition then and there,\xe2\x80\x9d while Padilla remained in the Southern District, \xe2\x80\x9crather than waiting two days.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Therefore, Justice Stevens concludes, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misconduct \xe2\x80\x9cjustifies treating the habeas petition as the functional equivalent of one filed two days earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e should not permit the Government to obtain a tactical advantage as a consequence of an <em>ex parte</em> proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent cites no authority whatsoever for its extraordinary proposition that a district court can exercise statutory jurisdiction based on a series of events that did not occur, or that jurisdiction might be premised on \xe2\x80\x9cpunishing\xe2\x80\x9d alleged Government misconduct.  The lower courts\xe2\x80\x94unlike the dissent\xe2\x80\x94did not perceive any hint of Government misconduct or bad faith that would warrant extending <em>Endo</em> to a case where both the petitioner and his immediate custodian were outside of the district at the time of filing.  Not surprisingly, then, neither Padilla nor the lower courts relied on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s counterfactual theory to argue that habeas jurisdiction was proper.  Finding it contrary to our well-established precedent, we are not persuaded either.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent contends that even if we do not indulge its hypothetical scenario, the Court has made \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to the immediate custodian and district of confinement rules, rendering our bright-line rule \xe2\x80\x9cfar from bright.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  Yet the dissent cannot cite <em>a single case </em>in which we have deviated from the longstanding rule we reaffirm today\xe2\x80\x94that is, a case in which we allowed a habeas petitioner challenging his present physical custody within the United States to name as respondent someone other than the immediate custodian and to file somewhere other than the district of confinement.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] If Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 view were accepted, district courts would be consigned to making ad hoc determinations as to whether the circumstances of a given case are \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cspecial,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d enough to require departure from the jurisdictional rules this Court has consistently applied.  We do not think Congress intended such a result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the dissent urges us to bend the jurisdictional rules because the merits of this case are indisputably of \xe2\x80\x9cprofound importance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 1, 7.

According to the dissent, because the Government \xe2\x80\x9cshrouded . . . in secrecy\xe2\x80\x9d the location of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s military custody, counsel was entitled to file in the district where Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s presence was \xe2\x80\x9clast officially confirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As with the argument addressed above, neither Padilla nor the District Court\xe2\x80\x94which was much closer to the facts of the case than we are\xe2\x80\x94or the Court of Appeals ever suggested that the Government concealed Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts from counsel, much less contended that such concealment was the basis for habeas jurisdiction in the Southern District.  And even if this were a valid legal argument, the record simply does not support the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s inference of Government secrecy.  The dissent relies solely on a letter written by Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.

The only reasonable inference, particularly in light of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s failure to argue to the contrary, is that counsel was well aware of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s presence in South Carolina when she filed the habeas petition, not that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cshrouded\xe2\x80\x9d Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts in secrecy.</p>\n<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Instead, Justice Stevens, like the Court of Appeals, relies heavily on <em>Braden</em>, <em>Strait</em>, and other cases involving challenges to something other than present physical custody.  <em>Post, </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x9310; <em>post, </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa04 (citing <em>Garlotte</em> v. <em>Fordice,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/39/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/39/index.html">515 U.

That is not the case here, where the identity of the immediate custodian and the location of the appropriate district court are clear.</p>\n<p>\n\nThe dissent also cites two cases in which a state prisoner proceeding under 28 U.

S., at 493, 500 (indicating that the analysis is guided by \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional venue considerations\xe2\x80\x9d and  \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional principles of venue\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Moore </em>v<em>. Olson</em>, 368 F.\xc2\xa03d 757, 759\xe2\x80\x93760 (CA7 2004) (suggesting that the territorial-jurisdiction rule is a venue rule, and the immediate-custodian rule is a personal jurisdiction rule).  This approach is consistent with the reference in the statute to the \xe2\x80\x9crespective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d of the district court. 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241.  As we have noted twice this Term, the word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d is susceptible of different meanings, not all of which refer to the power of a federal court to hear a certain class of cases.  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U. S. ___ (2004); <em> Scarborough</em> v. <em>Principi, </em>541 U. S. ___ (2004).  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9crespective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d does establish a territorial restriction on the proper forum for habeas petitions, but does not of necessity establish that the limitation goes to the power of the court to hear the case. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the immediate-custodian and territorial-jurisdiction rules are like personal jurisdiction or venue rules, objections to the filing of petitions based on those grounds can be waived by the Government.  <em>Moore</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 759<em>; </em>cf.<em> Endo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 305 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that no respondent was ever served with process or appeared in the proceedings is not important.  The United States resists the issuance of a writ.  A cause exists in that state of the proceedings and an appeal lies from denial of a writ without the appearance of a respondent\xe2\x80\x9d).   For the same reason, the immediate-custodian and territorial rules are subject to exceptions, as acknowledged in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa09, 9\xe2\x80\x9313, 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  This does not mean that habeas petitions are governed by venue rules and venue considerations that apply to other sorts of civil lawsuits.  Although habeas actions are civil cases, they are not automatically subject to all of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cThese rules are applicable to proceedings for \xe2\x80\xa6 habeas corpus \xe2\x80\xa6 to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States, the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, or the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, these forum-location rules for habeas petitions are based on the habeas statutes and the cases interpreting them.  Furthermore, the fact that these habeas rules are subject to exceptions does not mean that, in the exceptional case, a petition may be properly filed in any one of the federal district courts.  When an exception applies, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rasul </em>v.<em> Bush</em>, <em>post</em>, p. ___, courts must still take into account the considerations that in the ordinary case are served by the immediate custodian rule, and, in a similar fashion, limit the available forum to the one with the most immediate connection to the named custodian.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would not decide today whether these habeas rules function more like rules of personal jurisdiction or rules of venue.  It is difficult to describe the precise nature of these restrictions on the filing of habeas petitions, as an examination of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own opinions in this area makes clear.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ahrens </em>v<em>. Clark</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/188/index.html">335 U. S. 188</a> (1948), with <em>Schlanger </em>v.<em> Seamans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/487/index.html">401 U. S. 487</a>, 491 (1971), and <em>Braden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495. The precise question of how best to characterize the statutory direction respecting where the action must be filed need not be resolved with finality in this case.  Here there has been no waiver by the Government; there is no established exception to the immediate-custodian rule or to the rule that the action must be brought in the district court with authority over the territory in question; and there is no need to consider some further exception to protect the integrity of the writ or the rights of the person detained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the purposes of this case, it is enough to note that, even under the most permissive interpretation of the habeas statute as a venue provision, the Southern District of New York was not the proper place for this petition.  As the Court concludes, in the ordinary case of a single physical custody within the borders of the United States, where the objection has not been waived by the Government, the immediate-custodian and territorial-jurisdiction rules must apply.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  I also agree with the arguments from statutory text and case law that the Court marshals in support of these two rules.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Only in an exceptional case may a court deviate from those basic rules to hear a habeas petition filed against some person other than the immediate custodian of the prisoner, or in some court other than the one in whose territory the custodian may be found.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has made exceptions in the cases of nonphysical custody, see<em>, e.g</em>,<em> Strait</em>, 406 U. S., at 345, of dual custody, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Braden</em>, 410 U. S., at 500,<em> </em>and of removal of the prisoner from the territory of a district after a petition has been filed, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Endo</em>, 323 U. S., at 306; see also <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  In addition, I would acknowledge an exception if there is an indication that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in removing a prisoner were to make it difficult for his lawyer to know where the habeas petition should be filed, or where the Government was not forthcoming with respect to the identity of the custodian and the place of detention.  In cases of that sort, habeas jurisdiction would be in the district court from whose territory the petitioner had been removed.  In this case, if the Government had removed Padilla from the Southern District of New York but refused to tell his lawyer where he had been taken, the District Court would have had jurisdiction over the petition.  Or, if the Government did inform the lawyer where a prisoner was being taken but kept moving him so a filing could not catch up to the prisoner, again, in my view, habeas jurisdiction would lie in the district or districts from which he had been removed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of the exceptions apply here.  There is no indication that the Government refused to tell Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer where he had been taken.  The original petition demonstrates that the lawyer knew where Padilla was being held at that time.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21, n. 17.  In these circumstances, the basic rules apply, and the District of South Carolina was the proper forum.  The present case demonstrates the wisdom of those rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s change in location and his change of custodian reflected a change in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for detaining him.  He ceased to be held under the authority of the criminal justice system, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73144, and began to be held under that of the military detention system.  Rather than being designed to play games with forums, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s removal of Padilla reflected the change in the theory on which it was holding him.  Whether that theory is a permissible one, of course, is a question the Court does not reach today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The change in custody, and the underlying change in rationale, should be challenged in the place the Government has brought them to bear and against the person who is the immediate representative of the military authority that is detaining him.  That place is the District of South Carolina, and that person is Commander Marr.  The Second Circuit erred in holding that the Southern District of New York was a proper forum for Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  With these further observations, I join the opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961630">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nRUMSFELD V.

The arguments set forth by the Court do not justify avoidance of our duty to answer those questions.  It is quite wrong to characterize the proceeding as a \xe2\x80\x9csimple challenge to physical custody,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, that should be resolved by slavish application of a \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 21, designed to prevent \xe2\x80\x9crampant forum shopping\xe2\x80\x9d by litigious prison inmates, <em>ante</em>, at 19.  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion itself demonstrates, that rule is riddled with exceptions fashioned to protect the high office of the Great Writ.  This is an exceptional case that we clearly have jurisdiction to decide.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2002, a grand jury convened in the Southern District of New York was conducting an investigation into the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  In response to an application by the Department of Justice, the Chief Judge of the District issued a material witness warrant authorizing Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s arrest when his plane landed in Chicago on May 8.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Pursuant to that warrant, agents of the Department of Justice took Padilla (hereinafter respondent) into custody and transported him to New York City, where he was detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.  On May 15, the court appointed Donna R. Newman, a member of the New York bar, to represent him.  She conferred with respondent in person and filed motions on his behalf, seeking his release on the ground that his incarceration was unauthorized and unconstitutional.  The District Court scheduled a hearing on those motions for Tuesday, June 11, 2002.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On Sunday, June 9, 2002, before that hearing could occur, the President issued a written command to the Secretary of Defense concerning respondent.  \xe2\x80\x9cBased on the information available to [him] from all sources,\xe2\x80\x9d the President determined that respondent is an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy combatant,\xe2\x80\x9d that he is \xe2\x80\x9cclosely associated with al Qaeda, an international terrorist organization with which the United States is at war,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he possesses intelligence that, \xe2\x80\x9cif communicated to the U. S., would aid U. S. efforts to prevent attacks by al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x9d on U. S. targets.  App. A to Pet. for Cert. 57a.  The command stated that \xe2\x80\x9cit is in the interest of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with U. S. law and the laws of war for the Secretary of Defense to detain Mr. Padilla as an enemy combatant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 58a.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s order concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cAccordingly, you are directed to receive Mr. Padilla from the Department of Justice and to detain him as an enemy combatant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the same Sunday that the President issued his order, the Government notified the District Court in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding that it was withdrawing its grand jury subpoena, and it asked the court to enter an order vacating the material witness warrant.  <em>Padilla ex rel. Newman</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 233 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 564, 571 (SDNY 2002).  In that proceeding, in which respondent was not represented, the Government informed the court that the President had designated respondent an enemy combatant and had directed the Secretary of Defense, petitioner Donald Rumsfeld, to detain respondent.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Government also disclosed that the Department of Defense would take custody of respondent and immediately transfer him to South Carolina.  The District Court complied with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request and vacated the warrant.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On Monday, June 10, 2002, the Attorney General publicly announced respondent\xe2\x80\x99s detention and transfer \xe2\x80\x9cto the custody of the Defense Department,\xe2\x80\x9d which he called \xe2\x80\x9ca significant step forward in the War on Terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Exh. A, p.\xc2\xa01, Record, Doc. 4.  On June 11, 2002, presumably in response to that announcement, Newman commenced this proceeding by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of New York.  233 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 571.  At a conference on that date, which had been originally scheduled to address Newman\xe2\x80\x99s motion to vacate the material witness warrant, the Government conceded that Defense Department personnel had taken custody of respondent in the Southern District of New York.  <em>Id</em>., at 571\xe2\x80\x93572.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All Members of this Court agree that the immediate custodian rule should control in the ordinary case and that habeas petitioners should not be permitted to engage in forum shopping.  But we also all agree with Judge Bork that \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d can justify exceptions from the general rule.  <em>Demjanjuk</em> v. <em>Meese, </em>784 F.2d 1114, 1116 (CADC 1986).  See <em>ante</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa018.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  More narrowly, we agree that if jurisdiction was proper when the petition was filed, it cannot be defeated by a later transfer of the prisoner to another district.  <em>Ex parte Endo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/283/index.html"></a><a href="/us/323/283/index.html">323 U. S. 283</a>, 306 (1944).  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is reasonable to assume that if the Government had given Newman, who was then representing respondent in an adversary proceeding, notice of its intent to ask the District Court to vacate the outstanding material witness warrant and transfer custody to the Department of Defense, Newman would have filed the habeas petition then and there, rather than waiting two days.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Under that scenario, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s immediate custodian would then have been physically present in the Southern District of New York carrying out orders of the Secretary of Defense.  Surely at that time Secretary Rumsfeld, rather than the lesser official who placed the handcuffs on petitioner, would have been the proper person to name as a respondent to that petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difference between that scenario and the secret transfer that actually occurred should not affect our decision, for we should not permit the Government to obtain a tactical advantage as a consequence of an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding.  The departure from the time-honored practice of giving one\xe2\x80\x99s adversary fair notice of an intent to present an important motion to the court justifies treating the habeas application as the functional equivalent of one filed two days earlier.  See <em>Baldwin</em> v. <em>Hale,</em> 1 Wall. 223, 233 (1864) (\xe2\x80\x9cCommon justice requires that no man shall be condemned in his person or property without notice and an opportunity to make his defence\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe very nature of the writ demands that it be administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Nelson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/286/index.html">394 U. S. 286</a>, 291 (1969).  But even if we treat respondent\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition as having been filed in the Southern District after the Government removed him to South Carolina, there is ample precedent for affording special treatment to this exceptional case, both by recognizing Secretary Rumsfeld as the proper respondent and by treating the Southern District as the most appropriate venue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court purports to be enforcing a \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line rule\xe2\x80\x9d governing district courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction, <em>ante</em>, at 21, an examination of its opinion reveals that the line is far from bright.  Faced with a series of precedents emphasizing the writ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cscope and flexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harris</em>, 394 U. S., at 291, the Court is forced to acknowledge the numerous exceptions we have made to the immediate custodian rule.  The rule does not apply, the Court admits, when physical custody is not at issue, <em>ante</em>, at 8, or when American citizens are confined overseas, <em>ante</em>, at 19, n.\xc2\xa016, or when the petitioner has been transferred after filing, <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, or when the custodian is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98present\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the district through his agents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, <em>ante</em>, at 17.  In recognizing exception upon exception and corollaries to corollaries, the Court itself persuasively demonstrates that the rule is not ironclad.  It is, instead, a workable general rule that frequently gives way outside the context of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98core challenges\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to Executive confinement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s detention falls within the category of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98core challenges\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot unique in any way that would provide arguable basis for a departure from the immediate custodian rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  It is, however, disingenuous at best to classify respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition with run-of-the-mill collateral attacks on federal criminal convictions.  On the contrary, this case is singular not only because it calls into question decisions made by the Secretary himself, but also because those decisions have created a unique and unprecedented threat to the freedom of every American citizen.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have consistently rejected interpretations of the habeas corpus statute that would suffocate the writ in stifling formalisms or hobble its effectiveness with the manacles of arcane and scholastic procedural requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Municipal Court, San Jose&amp;nbhyph;Milpitas Judicial Dist., Santa Clara Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/345/index.html">411 U. S. 345</a>, 350 (1973).  With respect to the custody requirement, we have declined to adopt a strict reading of <em>Wales</em> v. <em>Whitney,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/114/564/index.html">114 U. S. 564</a> (1885), see <em>Hensley</em>, 411 U. S., at 350, n.\xc2\xa08, and instead have favored a more functional approach that focuses on the person with the power to produce the body.  See <em>Endo</em>, 323 U. S., at 306\xe2\x80\x93307.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In this case, the President entrusted the Secretary of Defense with control over respondent.  To that end, the Secretary deployed Defense Department personnel to the Southern District with instructions to transfer respondent to South Carolina.  Under the President\xe2\x80\x99s order, only the Secretary\xe2\x80\x94not a judge, not a prosecutor, not a warden\xe2\x80\x94has had a say in determining respondent\xe2\x80\x99s location.  As the District Court observed, Secretary Rumsfeld has publicly shown \xe2\x80\x9cboth his familiarity with the circumstances of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s detention, and his personal involvement in the handling of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  233 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 574.  Having \xe2\x80\x9cemphasized and jealously guarded\xe2\x80\x9d the Great Writ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cability to cut through barriers of form and procedural mazes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harris</em>, 394 U. S., at 291, surely we should acknowledge that the writ reaches the Secretary as the relevant custodian in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the Secretary is a proper custodian, the question whether the petition was appropriately filed in the Southern District is easily answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo long as the custodian can be reached by service of process, the court can issue a writ \xe2\x80\x98within its jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 requiring that the prisoner be brought before the court for a hearing on his claim . . . even if the prisoner himself is confined outside the court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Braden</em> v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/484/index.html"></a><a href="/us/410/484/index.html">410 U.

S., at 306 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he court may act if there is a respondent within reach of its process who has custody of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this case, Secretary Rumsfeld no doubt has sufficient contacts with the Southern District properly to be served with process there.  The Secretary, after all, ordered military personnel to that forum to seize and remove respondent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears emphasis that the question of the proper forum to determine the legality of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s incarceration is not one of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa07; <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Federal courts undoubtedly have the authority to issue writs of habeas corpus to custodians who can be reached by service of process \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241(a).  Rather, the question is one of venue, <em>i.e</em>., in which federal court the habeas inquiry may proceed.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Government purports to exercise complete control, free from judicial surveillance, over that placement.  Venue principles, however, center on the most convenient and efficient forum for resolution of a case, see <em>Braden</em>, 410 U. S., at 493\xe2\x80\x93494, 499\xe2\x80\x93500 (considering those factors in allowing Alabama prisoner to sue in Kentucky), and on the placement most likely to minimize forum shopping by either party, see <em>Eisel</em> v. <em>Secretary of the Army</em>, 477 F.\xc2\xa02d 1251, 1254 (CADC 1973) (preferring such functional considerations to \xe2\x80\x9cblind incantation of words with implied magical properties, such as \xe2\x80\x98immediate custodian\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Cf. <em>Ex parte Bollman,</em> 4 Cranch 75, 136 (1807) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would \xe2\x80\xa6 be extremely dangerous to say, that because the prisoners were apprehended, not by a civil magistrate, but by the military power, there could be given by law a right to try the persons so seized in any place which the general might select, and to which he might direct them to be carried\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When this case is analyzed under those traditional venue principles, it is evident that the Southern District of New York, not South Carolina, is the more appropriate place to litigate respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  The Government sought a material witness warrant for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s detention in the Southern District, indicating that it would be convenient for its attorneys to litigate in that forum.  As a result of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s initial forum selection, the District Judge and counsel in the Southern District were familiar with the legal and factual issues surrounding respondent\xe2\x80\x99s detention both before and after he was transferred to the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s custody.  Accordingly, fairness and efficiency counsel in favor of preserving venue in the Southern District.

Even more important than the method of selecting the people\xe2\x80\x99s rulers and their successors is the character of the constraints imposed on the Executive by the rule of law.  Unconstrained Executive detention for the purpose of investigating and preventing subversive activity is the hallmark of the Star Chamber.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Access to counsel for the purpose of protecting the citizen from official mistakes and mistreatment is the hallmark of due process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Executive detention of subversive citizens, like detention of enemy soldiers to keep them off the battlefield, may sometimes be justified to prevent persons from launching or becoming missiles of destruction.  It may not, however, be justified by the naked interest in using unlawful procedures to extract information.  Incommunicado detention for months on end is such a procedure.  Whether the information so procured is more or less reliable than that acquired by more extreme forms of torture is of no consequence.  For if this Nation is to remain true to the ideals symbolized by its flag, it must not wield the tools of tyrants even to resist an assault by the forces of tyranny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As its authority for detaining respondent as a material witness, the Government relied on a federal statute that provides: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it appears from an affidavit filed by a party that the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding, and if it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena, a judicial officer may order the arrest of the person and treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section 3142 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Release of a material witness may be delayed for a reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witness can be taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73144.  </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The order vacating the material witness warrant that the District Court entered in the <em>ex parte</em> proceeding on June 9 terminated the Government\xe2\x80\x99s lawful custody of respondent.  After that order was entered, Secretary Rumsfeld\xe2\x80\x99s agents took custody of respondent.  The authority for that action was based entirely on the President\xe2\x80\x99s command to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x94a document that, needless to say, would not even arguably qualify as a valid warrant.  Thus, whereas respondent\xe2\x80\x99s custody during the period between May 8 and June 9, 2002, was pursuant to a judicially authorized seizure, he has been held ever since\xe2\x80\x94for two years\xe2\x80\x94pursuant to a warrantless arrest.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The record indicates that the Government had not <em>officially</em> informed Newman of her client\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts at the time she filed the habeas petition on June 11.  Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus\xc2\xa02, \xc2\xb6  ;4 (\xe2\x80\x9cOn information and belief, Padilla is being held in segregation at the high-security Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston, South Carolina\xe2\x80\x9d); Letter from Donna R. Newman to General Counsel of the Department of Defense, June 17, 2002 (\xe2\x80\x9cI understand <em>from the media</em> that my client is being held in Charleston, South Carolina in the military brig\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)), Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Exh. A, p.\xc2\xa04, Record, Doc. 4.  Thus, while it is true, as the Court observes, that \xe2\x80\x9cPadilla was moved from New York to South Carolina before his lawyer filed a habeas petition on his behalf,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, what matters for present purposes are the facts available to Newman at the time of filing.  When the Government shrouded those facts in secrecy, Newman had no option but to file immediately in the district where respondent\xe2\x80\x99s presence was last officially confirmed.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, Newman was appointed to represent respondent by the District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Once the Government removed her client, it did not permit her to counsel him until February 11, 2004.  Consultation thereafter has been allowed as a matter of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s grace, not as a matter of right stemming from the Southern District of New York appointment.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Further, it is not apparent why the District of South Carolina, rather than the Southern District of New York, should be regarded as the proper forum to determine the validity of the \xe2\x80\x9cchange in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for detaining\xe2\x80\x9d respondent.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  If the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory is not \xe2\x80\x9ca permissible one,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, then the New York federal court would remain the proper forum in this case.  Why should the New York court not have the authority to determine the legitimacy of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s removal of respondent beyond that court\xe2\x80\x99s borders?</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For other cases in which the immediate custodian rule has not been strictly applied, see <em>Garlotte</em> v. <em>Fordice,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/39/index.html">515 U.
