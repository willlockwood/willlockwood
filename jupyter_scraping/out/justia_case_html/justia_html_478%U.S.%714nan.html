Synar, 478 U.S.  714 (1986)</h3><p><b>Bowsher v. Synar</b></p><p><b>No. 85-1377</b></p><p><b>Argued April 23, 1986</b></p><p><b>Decided July 7, 1986<l=|478 714ast|="" u.s.="">*</l=|478></b></p><p><b>478 U.S. 714</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>In order to eliminate the federal budget deficit, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Act), popularly known as the "Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act," which sets a maximum deficit amount for federal spending for each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1991 (progressively reducing the deficit amount to zero in 1991).  If in any fiscal year the budget deficit exceeds the prescribed maximum by more than a specified sum, the Act requires basically across-the-board cuts in federal spending to reach the targeted deficit level.  These reductions are accomplished under the "reporting provisions" spelled out in \xc2\xa7 251 of the Act, which requires the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to submit their deficit estimates and program-by-program budget reduction calculations to the Comptroller General, who, after reviewing the Directors\' joint report, then reports his conclusions to the President.  The President in turn must issue a "sequestration" order mandating the spending reductions specified by the Comptroller General, and the sequestration order becomes effective unless, within a specified time, Congress legislates reductions to obviate the need for the sequestration order.  The Act also contains in \xc2\xa7 274(f) a "fallback" deficit reduction process (eliminating the Comptroller General\'s participation) to take effect if \xc2\xa7 251\'s reporting provisions are invalidated.  In consolidated actions in the Federal District Court, individual Congressmen and the National Treasury Employees Union (Union) (who, along with one of the Union\'s members, are appellees here) challenged the Act\'s constitutionality.  The court held, <em>inter alia,</em> that the Comptroller General\'s role in exercising executive functions under the Act\'s deficit reduction process violated the constitutionally imposed doctrine of separation of powers because the Comptroller General is removable only by a congressional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="715">Page 478 U. S. 715</a></p><p> joint resolution or by impeachment, and Congress may not retain the power of removal over an officer performing executive powers.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The fact that members of the Union, one of whom is an appellee here, will sustain injury because the Act suspends certain scheduled cost-of-living benefit increases to the members, is sufficient to create standing under a provision of the Act and Article III to challenge the Act\'s constitutionality.  Therefore, the standing issue as to the Union itself or Members of Congress need not be considered.  P.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#721">478 U. S. 721</a></span>.</p>\n<p>2. The powers vested in the Comptroller General under \xc2\xa7 251 violate the Constitution\'s command that Congress play no direct role in the execution of the laws.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#721">478 U. S. 721</a></span>-734.</p>\n<p>(a) Under the constitutional principle of separation of powers, Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment.  To permit the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical terms, reserve in Congress control of the execution of the laws.  The structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Congress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it does not possess.  <em>Cf.

S. 721</a></span>-727.</p>\n<p>(b) There is no merit to the contention that the Comptroller General performs his duties independently and is not subservient to Congress.  Although nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the Comptroller General is removable only at the initiative of Congress.  Under controlling statutes, he may be removed not only by impeachment but also by joint resolution of Congress "at any time" for specified causes, including "inefficiency," "neglect of duty," and "malfeasance."  The quoted terms, as interpreted by Congress, could sustain removal of a Comptroller General for any number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will.  Moreover, the political realities do not reveal that the Comptroller General is free from Congress\' influence.  He heads the General Accounting Office, which, under pertinent statutes, is "an instrumentality of the United States Government independent of the executive departments," and Congress has consistently viewed the Comptroller General as an officer of the Legislative Branch.  Over the years, the Comptrollers General have also viewed themselves as part of the Legislative Branch.  Thus, because Congress has retained removal authority over the Comptroller General, he may not be entrusted with executive powers.

S. 727</a></span>-732.</p>\n<p>(c) Under \xc2\xa7 251 of the Act, the Comptroller General has been improperly assigned executive powers.  Although he is to have "due regard" for the estimates and reductions contained in the joint report of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="716">Page 478 U. S. 716</a></p><p> the Directors of the CBO and the OMB, the Act clearly contemplates that, in preparing his report, the Comptroller General will exercise his independent judgment and evaluation with respect to those estimates, and will make decisions of the kind that are made by officers charged with executing a statute.  The Act\'s provisions give him, not the President, the ultimate authority in determining what budget cuts are to be made.  By placing the responsibility for execution of the Act in the hands of an officer who is subject to removal only by itself, Congress, in effect, has retained control over the Act\'s execution, and has unconstitutionally intruded into the executive function.

It is not necessary to consider whether the appropriate remedy is to nullify the 1921 statutory provisions that authorize Congress to remove the Comptroller General, rather than to invalidate \xc2\xa7 251 of the Act.  In \xc2\xa7 274(f), Congress has explicitly provided "fallback" provisions that take effect if any of the reporting procedures described in \xc2\xa7 251 are invalidated.  Assuming that the question of the appropriate remedy must be resolved on the basis of congressional intent, the intent appears to have been for \xc2\xa7 274(f) to be given effect as written.

S. 717</a></p><p></p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented by these appeals is whether the assignment by Congress to the Comptroller General of the United States of certain functions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 violates the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>On December 12, 1985, the President signed into law the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, Pub.L. 99-177, 99 Stat. 1038, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 901 <em>et seq.</em> (1982 ed., Supp. III), popularly known as the "Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act."  The purpose of the Act is to eliminate the federal budget deficit.  To that end, the Act sets a "maximum deficit amount" for federal spending for each of fiscal years 1986 through 1991.  The size of that maximum deficit amount progressively reduces to zero in fiscal year 1991.  If in any fiscal year the federal budget deficit exceeds the maximum </p><p><a class="page-number" name="718">Page 478 U. S. 718</a></p><p> deficit amount by more than a specified sum, the Act requires across-the-board cuts in federal spending to reach the targeted deficit level, with half of the cuts made to defense programs and the other half made to nondefense programs.  The Act exempts certain priority programs from these cuts.  \xc2\xa7 255.</p>\n<p>These "automatic" reductions are accomplished through a rather complicated procedure, spelled out in \xc2\xa7 251, the so-called "reporting provisions" of the Act.  Each year, the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) independently estimate the amount of the federal budget deficit for the upcoming fiscal year.  If that deficit exceeds the maximum targeted deficit amount for that fiscal year by more than a specified amount, the Directors of OMB and CBO independently calculate, on a program-by-program basis, the budget reductions necessary to ensure that the deficit does not exceed the maximum deficit amount.  The Act then requires the Directors to report jointly their deficit estimates and budget reduction calculations to the Comptroller General.</p>\n<p>The Comptroller General, after reviewing the Directors\' reports, then reports his conclusions to the President.  \xc2\xa7 251(b).  The President, in turn, must issue a "sequestration" order mandating the spending reductions specified by the Comptroller General.  \xc2\xa7 252.  There follows a period during which Congress may by legislation reduce spending to obviate, in whole or in part, the need for the sequestration order.  If such reductions are not enacted, the sequestration order becomes effective and the spending reductions included in that order are made.</p>\n<p>Anticipating constitutional challenge to these procedures, the Act also contains a "fallback" deficit reduction process to take effect "[i]n the event that any of the reporting procedures described in section 251 are invalidated."  \xc2\xa7 274(f).  Under these provisions, the report prepared by the Directors of OMB and the CBO is submitted directly to a specially </p><p><a class="page-number" name="719">Page 478 U. S. 719</a></p><p> created Temporary Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, which must report in five days to both Houses a joint resolution setting forth the content of the Directors\' report.  Congress then must vote on the resolution under special rules, which render amendments out of order.  If the resolution is passed and signed by the President, it then serves as the basis for a Presidential sequestration order.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Within hours of the President\'s signing of the Act, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] Congressman Synar, who had voted against the Act, filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief that the Act was unconstitutional.  Eleven other Members later joined Congressman Synar\'s suit.  A virtually identical lawsuit was also filed by the National Treasury Employees Union.  The Union alleged that its members had been injured as a result of the Act\'s automatic spending reduction provisions, which have suspended certain cost-of-living benefit increases to the Union\'s members. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>A three-judge District Court, appointed pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 922(a)(5) (1982 ed., Supp. III), invalidated the reporting provisions.  <em>Synar v. United States,</em> 626 F.Supp. 1374 (DC 1986) (Scalia, Johnson, and Gasch, JJ.).  The District Court concluded that the Union had standing to challenge the Act, since the members of the Union had suffered actual injury by suspension of certain benefit increases.  The District Court also concluded that Congressman Synar and his fellow Members had standing under the so-called "congressional standing" doctrine.  <em>See Barnes v. Kline,</em> 245 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 21, 759 F.2d 21, 41 (1985), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Burke v. Barnes,</em> 475 U.S. 1044 (1986). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="720">Page 478 U. S. 720</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court next rejected appellees\' challenge that the Act violated the delegation doctrine.  The court expressed no doubt that the Act delegated broad authority, but delegation of similarly broad authority has been upheld in past cases.  The District Court observed that, in <em>Yakus v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/case.html">321 U. S. 414</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/case.html#420">321 U. S. 420</a></span> (1944), this Court upheld a statute that delegated to an unelected "Price Administrator" the power "to promulgate regulations fixing prices of commodities."  Moreover in the District Court\'s view, the Act adequately confined the exercise of administrative discretion.  The District Court concluded that</p>\n<p>"the totality of the Act\'s standards, definitions, context, and reference to past administrative practice provides an adequate \'intelligible principle\' to guide and confine administrative decisionmaking."</p>\n<p>626 F.Supp. at 1389.</p>\n<p>Although the District Court concluded that the Act survived a delegation doctrine challenge, it held that the role of the Comptroller General in the deficit reduction process violated the constitutionally imposed separation of powers.  The court first explained that the Comptroller General exercises executive functions under the Act.  However, the Comptroller General, while appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, is removable not by the President but only by a joint resolution of Congress or by impeachment.  The District Court reasoned that this arrangement could not be sustained under this Court\'s decisions in <em>Myers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html">272 U. S. 52</a></span> (1926), and <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span> (1935).  Under the separation of powers established by the Framers of the Constitution, the court concluded, Congress may not retain the power of removal over an officer performing executive functions.  The congressional removal power created a "here-and-now subservience" of the Comptroller General to Congress.  626 F.Supp. at 1392.  The District Court therefore held that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="721">Page 478 U. S. 721</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"since the powers conferred upon the Comptroller General as part of the automatic deficit reduction process are executive powers, which cannot constitutionally be exercised by an officer removable by Congress, those powers cannot be exercised, and therefore the automatic deficit reduction process to which they are are central cannot be implemented."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1403.</p>\n<p>Appeals were taken directly to this Court pursuant to \xc2\xa7 274(b) of the Act.  We noted probable jurisdiction and expedited consideration of the appeals.  475 U.S. 1009 (1986).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>A threshold issue is whether the Members of Congress, members of the National Treasury Employees Union, or the Union itself have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act in question.  It is clear that members of the Union, one of whom is an appellee here, will sustain injury by not receiving a scheduled increase in benefits.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 252(a)(6)(C)(i); 626 F.Supp. at 1381.  This is sufficient to confer standing under \xc2\xa7 274(a)(2) and Article III.  We therefore need not consider the standing issue as to the Union or Members of Congress.  <em>See Secretary of Interior v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/312/case.html">464 U.

Cooke ed.1961).\n</em></p>\n<p>Even a cursory examination of the Constitution reveals the influence of Montesquieu\'s thesis that checks and balances were the foundation of a structure of government that would protect liberty.  The Framers provided a vigorous Legislative Branch and a separate and wholly independent Executive Branch, with each branch responsible ultimately to the people.  The Framers also provided for a Judicial Branch equally independent, with "[t]he judicial Power . . . extend[ing] to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, and the Laws of the United States."  Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2.</p>\n<p>Other, more subtle, examples of separated powers are evident as well.  Unlike parliamentary systems such as that of Great Britain, no person who is an officer of the United States may serve as a Member of the Congress.  Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6.  Moreover, unlike parliamentary systems, the President, under Article II, is responsible not to the Congress, but to the people, subject only to impeachment proceedings which are exercised by the two Houses as representatives of the people.  Art. II, \xc2\xa7 4.  And even in the impeachment of a President, the presiding officer of the ultimate tribunal is not a member of the 1egislative Branch, but the Chief Justice of the United States.  Art. I, \xc2\xa7 3.</p>\n<p>That this system of division and separation of powers produces conflicts, confusion, and discordance at times is inherent, but it was deliberately so structured to assure full, vigorous, and open debate on the great issues affecting the people, and to provide avenues for the operation of checks on the exercise of governmental power.</p>\n<p>The Constitution does not contemplate an active role for Congress in the supervision of officers charged with the execution of the laws it enacts.  The President appoints "Officers of the United States" with the "Advice and Consent of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="723">Page 478 U. S. 723</a></p><p> the Senate. . . ."  Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2.  Once the appointment has been made and confirmed, however, the Constitution explicitly provides for removal of Officers of the United States by Congress only upon impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate.  An impeachment by the House and trial by the Senate can rest only on "Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."  Art. II, \xc2\xa7 4.  A direct congressional role in the removal of officers charged with the execution of the laws beyond this limited one is inconsistent with separation of powers.</p>\n<p>This was made clear in debate in the First Congress in 1789.  When Congress considered an amendment to a bill establishing the Department of Foreign Affairs, the debate centered around whether the Congress</p>\n<p>"should recognize and declare the power of the President under the Constitution to remove the Secretary of Foreign Affairs without the advice and consent of the Senate."</p>\n<p><em>Myers,</em> 272 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html#114">272 U. S. 114</a></span>.  James Madison urged rejection of a congressional role in the removal of Executive Branch officers, other than by impeachment, saying in debate:</p>\n<p>"Perhaps there was no argument urged with more success, or more plausibly grounded against the Constitution, under which we are now deliberating, than that founded on the mingling of the Executive and Legislative branches of the Government in one body.  It has been objected, that the Senate have too much of the Executive power even, by having a control over the President in the appointment to office.  Now, shall we extend this connexion between the Legislative and Executive departments, which will strengthen the objection, and diminish the responsibility we have in the head of the Executive?"</p>\n<p>1 Annals of Cong. 380 (1789).  Madison\'s position ultimately prevailed, and a congressional role in the removal process was rejected.  This "Decision of 1789" provides "contemporaneous and weighty evidence" of the Constitution\'s meaning, since many of the Members of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="724">Page 478 U.

At issue in <em>Myers</em> was a statute providing that certain postmasters could be removed only "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."  The President removed one such Postmaster without Senate approval, and a lawsuit ensued.  Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court, declared the statute unconstitutional on the ground that for Congress to</p>\n<p>"draw to itself, or to either branch of it, the power to remove or the right to participate in the exercise of that power . . . would be . . . to infringe the constitutional principle of the separation of governmental powers."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html#161">272 U.

Justice Sutherland\'s opinion for the Court also underscored the crucial role of separated powers in our system:</p>\n<p>"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question.  So much is implied in the very fact of the separation of the powers of these departments by the Constitution, and in the rule which recognizes their essential co-equality."</p>\n<p>295 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#629">295 U.

S. 726</a></p><p> removal authority over a member of the War Claims Commission.</p>\n<p>In light of these precedents, we conclude that Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment.  To permit the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical terms, reserve in Congress control over the execution of the laws.  As the District Court observed:</p>\n<p>"Once an officer is appointed, it is only the authority that can remove him, and not the authority that appointed him, that he must fear and, in the performance of his functions, obey."</p>\n<p>626 F.Supp. at 1401.  The structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Congress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it does not possess.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <em>INS v. Chadha,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a></span> (1983), supports this conclusion.  In <em>Chadha,</em> we struck down a one-House "legislative veto" provision by which each House of Congress retained the power to reverse a decision Congress had expressly authorized the Attorney General to make:</p>\n<p>"Disagreement with the Attorney General\'s decision on Chadha\'s deportation -- that is, Congress\' decision to deport Chadha -- no less than Congress\' original choice to delegate to the Attorney General the authority to make that decision, involves determinations of policy that Congress can implement in only one way:  bicameral passage followed by presentment to the President.

Congress could simply remove, or threaten to remove, an officer for executing the laws in any fashion found to be unsatisfactory to Congress.  This kind of congressional control over </p><p><a class="page-number" name="727">Page 478 U.

With these principles in mind, we turn to consideration of whether the Comptroller General is controlled by Congress.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellants urge that the Comptroller General performs his duties independently and is not subservient to Congress.  We agree with the District Court that this contention does not bear close scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The critical factor lies in the provisions of the statute defining the Comptroller General\'s office relating to removability. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Although the Comptroller General is nominated by the President from a list of three individuals recommended by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate, <em>see</em> 31 U.S.C. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="728">Page 478 U. S. 728</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 703(a)(2), [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and confirmed by the Senate, he is removable only at the initiative of Congress.  He may be removed not only by impeachment, but also by joint resolution of Congress "at any time" resting on any one of the following bases:</p>\n<p>"(i) permanent disability;"</p>\n<p>"(ii) inefficiency;"</p>\n<p>"(iii) neglect of duty;"</p>\n<p>"(iv) malfeasance; or"</p>\n<p>"(v) a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude."</p>\n<p>31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 703(e)(1)B. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This provision was included, as one Congressman explained in urging passage of the Act, because Congress</p>\n<p>"felt that [the Comptroller General] should be brought under the sole control of Congress, so that Congress, at any moment when it found he was inefficient and was not carrying on the duties of his office as he should and as the Congress expected, could remove him without the long tedious process of a trial by impeachment."</p>\n<p>61 Cong.Rec. 1081 (1921).</p>\n<p>The removal provision was an important part of the legislative scheme, as a number of Congressmen recognized.  Representative Hawley commented:</p>\n<p>"[H]e is our officer, in a measure, getting information for us. . . .  If he does not do his work properly, we, as practically his employers, ought to be able to discharge him from his office."</p>\n<p>58 Cong.Rec. 7136 (1919).  Representative Sisson observed that the removal provisions would give "[t]he Congress of the United States . . . absolute control of the man\'s destiny in office." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="729">Page 478 U. S. 729</a></p><p></p>\n<p>61 Cong.Rec. 987 (1921).  The ultimate design was to "give the legislative branch of the Government control of the audit not through the power of appointment, but through the power of removal."  58 Cong.Rec. 7211 (1919) (Rep. Temple).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE contends:</p>\n<p>"The statute does not permit anyone to remove the Comptroller at will; removal is permitted only for specified cause, with the existence of cause to be determined by Congress following a hearing.  Any removal under the statute would presumably be subject to post-termination judicial review to ensure that a hearing had in fact been held and that the finding of cause for removal was not arbitrary."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">478 U. S. 770</span>.  That observation by the dissenter rests on at least two arguable premises:  (a) that the enumeration of certain specified causes of removal excludes the possibility of removal for other causes, <em>cf. Shurtleff v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/311/case.html">189 U. S. 311</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/311/case.html#315">189 U. S. 315</a></span>-316 (1903); and (b) that any removal would be subject to judicial review, a position that appellants were unwilling to endorse. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Glossing over these difficulties, the dissent\'s assessment of the statute fails to recognize the breadth of the grounds for removal.  The statute permits removal for "inefficiency," "neglect of duty," or "malfeasance."  These terms are very broad and, as interpreted by Congress, could sustain removal of a Comptroller General for any number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will.  The Constitutional Convention chose to permit impeachment of executive officers only for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."  It rejected language that would have permitted impeachment for "maladministration," with Madison </p><p><a class="page-number" name="730">Page 478 U. S. 730</a></p><p> arguing that "[s]o vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate."  2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 550 (1911).</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether "inefficiency" or "malfeasance" are terms as broad as "maladministration" in order to reject the dissent\'s position that removing the Comptroller General requires "a feat of bipartisanship more difficult than that required to impeach and convict."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#771">478 U. S. 771</a></span> (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Surely no one would seriously suggest that judicial independence would be strengthened by allowing removal of federal judges only by a joint resolution finding "inefficiency," "neglect of duty," or "malfeasance."</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, however, assures us that "[r]ealistic consideration" of the "practical result of the removal provision," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#773">478 U. S. 773</a></span>, 774, reveals that the Comptroller General is unlikely to be removed by Congress.  The separated powers of our Government cannot be permitted to turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exercising executive power is on good terms with Congress.  The Framers recognized that, in the long-term, structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.  In constitutional terms, the removal powers over the Comptroller General\'s office dictate that he will be subservient to Congress.</p>\n<p>This much said, we must also add that the dissent is simply in error to suggest that the political realities reveal that the Comptroller General is free from influence by Congress.  The Comptroller General heads the General Accounting Office (GAO), "an instrumentality of the United States Government independent of the executive departments," 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 702(a), which was created by Congress in 1921 as part of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 23.  Congress created the office because it believed that it "needed an officer, responsible to it alone, to check upon the application of public funds in accordance with appropriations."  H. Mansfield, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="731">Page 478 U. S. 731</a></p><p> The Comptroller General:  A Study in the Law and Practice of Financial Administration 65 (1939).</p>\n<p>It is clear that Congress has consistently viewed the Comptroller General as an officer of the Legislative Branch.  The Reorganization Acts of 1945 and 1949, for example, both stated that the Comptroller General and the GAO are "a part of the legislative branch of the Government."  59 Stat. 616; 63 Stat. 205.  Similarly, in the Accounting and Auditing Act of 1950, Congress required the Comptroller General to conduct audits "as an agent of the Congress."  64 Stat. 835.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the Comptrollers General have also viewed themselves as part of the Legislative Branch.  In one of the early Annual Reports of Comptroller General, the official seal of his office was described as reflecting</p>\n<p>"the independence of judgment to be exercised by the General Accounting Office, subject to the control of the legislative branch. . . .  The combination represents an agency of the Congress independent of other authority auditing and checking the expenditures of the Government as required by law and subjecting any questions arising in that connection to quasijudicial determination."</p>\n<p>GAO Ann. Rep. 5-6 (1924).  Later, Comptroller General Warren, who had been a Member of Congress for 15 years before being appointed Comptroller General, testified:</p>\n<p>"During most of my public life, . . . I have been a member of the legislative branch.  Even now, although heading a great agency, it is an agency of the Congress, and <em>I am an agent of the Congress.</em>"</p>\n<p>To Provide for Reorganizing of Agencies of the Government:  Hearings on H.R. 3325 before the House Committee on Expenditures, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 69 (1945) (emphasis added).  And, in one conflict during Comptroller General McCarl\'s tenure, he asserted his independence of the Executive Branch, stating:</p>\n<p>"Congress . . . is . . . the only authority to which there lies an appeal from the decision of this office. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="732">Page 478 U. S. 732</a></p><p></p>\n<p>". . .  I may not accept the opinion of any official, inclusive of the Attorney General, as controlling my duty under the law."</p>\n<p>2 Comp.Gen. 784, 786-787 (1923) (disregarding conclusion of the Attorney General, 33 Op.Atty.Gen. 476 (1923), with respect to interpretation of compensation statute).</p>\n<p>Against this background, we see no escape from the conclusion that, because Congress has retained removal authority over the Comptroller General, he may not be entrusted with executive powers.  The remaining question is whether the Comptroller General has been assigned such powers in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>The primary responsibility of the Comptroller General under the instant Act is the preparation of a "report."  This report must contain detailed estimates of projected federal revenues and expenditures.  The report must also specify the reductions, if any, necessary to reduce the deficit to the target for the appropriate fiscal year.  The reductions must be set forth on a program-by-program basis.</p>\n<p>In preparing the report, the Comptroller General is to have "due regard" for the estimates and reductions set forth in a joint report submitted to him by the Director of CBO and the Director of OMB, the President\'s fiscal and budgetary adviser.  However, the Act plainly contemplates that the Comptroller General will exercise his independent judgment and evaluation with respect to those estimates.  The Act also provides that the Comptroller General\'s report "shall explain fully any differences between the contents of such report and the report of the Directors."  \xc2\xa7 251(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Appellants suggest that the duties assigned to the Comptroller General in the Act are essentially ministerial and mechanical, so that their performance does not constitute "execution of the law" in a meaningful sense.  On the contrary, we view these functions as plainly entailing execution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="733">Page 478 U. S. 733</a></p><p> of the law in constitutional terms.  Interpreting a law enacted by Congress to implement the legislative mandate is the very essence of "execution" of the law.  Under \xc2\xa7 251, the Comptroller General must exercise judgment concerning facts that affect the application of the Act.  He must also interpret the provisions of the Act to determine precisely what budgetary calculations are required.  Decisions of that kind are typically made by officers charged with executing a statute.</p>\n<p>The executive nature of the Comptroller General\'s functions under the Act is revealed in \xc2\xa7 252(a)(3), which gives the Comptroller General the ultimate authority to determine the budget cuts to be made.  Indeed, the Comptroller General commands the President himself to carry out, without the slightest variation (with exceptions not relevant to the constitutional issues presented), the directive of the Comptroller General as to the budget reductions:</p>\n<p>"The [Presidential] order <em>must provide</em> for reductions in the manner specified in section 251(a)(3), <em>must incorporate</em> the provisions of the [Comptroller General\'s] report submitted under section 251(b), and <em>must be consistent with such report in all respects.</em>  The President <em>may not modify or recalculate any of the estimates, determinations, specifications, bases, amounts, or percentages</em> set forth in the report submitted under section 251(b) in determining the reductions to be specified in the order with respect to programs, projects, and activities, or with respect to budget activities, within an account. . . ."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 252(a)(3) (emphasis added).  <em>See also</em> \xc2\xa7 251(d)(3)(A).</p>\n<p>Congress, of course, initially determined the content of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, and undoubtedly the content of the Act determines the nature of the executive duty.  However, as <em>Chadha</em> makes clear, once Congress makes its choice in enacting legislation, its participation ends.  Congress can thereafter control the execution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="734">Page 478 U. S. 734</a></p><p> of its enactment only indirectly -- by passing new legislation.  <em>Chadha,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#958">462 U. S. 958</a></span>.  By placing the responsibility for execution of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act in the hands of an officer who is subject to removal only by itself, Congress, in effect, has retained control over the execution of the Act, and has intruded into the executive function.  The Constitution does not permit such intrusion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>We now turn to the final issue of remedy.  Appellants urge that, rather than striking down \xc2\xa7 251 and invalidating the significant power Congress vested in the Comptroller General to meet a national fiscal emergency, we should take the lesser course of nullifying the statutory provisions of the 1921 Act that authorizes Congress to remove the Comptroller General.  At oral argument, counsel for the Comptroller General suggested that this might make the Comptroller General removable by the President.  All appellants urge that Congress would prefer invalidation of the removal provisions, rather than invalidation of \xc2\xa7 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.</p>\n<p>Severance at this late date of the removal provisions enacted 65 years ago would significantly alter the Comptroller General\'s office, possibly by making him subservient to the Executive Branch.  Recasting the Comptroller General as an officer of the Executive Branch would, accordingly, alter the balance that Congress had in mind in drafting the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, to say nothing of the wide array of other tasks and duties Congress has assigned the Comptroller General in other statutes. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Thus, appellants\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="735">Page 478 U. S. 735</a></p><p> argument would require this Court to undertake a weighing of the importance Congress attached to the removal provisions in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as well as in other subsequent enactments, against the importance it placed on the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.</p>\n<p>Fortunately this is a thicket we need not enter.  The language of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act itself settles the issue.  In \xc2\xa7 274(f), Congress has explicitly provided "fallback" provisions in the Act that take effect "[i]n the event . . . <em>any</em> of the reporting procedures described in section 251 are invalidated."  \xc2\xa7 274(f)(1) (emphasis added).  The fallback provisions are "<em>fully operative as a law,\'" <em>Buckley v. Valeo,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#108">424 U. S. 108</a></span> (quoting <em>Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm\'n of Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/210/case.html">286 U.

Assuming that appellants are correct in urging that this matter must be resolved on the basis of congressional intent, the intent appears to have been for \xc2\xa7 274(f) to be given effect in this situation.  Indeed, striking the removal provisions would lead to a statute that Congress would probably have refused to adopt.  As the District Court concluded:\n</em></p>\n<p>"[T]he grant of authority to the Comptroller General was a carefully considered protection against what the House conceived to be the pro-executive bias of the OMB.  It is doubtful that the automatic deficit reduction process would have passed without such protection, and doubtful that the protection would have been considered present if the Comptroller General were not removable by Congress itself. . . ."</p>\n<p>626 F.Supp. at 1394.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="736">Page 478 U. S. 736</a></p><p> Accordingly, rather than perform the type of creative and imaginative statutory surgery urged by appellants, our holding simply permits the fallback provisions to come into play. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>VII</h3><p></p>\n<p>No one can doubt that Congress and the President are confronted with fiscal and economic problems of unprecedented magnitude, but</p>\n<p>"the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.  Convenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives -- or the hallmarks -- of democratic government. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Chadha, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#944">462 U.

The statutes establishing independent agencies typically specify either that the agency members are removable by the President for specified causes, <em>see, e.g.,</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 41 (members of the Federal Trade Commission may be removed by the President "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office"), or else do not specify a removal procedure, <em>see, e.g.,</em> 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 437c (Federal Election Commission).  This case involves nothing like these statutes, but rather a statute that provides for direct congressional involvement over the decision to remove the Comptroller General.

I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="737">Page 478 U. S. 737</a></p><p> agree with the Court that the "Gramm-Rudman-Hollings" Act contains a constitutional infirmity so severe that the flawed provision may not stand.  I disagree with the Court, however, on the reasons why the Constitution prohibits the Comptroller General from exercising the powers assigned to him by \xc2\xa7 251(b) and \xc2\xa7 251(c)(2) of the Act.  It is not the dormant, carefully circumscribed congressional removal power that represents the primary constitutional evil.  Nor do I agree with the conclusion of both the majority and the dissent that the analysis depends on a labeling of the functions assigned to the Comptroller General as "executive powers."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#732">478 U. S. 732</a></span>-734; <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#764">478 U. S. 764</a></span>-765.  Rather, I am convinced that the Comptroller General must be characterized as an agent of Congress because of his longstanding statutory responsibilities; that the powers assigned to him under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act require him to make policy that will bind the Nation; and that, when Congress, or a component or an agent of Congress seeks to make policy that will bind the Nation, it must follow the procedures mandated by Article I of the Constitution -- through passage by both Houses and presentment to the President.  In short, Congress may not exercise its fundamental power to formulate national policy by delegating that power to one of its two Houses, to a legislative committee, or to an individual agent of the Congress such as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, or the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.  <em>INS v. Chadha,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a></span> (1983).  That principle, I believe, is applicable to the Comptroller General.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The fact that Congress retained for itself the power to remove the Comptroller General is important evidence supporting the conclusion that he is a member of the Legislative Branch of the Government.  Unlike the Court, however, I am not persuaded that the congressional removal power is either a necessary or a sufficient basis for concluding that his statutory assignment is invalid. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="738">Page 478 U. S. 738</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As JUSTICE WHITE explains, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">478 U. S. 770</span>-771, Congress does not have the power to remove the Comptroller General at will, or because of disagreement with any policy determination that he may be required to make in the administration of this or any other Act.  The statute provides a term of 15 years for the Comptroller General; it further provides that he must retire upon becoming 70 years of age, and that he may be removed at any time by impeachment or by</p>\n<p>"joint resolution of Congress, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, only for -- (i) permanent disability; (ii) inefficiency; (iii) neglect of duty; (iv) malfeasance; or (v) a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude."</p>\n<p>31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 703(e)(1)(B).  Far from assuming that this provision creates a "<em>here-and-now subservience\'" respecting all of the Comptroller General\'s actions, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#727">478 U. S. 727</a></span>, n. 5 (quoting District Court), we should presume that Congress will adhere to the law -- that it would only exercise its removal powers if the Comptroller General were found to be permanently disabled inefficient, neglectful, or culpable of malfeasance, a felony, or conduct involving moral turpitude. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="739">Page 478 U. S. 739</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The notion that the removal power at issue here automatically creates some kind of "here-and-now subservience" of the Comptroller General to Congress is belied by history.  There is no evidence that Congress has ever removed, or threatened to remove, the Comptroller General for reasons of policy.  Moreover, the President has long possessed a comparable power to remove members of the Federal Trade Commission, yet it is universally accepted that they are independent of, rather than subservient to, the President in performing their official duties.  Thus, the statute that the Court construed in <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span> (1935), provided:</p>\n<p>"Any commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."</p>\n<p>38 Stat. 718.  In upholding the congressional limitations on the President\'s power of removal, the Court stressed the independence of the Commission from the President. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  There was no suggestion that the retained Presidential removal powers -- similar to those at issue here -- created a subservience to the President. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="740">Page 478 U. S. 740</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To be sure, there may be a significant separation of powers difference between the President\'s exercise of carefully circumscribed removal authority and Congress\' exercise of identically circumscribed removal authority.  But the <em>Humphrey\'s Executor</em> analysis at least demonstrates that it is entirely proper for Congress to specify the qualifications for an office that it has created, and that the prescription of what might be termed "dereliction of duty" removal standards does not itself impair the independence of the official subject to such standards. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The fact that Congress retained for itself the power to remove the Comptroller General thus not necessarily an adequate reason for concluding that his role in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget reduction process is unconstitutional.  It is however, a fact that lends support to my ultimate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 478 U. S. 741</a></p><p> conclusion that, in exercising his functions under this Act, he serves as an agent of the Congress.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In assessing the role of the Comptroller General, it is appropriate to consider his already existing statutory responsibilities.  Those responsibilities leave little doubt that one of the identifying characteristics of the Comptroller General is his statutorily required relationship to the Legislative Branch.</p>\n<p>In the statutory section that identifies the Comptroller General\'s responsibilities for investigating the use of public money, four of the five enumerated duties specifically describe an obligation owed to Congress.  The first is the only one that does not expressly refer to Congress: The Comptroller General shall "investigate all matters related to the receipt, disbursement, and use of public money."  31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 712(1).  The other four clearly require the Comptroller General to work with Congress\' specific needs as his legal duty.  Thus, the Comptroller General must</p>\n<p>"estimate the cost to the United States Government of complying with each restriction on expenditures of a specific appropriation in a general appropriation law <em>and report each estimate to Congress with recommendations</em> the Comptroller General considers desirable."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 712(2) (emphasis added).  He must</p>\n<p>"analyze expenditures of each executive agency the Comptroller General believes <em>will help Congress decide</em> whether public money has been used and expended economically and efficiently."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 712(3) (emphasis added).  He must</p>\n<p>"make an investigation and report <em>ordered by either House of Congress or a committee of Congress</em> having jurisdiction over revenue, appropriations, or expenditures."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 712(4) (emphasis added).  Finally, he must "give a <em>committee of Congress</em> having jurisdiction over revenue, appropriations, or expenditures the help and information the committee requests."  \xc2\xa7 712(5) (emphasis added). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="742">Page 478 U. S. 742</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The statutory provision detailing the Comptroller General\'s role in evaluating programs and activities of the United States Government similarly leaves no doubt regarding the beneficiary of the Comptroller General\'s labors.  The Comptroller General may undertake such an evaluation for one of three specified reasons:  (1) on his own initiative; (2) "when either House of Congress orders an evaluation"; or (3) "when a committee of Congress with jurisdiction over the program or activity requests the evaluation."  31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 717(b).  In assessing a program or activity, moreover, the Comptroller General\'s responsibility is to "develop and recommend <em>to Congress</em> ways to evaluate a program or activity the Government carries out under existing law."  \xc2\xa7 717(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Comptroller General\'s responsibilities are repeatedly framed in terms of his specific obligations to Congress.  Thus, one provision specifies in some detail the obligations of the Comptroller General with respect to an individual committee\'s request for a program evaluation:</p>\n<p>"On request of a committee of Congress, the Comptroller General shall help the committee to -- "</p>\n<p>"(A) develop a statement of legislative goals and ways to assess and report program performance related to the goals, including recommended ways to assess performance, information to be reported, responsibility for reporting, frequency of reports, and feasibility of pilot testing; and"</p>\n<p>"(B) assess program evaluations prepared by and for an agency."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 717(d)(1).  Similarly, another provision requires that, on</p>\n<p>"request of a member of Congress, the Comptroller General shall give the member a copy of the material the Comptroller General compiles in carrying out this subsection that has been released by the committee for which the material was compiled."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 717(d)(2). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 478 U. S. 743</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Numerous other provisions strongly support the conclusion that one of the Comptroller General\'s primary responsibilities is to work specifically on behalf of Congress.  The Comptroller General must make annual reports on specified subjects to Congress. to the Senate Committee on Finance, to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, to the House Committee on Ways and Means, to the House Committee on Government Operations, and to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 719(a), (d).  On request of a committee, the Comptroller General</p>\n<p>"shall explain to and discuss with the committee or committee staff a report the Comptroller General makes that would help the committee (1) evaluate a program or activity of an agency within the jurisdiction of the committee; or (2) in its consideration of proposed legislation."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 719(i).  Indeed, the relationship between the Comptroller General and Congress is so close that the</p>\n<p>"Comptroller General may assign or detail an officer or employee of the General Accounting Office to full-time continuous duty with a committee of Congress for not more than one year."</p>\n<p>31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 734(a).</p>\n<p>The Comptroller General\'s current statutory responsibilities on behalf of Congress are fully consistent with the historic conception of the Comptroller General\'s office.  The statute that created the Comptroller General\'s office -- the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 -- provided that four of the five statutory responsibilities given to the Comptroller General be exercised on behalf of Congress, three of them exclusively so. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  On at least three occasions since 1921, moreover, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 478 U. S. 744</a></p><p> in considering the structure of Government.  Congress has defined the Comptroller General as being a part of the Legislative Branch.  In the Reorganization Act of 1945, Congress specified that the Comptroller General and the General Accounting Office "are a part of the legislative branch of the Government."  59 Stat. 616. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In the Reorganization Act of 1949, Congress again confirmed that the Comptroller General and the General Accounting Office "are a part of the legislative branch of the Government."  63 Stat. 205. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Finally, in the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, Congress referred to the "auditing for the Government, conducted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="745">Page 478 U. S. 745</a></p><p> by the Comptroller General of the United States as an agent of the Congress."  64 Stat. 835.  Like the already existing statutory responsibilities, then, the history of the Comptroller General statute confirms that the Comptroller General should be viewed as an agent of the Congress.</p>\n<p>This is not to say, of course, that the Comptroller General has no obligations to the Executive Branch, or that he is an agent of the Congress in quite so clear a manner as the Doorkeeper of the House.  For the current statutory responsibilities also envision a role for the Comptroller General with respect to the Executive Branch.  The Comptroller General must "give the President information on expenditures and accounting the President requests."  31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 719(f).  Although the Comptroller General is required to provide Congress with an annual report, he is also required to provide the President with the report if the President so requires.  \xc2\xa7 719(a).  The Comptroller General is statutorily required to audit the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, and Firearms (and provide congressional committees with information respecting the audits).  \xc2\xa7 713.  In at least one respect, moreover, the Comptroller General is treated like an executive agency:  "To the extent applicable, all laws generally related to administering an agency apply to the Comptroller General."  \xc2\xa7 704(a).  Historically, as well, the Comptroller General has had some relationship to the Executive Branch.  As noted,  <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra,</em> in the 1921 Act, one of the Comptroller General\'s specific responsibilities was to provide information to the Bureau of the Budget.  In fact, when the Comptroller General\'s office was created, its functions, personnel, records, and even furniture derived from a previous executive office. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 478 U. S. 746</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus, the Comptroller General retains certain obligations with respect to the Executive Branch. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Obligations to two branches are not, however, impermissible, and the presence of such dual obligations does not prevent the characterization of the official with the dual obligations as part of one branch. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  It is at least clear that in most, if not all, of his statutory responsibilities, the Comptroller General is properly characterized as an agent of the Congress. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 478 U. S. 747</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Everyone agrees that the powers assigned to the Comptroller General by \xc2\xa7 251(b) and \xc2\xa7 251(c)(2) of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act are extremely important.  They require him to exercise sophisticated economic judgment concerning anticipated trends in the Nation\'s economy, projected </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 478 U. S. 748</a></p><p> levels of unemployment, interest rates, and the special problems that may be confronted by the many components of a vast federal bureaucracy.  His duties are anything but ministerial -- he is not merely a clerk wearing a "green eyeshade" as he undertakes these tasks.  Rather, he is vested with the kind of responsibilities that Congress has elected to discharge itself under the fallback provision that will become effective if and when \xc2\xa7 251(b) and \xc2\xa7 251(c)(2) are held invalid.  Unless we make the naive assumption that the economic destiny of the Nation could be safely entrusted to a mindless bank of computers, the powers that this Act vests in the Comptroller General must be recognized as having transcendent importance.

[<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  But, when that delegation is held invalid, the "fallback provision" provides that the report that would otherwise be issued by the Comptroller General shall be issued by Congress itself. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 478 U. S. 751</a></p><p> In the event that the resolution is enacted, the congressional report will have the same legal consequences as if it had been issued by the Comptroller General.  In that event, moreover, surely no one would suggest that Congress had acted in any capacity other than "legislative."  Since the District Court expressly recognized the validity of what it described as the "<em>fallback\' deficit reduction process," <em>Synar v. United States,</em> 626 F.Supp. 1374, 1377 (DC 1986), it obviously did not doubt the constitutionality of the performance by Congress of the functions delegated to the Comptroller General.\n</em></p>\n<p>Under the District Court\'s analysis, and the analysis adopted by the majority today, it would therefore appear that the function at issue is "executive" if performed by the Comptroller General, but "legislative" if performed by the Congress.  In my view, however, the function may appropriately </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 478 U. S. 752</a></p><p> be labeled "legislative" even if performed by the Comptroller General or by an executive agency.</p>\n<p>Despite the statement in Article I of the Constitution that "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States," it is far from novel to acknowledge that independent agencies do indeed exercise legislative powers.  As JUSTICE WHITE explained in his <em>Chadha</em> dissent, after reviewing our cases upholding broad delegations of legislative power:</p>\n<p>"[T]hese cases establish that, by virtue of congressional delegation, legislative power can be exercised by independent agencies and Executive departments without the passage of new legislation.  For some time, the sheer amount of law -- the substantive rules that regulate private conduct and direct the operation of government -- made by the agencies has far outnumbered the lawmaking engaged in by Congress through the traditional process.  There is no question but that agency rulemaking is lawmaking in any functional or realistic sense of the term.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 551(4), provides that a \'rule\' is an agency statement \'designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\'  When agencies are authorized to prescribe law through substantive rulemaking, the administrator\'s regulation is not only due deference, but is accorded \'legislative effect.\'  <em>See, e g., Schweiker v. Gray Panthers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/453/34/case.html">453 U. S. 34</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/453/34/case.html#43">453 U.

De la Cuesta,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/458/141/case.html">458 U. S. 141</a></span> (1982), and grant rights to and impose obligations on the public.

S. 753</a></p><p> termed "executive powers," or even that our inquiry is much advanced by using that term.  For, whatever the label given the functions to be performed by the Comptroller General under \xc2\xa7 251 -- or by the Congress under \xc2\xa7 274 -- the District Court had no difficulty in concluding that Congress could delegate the performance of those functions to another branch of the Government. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  If the delegation to a stranger is permissible, why may not Congress delegate the same responsibilities to one of its own agents?  That is the central question before us today.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Congress regularly delegates responsibility to a number of agents who provide important support for its legislative activities.  Many perform functions that could be characterized as "executive" in most contexts -- the Capitol Police can arrest and press charges against lawbreakers, the Sergeant at Arms manages the congressional payroll, the Capitol Architect maintains the buildings and grounds, and its Librarian has custody of a vast number of books and records.  Moreover, the Members themselves necessarily engage in many activities that are merely ancillary to their primary lawmaking </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 478 U. S. 754</a></p><p> responsibilities -- they manage their separate offices, they communicate with their constituents, they conduct hearings, they inform themselves about the problems confronting the Nation, and they make rules for the governance of their own business.  The responsibilities assigned to the Comptroller General in the case before us are, of course, quite different from these delegations and ancillary activities.</p>\n<p>The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act assigns to the Comptroller General the duty to make policy decisions that have the force of law.  The Comptroller General\'s report is, in the current statute, the engine that gives life to the ambitious budget reduction process.  It is the Comptroller General\'s report that "provide[s] for the determination of reductions" and that "contain[s] estimates, determinations, and specifications for all of the items contained in the report" submitted by the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.  \xc2\xa7 251(b).  It is the Comptroller General\'s report that the President must follow and that will have conclusive effect.  \xc2\xa7 252.  It is, in short, the Comptroller General\'s report that will have a profound, dramatic, and immediate impact on the Government and on the Nation at large.</p>\n<p>Article I of the Constitution specifies the procedures that Congress must follow when it makes policy that binds the Nation:  its legislation must be approved by both of its Houses and presented to the President.  In holding that an attempt to legislate by means of a "one-House veto" violated the procedural mandate in Article I, we explained:</p>\n<p>"We see therefore that the Framers were acutely conscious that the bicameral requirement and the Presentment Clauses would serve essential constitutional functions.  The President\'s participation in the legislative process was to protect the Executive Branch from Congress and to protect the whole people from improvident laws.  The division of the Congress into two distinctive bodies assures that the legislative power would be exercised </p><p><a class="page-number" name="755">Page 478 U. S. 755</a></p><p> only after opportunity for full study and debate in separate settings.  The President\'s unilateral veto power, in turn, was limited by the power of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress to overrule a veto, thereby precluding final arbitrary action of one person. . . .  It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative action in Art. I, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1, 7, represents the Framers\' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure."</p>\n<p><em>INS v. Chadha,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#951">462 U. S. 951</a></span>.

S. 959</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  That danger -- congressional action that evades constitutional restraints -- is not present when Congress delegates lawmaking power to the executive or to an independent agency. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>The distinction between the kinds of action that Congress may delegate to its own components and agents and those that require either compliance with Article I procedures or delegation to another branch pursuant to defined standards is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="756">Page 478 U. S. 756</a></p><p> reflected in the practices that have developed over the years regarding congressional resolutions.  The <em>joint</em> resolution, which is used for "special purposes and . . . incidental matters," 7 Deschler\'s Precedents of the House of Representatives 334 (1977), makes binding policy and "requires an affirmative vote by both Houses and submission to the President for approval," <em>id.</em> at 333 -- the full Article I requirements.  A <em>concurrent</em> resolution, in contrast, makes no binding policy; it is "a means of expressing fact, principles, opinions, and purposes of the two Houses," Jefferson\'s Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives 176 (1983), and thus does not need to be presented to the President.  It is settled, however, that, if a resolution is intended to make policy that will bind the Nation, and thus is "legislative in its character and effect," S.Rep. No. 1335, 54th Cong. .2d Sess., 8 (1897) -- then the full Article I requirements must be observed.  For "the nature or substance of the resolution, and not its form, controls the question of its disposition."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>In my opinion, Congress itself could not exercise the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings functions through a concurrent resolution.  The fact that the fallback provision in \xc2\xa7 274 requires a joint resolution, rather than a concurrent resolution, indicates that Congress endorsed this view. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  I think it equally clear that Congress may not simply delegate those functions to an agent such as the Congressional Budget Office.  Since I am persuaded that the Comptroller General is also fairly deemed to be an agent of Congress, he too cannot exercise such functions. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="757">Page 478 U. S. 757</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As a result, to decide this case, there is no need to consider the Decision of 1789, the President\'s removal power, or the abstract nature of "executive powers."  Once it is clear that the Comptroller General, whose statutory duties define him as an agent of Congress, has been assigned the task of making policy determinations that will bind the Nation, the question is simply one of congressional process.  There can be no doubt that the Comptroller General\'s statutory duties under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings do not follow the constitutionally prescribed procedures for congressional lawmaking. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, even though it is well settled that Congress may delegate legislative power to independent agencies or to the Executive, and thereby divest itself of a portion of its lawmaking power, when it elects to exercise such power itself, it may not authorize a lesser representative of the Legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="758">Page 478 U. S. 758</a></p><p> Branch to act on its behalf. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  It is for this reason that I believe \xc2\xa7 251(b) and \xc2\xa7 251(c)(2) of the Act are unconstitutional. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, the critical inquiry in this case concerns not the manner in which executive officials or agencies may act, but the manner in which Congress and its agents may act.  As we emphasized in <em>Chadha,</em> when Congress legislates, when it makes binding policy, it must follow the procedures prescribed in Article I.  Neither the unquestioned urgency of the national budget crisis nor the Comptroller General\'s proud record of professionalism and dedication provides a justification for allowing a congressional agent to set policy that binds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 478 U. S. 759</a></p><p> the Nation.  Rather than turning the task over to its agent, if the Legislative Branch decides to act with conclusive effect, it must do so through a process akin to that specified in the fallback provision -- through enactment by both Houses and presentment to the President.</p>\n<p>I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Just as it is "always appropriate to assume that our elected representatives, like other citizens, know the law," <em>Cannon v.

What I do say is that, when the condition imposed upon the creation of the office has no reasonable relation to the office; when it is not a legislative standard to be applied by the President, and is not the declaration of qualifications, but is the creation of an appointing power other than the President, then Congress has crossed the deadline, for it has usurped the prerogative of the President."</p>\n<p>272 U.S. at 96-97 [argument of counsel omitted from electronic version].</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In pertinent part, the 1921 Act provided:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 312(a).

S. 778</a></span>-779, n. 1 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting), it is quite obvious that the Comptroller General, and the General Accounting office, have a fundamentally different relationship with Congress than do independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.  Rather than an independent agency, the Comptroller General and the GAO are functionally equivalent to congressional agents such as the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Technology Assessment, and the Library of Congress\' Congressional Research Service.  As the statutory responsibilities make clear, like those congressional agents, the Comptroller General and the GAO function virtually as a permanent staff for Congress.  Indeed, in creating the Congressional Budget Office, Congress explicitly required that the GAO provide extensive services for the CBO -- a fact with some significance for this case.  The CBO statute enumerates the three "congressional agencies" that must provide assistance to the CBO:  "the General Accounting Office, the Library of Congress, and the Office of Technology Assessment."  2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 601(e).  These "congressional agencies" are authorized to provide the CBO with "services, facilities, and personnel with or without reimbursement," <em>ibid.,</em> as well as "information, data, estimates, and statistics."  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>See also</em> Congressional Quarterly\'s Guide to Congress 555 (3d ed.1982) ("In addition to their staffs, committees, facilities and privileges, members of Congress are backed by a number of other supporting organizations and activities that keep Capitol Hill running.  Among the largest of these in size of staff are the General Accounting Office (GAO), with about 5,200 employees; the Library of Congress\' Congressional Research Service (CRS), with 856; the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), with 218; and the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), with 130. . . .  To an extent, each of the four legislative agencies has its own specialized functions. . . .  Although each of the four agencies has been given its own task, their jobs overlap to some extent.  This has led in some cases to duplication and waste and even to competition among the different groups. . . .  The General Accounting Office is an arm of the legislative branch that was created to oversee the expenditures of the executive branch").</p>\n<p>Thus, to contend that the Comptroller General\'s numerous statutory responsibilities to serve Congress directly are somehow like an independent agency\'s obligations to report to Congress and to implement legislatively mandated standards simply misconceives the actual duties of the Comptroller General and the GAO.  It also ignores the clear import of the legislative history of these entities.  <em>See, e.g., Ameron, Inc. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,</em> 787 F.2d 875, 892-893 (CA3 1986) (Becker, J., concurring in part) ("Because the office of the Comptroller General is created by statute, the Comptroller General\'s status within the government is a matter of statutory interpretation which, like all statutory interpretation, is controlled by legislative intent. . . .  There is copious evidence in the legislative history that the GAO (and therefore the Comptroller General) was intended to be in the legislative branch. . . .  Because there is no legislative intent to the contrary, I believe that it is incumbent upon us to hold that the Comptroller General is within the legislative branch of government, despite the inconveniences that may attend such a holding").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>The element of judgment that the Comptroller General must exercise is evident by the congressional recognition that "there may be differences between the contents of [his] report and the report of the Directors" of the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget.  \xc2\xa7 251(b)(2).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/13" name="F2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>"Perhaps as a matter of political science we could say that Congress should only concern itself with broad principles of policy, and leave their application in particular cases to the executive branch.

Characteristically, the draftsmen of 1787 did not even attempt doctrinaire definitions, but placed their reliance in the mechanics of the Constitution.  One of their principal devices was to vest the legislative powers in the two Houses of Congress, and to make the President a part of the legislative process by requiring that all bills passed by the two Houses be submitted to him for his approval or disapproval, his disapproval or veto to be overridden only by a two-thirds vote of each House.

His suggestion is not faithful to the rationale of <em>Chadha,</em> because no component of Congress, not even one of its Houses, is subject to the "tight control" of the entire Congress.  For instance, the Congressional Research Service, whose primary function is to respond to congressional research requests, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 166, apparently would not fall within JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'s "tight control" test, because Congress has guaranteed the Service "complete research independence and the maximum practicable administrative independence consistent with these objectives."  \xc2\xa7 166(b)(2).  I take it, however, that few would doubt the unconstitutionality of assigning the functions at issue in this case to the Congressional Research Service.

The basis of the Court\'s action is a solitary provision of another statute that was passed over 60 years ago and has lain dormant since that time.  I cannot concur in the Court\'s action.  Like the Court, I will not purport to speak to the wisdom of the policies incorporated in the legislation the Court invalidates; that is a matter for the Congress and the Executive, both of which expressed their assent to the statute barely half a year ago.  I will, however, address the wisdom of the Court\'s willingness to interpose its distressingly formalistic view of separation of powers as a bar to the attainment of governmental objectives through the means chosen by the Congress and the President in the legislative process established by the Constitution.  Twice in the past four years I have expressed my view that the Court\'s recent efforts to police the separation of powers have rested on untenable constitutional propositions leading to regrettable results.  <em>See Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.

Today\'s result is even more misguided.  As I will explain, the Court\'s decision rests on a feature of the legislative scheme that is of minimal practical significance and that presents no substantial threat to the basic scheme of separation of powers.  In attaching dispositive significance to what should be regarded as a triviality, the Court neglects what has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 478 U.

I, \xc2\xa7 8, to vest authority that falls within the Court\'s definition of executive power in officers who are not subject to removal at will by the President, and are therefore not under the President\'s direct control.  <em>See, e.g., Humphrey\'s Executor v.

[<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  In an earlier day, in which simpler notions of the role of government in society prevailed, it was perhaps plausible to insist that all "executive" officers be subject to an unqualified Presidential removal power, <em>see Myers v.

II, \xc2\xa7 3, for any such duty is necessarily limited to a great extent by the content of the laws enacted by the Congress.  As Justice Holmes put it:</p>\n<p>"The duty of the President to see that the laws be executed is a duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to achieve more than Congress sees fit to leave within his power."</p>\n<p><em>Myers v.

[<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Justice Holmes perhaps overstated his case, for there are undoubtedly executive functions that, regardless of the enactments of Congress, must be performed by officers subject to removal at will by the President.  Whether a particular function falls within this class or within the far larger class that may be relegated to independent officers "will depend upon the character of the office."  <em>Humphrey\'s Executor, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#631">295 U.

S. 763</a></p><p> is, to be sure, not one that will beget easy answers; it provides nothing approaching a bright-line rule or set of rules.  Such an inquiry, however, is necessitated by the recognition that "formalistic and unbending rules" in the area of separation of powers may "unduly constrict Congress\' ability to take needed and innovative action pursuant to its Article I powers."  <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\'n v. Schor, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/833/case.html#851">478 U. S. 851</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is evident (and nothing in the Court\'s opinion is to the contrary) that the powers exercised by the Comptroller General under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act are not such that vesting them in an officer not subject to removal at will by the President would in itself improperly interfere with Presidential powers.  Determining the level of spending by the Federal Government is not, by nature, a function central either to the exercise of the President\'s enumerated powers or to his general duty to ensure execution of the laws; rather, appropriating funds is a peculiarly legislative function, and one expressly committed to Congress by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, which provides that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."  In enacting Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, Congress has chosen to exercise this legislative power to establish the level of federal spending by providing a detailed set of criteria for reducing expenditures below the level of appropriations in the event that certain conditions are met.  Delegating the execution of this legislation -- that is, the power to apply the Act\'s criteria and make the required calculations -- to an officer independent of the President\'s will does not deprive the President of any power that he would otherwise have or that is essential to the performance of the duties of his office.  Rather, the result of such a delegation, from the standpoint of the President, is no different from the result of more traditional forms of appropriation:  under either system, the level of funds available to the Executive Branch to carry out its duties is not within the President\'s discretionary control.  To be sure, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 478 U. S. 764</a></p><p> if the budget-cutting mechanism required the responsible officer to exercise a great deal of policymaking discretion, one might argue that, having created such broad discretion, Congress had some obligation based upon Art. II to vest it in the Chief Executive or his agents.  In Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, however, Congress has done no such thing; instead, it has created a precise and articulated set of criteria designed to minimize the degree of policy choice exercised by the officer executing the statute, and to ensure that the relative spending priorities established by Congress in the appropriations it passes into law remain unaltered. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Given that the exercise of policy choice by the officer executing the statute would be inimical to Congress\' goal in enacting "automatic" budget-cutting measures, it is eminently reasonable and proper for Congress to vest the budget-cutting authority in an officer who is, to the greatest degree possible, nonpartisan and independent of the President and his political agenda, and who therefore may be relied upon not to allow his calculations to be colored by political considerations.  Such a delegation deprives the President of no authority that is rightfully his.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>If, as the Court seems to agree, the assignment of "executive" powers under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to an officer not removable at will by the President would not, in itself, represent a violation of the constitutional scheme of separated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="765">Page 478 U. S. 765</a></p><p> powers, the question remains whether, as the Court concludes, the fact that the officer to whom Congress has delegated the authority to implement the Act is removable by a joint resolution of Congress should require invalidation of the Act.  The Court\'s decision, as I have stated above, is based on a syllogism:  the Act vests the Comptroller with "executive power"; such power may not be exercised by Congress or its agents; the Comptroller is an agent of Congress because he is removable by Congress; therefore the Act is invalid.  I have no quarrel with the proposition that the powers exercised by the Comptroller under the Act may be characterized as "executive" in that they involve the interpretation and carrying out of the Act\'s mandate.  I can also accept the general proposition that, although Congress has considerable authority in designating the officers who are to execute legislation, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#760">478 U. S. 760</a></span>-764, the constitutional scheme of separated powers does prevent Congress from reserving an executive role for itself or for its "agents."  <em>Buckley v. Valeo,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#120">424 U.

S. 267</a></span>-282 (WHITE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  I cannot accept, however, that the exercise of authority by an officer removable for cause by a joint resolution of Congress is analogous to the impermissible execution of the law by Congress itself, nor would I hold that the congressional role in the removal process renders the Comptroller an "agent" of the Congress, incapable of receiving "executive" power.</p>\n<p>In <em>Buckley v. Valeo, supra,</em> the Court held that Congress could not reserve to itself the power to appoint members of the Federal Election Commission, a body exercising "executive" power.  Buckley, however, was grounded on a textually based separation of powers argument whose central premise was that the Constitution requires that all "Officers of the United States" (defined as "all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government," 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#126">424 U. S. 126</a></span>) whose appointment is not otherwise specifically provided for elsewhere in its text be appointed through the means specified </p><p><a class="page-number" name="766">Page 478 U. S. 766</a></p><p> by the Appointments Clause, Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2 -- that is, either by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate or, if Congress so specifies, by the President alone, by the courts, or by the head of a department.  The Buckley Court treated the Appointments Clause as reflecting the principle that "the Legislative Branch may not exercise executive authority," 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#119">424 U. S. 119</a></span> (citing <em>Springer v. Philippine Islands,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/189/case.html">277 U. S. 189</a></span> (1928)), but the Court\'s holding was merely that Congress may not direct that its laws be implemented through persons who are its agents in the sense that it chose them; the Court did not pass on the legitimacy of other means by which Congress might exercise authority over those who execute its laws.  Because the Comptroller is not an appointee of Congress, but an officer of the United States appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, <em>Buckley</em> neither requires that he be characterized as an agent of the Congress nor in any other way calls into question his capacity to exercise "executive" authority.  <em>See</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#128">424 U.

S. 919</a></span> (1983), recognizes additional limits on the ability of Congress to participate in or influence the execution of the laws.  As interpreted in <em>Chadha,</em> the Constitution prevents Congress from interfering with the actions of officers of the United StateS through means short of legislation satisfying the demands of bicameral passage and presentment to the President for approval or disapproval.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#954">462 U.

Today\'s majority concludes that the same concerns that underlay <em>Chadha</em> indicate the invalidity of a statutory provision allowing the removal by joint resolution for specified cause of any officer performing executive functions.  Such removal power, the Court contends, constitutes a "congressional veto" analogous to that struck down in <em>Chadha,</em> for it permits Congress to "remove, or threaten to remove, an officer for executing the laws in any fashion found to be unsatisfactory."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#726">478 U.

First, the Court baldly mischaracterizes the removal provision when it suggests that it allows Congress to remove the Comptroller for "executing the laws in any fashion found to be unsatisfactory"; in fact, Congress may remove the Comptroller only for one or more of five specified reasons, which,</p>\n<p>"although not so narrow as to deny Congress any leeway, circumscribe Congress\' power to some extent by providing a basis for judicial review of congressional removal."</p>\n<p><em>Ameron, Inc. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,</em> 787 F.2d 875, 895 (CA3 1986) (Becker, J., concurring in part).  Second, and more to the point, the Court overlooks or deliberately ignores the decisive difference between the congressional removal provision and the legislative veto struck down in <em>Chadha:</em>  under the Budget and Accounting Act, Congress may remove the Comptroller only through a joint resolution, which, by definition, must be passed by both Houses and signed by the President.  <em>See United States v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/19/case.html">332 U. S. 19</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/19/case.html#28">332 U. S. 28</a></span> (1947). [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  In other words, a removal of the Comptroller under the statute <em>satisfies the requirements of bicameralism and presentment laid down in Chadha.</em>  The majority\'s citation of <em>Chadha</em> for the proposition that Congress may only control the acts of officers of the United States "by passing new legislation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#734">478 U.

I represent the principal assurances that Congress will remain within its legislative role in the constitutionally prescribed scheme of separated powers.  Action taken in accordance with the "single, finely wrought, and exhaustively considered, procedure" established by Art. I, <em>Chadha, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#951">462 U. S. 951</a></span>, should be presumptively viewed as a legitimate exercise of legislative power.  That such action may represent a more or less successful attempt by Congress to "control" the actions of an officer of the United States surely does not, in itself, indicate that it is unconstitutional, for no one would dispute that Congress has the power to "control" administration through legislation imposing duties or substantive restraints on executive officers, through legislation increasing or decreasing the funds made available to such officers, or through legislation actually abolishing a particular office.  Indeed, <em>Chadha</em> expressly recognizes that, while congressional meddling with administration of the laws outside of the legislative process is impermissible, congressional control over executive officers exercised through the legislative process is valid.  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#955">462 U. S. 955</a></span>, n.19.  Thus, if the existence of a statute permitting removal of the Comptroller through joint resolution (that is, through the legislative process) renders his exercise of executive powers unconstitutional, it is for reasons having virtually nothing to do with <em>Chadha.</em> [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 478 U. S. 769</a></p><p></p>\n<p>That a joint resolution removing the Comptroller General would satisfy the requirements for legitimate legislative action laid down in <em>Chadha</em> does not fully answer the separation-of-powers argument, for it is apparent that even the results of the constitutional legislative process may be unconstitutional if those results are, in fact, destructive of the scheme of separation of powers.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/425/case.html">Nixon v.

The question to be answered is whether the threat of removal of the Comptroller General for cause through joint resolution as authorized by the Budget and Accounting Act renders the Comptroller sufficiently subservient to Congress that investing him with "executive" power can be realistically equated with the unlawful retention of such power by Congress itself; more generally, the question is whether there is a genuine threat of "encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other," <em>Buckley v. Valeo,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#122">424 U. S. 122</a></span>.  Common sense indicates that the existence of the removal provision poses no such threat to the principle of separation of powers.</p>\n<p>The statute does not permit anyone to remove the Comptroller at will; removal is permitted only for specified cause, with the existence of cause to be determined by Congress following a hearing.  Any removal under the statute would presumably be subject to post-termination judicial review to ensure that a hearing had in fact been held and that the finding of cause for removal was not arbitrary.  <em>See Ameron, Inc. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,</em> 787 F.2d at 895 (Becker, J., concurring in part). [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  These procedural and substantive limitations on the removal power militate strongly against the characterization of the Comptroller as a mere agent of Congress by virtue of the removal authority.  Indeed, similarly qualified grants of removal power are generally deemed to protect the officers to whom they apply and to establish their independence from the domination of the possessor of the removal power.  <em>See Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> 295 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#625">295 U.

Removal authority limited in such a manner is more properly viewed as motivating adherence to a substantive standard established by law than as inducing subservience to the particular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 478 U. S. 771</a></p><p> institution that enforces that standard.  That the agent enforcing the standard is Congress may be of some significance to the Comptroller, but Congress\' substantively limited removal power will undoubtedly be less of a spur to subservience than Congress\' unquestionable and unqualified power to enact legislation reducing the Comptroller\'s salary, cutting the funds available to his department, reducing his personnel, limiting or expanding his duties, or even abolishing his position altogether.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the substantial role played by the President in the process of removal through joint resolution reduces to utter insignificance the possibility that the threat of removal will induce subservience to the Congress.  As I have pointed out above, a joint resolution must be presented to the President, and is ineffective if it is vetoed by him, unless the veto is overridden by the constitutionally prescribed two-thirds majority of both Houses of Congress.  The requirement of Presidential approval obviates the possibility that the Comptroller will perceive himself as so completely at the mercy of Congress that he will function as its tool. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  If the Comptroller\'s conduct in office is not so unsatisfactory to the President as to convince the latter that removal is required under the statutory standard, Congress will have no independent power to coerce the Comptroller unless it can muster a two-thirds majority in both Houses -- a feat of bipartisanship more difficult than that required to impeach and convict.  The incremental <em>in terrorem</em> effect of the possibility of congressional removal in the face of a Presidential </p><p><a class="page-number" name="772">Page 478 U. S. 772</a></p><p> veto is therefore exceedingly unlikely to have any discernible impact on the extent of congressional influence over the Comptroller.

S. 773</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The practical result of the removal provision is not to render the Comptroller unduly dependent upon or subservient to Congress, but to render him one of the most independent officers in the entire federal establishment.  Those who have studied the office agree that the procedural and substantive limits on the power of Congress and the President to remove the Comptroller make dislodging him against his will practically impossible.  As one scholar put it nearly 50 years ago:</p>\n<p>"Under the statute, the Comptroller General, once confirmed, is safe so long as he avoids a public exhibition of personal immorality, dishonesty, or failing mentality."</p>\n<p>H. Mansfield, The Comptroller General 75-76 (1939). [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  The passage of time has done little to cast doubt on this view:  of the six Comptrollers who have served since 1921, none has been threatened with, much less subjected to, removal.  Recent students of the office concur that,</p>\n<p>"[b]arring resignation, death, physical or mental incapacity, or extremely bad behavior, the Comptroller General is assured his tenure if he wants it, and not a day more."</p>\n<p>F. Mosher, The GAO 242 (1979).

The power over removal retained by the Congress is not a power that is exercised outside the legislative process as established by the Constitution, nor does it appear likely that it is a power that adds significantly to the influence Congress may exert over executive officers through other, undoubtedly constitutional exercises of legislative power and through the constitutionally guaranteed impeachment power.

S. 723</a></span>.  Reliance on such an unyielding principle to strike down a statute posing no real danger of aggrandizement of congressional power is extremely misguided and insensitive to our constitutional role.  The wisdom of vesting "executive" powers in an officer removable by joint resolution may indeed be debatable -- as may be the wisdom of the entire scheme of permitting an unelected official to revise the budget enacted by Congress -- but such matters are, for the most part, to be worked out between the Congress and the President through the legislative process, which affords each branch ample opportunity to defend its interests.  The Act vesting budget-cutting authority in the Comptroller General represents Congress\' judgment that the delegation of such authority to counteract ever-mounting deficits is "necessary and proper" to the exercise of the powers granted the Federal Government by the Constitution; and the President\'s approval of the statute signifies his unwillingness to reject the choice made by Congress.  <em>Cf. Nixon v. Administrator of General Services,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/425/case.html#441">433 U. S. 441</a></span>.  Under such circumstances, the role of this Court should be limited to determining whether the Act so alters the balance of authority among the branches of government as to pose a genuine threat to the basic division between the lawmaking power and the power to execute the law.

Because the majority does not address the delegation argument, I shall not discuss it at any length, other than to refer the reader to the District Court\'s persuasive demonstration that the statute is not void under the nondelegation doctrine.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/6" name="F3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The legislative history indicates that the inclusion of the President in the removal process was a deliberate choice on the part of the Congress that enacted the Budget and Accounting Act.  The previous year, legislation establishing the position of Comptroller General and providing for removal by <em>concurrent</em> resolution -- that is, by a resolution not presented to the President -- had been vetoed by President Wilson on the ground that granting the sole power of removal to the Congress would be unconstitutional.  <em>See</em> 59 Cong.Rec. 8609-8610 (1920).  That Congress responded by providing for removal through joint resolution clearly evinces congressional intent that removal take place only through the legislative process, with Presidential participation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Because a joint resolution passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President (or repassed over the President\'s Veto) is legislation having the same force as any other Act of Congress, it is somewhat mysterious why the Court focuses on the Budget and Accounting Act\'s authorization of removal of the Comptroller through such a resolution as an indicator that the Comptroller may not be vested with executive powers.  After all, even without such prior statutory authorization, Congress could pass, and the President sign, a joint resolution purporting to remove the Comptroller, and the validity of such legislation would seem in no way dependent on previous legislation contemplating it.  Surely the fact that Congress might at any time pass, and the President sign, legislation purporting to remove some officer of the United States does not make the exercise of executive power by all such officers unconstitutional.  Since the effect of the Budget and Accounting Act is merely to recognize the possibility of legislation that Congress might at any time attempt to enact with respect to any executive officer, it should not make the exercise of "executive" power by the Comptroller any more problematic than the exercise of such power by any other officer.  A joint resolution purporting to remove the Comptroller, or any other executive officer, might be constitutionally infirm, but Congress\' advance assertion of the power to enact such legislation seems irrelevant to the question whether exercise of authority by an officer who might in the future be subject to such a possibly valid and possibly invalid resolution is permissible, since the provision contemplating a resolution of removal obviously cannot in any way add to Congress\' power to enact such a resolution.</p>\n<p>Of course, the foregoing analysis does not imply that the removal provision of the Budget and Accounting Act is meaningless; for although that provision cannot <em>add to</em> any power Congress might have to pass legislation (that is, a joint resolution) removing the Comptroller, it can <em>limit</em> its power to do so to the circumstances specified.  The reason for this is that any joint resolution purporting to remove the Comptroller in the absence of a hearing or one of the specified grounds for removal would not be deemed an implied repeal of the limits on removal in the 1921 Act (for such implied repeals are disfavored), and thus the joint resolution would only be given effect to the extent consistent with the preexisting law (that is, to the extent that there was actually cause for removal).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/8" name="F3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf. Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U.

S. 728</a></span>.  The Court\'s scholarship, however, is faulty:  at the time all of these statements were made -- including Representative Sisson\'s statement of May 3, 1921 -- the proposed legislation provided for removal by concurrent resolution, with no Presidential role.  <em>See</em> 61 Cong.Rec. 983, 989-992, 1079-1085 (1921).\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/10" name="F3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Concededly, the substantive grounds for removal under the statute are broader than the grounds for impeachment specified by the Constitution, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#729">478 U. S. 729</a></span>-730, although, given that it is unclear whether the limits on the impeachment power may be policed by any body other than Congress itself, the practical significance of the difference is hard to gauge.  It seems to me most likely that the difficulty of obtaining a two-thirds vote for removal in both Houses would more than offset any increased likelihood of removal that might result from the greater liberality of the substantive grounds for removal under the statute.  And even if removal by Congress alone through joint resolution passed over Presidential veto is marginally more likely than impeachment, whatever additional influence over the Comptroller Congress may thereby possess seems likely to be minimal in relation to that which Congress already possesses by virtue of its general legislative powers and its power to impeach.  Of course, if it were demonstrable that the Constitution specifically limited Congress\' role in removal to the impeachment process, the insignificance of the marginal increase in congressional influence resulting from the provision authorizing removal through joint resolution would be no answer to a claim of unconstitutionality.  But no such limit appears in the Constitution:  the Constitution merely provides that all officers of the United States may be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and nowhere suggests that impeachment is the sole means of removing such officers.</p>\n<p>As for the Court\'s observation that</p>\n<p>"no one would seriously suggest that judicial independence would be strengthened by allowing removal of federal judges only by a joint resolution finding \'inefficiency,\' \'neglect of duty,\' or \'malfeasance,\'"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#730">478 U. S. 730</a></span>, it can only be described as a <em>non sequitur.</em>  The issue is not whether the removal provision makes the Comptroller more independent than he would be if he were removable only through impeachment, but whether the provision so weakens the Comptroller that he may not exercise executive authority.  Moreover, the Court\'s reference to standards applicable to removal of Art. III judges is a red herring, for Art. III judges -- unlike other officers of the United States -- are specifically protected against removal for other than constitutionally specified cause.  Thus, the infirmity of a statute purporting to allow removal of judges for some other reason would be that it violated the specific command of Art. III.  In the absence of a similar textual limit on the removal of nonjudicial officers, the test for a violation of separation of powers should be whether an asserted congressional power to remove would constitute a real and substantial aggrandizement of congressional authority at the expense of executive power, not whether a similar removal provision would appear problematic if applied to federal judges.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/11" name="F3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The author of this statement was no apologist for the Comptroller; rather, his study of the office is premised on the desirability of Presidential control over many of the Comptroller\'s functions.

Such meaningless labels are quite obviously irrelevant to the question whether in actuality the Comptroller is so subject to congressional domination that he may not participate in the execution of the laws.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, for his part, finds that the Comptroller is an "agent" of Congress, and thus incapable of wielding the authority granted him by the Act, because his responsibilities under a variety of statutes include making reports to the Congress.  JUSTICE STEVENS\' position is puzzling, to say the least.  It seems to rest on the view that an officer required to perform certain duties for the benefit of Congress somehow becomes a part of Congress for all purposes.  But it is by no means true that an officer who must perform specified duties for some other body is under that body\'s control or acts as its agent when carrying out other, unrelated duties.  As JUSTICE BLACKMUN points out, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#778">478 U. S. 778</a></span>-779, n. 1. duties toward Congress are imposed on a variety of agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission; and certainly it cannot credibly be maintained that, by virtue of those duties, the agencies become branches of Congress, incapable of wielding governmental power except through the legislative process.  Indeed, the President himself is under numerous obligations, both statutory and constitutional, to provide information to Congress, <em>see, e.g.,</em> Art. II, \xc2\xa7 3, cl. 1; surely the President is not thereby transformed into an arm or agency of the Congress.  If, therefore, as JUSTICE STEVENS concedes, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#737">478 U. S. 737</a></span>-741, the provision authorizing removal of the Comptroller by joint resolution does not suffice to establish that he may not exercise the authority granted him under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, I see no substantial basis for concluding that his various duties toward Congress render him incapable of receiving such power.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/14" name="F3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if I were to concede that the exercise of executive authority by the Comptroller is inconsistent with the removal provision, I would agree with JUSTICE BLACKMUN that striking down the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act vesting the Comptroller with such duties is a grossly inappropriate remedy for the supposed constitutional infirmity, and that, if one of the features of the statutory scheme must go, it should be the removal provision.  As JUSTICE BLACKMUN points out, the mere fact that the parties before the Court have standing only to seek invalidation of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings spending limits cannot dictate that the Court resolve any constitutional incompatibility by striking down Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.  Nor does the existence of the fallback provisions in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings indicate the appropriateness of the Court\'s choice, for those provisions, by their terms, go into effect only if the Court finds that the primary budget-cutting mechanism established by the Act must be invalidated; they by no means answer the antecedent question whether the Court should take that step.</p>\n<p>Given the majority\'s constitutional premises, it is clear to me that the decision whether to strike down Gramm-Rudman-Hollings must depend on whether such a choice would be more or less disruptive of congressional objectives than declaring the removal provision invalid (with the result that the Comptroller would still be protected against removal at will by the President, but could also not be removed through joint resolution).  When the choice is put in these terms, it is evident that it is the never-used removal provision that is far less central to the overall statutory scheme.  That this is so is underscored by the fact that, under the majority\'s theory, the removal provision was never constitutional, as the Comptroller\'s primary duties under the 1921 Act were clearly executive under the Court\'s definition:  the Comptroller\'s most important tasks under that legislation were to dictate accounting techniques for all executive agencies, to audit all federal expenditures, and to approve or disapprove disbursement of funds.  <em>See</em> F. Mosher, The GAO (1979).  Surely the Congress in 1921 would have sacrificed its own role in removal rather than allow such duties to go unfulfilled by a Comptroller independent of the President.  <em>See</em> 59 Cong.Rec. 8611 (1920).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court may be correct when it says that Congress cannot constitutionally exercise removal authority over an official vested with the budget-reduction powers that \xc2\xa7 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="777">Page 478 U.

This, however, is not because "the removal powers over the Comptroller General\'s office dictate that he will be subservient to Congress," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#730">478 U. S. 730</a></span>; I agree with JUSTICE WHITE that any such claim is unrealistic.  Furthermore, I think it is clear under <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span> (1935), that "executive" powers of the kind delegated to the Comptroller General under the Deficit Control Act need not be exercised by an officer who serves at the President\'s pleasure; Congress certainly could prescribe the standards and procedures for removing the Comptroller General.  But it seems to me that an attempt by Congress to participate <em>directly</em> in the removal of an executive officer -- other than through the constitutionally prescribed procedure of impeachment -- might well violate the principle of separation of powers by assuming for Congress part of the President\'s constitutional responsibility to carry out the laws.</p>\n<p>In my view, however, that important and difficult question need not be decided in this litigation, because, no matter how it is resolved, the plaintiffs, now appellees, are not entitled to the relief they have requested.  Appellees have not sought invalidation of the 1921 provision that authorizes Congress to remove the Comptroller General by joint resolution; indeed, it is far from clear they would have standing to request such a judgment.  The only relief sought in this case is nullification of the automatic budget-reduction provisions of the Deficit Control Act, and that relief should not be awarded even if the Court is correct that those provisions are constitutionally incompatible with Congress\' authority to remove the Comptroller General by joint resolution.  Any incompatibility, I feel, should be cured by refusing to allow congressional removal -- if it ever is attempted -- and not by striking down the central provisions of the Deficit Control Act.  However wise or foolish it may be, that statute unquestionably ranks among the most important federal enactments of the past several </p><p><a class="page-number" name="778">Page 478 U. S. 778</a></p><p> decades.  I cannot see the sense of invalidating legislation of this magnitude in order to preserve a cumbersome, 65-year-old removal power that has never been exercised and appears to have been all but forgotten until this litigation. [<a href="#F4/1" name="T4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 478 U. S. 779</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The District Court believed it had no choice in this matter.  Once it concluded that the Comptroller General\'s functions under the Deficit Control Act were constitutionally incompatible with the 1921 removal provision, the District Court considered itself bound as a matter of orderly judicial procedure to set aside the statute challenged by the plaintiffs.  <em>See Synar v. United States,</em> 626 F.Supp. 1374, 1393 (DC 1986).  The majority today does not take this view, and I believe it is untenable.</p>\n<p>Under the District Court\'s approach, everything depends on who first files suit.  Because Representative Synar and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="780">Page 478 U. S. 780</a></p><p> the plaintiffs who later joined him in this case objected to budget cuts made pursuant to the Deficit Control Act, the District Court struck down that statute, while retaining the 1921 removal provision.  But if the Comptroller General had filed suit 15 minutes before the Congressman did, seeking a declaratory judgment that the 1921 removal power could not constitutionally be exercised in light of the duties delegated to the Comptroller General in 1985, the removal provision presumably would have been invalidated, and the Deficit Control Act would have survived intact.  Momentous issues of public law should not be decided in so arbitrary a fashion.  In my view, the only sensible way to choose between two conjunctively unconstitutional statutory provisions is to determine which provision can be invalidated with the least disruption of congressional objectives.</p>\n<p>The District Court apparently thought differently in large part because it believed this Court had never undertaken such analysis in the past; instead, according to the District Court, this Court has "set aside that statute which either allegedly prohibits or allegedly authorizes the injury-in-fact that confers standing upon the plaintiff."  626 F.Supp. at 1393.  But none of the four cases the District Court cited for this proposition discussed the problem of choice of remedy, and in none of them could a strong argument have been made that invalidating the other of the inconsistent statutory provisions would have interfered less substantially with legislative goals or have been less disruptive of governmental operations. [<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 478 U. S. 781</a></p><p></p>\n<p>More importantly, the District Court ignored what appears to be the only separation of powers case in which this Court did expressly consider the question as to which of two incompatible statutes to invalidate:  <em>Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html">370 U. S. 530</a></span> (1962).  The petitioners in that case had received unfavorable rulings from judges assigned to temporary duty in the District Court or Court of Appeals from the Court of Claims or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals; they argued that those rulings should be set aside because the judges from the specialized courts did not enjoy the tenure and compensation guaranteed by Article III of the Constitution.  Before the assignments, Congress had pronounced the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be Article III courts, implying that judges on those courts were entitled to Article III benefits.  Older statutes, however, gave both courts authority to issue advisory opinions, an authority incompatible with Article III status.  <em>Glidden</em> held that the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals were indeed Article III tribunals.  With respect to the advisory opinion jurisdiction, Justice Harlan\'s opinion for the plurality noted:  "The overwhelming majority of the Court of Claims\' business is composed of cases and controversies."  370 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html#583">370 U. S. 583</a></span>.  Since </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 478 U. S. 782</a></p><p> "it would be . . . perverse to make the status of these courts turn upon so minuscule a portion of their purported functions," Justice Harlan reasoned that, "if necessary, the particular offensive jurisdiction, and not the courts, would fall."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Justice Clark\'s opinion concurring in the result for himself and the Chief Justice similarly concluded that the "minuscule" advisory opinion jurisdiction of the courts in question would have to bow to the Article III status clearly proclaimed by Congress, and not vice versa.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html#587">370 U. S. 587</a></span>-589.</p>\n<p>The Court thus recognized in <em>Glidden</em> that it makes no sense to resolve the constitutional incompatibility between two statutory provisions simply by striking down whichever provision happens to be challenged first.  A similar recognition has underlain the Court\'s approach in equal protection cases concerning statutes that create unconstitutionally circumscribed groups of beneficiaries.  The Court has noted repeatedly that such a defect may be remedied in either of two ways:  the statute may be nullified or its benefits may be extended to the excluded class.  <em>See, e.g., Heckler v. Mathews,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/case.html">465 U. S. 728</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/case.html#738">465 U. S. 738</a></span> (1984); <em>Califano v.

S. 89</a></span> (1979).  Although extension is generally the preferred alternative, we have instructed lower courts choosing between the two remedies to</p>\n<p>"\'measure the intensity of [legislative] commitment to the residual policy and consider the degree of potential disruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as opposed to abrogation.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Heckler v. Mathews, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/case.html#739">465 U. S. 739</a></span>, n. 5, quoting <em>Welsh v.

Calculations of this kind are obviously more complicated when a court is faced with two different statutes, enacted decades apart, but <em>Glidden</em> indicates that even then the task is judicially manageable.  No matter how difficult it is to determine which remedy would less obstruct congressional objectives, surely we should make that determination as best we can, instead of leaving the selection to the litigants. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 478 U. S. 783</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Assuming that the Comptroller General\'s functions under \xc2\xa7 251 of the Deficit Control Act cannot be exercised by an official removable by joint resolution of Congress, we must determine whether legislative goals would be frustrated more by striking down \xc2\xa7 251 or by invalidating the 1921 removal provision.  That question is not answered by the "fallback" provisions of the 1985 Act, which take effect "[i]n the event that any of the reporting procedures described in section 251 [of the Act] are invalidated."  \xc2\xa7 274(f)(1), 99 Stat. 1100.  The question is whether the reporting procedures should be invalidated in the first place.  The fallback provisions simply make clear that Congress would prefer a watered-down version of the Deficit Control Act to none at all; they provide no evidence that Congress would rather settle for the watered-down version than surrender its statutory authority to remove the Comptroller General.  The legislative history of the Deficit Control Act contains no mention of the 1921 statute, and both Houses of Congress have argued in this Court that, if necessary, the removal provision should be invalidated, rather than \xc2\xa7 251.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellant United States Senate 31-43; Brief for Appellants Speaker and Bipartisan Leadership Group of United States House of Representatives 49; <em>accord,</em> Brief for Appellant Comptroller General 33-47.  To the extent that the absence of express fallback provisions in the 1921 statute signifies anything, it appears to signify only that, if the removal provision were invalidated, Congress preferred simply that the remainder of the statute should remain in effect without alteration. [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 478 U. S. 784</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In the absence of express statutory direction, I think it is plain that, as both Houses urge, invalidating the Comptroller General\'s functions under the Deficit Control Act would frustrate congressional objectives far more seriously than would refusing to allow Congress to exercise its removal authority under the 1921 law.  The majority suggests that the removal authority plays an important role in furthering Congress\' desire to keep the Comptroller General under its control.  But, as JUSTICE WHITE demonstrates, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">478 U. S. 770</span>-773, the removal provision serves feebly for such purposes, especially in comparison to other, more effective means of supervision at Congress\' disposal.  Unless Congress institutes impeachment proceedings -- a course all agree the Constitution would permit -- the 1921 law authorizes Congress to remove the Comptroller General only for specified cause, only after a hearing, and only by passing the procedural equivalent of a new public law.  Congress has never attempted to use this cumbersome procedure, and the Comptroller General has shown few signs of subservience. [<a href="#F4/4" name="T4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>]  If Congress in 1921 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 478 U. S. 785</a></p><p> wished to make the Comptroller General its lackey, it did a remarkably poor job.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there is little evidence that Congress as a whole was very concerned in 1921 -- much less in 1985 or during the intervening decades -- with its own ability to control the Comptroller General.  The Committee Reports on the 1921 Act and its predecessor bills strongly suggest that what was critical to the legislators was not the Comptroller General\'s subservience to Congress, but rather his independence from the President.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> H.R.Rep. No. 14, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 7-8 (1921); H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1044, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., 13 (1920); S.Rep. No. 524, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., 6-7 (1920); H.R.Rep. No. 362, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9 (1919).  The debates over the Deficit Control Act contain no suggestion that the Comptroller General was chosen for the tasks outlined in \xc2\xa7 251 because Congress thought it could count on him to do its will; instead, the Comptroller General appears to have been selected precisely because of his independence from both the Legislature and the Executive.  By assigning the reporting functions to the Comptroller General, rather than to the Congressional Budget Office or to the Office of Management and Budget, Congress sought to create "a wall . . . that takes these decisions out of the hands of the President <em>and the Congress.</em>"  131 Cong.Rec. 30865 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Gephardt) (emphasis added); <em>see also, e.g., id.</em> at 36089 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Weiss); <em>id.</em> at 36367 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Bedell).</p>\n<p>Of course, the Deficit Control Act was hardly the first statute to assign new functions to the Comptroller General; a good number of other duties have been delegated to the Comptroller General over the years.  But there is no reason to believe that, in effecting these earlier delegations, Congress relied any more heavily on the availability of the removal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 478 U. S. 786</a></p><p> provision than it did in passing the Deficit Control Act.  In the past, as in 1985, it is far more likely that Congress was concerned mainly with the Comptroller General\'s demonstrated political independence, and perhaps, to a lesser extent, with his long tradition of service to the Legislative Branch; neither of these characteristics depends to any significant extent on the ability of Congress to remove the Comptroller General without instituting impeachment proceedings.  Striking down the congressional removal provision might marginally frustrate the legislative expectations underlying some grants of authority to the Comptroller General, but surely to a lesser extent than would invalidation of \xc2\xa7 251 of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings -- along with all other "executive" powers delegated to the Comptroller General over the years. [<a href="#F4/5" name="T4/5">Footnote 4/5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 478 U. S. 787</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I do not claim that the 1921 removal provision is a piece of statutory deadwood utterly without contemporary significance.  But it comes close.  Rarely if ever invoked even for symbolic purposes, the removal provision certainly pales in importance beside the legislative scheme the Court strikes down today -- an extraordinarily far-reaching response to a deficit problem of unprecedented proportions.  Because I believe that the constitutional defect found by the Court cannot justify the remedy it has imposed, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>For the reasons identified by the District Court, I agree that the Deficit Control Act does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.  <em>See Synar v. United States,</em> 626 F.Supp. 1374, 1382-1391 (DC 1986).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS concludes that the delegation effected under \xc2\xa7 251 contravenes the holding of <em>INS v. Chadha,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a></span> (1983), that Congress may make law only "in conformity with the express procedures of the Constitution\'s prescription for legislative action:  passage by a majority of both Houses and presentment to the President."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#958">462 U. S. 958</a></span>.  I do not agree.  We made clear in <em>Chadha</em> that the bicameralism and presentation requirements prevented Congress from itself exercising legislative power through some kind of procedural shortcut, such as the one-House veto challenged in that case.  But we also made clear that our holding in no way questioned "Congress\' authority to delegate portions of its power to administrative agencies."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#953">462 U. S. 953</a></span>-954, n. 16.  We explained:</p>\n<p>"Executive action under legislatively delegated authority that might resemble \'legislative\' action in some respects is not subject to the approval of both Houses of Congress and the President, for the reason that the Constitution does not so require.  That kind of Executive action is always subject to check by the terms of the legislation that authorized it, and, if that authority is exceeded, it is open to judicial review, as well as the power of Congress to modify or revoke the authority entirely."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Although JUSTICE STEVENS seems to agree that the duties delegated to the Comptroller General under \xc2\xa7 251 could be assigned constitutionally to an independent administrative agency, he argues that Congress may not give these duties "to one of its own agents."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#752">478 U. S. 752</a></span>-753.   He explains that the Comptroller General fits this description because "most" of his statutory responsibilities require him to provide services to Congress, and because Congress has repeatedly referred to the Comptroller General as part of the Legislative Branch.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#741">478 U. S. 741</a></span>-746.  "If Congress were free to delegate its policymaking authority" to such an officer, JUSTICE STEVENS contends that "it would be able to evade <em>the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the Constitution.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#755">478 U.

In his view, "[t]hat danger -- congressional action that evades constitutional restraints -- is not present when Congress delegates lawmaking power to the executive or to an independent agency."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#755">478 U. S. 755</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>I do not think that danger is present here, either.  The Comptroller General is not Congress, nor is he a part of Congress; "irrespective of Congress\' designation," he is an officer of the United States, appointed by the President.  <em>Buckley v. Valeo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html">424 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#128">424 U. S. 128</a></span>, n. 165 (1976).  In this respect, the Comptroller General differs critically from, for example, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, who is appointed by Congress, <em>see</em> 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 601(a)(2), and hence may not "exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States," <em>Buckley v. Valeo, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#126">424 U. S. 126</a></span>; <em>see</em> U.S.Const., Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2.  The exercise of rulemaking authority by an independent agency such as the Federal Trade Commission does not offend <em>Chadha,</em> even though the Commission could be described as an "agent" of Congress because it "carr[ies] into effect legislative policies embodied in the statute in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed."  <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U.

I do not see why the danger of "congressional action that evades constitutional restraints" becomes any more pronounced when a statute delegates power to a Presidentially appointed agent whose primary duties require him to provide services to Congress.  The impermissibility of such a delegation surely is not rendered "obvious" by the fact that some officers who perform services for Congress have titles such as "librarian," "architect," or "printer."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/case.html#758">478 U. S. 758</a></span>, n. 25 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  Furthermore, in sustaining the constitutionality of the Federal Trade Commission\'s independent status, this Court noted specifically that the Commission "acts as a legislative agency" in "making investigations and reports thereon for the information of Congress . . . in aid of the legislative power."  295 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#628">295 U. S. 628</a></span>.  JUSTICE STEVENS\' approach might make some sense if Congress had delegated legislative responsibility to an officer over whom Congress could hope to exercise tight control, but even JUSTICE STEVENS does not claim that the Comptroller General is such an officer.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/2" name="F4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Myers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html">272 U. S. 52</a></span> (1926), the Court refused to enforce a statute requiring congressional approval for removal of postmasters.  The Court\'s analysis suggested that there was no practical way the duties of the office could have been reformulated to render congressional participation in the removal process permissible.  In <em>Springer v. Philippine Islands,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/189/case.html">277 U. S. 189</a></span> (1928), the Court removed from office several Philippine officials exercising executive powers but appointed by officers of the Philippine Legislature.  As in <em>Myers,</em> the Court concluded that the offices by their very nature were executive, so the appointments could not have been rendered legal simply by trimming the delegated duties.  In <em>Buckley v. Valeo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html">424 U. S. 1</a></span> (1976), the Court set aside Federal Election Campaign Act provisions granting certain powers to officials appointed by Congress, but it structured its remedy so as to interfere as little as possible with the orderly conduct of business by the Federal Election Commission.  Past acts of the improperly constituted Commission were deemed valid, and the Court\'s mandate was stayed for 30 days to allow time for the Commission to be reconstituted through Presidential appointment.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#142">424 U.

S. 50</a></span> (1982), the Court set aside an exercise of judicial power by a bankruptcy judge, because his tenure was not protected in the manner required by Article III of the Constitution.  To give Article III protections to bankruptcy judges, the federal bankruptcy statute would have had to be rewritten completely.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/3" name="F4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the legislative history on this point is sparse, it seems reasonably clear that Congress intended the removal provision to be severable from the remainder of the 1921 statute.  An earlier bill, providing for removal of the Comptroller General only by impeachment or concurrent resolution of Congress, was vetoed by President Wilson on the grounds that Congress could not constitutionally limit the President\'s removal power or exercise such power on its own.  <em>See</em> 59 Cong.Rec. 8609-8610 (1920).  In the course of an unsuccessful attempt to override the veto, Representative Pell inquired:</p>\n<p>"If we pass this over the President\'s veto and then the Supreme Court should uphold the contention of the President, this bill would not fail, would it?

The majority does not suggest that an official who exercises the functions that the Deficit Control Act vests in the Comptroller General must be removable by the President at will.  Perhaps the President possesses inherent constitutional authority to remove "executive" officials for such politically neutral grounds as inefficiency or neglect of duty, but if so -- and I am not convinced of it -- I do not see how that power would be enhanced by nullification of a statutory provision giving similar authority to Congress.  In any event, I agree with JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE STEVENS that the power to remove an officer for reasons of this kind cannot realistically be expected to make an officer "subservient" in any meaningful sense to the removing authority.  <em>Cf.
