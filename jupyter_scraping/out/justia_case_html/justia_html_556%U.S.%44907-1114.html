BELL, WARDEN</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x931114.\xe2\x80\x83Argued December 9, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 28, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">After the State discredited petitioner Cone\xe2\x80\x99s defense that he killed two people while suffering from acute psychosis caused by drug addiction, he was convicted and sentenced to death.  The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal and the state courts denied postconviction relief.  Later, in a second petition for state postconviction relief, Cone raised the claim that the State had violated <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a>, by suppressing witness statements and police reports that would have corroborated his insanity defense and bolstered his case in mitigation of the death penalty.  The postconviction court denied him a hearing on the ground that the <em>Brady</em> claim had been previously determined, either on direct appeal or in earlier collateral proceedings.  The State Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  Cone then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.  That Court denied relief, holding the <em>Brady</em> claim procedurally barred because the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 disposition rested on adequate and independent state grounds: Cone had waived it by failing to present his claim in state court.  Even if he had not defaulted the claim, ruled the court, it would fail on its merits because none of the withheld evidence would have cast doubt on his guilt.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with the latter conclusion, but considered itself barred from reaching the claim\xe2\x80\x99s merits because the state courts had ruled the claim previously determined or waived under state law.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The state courts\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s Brady</em> claim does not rest on a ground that bars federal review.  Neither of the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted justifications for such a bar\xe2\x80\x94that the claim was decided by the State Supreme Court on direct review or that Cone had waived it by never properly raising it in state court\xe2\x80\x94provides an independent and adequate state ground for denying review of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s federal<em> </em>claim.  The state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the <em>Brady</em> claim on the ground it had been previously determined in state court rested on a false premise: Cone had not presented the claim in earlier proceedings and, consequently, the state courts had not passed on it.  The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the claim as procedurally defaulted because it had been twice presented to the Tennessee courts was thus erroneous.  Also unpersuasive is the State\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that federal review is barred because the <em>Brady </em>claim was properly dismissed by the state postconviction courts as waived.  Those courts held only that the claim had been previously determined, and this Court will not second-guess their judgment.  Because the claim was properly preserved and exhausted in state court, it is not defaulted.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The lower federal courts failed to adequately consider whether the withheld documents were material to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  Both the quantity and quality of the suppressed evidence lend support to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s trial position that he habitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during the murders, and that the State\xe2\x80\x99s contrary arguments were false and misleading.  Nevertheless, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone, the evidence does not sustain his insanity defense: His behavior before, during, and after the crimes was inconsistent with the contention that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform it to the requirements of law.  Because the likelihood that the suppressed evidence would have affected the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict on the insanity issue is remote, the Sixth Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief on the ground that such evidence was immaterial to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilt finding.  The same cannot be said of that court\xe2\x80\x99s summary treatment of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the suppressed evidence would have influenced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing recommendation.  Because the suppressed evidence might have been material to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the proper punishment, a full review of that evidence and its effect on the sentencing verdict is warranted.

S. 97</a>, 111 (1976) (quoting <em>Berger</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/78/index.html">295 U. S. 78</a>, 88 (1935)).  In <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963), we held that when a State suppresses evidence favorable to an accused that is material to guilt or to punishment, the State violates the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to due process, \xe2\x80\x9cirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 87.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, Gary Cone, a Vietnam veteran sentenced to death, contends that the State of Tennessee violated his right to due process by suppressing witness statements and police reports that would have corroborated his trial defense and bolstered his case in mitigation of the death penalty.  At his trial in 1982, Cone asserted an insanity defense, contending that he had killed two people while suffering from acute amphetamine psychosis, a disorder caused by drug addiction.  The State of Tennessee discredited that defense, alleging that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug addiction was \xe2\x80\x9cbaloney.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ten years later, Cone learned that the State had suppressed evidence supporting his claim of drug addiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone presented his new evidence to the state courts in a petition for postconviction relief, but the Tennessee courts denied him a hearing on the ground that his <em>Brady</em> claim had been \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously determined,\xe2\x80\x9d either on direct appeal from his conviction or in earlier collateral proceedings.  On application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, the Federal District Court concluded that the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 disposition rested on an adequate and independent state ground that barred further review in federal court, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed.  Doubt concerning the correctness of that holding, coupled with conflicting decisions from other Courts of Appeals, prompted our grant of certiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a complete review of the trial and postconviction proceedings, we conclude that the Tennessee courts\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim does not rest on a ground that bars federal review.  Furthermore, although the District Court and the Court of Appeals passed briefly on the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim, neither court distinguished the materiality of the suppressed evidence with respect to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s guilt from the materiality of the evidence with respect to his punishment.  While we agree that the withheld documents were not material to the question whether Cone committed murder with the requisite mental state, the lower courts failed to adequately consider whether that same evidence was material to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  Therefore, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether there is a reasonable probability that the withheld evidence would have altered at least one juror\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the appropriate penalty for Cone\xe2\x80\x99s crimes.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the afternoon of Saturday, August 10, 1980, Cone robbed a jewelry store in downtown Memphis, Tennessee. Fleeing the scene by car, he led police on a high-speed chase into a residential neighborhood.  Once there, he abandoned his vehicle and shot a police officer.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  When a bystander tried to impede his escape, Cone shot him, too, before escaping on foot.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A short time later, Cone tried to hijack a nearby car.  When that attempt failed (because the driver refused to surrender his keys), Cone tried to shoot the driver and a hovering police helicopter before realizing he had run out of ammunition.  He then fled the scene.  Although police conducted a thorough search, Cone was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Early the next morning, Cone reappeared in the same neighborhood at the door of an elderly woman.  He asked to use her telephone, and when she refused, he drew a gun.  Before he was able to gain entry, the woman slammed the door and called the police.  By the time officers arrived, however, Cone had once again disappeared.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That afternoon, Cone gained entry to the home of 93-year-old Shipley Todd and his wife, 79-year-old Cleopatra Todd.  Cone beat the couple to death with a blunt instrument and ransacked the first floor of their home.  Later, he shaved his beard and escaped to the airport without being caught.  Cone then traveled to Florida, where he was arrested several days later after robbing a drugstore in Pompano Beach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Tennessee grand jury charged Cone with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of murder in the perpetration of a burglary, three counts of assault with intent to murder, and one count of robbery by use of deadly force.  At his jury trial in 1982, Cone did not challenge the overwhelming physical and testimonial evidence supporting the charges against him.  His sole defense was that he was not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone\xe2\x80\x99s counsel portrayed his client as suffering from severe drug addiction attributable to trauma Cone had experienced in Vietnam.  Counsel argued that Cone had committed his crimes while suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis, a disorder brought about by his drug abuse.  That defense was supported by the testimony of three witnesses.  First was Cone\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who described her son as an honorably discharged Vietnam veteran who had changed following his return from service.  She recalled Cone describing \xe2\x80\x9chow terrible\xe2\x80\x9d it had been to handle the bodies of dead soldiers, and she explained that Cone slept restlessly and sometimes \xe2\x80\x9choller[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d in his sleep.  Tr. 1643\xe2\x80\x931645 (Apr. 20, 1982).  She also described one occasion, following Cone\xe2\x80\x99s return from service, when a package was shipped to him that contained marijuana.  Before the war, she asserted, Cone had not used drugs of any kind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two expert witnesses testified on Cone\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Matthew Jaremko, a clinical psychologist, testified that Cone suffered from substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorders related to his military service in Vietnam.  Jaremko testified that Cone had expressed remorse for the murders, and he opined that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s mental disorder rendered him substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the law.  Jonathan Lipman, a neuropharmacologist, recounted at length Cone\xe2\x80\x99s history of illicit drug use, which began after Cone joined the Army and escalated to the point where Cone was consuming \xe2\x80\x9crather horrific\xe2\x80\x9d quantities of drugs daily.  App. 100.  According to Lipman, Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug abuse had led to chronic amphetamine psychosis, a disorder manifested through hallucinations and ongoing paranoia that prevented Cone from obeying the law and appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In rebutting Cone\xe2\x80\x99s insanity defense the State\xe2\x80\x99s strategy throughout trial was to present Cone as a calculating, intelligent criminal who was fully in control of his decisions and actions at the time of the crimes.  A key component of that strategy involved discrediting Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claims of drug use.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Through cross-examination, the State established that both defense experts\xe2\x80\x99 opinions were based solely on Cone\xe2\x80\x99s representations to them about his drug use rather than on any independently corroborated sources, such as medical records or interviews with family or friends.  The prosecution also adduced expert and lay testimony to establish that Cone was not addicted to drugs and had acted rationally and intentionally before, during, and after the Todd murders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Particularly damaging to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s defense was the testimony of rebuttal witness Ilene Blankman, who had spent time with Cone several months before the murders and at whose home Cone had stayed in the days leading up to his arrest in Florida.  Blankman admitted to being a former heroin addict but testified that she no longer used drugs and tried to stay away from people who did.  She testified that she had never seen Cone use drugs, had never observed track marks on his body, and had never seen him exhibit signs of paranoia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Emphasizing the State\xe2\x80\x99s position with respect to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s alleged addiction, the prosecutor told the jury during closing argument, \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou\xe2\x80\x99re not dealing with a crazy person, an insane man.  A man \xe2\x80\xa6 out of his mind.  You\xe2\x80\x99re dealing, I submit to you, with a premeditated, cool, deliberate\xe2\x80\x94and even cowardly, really\xe2\x80\x94murderer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 2084 (Apr. 22, 1982).  Pointing to the quantity of drugs found in Cone\xe2\x80\x99s car, the prosecutor suggested that far from being a drug addict, Cone was actually a drug dealer.  The prosecutor argued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be absurd, but he says he\xe2\x80\x99s a drug addict.  I say baloney.  He\xe2\x80\x99s a drug seller.  Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the proof show that?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 107.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury rejected Cone\xe2\x80\x99s insanity defense and found him guilty on all counts.  At the penalty hearing, the prosecution asked the jury to find that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s crime met the criteria for four different statutory aggravating factors, any one of which would render him eligible for a capital sentence.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Cone\xe2\x80\x99s counsel called no witnesses but instead rested on the evidence adduced during the guilt phase proceedings.  Acknowledging that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s experts had disputed the existence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mental disorder, counsel nevertheless urged the jury to consider Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug addiction when weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The jury found all four aggravating factors and unanimously returned a sentence of death.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct appeal Cone raised numerous challenges to his conviction and sentence.  Among those was a claim that the prosecution violated state law by failing to disclose a tape-recorded statement and police reports relating to several trial witnesses.  See App. 114\xe2\x80\x93117.  The Tennessee Supreme Court rejected each of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claims, and affirmed his conviction and sentence.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 87 (1984).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Cone then filed a petition for postconviction relief, primarily raising claims that his trial counsel had been ineffective; the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of that petition in 1987.  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>State</em>, 747 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 353.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1989, Cone, acting <em>pro se</em>, filed a second petition for postconviction relief, raising myriad claims of error.  Among these was a claim that the State had failed to disclose evidence in violation of his rights under the United States Constitution.  At the State\xe2\x80\x99s behest, the postconviction court summarily denied the petition, concluding that all the claims raised in it had either been \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously determined\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwaived.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order Dismissing Petition for Post-Conviction Relief in <em>Cone</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. P\xe2\x80\x9306874 (Crim. Ct. Shelby Cty., Tenn., Jan. 2, 1990).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  At that time, the court did not specify which claims fell into which category.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone appealed the denial of his petition to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, asserting that the postconviction court had erred by dismissing 13 claims\xe2\x80\x94his <em>Brady</em> claim among them\xe2\x80\x94as previously determined when, in fact, they had not been \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously addressed or determined by any court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner-Appellant Gary Bradford Cone in No. P\xe2\x80\x9306874, pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9324, and n.\xc2\xa011.  In addition Cone urged the court to remand the case to allow him, with the assistance of counsel, to rebut the presumption that he had waived any of his claims by not raising them at an earlier stage in the litigation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 24.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The court agreed and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand counsel was appointed and an amended petition was filed.  The State once again urged the postconviction court to dismiss Cone\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  Apparently conflating the state-law disclosure claim Cone had raised on direct appeal with his newly filed <em>Brady</em> claim, the State represented that the Tennessee Supreme Court had already decided the <em>Brady</em> issue and that Cone was therefore barred from relitigating it.  See App. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While that petition remained pending before the postconviction court, the Tennessee Court of Appeals held for the first time that the State\xe2\x80\x99s Public Records Act allowed a criminal defendant to review the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s file in his case.  See <em>Capital Case Resource Center of Tenn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodall,</em> No. 01\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x9301\xe2\x80\x939104\xe2\x80\x93CH\xe2\x80\x9300150, 1992 WL 12217 (Jan. 29, 1992).  Based on that holding, Cone obtained access to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s files, in which he found proof that evidence had indeed been withheld from him at trial.  Among the undisclosed documents Cone discovered were statements from witnesses who had seen him several days before and several days after the murders.  The witnesses described Cone\xe2\x80\x99s appearance as \xe2\x80\x9cwild eyed,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 50, and his behavior as \xe2\x80\x9creal weird,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 49.  One witness affirmed that Cone had appeared \xe2\x80\x9cto be drunk or high.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The file also contained a police report describing Cone\xe2\x80\x99s arrest in Florida following the murders.  In that report, a police officer described Cone looking around \xe2\x80\x9cin a frenzied manner,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwalking in [an] agitated manner\xe2\x80\x9d prior to his apprehension.  <em>Id.</em>, at 53.  Multiple police bulletins describing Cone as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug user\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cheavy drug user\xe2\x80\x9d were also among the undisclosed evidence.  See <em>id.</em>, at 55\xe2\x80\x9359.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the newly discovered evidence in hand, Cone amended his postconviction petition once again in October 1993, expanding his <em>Brady</em> claim to allege more specifically that the State had withheld exculpatory evidence demonstrating that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid in fact suffer drug problems and/or drug withdrawal or psychosis both at the time of the offense and in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. at 20.  Cone pointed to specific examples of evidence that had been withheld, alleging the evidence was \xe2\x80\x9cexculpatory to both the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s guilt and its consideration of the proper sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d and that there was \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence not been withheld, the jurors would not have convicted [him] and would not have sentenced him to death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321<em>.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</em>  In a lengthy affidavit submitted with his amended petition, Cone explained that he had not raised his <em>Brady</em> claim in earlier proceedings because the facts underlying it \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] been revealed through disclosure of the State\xe2\x80\x99s files, which occurred after the first post-conviction proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After denying Cone\xe2\x80\x99s request for an evidentiary hearing, the postconviction court denied relief on each claim presented in the amended petition.  Many of the claims were dismissed on the ground that they had been waived by Cone\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise them in earlier proceedings; however, consistent with the position urged by the State, the court dismissed many others, including the <em>Brady</em> claim, as mere \xe2\x80\x9cre-statements of previous grounds heretofore determined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court upon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe findings of the trial court in post-conviction hearings are conclusive on appeal unless the evidence preponderates against the judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>State</em>, 927 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 579, 581\xe2\x80\x93582 (1995).

Without disclosing to the District Court the contrary position it had taken in the state-court proceedings, the State acknowledged that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim had not been raised prior to the filing of his second postconviction petition.  However, wrenching out of context the state appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Cone had \xe2\x80\x9cwaived \xe2\x80\x98all claims \xe2\x80\xa6 which had not been previously determined,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the State now asserted the <em>Brady </em>claim had been waived.  App. 39 (quoting <em>Cone</em>, 927 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 581\xe2\x80\x93582).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 1998, the District Court denied Cone\xe2\x80\x99s request for an evidentiary hearing on his <em>Brady</em> claim.  Lamenting that its consideration of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claims had been \xe2\x80\x9cmade more difficult\xe2\x80\x9d by the parties\xe2\x80\x99 failure to articulate the state procedural rules under which each of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claims had allegedly been defaulted, App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a, the District Court nevertheless held that the <em>Brady</em> claim was procedurally barred.  After parsing the claim into 11 separate subclaims based on 11 pieces of withheld evidence identified in the habeas petition, the District Court concluded that Cone had waived each subclaim by failing to present or adequately develop it in state court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 112a\xe2\x80\x93113a.  Moreover, the court concluded that even if Cone had not defaulted his <em>Brady</em> claim, it would fail on its merits because none of the withheld evidence would have cast doubt on Cone\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a\xe2\x80\x93119a.  Throughout its opinion the District Court repeatedly referenced factual allegations contained in early versions of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s second petition for postconviction relief rather than the amended version of the petition upon which the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision had rested.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 112a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the District Court dismissed the remainder of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s federal claims, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted him permission to appeal several issues, including the alleged suppression of <em>Brady </em>material.  Before the Court of Appeals, the State shifted its procedural default argument once more, this time contending that Cone had \xe2\x80\x9csimply never raised\xe2\x80\x9d his <em>Brady</em> claim in the state court because he failed to make adequate factual allegations to support that claim in his second petition for postconviction relief.

In other words, instead of citing the October 1993 amended petition on which the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision had been based and to which its order explicitly referred, the State pointed the court to earlier, less developed versions of the same claim.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded that Cone had procedurally defaulted his <em>Brady</em> claim and had failed to show cause and prejudice to overcome the default.  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 961, 968 (2001).  The court acknowledged that Cone had raised his <em>Brady </em>claim.  243 F. 3d, at 969.  Nevertheless, the court considered itself barred from reaching the merits of the claim because the Tennessee courts had concluded the claim was \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously determined or waived under Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa740\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x93112.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Briefly mentioning several isolated pieces of suppressed evidence, the court summarily concluded that even if Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim had not been defaulted, the suppressed evidence would not undermine confidence in the verdict (and hence was not <em>Brady </em>material) \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the overwhelming evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  243 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 968.  The court did not discuss whether any of the undisclosed evidence was material with respect to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court of Appeals rejected Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim, it held that he was entitled to have his death sentence vacated because of his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective assistance at sentencing.  See 243 F. 3d, at 975.  In 2002, this Court reversed that holding after concluding that the Tennessee courts\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html">535 U.

Again we granted certiorari and reversed, relying in part on the deferential standard that governs our review of state-court decisions under AEDPA.  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/447/index.html">543 U.

This time, the court divided the claim into four separate subclaims: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) evidence regarding [Cone\xe2\x80\x99s] drug use; (2) evidence that might have been useful to impeach the testimony and credibility of prosecution witness Sergeant Ralph Roby; (3) FBI reports;[[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]] and (4) evidence showing that prosecution witness Ilene Blankman was untruthful and biased.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 F. 3d 743, 753 (2007).  Noting that it had previously found all four subclaims to be procedurally defaulted, the court declined to reconsider its earlier decision.  See <em>ibid</em>. (citing <em>Cone</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 968\xe2\x80\x93970).  At the same time, the court reiterated that the withheld evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have overcome the overwhelming evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s guilt in committing a brutal double murder and the persuasive testimony that Cone was not under the influence of drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 F. 3d, at 756.  Summarily discounting Cone\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the withheld evidence was material with respect to his sentence, the court concluded that the introduction of the suppressed evidence would not have altered the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 finding that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s alleged drug use did not \xe2\x80\x9cvitiate his specific intent to murder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to avoid the death sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 757.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Merritt dissented.  He castigated the State not only for withholding documents relevant to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sole defense and plea for mitigation, but also for its \xe2\x80\x9cfalsification of the procedural record \xe2\x80\xa6 concerning the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default defense to the <em>Brady</em> claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 760.  Over the dissent of seven judges, Cone\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc was denied.  505 F. 3d 610 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to answer the question whether a federal habeas claim is \xe2\x80\x9cprocedurally defaulted\xe2\x80\x9d when it is twice presented to the state courts.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the state and federal proceedings below, the State of Tennessee offered two different justifications for denying review of the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim.  First, in connection with Cone\xe2\x80\x99s amended petition for state postconviction relief, the State argued that the <em>Brady </em>claim was barred because it had been decided on direct appeal.  See App. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Then, in connection with Cone\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition, the State argued that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim was waived because it had never been properly raised before the state courts.  See <em>id.</em>, at 39.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim was procedurally barred, but for different reasons.  The District Court held that the claim had been waived, App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a, while the Court of Appeals held that the claim had been either waived or previously determined, <em>Cone</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 969.  We now conclude that neither prior determination nor waiver provides an independent and adequate state ground for denying Cone review of his federal<em> </em>claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is well established that federal courts will not review questions of federal law presented in a habeas petition when the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rests upon a state-law ground that \xe2\x80\x9cis independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 729 (1991); <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/362/index.html">534 U. S. 362</a>, 375 (2002).  In the context of federal habeas proceedings, the independent and adequate state ground doctrine is designed to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] that the States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in correcting their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coleman</em>, 501 U. S., at 732.  When a petitioner fails to properly raise his federal claims in state court, he deprives the State of \xe2\x80\x9can opportunity to address those claims in the first instance\xe2\x80\x9d and frustrates the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to honor his constitutional rights.  <em>Id.</em>, at 732, 748.  Therefore, consistent with the longstanding requirement that habeas petitioners must exhaust available state remedies before seeking relief in federal court, we have held that when a petitioner fails to raise his federal claims in compliance with relevant state procedural rules, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to adjudicate the claim ordinarily qualifies as an independent and adequate state ground for denying federal review.  See <em>id.</em>, at 731.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That does not mean, however, that federal habeas review is barred every time a state court invokes a procedural rule to limit its review of a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  We have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the adequacy of state procedural bars to the assertion of federal questions\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 is not within the State\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative finally to decide; rather, adequacy \xe2\x80\x98is itself a federal question.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lee</em>, 534 U. S., at 375 (quoting <em>Douglas</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/415/index.html">380 U. S. 415</a>, 422 (1965)); see also <em>Coleman</em>, 501 U. S., at 736 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal habeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds\xe2\x80\x9d).  The question before us now is whether federal review of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim is procedurally barred either because the claim was twice presented to the state courts or because it was waived, and thus not presented at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, we address the contention that the repeated presentation of a claim in state court bars later federal review.  The Tennessee postconviction court denied Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim after concluding it had been previously determined following a full and fair hearing in state court.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa740\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x93112(a) (1982).  That conclusion rested on a false premise: Contrary to the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 finding, Cone had not presented his <em>Brady</em> claim in earlier proceedings and, consequently, the state courts had not passed on it.  The Sixth Circuit recognized that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim had not been decided on direct appeal, see <em>Cone</em>, 243 F. 3d, at 969, but felt constrained by the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to reach the merits of that claim on postconviction review.  The Court of Appeals concluded that because the state postconviction courts had applied a state procedural law to avoid reaching the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim, \xe2\x80\x9can \xe2\x80\x98independent and adequate\xe2\x80\x99 state ground\xe2\x80\x9d barred federal habeas review.  243 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 969.  In this Court the State does not defend that aspect of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding, and rightly so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a state court declines to review the merits of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim on the ground that it has done so already, it creates no bar to federal habeas review.  In <em>Ylst</em> v. <em>Nunnemaker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/797/index.html"></a><a href="/us/501/797/index.html">501 U. S. 797</a>, 804, n. 3 (1991), we observed in passing that when a state court declines to revisit a claim it has already adjudicated, the effect of the later decision upon the availability of federal habeas is \xe2\x80\x9cnil\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ca later state decision based upon ineligibility for further state review neither rests upon procedural default nor lifts a pre-existing procedural default.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  When a state court refuses to readjudicate a claim on the ground that it has been previously determined, the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not indicate that the claim has been procedurally defaulted.  To the contrary, it provides strong evidence that the claim has already been given full consideration by the state courts and thus is <em>ripe</em> for federal adjudication.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A) (permitting issuance of a writ of habeas corpus only after \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A claim is procedurally barred when it has not been fairly presented to the state courts for their initial consideration\xe2\x80\x94not when the claim has been presented more than once.  Accordingly, insofar as the Court of Appeals rejected Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim as procedurally defaulted because the claim had been twice presented to the Tennessee courts, its decision was erroneous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an alternative (and contradictory) ground for barring review of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim, the State has argued that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim was properly dismissed by the state postconviction court on the ground it had been waived.  We are not persuaded.  The state appellate court affirmed the denial of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim on the same mistaken ground offered by the lower court\xe2\x80\x94that the claim had been previously determined.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Contrary to the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, the Tennessee appellate court did not hold that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>claim was waived.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a state court declines to find that a claim has been waived by a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s alleged failure to comply with state procedural rules, our respect for the state-court judgment counsels us to do the same.  Although we have an independent duty to scrutinize the application of state rules that bar our review of federal claims, <em>Lee</em>, 534 U. S., at 375, we have no concomitant duty to apply state procedural bars where state courts have themselves declined to do so.  The Tennessee courts did not hold that Cone waived his <em>Brady </em>claim, and we will not second-guess their judgment.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural objections to federal review of the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim have resulted in a significant delay in bringing this unusually protracted case to a conclusion.  Ultimately, however, they provide no obstacle to judicial review.  Cone properly preserved and exhausted his <em>Brady </em>claim in the state court; therefore, it is not defaulted.  We turn now to the merits of that claim.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the State is obliged to \xe2\x80\x9cprosecute with earnestness and vigor,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cis as much [its] duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Berger</em>, 295 U. S., at 88.  Accordingly, we have held that when the State withholds from a criminal defendant evidence that is material to his guilt or punishment, it violates his right to due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See <em>Brady</em>, 373 U. S., at 87.  In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/667/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/667/index.html">473 U. S. 667</a>, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.), we explained that evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of <em>Brady</em> when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  In other words, favorable evidence is subject to constitutionally mandated disclosure when it \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html">514 U.

The suppressed evidence includes statements by witnesses acknowledging that Cone appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9cdrunk or high,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 49, \xe2\x80\x9cacted real weird,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and \xe2\x80\x9clooked wild eyed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 50, in the two days preceding the murders.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  It also includes documents that could have been used to impeach witnesses whose trial testimony cast doubt on Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug addiction.  For example, Memphis police officer Ralph Roby testified at trial that Cone had no needle marks on his body when he was arrested\xe2\x80\x94an observation that bolstered the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Cone was not a drug user.  The suppressed evidence reveals, however, that Roby authorized multiple teletypes to law enforcement agencies in the days following the murders in which he described Cone as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug user\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cheavy drug user.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 55\xe2\x80\x9358.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  A suppressed statement made by the chief of police of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s hometown also describes Cone as a serious drug user.  See <em>Cone</em>, 243 F. 3d, at 968.  And undisclosed notes of a police interview with Ilene Blankman conducted several days after the murders reveal discrepancies between her initial statement and her trial testimony relevant to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s alleged drug use.  App. 72\xe2\x80\x9373.  In sum, both the quantity and the quality of the suppressed evidence lends support to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s position at trial that he habitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during his crime spree, and that the State\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary were false and misleading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the federal question that must be decided is whether the suppression of that probative evidence deprived Cone of his right to a fair trial.  See <em>Agurs</em>, 427 U. S., at 108.  Because the Tennessee courts did not reach the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim, federal habeas review is not subject to the deferential standard that applies under AEDPA to \xe2\x80\x9cany claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

In assessing the materiality of the evidence suppressed by the State, the Court of Appeals suggested that two facts outweighed the potential force of the suppressed evidence.  First, the evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s guilt was overwhelming.  Second, the evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug use was cumulative because the jury had heard evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s alleged addiction from witnesses and from officers who interviewed Cone and recovered drugs from his vehicle.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The Court of Appeals did not thoroughly review the suppressed evidence or consider what its cumulative effect on the jury would have been.  Moreover, in concluding that the suppressed evidence was not material within the meaning of <em>Brady</em>, the court did not distinguish between the materiality of the evidence with respect to guilt and the materiality of the evidence with respect to punishment\xe2\x80\x94an omission we find significant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evidence that is material to guilt will often be material for sentencing purposes as well; the converse is not always true, however, as <em>Brady</em> itself demonstrates.  In our seminal case on the disclosure of prosecutorial evidence, defendant John Brady was indicted for robbery and capital murder.  At trial, Brady took the stand and confessed to robbing the victim and being present at the murder but testified that his accomplice had actually strangled the victim.  <em>Brady</em> v. <em>State</em>, 226 Md. 422, 425, 174 A. 2d 167, 168 (1961).  After Brady was convicted and sentenced to death he discovered that the State had suppressed the confession of his accomplice, which included incriminating statements consistent with Brady\xe2\x80\x99s version of events.  <em>Id.</em>, at 426, 174 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 169.  The Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that Brady\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights were violated by the suppression of the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s confession but declined to order a new trial on guilt.  Observing that nothing in the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s confession \xe2\x80\x9ccould have reduced \xe2\x80\xa6 Brady\xe2\x80\x99s offense below murder in the first degree,\xe2\x80\x9d the state court ordered a new trial on the question of punishment only.  <em>Id.</em>, at 430, 174 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 171.  We granted certiorari and affirmed, rejecting Brady\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s limited remand violated his constitutional rights.  373 U. S., at 88.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Brady</em>, the distinction between the materiality of the suppressed evidence with respect to guilt and punishment is significant in this case.  During the guilt phase of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the only dispute was whether Cone was \xe2\x80\x9csane under the law,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 2040 (Apr. 22, 1982), as his counsel described the issue, or \xe2\x80\x9ccriminally responsible\xe2\x80\x9d for his conduct, App. 110, as the prosecutor argued.  Under Tennessee law, Cone could not be held criminally responsible for the murders if, \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of [his] conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lack[ed] substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham</em> v. <em>State</em>, 547 S. W. 2d 531, 543 (Tenn. 1977).  Although we take exception to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 failure to assess the effect of the suppressed evidence \xe2\x80\x9ccollectively\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9citem by item,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 436, we nevertheless agree that even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone, the evidence falls short of being sufficient to sustain his insanity defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone\xe2\x80\x99s experts testified that his drug addiction and posttraumatic stress disorder originated during his service in Vietnam, more than 13 years before the Todds were murdered.  During those years, despite Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug use and mental disorder, he managed to successfully complete his education, travel, and (when not incarcerated) function in civil society.  The suppressed evidence may have strengthened the inference that Cone was on drugs or suffering from withdrawal at the time of the murders, but his behavior before, during, and after the crimes was inconsistent with the contention that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.  See <em>Graham</em>, 547 S. W. 2d, at 543.  The likelihood that the suppressed evidence would have affected the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict on the issue of insanity is therefore remote.  Accordingly, we conclude that the Sixth Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief on the ground that the suppressed evidence was immaterial to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same cannot be said of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 summary treatment of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the suppressed evidence influenced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing recommendation.  There is a critical difference between the high standard Cone was required to satisfy to establish insanity as a matter of Tennessee law and the far lesser standard that a defendant must satisfy to qualify evidence as mitigating in a penalty hearing in a capital case.  See <em>Bell</em>, 535  U. S., at 712 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is a vast difference between insanity\xe2\x80\x94which the defense utterly failed to prove\xe2\x80\x94and the possible mitigating effect of drug addiction incurred as a result of honorable service in the military\xe2\x80\x9d).  As defense counsel emphasized in his brief opening statement during penalty phase proceedings, the jury was statutorily required to consider whether Cone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity \xe2\x80\xa6 to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which was insufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which substantially affected his judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93203(j)(8) (1982).  It is possible that the suppressed evidence, viewed cumulatively, may have persuaded the jury that Cone had a far more serious drug problem than the prosecution was prepared to acknowledge, and that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug use played a mitigating, though not exculpating, role in the crimes he committed.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The evidence might also have rebutted the State\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Cone had manipulated his expert witnesses into falsely believing he was a drug addict when in fact he did not struggle with substance abuse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court fully considered whether the suppressed evidence might have persuaded one or more jurors that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug addiction\xe2\x80\x94especially if attributable to honorable service of his country in Vietnam\xe2\x80\x94was sufficiently serious to justify a decision to imprison him for life rather than sentence him to death.  Because the evidence suppressed at Cone\xe2\x80\x99s trial may well have been material to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the proper punishment in this case, we conclude that a full review of the suppressed evidence and its effect is warranted.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 27 years since Gary Cone was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, no Tennessee court has reached the merits of his claim that state prosecutors withheld evidence that would have bolstered his defense and rebutted the State\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to cast doubt on his alleged drug addiction.  Today we hold that the Tennessee courts\xe2\x80\x99 procedural rejection of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim does not bar federal habeas review of the merits of that claim.  Although we conclude that the suppressed evidence was not material to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for first-degree murder, the lower courts erred in failing to assess the cumulative effect of the suppressed evidence with respect to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentence.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to give full consideration to the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0From the abandoned vehicle, police recovered stolen jewelry, large quantities of illegal and prescription drugs, and approximately $2,400 in cash.

The Tennessee Supreme Court later observed that by finding Cone guilty of murder in the first degree during the perpetration of a burglary, the jury implicitly found the existence of an additional statutory aggravating factor: that the murders occurred while Cone was committing a burglary, \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932404(i)(7).  <em>State</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 87, 94 (1984).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In summarizing the trial proceedings the Tennessee Supreme Court observed: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only defense interposed on [Cone\xe2\x80\x99s] behalf was that of insanity, or lack of mental capacity, due to drug abuse and to stress arising out of his previous service in the Vietnamese war, some eleven years prior to the events involved in this case.  This proved to be a tenuous defense, at best, since neither of the expert witnesses who testified on his behalf had ever seen or heard of him until a few weeks prior to the trial. Neither was a medical doctor or psychiatrist, and neither had purported to treat him as a patient.  Their testimony that he lacked mental capacity was based purely upon his personal recitation to them of his history of military service and drug abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 90.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Under Tennessee law in effect at the time a criminal defendant was entitled to collateral relief if his conviction or sentence violated \xe2\x80\x9cany right guaranteed by the constitution of [Tennessee] or the Constitution of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tenn.

The state postconviction court dismissed some of those claims as waived and others, including the <em>Brady</em> claim, as having been previously determined.  In affirming the denial of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s petition the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals summarily stated that Cone had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to rebut the presumption of waiver as to all claims raised in his second petition for post-conviction relief which had not been previously determined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>State</em>, 927 S. W. 2d 579, 582 (1995).  Pointing to that language, the State asserts that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals denied Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim not because it had been previously determined, but because it was waived in the postconviction court proceedings.  Not so.  Without questioning the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim had been previously determined, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction petition in its entirety.  Nothing in that decision suggests the appellate court believed the <em>Brady</em> claim had been waived in the court below.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, while Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s parsing of the record persuades him that Cone failed to adequately raise his <em>Brady</em> claim to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, he does not argue that the court expressly held that Cone waived the claim.  A review of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief reveals that he made a broad challenge to the postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of his petition and plainly asserted that the court erred by dismissing claims as previously determined on direct appeal or in his initial postconviction petition.  See Brief for Petitioner-Appellant in No. 02\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x9301\xe2\x80\x939403\xe2\x80\x93CR\xe2\x80\x9300052 (Tenn. Crim. App.), pp. 7, 14.  The state appellate court did not state or suggest that Cone had waived his <em>Brady</em> claim.  Rather, after commending the postconviction court for its \xe2\x80\x9cexemplary and meticulous treatment of the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s petition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cone</em>, 927 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 581, the appellate court simply adopted without modification the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s findings with respect to the application of Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa740\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x93112 to the facts of this case.  The best reading of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision is that it was based on an approval of the postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning rather than on an unmentioned failure by Cone to adequately challenge the dismissal of his <em>Brady </em>claim on appeal.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Setting aside the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 mistaken belief that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim had been previously determined, there are many reasons the state courts might have rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s waiver argument.  The record establishes that the suppressed documents which form the basis for Cone\xe2\x80\x99s claim were not available to him until the Tennessee Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 1992 decision interpreting the State\xe2\x80\x99s Public Records Act as authorizing the disclosure of prosecutorial records.  Soon after obtaining access to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s file and discovering within it documents that had not been disclosed prior to trial, Cone amended his petition for postconviction relief, adding detailed allegations regarding the suppressed evidence recovered from the file, along with an affidavit explaining the reason why his claim had not been filed sooner.  See App. 13, 18.  The State did not oppose the amendment of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s petition on the ground that it was untimely, and it appears undisputed that there would have been no basis under state law for doing so.

See <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U.

When issues under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963), are presented on federal habeas, they usually have been previously addressed in state proceedings.  Federal review is accordingly sharply limited by established principles of deference: If the claim has been waived under state rules, that waiver typically precludes federal review.  If the claim has been decided in the state system, federal review is restricted in light of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s legal and factual conclusions.  The unique procedural posture of this case presents a <em>Brady</em> claim neither barred under state rules for failure to raise it nor decided in the state system.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When it comes to that claim, the Court specifies that the appropriate legal standard is the one we set forth in <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a>, 435 (1995) (whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict\xe2\x80\x9d).  See <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 26, n.\xc2\xa019.  I do not understand the majority to depart from that standard, and the majority certainly does not purport to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That leaves only application of the accepted legal standard to the particular facts.  It is highly unusual for this Court to engage in such an enterprise, see <em>Kyles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 458 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s asserted basis for doing so in this case is dubious, see <em>post</em>, at 1, 4\xe2\x80\x935 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the facts does not lead it to conclude that Cone is entitled to relief\xe2\x80\x94only that the courts below did not adequately consider his claim with respect to sentencing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 26 (\xe2\x80\x9cNeither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court fully considered whether the suppressed evidence\xe2\x80\x9d undermines confidence in Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentence).  The Court simply reviews the facts in the light most favorable to Cone, concludes that the evidence does <em>not</em> undermine confidence in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Cone is guilty, but sends the case back for \xe2\x80\x9cfull consideration\xe2\x80\x9d of whether the same is true as to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentence of death.  <em>Ante</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So this is what we are left with: a fact-specific determination, under the established legal standard, viewing the unique facts in favor of the defendant, that the <em>Brady</em> claim fails with respect to guilt, but might have merit as to sentencing.  In light of all this, I see no reason to quarrel with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the <em>Brady</em> claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In considering on remand whether the facts establish a <em>Brady</em> violation, it is clear that the lower courts should analyze the issue under the <em>constitutional</em> standards we have set forth, not under whatever standards the American Bar Association may have established.  The ABA standards are wholly irrelevant to the disposition of this case, and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s passing citation of them should not be taken to suggest otherwise.

In so doing, the majority correctly rejects Cone\xe2\x80\x99s argument that his guilty verdict was secured in violation of his rights under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963).  The majority declines, however, to decide whether the same evidence that was insufficient under <em>Brady</em> to overturn his conviction provides a basis for overturning his death sentence.  The majority instead remands this question to the District Court for further consideration because it finds that the Court of Appeals engaged in a \xe2\x80\x9csummary treatment\xe2\x80\x9d of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>sentencing claim.  See <em>ante</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly \xe2\x80\x9csummary treatment\xe2\x80\x9d of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing claim does not justify a remand to the District Court.  Cone has failed to establish \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing] proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html">514 U.

As a result, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arises from a crime spree 28 years ago that began with Cone\xe2\x80\x99s robbery of a jewelry store in Memphis, Tennessee, and concluded with his robbery of a drugstore in Pompano Beach, Florida.  Along the way, Cone shot a police officer and a bystander while trying to escape the first robbery, attempted to shoot another man in a failed carjacking attempt, unsuccessfully tried to force his way into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s apartment at gunpoint, and murdered 93-year-old Shipley Todd and his 79-year-old wife, Cleopatra.  When he was tried on two counts of first-degree murder in 1982, Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sole defense was that he did not have the requisite intent to commit first-degree murder because\nhe was in the grip of a chronic amphetamine psychosis.  The jury rejected the defense and convicted Cone of both murders.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At sentencing, the Tennessee jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that four statutory aggravating factors applied to Cone\xe2\x80\x99s offense: (1) Cone had been convicted of one or more previous felonies involving the use or threat of violence; (2) he had knowingly created a great risk of death to two or more persons other than the victim during his act of murder; (3) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind;  and (4) the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding a lawful arrest.  Tr. 2151\xe2\x80\x932152 (Apr. 23, 1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cone</em>, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 87, 94\xe2\x80\x9396 (Tenn. 1984).  Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932-203(i) (1982).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Cone argued to the jury at sentencing that his \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity \xe2\x80\xa6 to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which was insufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which substantially affected his judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932-203(j)(8).  But the jury found that neither this, nor any other mitigating factor, outweighed the aggravating factors.  The jury, as required by Tennessee law, unanimously sentenced Cone to death.  See \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932-203(g).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For almost three decades, Cone\xe2\x80\x99s case has traveled through the Tennessee and federal courts.  This Court has twice reversed decisions from the Court of Appeals that invalidated Cone\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence.  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html">535 U. S. 685</a> (2002); <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/447/index.html">543 U. S. 447</a> (2005) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  On remand from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s latest decision, the Court of Appeals directly considered whether a handful of police reports, law enforcement bulletins, and notes that were allegedly withheld from Cone\xe2\x80\x99s trial attorneys could have changed the result of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s trial or sentencing.  And, for the second time, the Court of Appeals held that there was not a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable probability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the evidence would have altered the jury\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cthat Cone\xe2\x80\x99s prior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to murder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to avoid the death sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 F.\xc2\xa03d 743, 757 (CA6 2007).  The Court of Appeals, therefore, held that neither Cone\xe2\x80\x99s conviction nor his sentence was invalid.  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Bell</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 961, 968 (CA6 2001).  We should affirm the Court of Appeals and put an end to this litigation.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the majority, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision affirming Cone\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence is too \xe2\x80\x9csummary,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 25,<em> </em>and the facts are such that, on further examination, Cone \xe2\x80\x9cmight\xe2\x80\x9d be able to demonstrate that it is \xe2\x80\x9cpossible\xe2\x80\x9d that the contested evidence would have persuaded the jury to spare his life, <em>ante,</em> at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  On this reasoning, the majority remands the case directly to the District Court for \xe2\x80\x9cfull consideration [of] the merits of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s [sentencing] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 27.<em> </em>I disagree on all counts.  Remanding the sentencing issue to the District Court is an \xe2\x80\x9cunusual step\xe2\x80\x9d for this Court to take.  <em>House</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/518/index.html">547 U. S. 518</a>, 557 (2006) (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Furthermore, in this case, it is a step that is legally and factually unjustified.  There is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 433\xe2\x80\x93434 (quoting <em>Bagley</em>, 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly \xe2\x80\x9csummary treatment\xe2\x80\x9d of the sentencing question is misplaced.  Before the Court of Appeals, Cone dedicated eight pages of his opening brief to arguing that the implicated evidence was material to his guilt or innocence, but spent only one paragraph arguing its materiality to his death sentence.  See Brief for Appellant in No. 99\xe2\x80\x935279 (CA6), pp. 40\xe2\x80\x9348.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 focus on the guilt phase, rather than the sentencing phase, simply followed Cone\xe2\x80\x99s lead.  See 492 F. 3d, at 755 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn his most recent brief, claiming that his receiving the withheld evidence would have resulted in a different sentence, Cone has made only conclusory arguments\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]   There is nothing defective about a judicial decision that summarily rejects an abbreviated legal argument, especially where, as here, the burden of proving the materiality of the contested evidence was on Cone.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In remanding this matter to the District Court, the majority makes two critical errors\xe2\x80\x94one legal and one factual\xe2\x80\x94that leave the false impression that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>claim has a chance of success.  First, the majority states that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is <em>possible</em> that the suppressed evidence\xe2\x80\x9d may have convinced the jury that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s substance abuse played a mitigating role in his crime and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he evidence <em>might</em> also have rebutted the State\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion\xe2\x80\x9d that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s experts were inaccurately depicting the depth of his drug-induced impairment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26 (emphasis added); see also <em>ante,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9327<em> </em>(remanding \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause the evidence suppressed at Cone\xe2\x80\x99s trial <em>may well have been</em> material to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the proper punishment in this case\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  But, as the majority implicitly acknowledges, see <em>ante</em>, at 26, n.\xc2\xa019, this is not the correct legal test for evaluating a <em>Brady </em>claim: \xe2\x80\x9cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information <em>might</em> have helped the defense, or <em>might</em> have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \xe2\x80\x98materiality\xe2\x80\x99 in the constitutional sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Agurs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/97/index.html">427 U. S. 97</a>, 109\xe2\x80\x93110 (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0this Court has made clear that the legal standard for adjudicating such a claim is whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury would have been persuaded by the allegedly withheld evidence.  <em>Kyles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 435; <em>Bagley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).  It simply is not sufficient, therefore, to claim that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a reasonable <em>possibility </em>that \xe2\x80\xa6 testimony might have produced a different result \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [P]etitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burden is to establish a reasonable <em>probability </em>of a different result.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Strickler</em> v. <em>Greene</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/263/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/263/index.html">527 U. S. 263</a>, 291 (1999) (emphasis in original).  To satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d standard, Cone must show that \xe2\x80\x9cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing determination.  <em>Kyles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 435.  The Court must view the record \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sawyer</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/333/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/333/index.html">505 U. S. 333</a>, 374 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), and determine whether the absence of the disclosure prevented Cone from receiving \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a trial resulting in a [sentence] worthy of confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 290 (quoting <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 434).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the context of this case, for Cone to establish \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing] proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 435, he must not only demonstrate that the withheld evidence would have established that he was substantially impaired as a result of drug abuse or withdrawal; Cone also must establish that the addition of the allegedly withheld evidence ultimately would have led the jury to conclude that any mitigating factors (including substantial impairment) outweighed all of the established aggravating factors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932-203(g).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the majority incorrectly claims that to prevail on his <em>Brady</em> claim, Cone must demonstrate simply that the withheld evidence supported the inference that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas impaired by his use of drugs around the time his crimes were committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 21.  This is factually inaccurate because there was already significant evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug use at trial.  To establish that the allegedly withheld evidence would reasonably have had any impact on his case, Cone must instead show that the evidence would have supported his claim of <em>substantial</em> mental impairment from drug use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was extensive evidence at trial that supported the inference that Cone was not only a longstanding drug user, but that he was in fact using drugs at the time of his crimes.  The State itself presented significant evidence on this point.  For example, it presented proof that officers found marijuana cigarette butts, empty drug vials, and loose syringes in the car that Cone abandoned immediately after the jewelry store robbery.  Tr.<em> </em>1505\xe2\x80\x931509 (Apr. 19, 1982).  The State also did not challenge testimony from Cone\xe2\x80\x99s mother that Cone used drugs.  <em>Id</em>., at 1647, 1648\xe2\x80\x931653 (Apr. 20, 1982).  And, most tellingly, the State introduced evidence that Cone was abusing three drugs\xe2\x80\x94cocaine, Dilaudid, and Demerol\xe2\x80\x94at the time of his arrest and was suffering \xe2\x80\x9cslight withdrawal symptoms\xe2\x80\x9d from them.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 1915\xe2\x80\x931916, 1920 (Apr. 22, 1982).  As the Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would not have been news to the jurors, that Cone was a \xe2\x80\x98drug user.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 492 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 757.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, what <em>was </em>contested by the State during trial was Cone\xe2\x80\x99s defense that his drug use was so significant that it caused him to suffer from extreme amphetamine psychosis at the time of the murders.  One of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s expert witnesses, a neuropharmacologist, testified that by the summer of 1980, when the crimes occurred, Cone was ingesting \xe2\x80\x9cferociously large doses\xe2\x80\x9d of drugs and that his increasing tolerance and use of amphetamines caused a chronic amphetamine psychosis.  Tr. 1736\xe2\x80\x931737, 1744\xe2\x80\x931747, 1758\xe2\x80\x931759 (Apr. 21, 1982).  The expert further testified that if a person with chronic amphetamine psychosis were to go into withdrawal, he could suffer extreme mood swings, \xe2\x80\x9ca crashing depression,\xe2\x80\x9d and a state of weakness so severe that \xe2\x80\x9che could barely lift himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1857\xe2\x80\x931859.  In this expert\xe2\x80\x99s view, these symptoms could cause a person to \xe2\x80\x9close his mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1859.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State contradicted that testimony with significant evidence that Cone did not act like someone who was \xe2\x80\x9cout of his mind\xe2\x80\x9d during the commission of his crimes.  Rather, the State argued, Cone behaved rationally during his initial Tennessee robbery, his subsequent escape, his flight from Tennessee to Florida after the Todd murders, his Florida robbery, and his subsequent arrest.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id., </em>at 2074\xe2\x80\x932084 (Apr. 22, 1982).  To substantiate this argument, the State called FBI Special Agent Eugene Flynn to the stand.  Agent Flynn testified that, when captured, Cone coherently detailed his travel from Tennessee to Florida, explained his efforts to evade detection by shaving his beard and buying new clothes, and initiated negotiations for a plea bargain.  <em>Id</em>., at 1918\xe2\x80\x931921.  The State also presented testimony from a friend of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s, Ilene Blankman, that she saw no indication that Cone was under the influence of drugs or severe withdrawal in the days immediately following the murder of the Todds.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1875\xe2\x80\x931876, 1882\xe2\x80\x931883 (Apr. 21, 1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewing the record as a whole, then, it is apparent that the contested issue at trial and sentencing was not whether Cone used drugs, but rather the quantity<em> </em>of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s drug use and its effect on his mental state.  Only if the evidence allegedly withheld from Cone was relevant to <em>this </em>question whether Cone suffered from extreme amphetamine psychosis or other substantial impairment would the evidence have been exculpatory for purposes of <em>Brady</em>.  See Order Denying Motion for Evidentiary Hearing and Order of Partial Dismissal, <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Bell</em>, No. 97\xe2\x80\x932312\xe2\x80\x93M1/A (WD Tenn., May 15, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a, n. 9 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe issue at trial was not whether Cone had ever abused any drugs (he clearly had), but whether he was out of his mind on amphetamines at the time of the murders\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. 2115\xe2\x80\x932116 (Apr. 23, 1982).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the legal and factual issues correctly framed, it becomes clear that Cone cannot establish a reasonable probability that admission of the evidence\xe2\x80\x94viewed either individually or cumulatively\xe2\x80\x94would have caused the jury to alter his sentence.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone first argues that he was improperly denied police reports that included witness statements regarding Cone\xe2\x80\x99s behavior around the time of his crime spree.  The first statement was given by a convenience store employee, Robert McKinney, who saw Cone the day before he robbed the Tennessee jewelry store.  When asked whether Cone appeared \xe2\x80\x9cto be drunk or high on anything,\xe2\x80\x9d McKinney answered, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ell he did, he acted real weird \xe2\x80\xa6 he just wandered around the store.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 49.  But McKinney subsequently clarified that Cone \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t sound drunk\xe2\x80\x9d and that the reason Cone attracted his attention was because he \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t acting like a regular customer\xe2\x80\x9d; he was \xe2\x80\x9cjust kinda wandering\xe2\x80\x9d around the store.  Motion to Expand the Record in No. 97\xe2\x80\x932312\xe2\x80\x93M1 (WD Tenn.), Exh. 2, pp.\xc2\xa03, 4.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, this interview is not convincing evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat Cone appeared to be \xe2\x80\x98drunk or high\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d when McKinney saw him.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  McKinney\xe2\x80\x99s clarification that he had characterized Cone\xe2\x80\x99s behavior as \xe2\x80\x9cweird\xe2\x80\x9d because Cone appeared to be killing time rather than acting like a normal shopper undermines the implication of McKinney\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statement that Cone looked \xe2\x80\x9cweird\xe2\x80\x9d because he might have been drunk or on drugs.  Thus, there is little chance that McKinney\xe2\x80\x99s statement would have provided any significant additional evidence that Cone was using drugs, let alone provide sentence-changing evidence that he was substantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second statement was given by Charles and Debbie Slaughter, who both witnessed Cone fleeing from police after the jewelry store robbery and reportedly told police that he looked \xe2\x80\x9cwild eyed.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 50.  Cone had just robbed a jewelry store, shot a police officer and a bystander, and was still fleeing from police when seen by the Slaughters.  It is thus unlikely that their observation of a \xe2\x80\x9cwild eyed\xe2\x80\x9d man would have been interpreted by the jury to mean that Cone \xe2\x80\x9cwas suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis at the time of the crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa016, rather than to mean that Cone looked like a man on the run.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third statement is contained in a police report authored by an officer who helped apprehend Cone after the Florida drugstore robbery.  He reported that he saw a suspect \xe2\x80\x9cat the rear of Sambos restaurant.  Subject was observed to be looking about in a frenzied manner and also appeared to be looking for a place to run.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 53.  Nothing in this police report either connects Cone to drug use or appears otherwise capable of altering the jury\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s mental state at the time of the crimes.  It certainly makes perfect sense that Cone was \xe2\x80\x9clooking about in a frenzied manner,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> he had just robbed a drugstore and was about to engage in a gun battle with police in order to evade arrest.  The police officer\xe2\x80\x99s description of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s appearance under these circumstances thus does not \xe2\x80\x9cundermine confidence\xe2\x80\x9d in Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U. S., at 435.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next category of documents that Cone relies upon to establish his <em>Brady</em> claim are police bulletins.  Some of the bulletins were sent by Memphis Police Sergeant Roby to neighboring jurisdictions on the day of the Todd murders and the day after.  The bulletins sought Cone\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension and alternatively described him as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug user\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cheavy drug user.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 55\xe2\x80\x9358.  Cone asserts that he could have used these bulletins to impeach Sergeant Roby\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony that the sergeant did not see any track marks when visiting Cone in jail a week later.  Tr. 1939 (Apr. 22, 1982).  Cone\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is faulty for two key reasons.  First, Sergeant Roby never testified that Cone was not<em> </em>a drug user.  His only trial testimony on this point was simply that he observed no \xe2\x80\x9cneedle marks\xe2\x80\x9d on Cone\xe2\x80\x99s arm when taking hair samples from him a few days after Cone\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the bulletins establish only \xe2\x80\x9cthat the police were initially cautious regarding the characteristics of a person who had committed several heinous crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a, n. 9.  The bulletins would not have tended to prove that the fugitive Cone was, in fact, a heavy drug user\xe2\x80\x94let alone \xe2\x80\x9cout of his mind\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise substantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis\xe2\x80\x94at the time of his crimes.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone also argues that material was withheld that could have been used to impeach Ilene Blankman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Cone did not appear to be high or in withdrawal when she helped him obtain a Florida driver\xe2\x80\x99s license during his efforts to evade arrest in Florida.  Tr. 1875\xe2\x80\x931882 (Apr. 21, 1982).  But he again fails to meet the standard for exculpatory evidence set by <em>Brady</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone first points to police notes of a pre-trial interview with Blankman, which did not reflect the statement she gave at trial that she saw no track marks on Cone\xe2\x80\x99s arm.  App. 72\xe2\x80\x9373.  But Blankman was questioned at trial about her failure to initially disclose this fact to police, Tr. 1903 (Apr. 21, 1982), so the jury was fully aware of the omission.  Disclosure of the original copy of the police notes thus could not have had any material effect on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations.  Moreover, the missing notes also recorded a damning statement by Blankman that Cone \xe2\x80\x9cnever used drugs around\xe2\x80\x9d her and she \xe2\x80\x9cnever saw Cone with drug paraphernalia.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 73.  Thus, it is difficult to accept Cone\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he would have benefited from the introduction of notes from Blackman\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial interview.  If anything, these police notes would have undermined his mitigation argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cone next relies on a report that describes a woman\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation with the prosecution team and Blankman at a restaurant during trial.  During the encounter, the woman accused Blankman of lying on the stand in order to frame Cone for the murders.  <em>Id.,</em> at 74\xe2\x80\x9375.  The report indicates that the prosecutors politely declined the woman\xe2\x80\x99s numerous attempts to discuss the merits of the case and that Blankman said nothing.  <em>Id., </em>at 75.  Nothing about this encounter raises doubts about Blankman\xe2\x80\x99s credibility.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last, Cone points to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrespondence in the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s files suggest[ing] that the prosecution had been unusually solicitous of [Blankman\xe2\x80\x99s] testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 45.  But the correspondence was completely innocuous.  One of the notes, sent in response to Blankman\xe2\x80\x99s request for a copy of her prior statement, expressed to Blankman that her \xe2\x80\x9ccooperation in this particular matter is appreciated.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 76.  The prosecutor then sent a letter to confirm that Blankman would testify at trial.  <em>Id.</em>, at 77. And finally, after trial, the prosecutor sent a note to inform Blankman of the verdict and indicate that they \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly appreciate[d] [her] cooperation with [them] in the trial of Gary Bradford Cone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 78.  There is nothing about these notes that \xe2\x80\x9ctend[s] to prove any fact that is both favorable to Cone and material to his guilt or punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewing the record as a whole, Cone has not come close to demonstrating that there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the withheld evidence, analyzed individually or cumulatively, would have changed the result of his sentencing.  Much of the impeachment evidence identified by Cone is of no probative value whatsoever.  The police bulletins do not contradict any of the trial testimony; the restaurant encounter was innocuous; and the correspondence sent by prosecutors to Blankman does not undermine her testimony or call Cone\xe2\x80\x99s mental state into doubt.  If the remaining evidence has any value to Cone, it is marginal at best.  There was testimony that Blankman did not initially tell police that Cone lacked track marks.  See Tr. 1903 (Apr. 21, 1982).  McKinney clarified in his statement that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s activity in the store was consistent with a person killing time, not the use of drugs or alcohol.  And the behavior described by the Slaughters and the Florida police officer is more naturally attributable to the circumstances of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s flight from the police than to any inference that Cone was \xe2\x80\x9cout of his mind\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise substantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Countering the trivial value of the alleged <em>Brady</em> material is the clear and overwhelming evidence that during Cone\xe2\x80\x99s crime spree, he was neither sufficiently insane to avoid a conviction of murder nor substantially impaired by his drug use or withdrawal-related psychosis.  There was substantial evidence that Cone carefully planned the jewelry store robbery and was calm in carrying it out, Tr. at 974\xe2\x80\x93976, 1014 (Apr. 16, 1982), 1350\xe2\x80\x931352 (Apr. 17, 1982), 1501 (Apr. 19, 1982), 2075 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he successfully eluded police after engaging them in a shootout, <em>id.</em>, at 1053\xe2\x80\x931064 (Apr. 16, 1982); that, after hiding overnight, he concocted a ruse to try to gain illegal entry to a residence, <em>id.</em>, at 1205\xe2\x80\x931208 (Apr. 17, 1982); that he murdered the Todds after they declined to cooperate with his efforts to further elude police, <em>id</em>., at 1681 (Apr. 20, 1982); that he took steps to change his appearance at the Todd residence and then successfully fled to Florida, <em>id.</em>, at 1918\xe2\x80\x931919 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he arrived in Florida exhibiting no signs of drug use or severe withdrawal, <em>id.</em>, at 1875\xe2\x80\x931882 (Apr. 21, 1982); that he obtained false identification in a further effort to avoid apprehension, <em>id.</em>, at 1881\xe2\x80\x931882, and that he denied any memory lapses and described undergoing only minor drug withdrawal when police arrested him, <em>id.</em>, at 1919\xe2\x80\x931920 (Apr. 22, 1982).  Given this wealth of evidence, there is no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury would have found that Cone was entitled to the substantial impairment mitigator had the evidence he seeks been made available to him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And even if Cone could have presented this evidence to the jury at sentencing and established an entitlement to this mitigator, he still has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that it would have outweighed all of the aggravating factors supporting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence.   See <em>id.,</em> at 2151\xe2\x80\x932154 (Apr. 23, 1982).   In its decision on direct appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court was well aware of the evidence regarding the \xe2\x80\x9cdegree and extent of [Cone\xe2\x80\x99s] drug abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em>, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 90.  As part of its required independent review of whether the mitigation evidence was sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating factors, see Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932-205, the Tennessee court nevertheless concluded that the sentence was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in any way disproportionate under all of the circumstances, including the brutal murders of two elderly defenseless persons by an escaping armed robber who had terrorized a residential neighborhood for twenty-four hours.\xe2\x80\x9d 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  None of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s proffered evidence places that conclusion, made by both the jury and the Tennessee Supreme Court, \xe2\x80\x9cin such a different light as to undermine confidence\xe2\x80\x9d in Cone\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  <em>Kyles</em>, 514 U.

Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that the State Supreme Court did not decide any <em>Brady</em> issue on direct appeal, that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals erred in holding otherwise, and that the Sixth Circuit erred in concluding that the <em>Brady</em> claim had been procedurally defaulted on this ground.  Petitioner is quite correct that his <em>Brady</em> claim was not decided on direct appeal, and the Court in the present case is clearly correct in holding that a second attempt to litigate a claim in state court does not necessarily bar subsequent federal habeas review.

Rather, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>claim was simply never raised before the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and that court did not rule on the claim at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the issue of procedural default rests on the same mistaken premise that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Brady claim on the ground that it had been previously determined, I entirely agree with the majority that the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision on that issue cannot be sustained and that a remand is required.  I cannot join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, for two chief reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court states without explanation that \xe2\x80\x9cCone properly preserved and exhausted his <em>Brady</em> claim in the state court\xe2\x80\x9d and that therefore the claim has not been defaulted.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  Because Cone never fairly raised this claim in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, the claim is either not exhausted (if Cone could now raise the claim in state court) or is procedurally defaulted (if state law now provides no avenue for further review).  I would leave these questions for resolution in the first instance on remand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court, again without explanation, remands this case to the District Court, not the Court of Appeals.  I see no justification for this step.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to understand the tangled procedural default issue presented in this case, it is necessary to review the far-from-exemplary manner in which the attorneys for petitioner and respondent litigated the <em>Brady</em> claim in the state courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct appeal, petitioner did not raise any <em>Brady </em>claim.  As the Court notes, petitioner did claim that the State had violated a state discovery rule by failing to provide prior statements given by certain witnesses and that therefore the testimony of these witnesses should have been stricken.  App. 114\xe2\x80\x93117; <em>State </em>v.<em> Cone, </em>665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 87, 94 (Tenn. 1984).  Although this claim concerned the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to turn over information, it is clear that this was not a <em>Brady</em> claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first appearance of anything resembling the claim now at issue occurred in 1993 when petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s experienced attorneys filed an amendment to his second petition for postconviction relief in the Shelby County Criminal Court.  This petition included a long litany of tangled claims.  Paragraph 35 of this amended petition claimed, among other things, that the State had wrongfully withheld information demonstrating that one particular prosecution witness had testified falsely concerning \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner and his drug use.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  This nondisclosure, the petition stated, violated not only the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States (which protect the due process right on which <em>Brady</em> is based) but also the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution and four provisions of the Tennessee Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two months later, counsel for petitioner filed an amendment adding 12 more claims, including one (\xc2\xb641) alleging that the State had abridged petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rights by failing to disclose evidence that petitioner suffered from drug problems.  <em>Id., </em>at 20.  According to this new submission, the nondisclosure violated, in addition to the previously cited provisions of the federal and state constitutions, five more provisions of the state constitution, including provisions regarding double jeopardy, see Tenn. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa710, <em>ex post facto</em> laws, \xc2\xa711, indictment, \xc2\xa714, and open courts, \xc2\xa717.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Shelby County Criminal Court was faced with the task of wading through the morass presented in the amended petition.  Under Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa740\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x93112 (1990) (repealed 1995),[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] a claim could not be raised in a postconviction proceeding if the claim had been \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously determined\xe2\x80\x9d or waived.  Citing the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection on direct appeal of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the prosecution had violated a state discovery rule by failing to turn over witness statements, the State incorrectly informed the court that the failure-to-disclose-exculpatory-evidence claim set out in \xc2\xb641 had been \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously determined\xe2\x80\x9d on direct appeal.  App. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  The Shelby County Criminal Court rejected the claim on this ground, and held that all of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims had either been previously determined or waived.  <em>Id</em>.<em>, </em>at 22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the importance now assigned to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim, one might think that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would have (a) stressed that claim in the opening brief that they filed in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, (b) pointed out the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s clear error in concluding that this claim had been decided in the direct appeal, and (c) explained that information supporting the claim had only recently come to light due to the production of documents under the State\xe2\x80\x99s public records act.  But counsel did none of these things.  In fact, the <em>Brady</em> claim was not mentioned at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor was <em>Brady</em> cited in the reply brief filed by the same attorneys.  The reply brief did contain a passing reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe withholding of exculpatory evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d but the brief did not elaborate on this claim and again failed to mention that this claim had never been previously decided and was supported by newly discovered evidence.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower state court, but the appellate court made no mention of the <em>Brady </em>claim, and I see no basis for concluding that the court regarded the issue as having been raised on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellate courts generally do not reach out to decide issues not raised by the appellant.  <em>Snell</em> v. <em>Tunnell</em>, 920 F.\xc2\xa02d 673, 676 (CA10 1990); see <em>Powers</em> v. <em>Hamilton Cty. Public Defender Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 592, 609\xe2\x80\x93610 (CA6 2007); see also <em>Galvan </em>v. <em>Alaska Dept. of Corrections, </em>397 F.\xc2\xa03d 1198, 1204 (CA9 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cCourts generally do not decide issues not raised by the parties.  If they granted relief to petitioners on grounds not urged by petitioners, respondents would be deprived of a fair opportunity to respond, and the courts would be deprived of the benefit of briefing\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  Nor do they generally consider issues first mentioned in a reply brief.  <em>Physicians Comm. For Responsible Medicine</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 436 F.\xc2\xa03d 326, 331, n.\xc2\xa06 (CA2 2006); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Beaumont Independent School Dist.</em>, 173 F.\xc2\xa03d 274, 299, n.\xc2\xa013 (CA5 1999) (Garza, J.,<em> </em>dissenting); <em>Doolin Security Sav. Bank, F.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0B.</em> v. <em>Office of Thrift Supervision</em>, 156 F. 3d 190, 191 (CADC 1998); <em>Boone</em> v. <em>Carlsbad Bancorporation, Inc.</em>, 972 F.\xc2\xa02d 1545, 1554, n.\xc2\xa06 (CA10 1992).  And it is common to practice for appellate courts to refuse to consider issues that are mentioned only in passing.  <em>Reynolds</em> v. <em>Wagner</em>, 128 F.\xc2\xa03d 166, 178 (CA3 1997) (citing authorities).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals follows these standard practices.  Rule 10(b) of that court states quite specifically: \xe2\x80\x9cIssues which are not supported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate references to the record will be treated as waived in this court.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court has applied this rule in capital cases, <em>State</em> v. <em>Dellinger</em>, 79 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 458, 495, 497, 503 (Tenn. 2002) (appendix to majority opinion); <em>Brimmer </em>v.<em> State</em>, 29 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 497, 530 (1998), and in others.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State</em> v. <em>Faulkner</em>, 2001 WL 378540 (Tenn. Crim. App., Sept. 10, 2001) (73-year sentence for first-degree murder).  And in both capital and noncapital cases, the court has refused to entertain arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Gerhardt</em>, 2009 WL 160930 (Tenn. Crim. App., Jan. 23, 2009) (capital case); <em>Carruthers </em>v<em>. State</em>, 814 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 64, 68 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991) (capital case); <em>Cammon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 2007 WL 2409568, *6 (Tenn. Crim. App., Aug. 23, 2007) (noncapital case).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Thus, unless the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals departed substantially from its general practice, that court did not regard petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim as having been raised on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the decision now under review, the Sixth Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Tennessee courts found that Cone\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>claims were \xe2\x80\x98previously determined\xe2\x80\x99 and, therefore, not cognizable in [his] state post-conviction action.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 F.\xc2\xa03d 743, 756 (2007).  In my judgment, however, there is no basis for concluding that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals thought that any <em>Brady</em> issue was before it.  A contrary interpretation would mean that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, disregarding its own rules and standard practice, entertained an issue that was not mentioned at all in the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s main brief and was mentioned only in passing and without any development in the reply brief.  It would mean that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, having chosen to delve into the <em>Brady</em> issue on its own, ruled on the issue without even mentioning it in its opinion and without bothering to check the record to determine whether in fact the <em>Brady</em> issue had been decided on direct appeal.  Such an interpretation is utterly implausible, and it is telling that the majority\nin this case cites no support for such an interpretation in the opinion of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the question of procedural default rests on an erroneous premise and must therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also agree with the Court that we should not affirm the decision below on the ground that the <em>Brady</em> claim lacks substantive merit.  After its erroneous discussion of procedural default, the Sixth Circuit went on to discuss the merits of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim.  In its 2001 opinion, the Court of Appeals recognized that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> obligation extends not only to evidence that is material to guilt but also to evidence that is material to punishment.  See <em>Cone</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 961, 968 (2001) (citing <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/39/index.html">480 U. S. 39</a>, 57 (1987)).  But neither in that opinion nor in its 2006 opinion did the court address the materiality of the information in question here in relation to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s punishment.  See 492 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 756 (\xe2\x80\x9cA review of the allegedly withheld documents shows that this evidence would not have overcome the overwhelming <em>evidence of Cone\xe2\x80\x99s guilt</em> in committing a brutal double murder and the persuasive testimony that Cone was not under the influence of drugs\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Therefore, despite the strength of the arguments in Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 dissent, I would leave that question to be decided by the Sixth Circuit on remand.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, does not simply vacate and remand to the Sixth Circuit but goes further.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court states without elaboration that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cpreserved and exhausted his <em>Brady</em> claim in the state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  As I have explained, petitioner did not fairly present his <em>Brady </em>claim in his prior appeal to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and therefore that claim is either unexhausted or procedurally barred.  If the State is not now foreclosed from relying on the failure to exhaust, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(3), or on procedural default,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] those questions may be decided on remand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court remands the case to the District Court rather than the Court of Appeals.  A remand to the District Court would of course be necessary if petitioner were entitled to an evidentiary hearing, but the Court does not hold that an evidentiary hearing is either required or permitted.  In my view, unless there is to be an evidentiary hearing, there is no reason to remand this case to the District Court.  If the only purpose of remand is to require an evaluation of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim in light of the present record, the District Court is not in a superior position to conduct such a review.  And even if such a review is conducted in the first instance by the District Court, that court\xe2\x80\x99s decision would be subject to <em>de novo</em> review in the Court of Appeals.  492 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 750; <em>Cone</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 966\xe2\x80\x93967 (CA6 2001); see <em>United</em> <em>States</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, 484 F.\xc2\xa03d 413 (CA6 2007); <em>United</em> <em>States</em> v. <em>Miller,</em> 161 F.\xc2\xa03d 977, 987 (CA6 1998); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Phillip</em>, 948 F.\xc2\xa02d 241, 250 (CA6 1991).  Accordingly, I see no good reason for remanding to the District Court rather than the Court of Appeals.  And if the majority has such a reason, it is one that it has chosen to keep to itself.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to that court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because the Tennessee Supreme Court denied discretionary review of the decision of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decision affirming the denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second amended petition for postconviction relief, we must look to the decision of the latter court to determine if the decision below was based on an adequate and independent state ground.
