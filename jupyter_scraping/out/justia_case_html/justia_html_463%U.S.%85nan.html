Section 514(a) of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides, with enumerated exceptions, that ERISA shall supersede "any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan" covered by ERISA.  ERISA does not mandate that employers provide any particular benefits, and does not itself proscribe discrimination in the provision of employee benefits.  Prior to the effective date of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), which made discrimination based on pregnancy unlawful under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, appellee employers had welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA that did not provide benefits to employees disabled by pregnancy.  Appellees brought three separate declaratory judgment actions in Federal District Court, alleging that the Human Rights Law was preempted by ERISA.  Appellee airlines also alleged that the Disability Benefits Law was preempted.  The District Court in each case held that the Human Rights Law was preempted, at least insofar as it required the provision of pregnancy benefits prior to the effective date of the PDA.  As to appellee airlines\' challenge to the Disability Benefits Law, the District Court construed \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3) of ERISA as exempting from ERISA coverage those provisions of an employee benefit plan maintained to comply with state disability insurance laws, and, because it concluded that appellees would have provided pregnancy benefits solely to comply with the Disability Benefits Law, the court dismissed the portion of the complaint seeking relief from that law.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to the Human </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 463 U. S. 86</a></p><p> Rights Law.  With respect to the Disability Benefits Law, the Court of Appeals held that \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3)\'s exemption from preemption applied only when a benefit plan, "as an integral unit," is maintained solely to comply with the disability law.  The Court of Appeals remanded for a determination whether appellee airlines provided benefits through such plans, in which event the Disability Benefits Law would be enforceable, or through portions of comprehensive plans, in which case ERISA regulation would be exclusive.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. Given \xc2\xa7 514(a)\'s plain language, and ERISA\'s structure and legislative history, both the Human Rights Law and the Disability Benefits Law "relate to any employee benefit plan" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(a).

To the extent that the Human Rights Law provides a means of enforcing Title VII\'s commands, preemption of the Human Rights Law would modify and impair federal law within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(d).  State fair employment laws and administrative remedies play a significant role in the federal enforcement scheme under Title VII.  If ERISA were interpreted to preempt the Human Rights Law entirely with respect to covered benefit plans, the State no longer could prohibit employment practices relating to such plans and the state agency no longer would be authorized to grant relief.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission thus would be unable to refer claims involving covered plans to the state agency.  This would frustrate the goal of encouraging joint state/federal enforcement of Title VII.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#100">463 U.

While \xc2\xa7 514(d) may operate to exempt state laws upon which federal laws, such as Title VII, depend for their enforcement, the combination of Congress\' enactment of \xc2\xa7 514(a)\'s all-inclusive preemption provision and its enumeration of narrow, specific exceptions to that provision militate against expanding \xc2\xa7 514(d) into a more general saving clause.  Section 514(d)\'s limited legislative history is entirely consistent with Congress\' goal of ensuring that employers would not face conflicting or inconsistent state and local regulation of employee benefit plans.

Hence, those portions of appellee airlines\' multibenefit plans maintained to comply with the Disability Benefits Law are not exempt from ERISA and are not subject to state regulation.  Section 4(b)(3)\'s use of the word "solely" demonstrates that the purpose of the entire plan must be to comply with an applicable disability insurance law.

In these cases, we address the scope of several provisions of ERISA that speak expressly to the question of preemption.  The issues are whether the Human Rights Law and Disability Benefits Law "relate to" employee benefit plans within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(a), <em>see</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra,</em> and, if so, whether any exception in ERISA saves them from preemption.

To interpret \xc2\xa7 514(a) to preempt only state laws specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans would be to ignore the remainder of \xc2\xa7 514.  It would have been unnecessary to exempt generally applicable state criminal statutes from preemption in \xc2\xa7 514(b), for example, if \xc2\xa7 514(a) applied only to state laws dealing specifically with ERISA plans.</p>\n<p>Nor, given the legislative history, can \xc2\xa7 514(a) be interpreted to preempt only state laws dealing with the subject matters covered by ERISA -- reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and the like.  The bill that became ERISA originally contained a limited preemption clause, applicable only to state laws relating to the specific subjects covered by ERISA. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The Conference Committee rejected these provisions in favor of the present language, and indicated that the section\'s preemptive scope was as broad as its language.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep.

Senator Williams echoed these sentiments:</p>\n<p>"It should be stressed that, with the narrow exceptions specified in the bill, the substantive and enforcement provisions of the conference substitute are intended to preempt the field for Federal regulations, thus eliminating the threat of conflicting or inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefit plans.

[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We next consider whether any of the narrow exceptions to \xc2\xa7 514(a) saves these laws from preemption.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants argue that the Human Rights Law is exempt from preemption by \xc2\xa7 514(d), which provides that \xc2\xa7 514(a) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 463 U. S. 101</a></p><p> shall not "be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States."  According to appellants, preemption of state fair employment laws would impair and modify Title VII because it would change the means by which it is enforced.</p>\n<p>State laws obviously play a significant role in the enforcement of Title VII.  <em>See, e.g., Kremer v.

Title VII expressly preserves nonconflicting state laws in its \xc2\xa7 708:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this title shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any State or political subdivision of a State, other than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice under this title."</p>\n<p>78 Stat. 262, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-7. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Moreover, Title VII requires recourse to available state administrative remedies.  When an employment practice prohibited by Title VII is alleged to have occurred in a State or locality which prohibits the practice and has established an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 463 U. S. 102</a></p><p> agency to enforce that prohibition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) refers the charges to the state agency. The EEOC may not actively process the charges</p>\n<p>"before the expiration of sixty days after proceedings have been commenced under the State or local law, unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 706(c), 86 Stat. 104, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(c); <em>see Love v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/522/case.html">404 U. S. 522</a></span> (1972).  In its subsequent proceedings, the EEOC accords "substantial weight" to the state administrative determination. \xc2\xa7 706(b), 86 Stat. 104, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b).</p>\n<p>Given the importance of state fair employment laws to the federal enforcement scheme, preemption of the Human Rights Law would impair Title VII to the extent that the Human Rights Law provides a means of enforcing Title VII\'s commands.  Before the enactment of ERISA, an employee claiming discrimination in connection with a benefit plan would have had his complaint referred to the New York State Division of Human Rights.  If ERISA were interpreted to preempt the Human Rights Law entirely with respect to covered benefit plans, the State no longer could prohibit the challenged employment practice, and the state agency no longer would be authorized to grant relief.  The EEOC thus would be unable to refer the claim to the state agency.  This would frustrate the goal of encouraging joint state/federal enforcement of Title VII; an employee\'s only remedies for discrimination prohibited by Title VII in ERISA plans would be federal ones.  Such a disruption of the enforcement scheme contemplated by Title VII would, in the words of \xc2\xa7 514(d), "modify" and "impair" federal law. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 463 U. S. 103</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Insofar as state laws prohibit employment practices that are lawful under Title VII, however, preemption would not impair Title VII within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(d).  Although Title VII does not itself prevent States from extending their nondiscrimination laws to areas not covered by Title VII, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 708, 78 Stat. 262, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-7, it in no way depends on such extensions for its enforcement.  Title VII would prohibit precisely the same employment practices, and be enforced in precisely the same manner, even if no State made additional employment practices unlawful.  Quite simply, Title VII is neutral on the subject of all employment practices it does not prohibit. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  We fail to see how federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 463 U. S. 104</a></p><p> law would be impaired by preemption of a state law prohibiting conduct that federal law permitted.</p>\n<p>ERISA\'s structure and legislative history, while not particularly illuminating with respect to \xc2\xa7 514(d), caution against applying it too expansively.  As we have detailed above, Congress applied the principle of preemption "in its broadest sense to foreclose any non-Federal regulation of employee benefit plans," creating only very limited exceptions to preemption.  120 Cong.Rec. 29197 (1974) (remarks of Rep. Dent); <em>see id.</em> at 29933 (remarks of Sen. Williams).  Sections 4(b)(3) and 514(b), which list specific exceptions, do not refer to state fair employment laws.  While \xc2\xa7 514(d) may operate to exempt provisions of state laws upon which federal laws depend for their enforcement, the combination of Congress\' enactment of an all-inclusive preemption provision and its enumeration of narrow, specific exceptions to that provision makes us reluctant to expand \xc2\xa7 514(d) into a more general saving clause.</p>\n<p>The references to employment discrimination in the legislative history of ERISA provide no basis for an expansive construction of \xc2\xa7 514(d).  During floor debates, Senator Mondale questioned whether the Senate bill should be amended to require nondiscrimination in ERISA plans.  Senator Williams replied that no such amendment was necessary or desirable.  He noted that Title VII already prohibited discrimination in benefit plans, and stated:</p>\n<p>"I believe that the thrust toward centralized administration of nondiscrimination in employment must be maintained.  And I believe this can be done by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under terms of existing law."</p>\n<p>119 Cong.Rec. 30409 (1973).  Senator Mondale,</p>\n<p>"with the understanding that nondiscrimination in pension and profit-sharing plans is fully required under the Equal Employment Opportunity Act,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 30410, chose not to offer a nondiscrimination amendment.  This colloquy was repeated on the floor of the House by Representatives Abzug and Dent. 120 Cong.Rec. 4726 (1974). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 463 U. S. 105</a></p><p></p>\n<p>These exchanges demonstrate only the obvious:  that \xc2\xa7 514(d) does not preempt federal law.  The speakers referred to federal law, the EEOC, and the need for centralized enforcement.  The limited legislative history dealing with \xc2\xa7 514(d) is entirely consistent with Congress\' goal of ensuring that employers would not face "conflicting or inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefit plans," 120 Cong.Rec. 29933 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Williams).  Congress might well have believed, had it considered the precise issue before us, that ERISA plans should be subject only to the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VII, and not also to state laws prohibiting other forms of discrimination.  By establishing benefit plan regulation "as exclusively a federal concern," <em>Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc.,</em> 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/504/case.html#523">451 U. S. 523</a></span>, Congress minimized the need for interstate employers to administer their plans differently in each State in which they have employees. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>We recognize that our interpretation of \xc2\xa7 514(d) as requiring partial preemption of state fair employment laws may cause certain practical problems. Courts and state agencies, rather than considering whether employment practices are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 463 U. S. 106</a></p><p> unlawful under a broad state law, will have to determine whether they are prohibited by Title VII.  If they are not, the state law will be superseded and the agency will lack authority to act.  It seems more than likely, however, that state agencies and courts are sufficiently familiar with Title VII to apply it in their adjudicative processes.  Many States look to Title VII law as a matter of course in defining the scope of their own laws. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  In any event, these minor practical difficulties do not represent the kind of "impairment" or "modification" of <em>federal</em> law that can save a state law from preemption under \xc2\xa7 514(d).  To the extent that our construction of ERISA causes any problems in the administration of state fair employment laws, those problems are the result of congressional choice, and should be addressed by congressional action.  To give \xc2\xa7 514(d) the broad construction advocated by appellants would defeat the intent of Congress to provide comprehensive preemption of state law.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Disability Benefits Law presents a different problem. Section 514(a) of ERISA preempts state laws that relate to benefit plans "described in section 4(a) and not exempt under section 4(b)."  Consequently, while the Disability Benefits Law plainly is a state law relating to employee benefit plans, it is not preempted if the plans to which it relates are exempt from ERISA under \xc2\xa7 4(b).  Section 4(b)(3) exempts "any employee benefit plan . . . maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable . . . disability insurance laws."  The Disability Benefits Law is a "disability insurance law," of course; the difficulty is that at least some of the benefit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 463 U. S. 107</a></p><p> plans offered by the Airlines provide benefits not required by that law.  The question is whether, with respect to those among the Airlines using multibenefit plans, the Disability Benefits Law\'s requirement that employers provide particular benefits remains enforceable.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals recognized, \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3) excludes "plans," not portions of plans, from ERISA coverage; those portions of the Airlines\' multibenefit plans maintained to comply with the Disability Benefits Law, therefore, are not exempt from ERISA, and are not subject to state regulation.  There is no reason to believe that Congress used the word "plan" in \xc2\xa7 4(b) to refer to individual benefits offered by an employee benefit plan.  To the contrary, \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3)\'s use of the word "solely" demonstrates that the purpose of the entire plan must be to comply with an applicable disability insurance law.  As the Court noted in <em>Alessi,</em> plans that not only provide benefits required by such a law, but also "more broadly serve employee needs as a result of collective bargaining," are not exempt.  451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/504/case.html#523">451 U. S. 523</a></span>, n. 20.  The test is not one of the employer\'s motive -- any employer could claim that it provided disability benefits altruistically, to attract good employees, or to increase employee productivity, as well as to obey state law -- but whether the plan, as an administrative unit, provides only those benefits required by the applicable state law.</p>\n<p>Any other rule, it seems to us, would make little sense.  Under the District Court\'s approach, for which appellants argue here, one portion of a multibenefit plan would be subject only to state regulation, while other portions would be exclusively within the federal domain.  An employer with employees in several States would find its plan subject to a different jurisdictional pattern of regulation in each State, depending on what benefits the State mandated under disability, workmen\'s compensation, and unemployment compensation laws.  The administrative impracticality of permitting mutually exclusive pockets of federal and state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 463 U. S. 108</a></p><p> jurisdiction within a plan is apparent.  We see no reason to torture the plain language of \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3) to achieve this result.  Only separately administered disability plans maintained solely to comply with the Disability Benefits Law are exempt from ERISA coverage under \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3).</p>\n<p>This is not to say, however, that the Airlines are completely free to circumvent the Disability Benefits Law by adopting plans that combine disability benefits inferior to those required by that law with other types of benefits.  Congress surely did not intend, at the same time it preserved the role of state disability laws, to make enforcement of those laws impossible.  A State may require an employer to maintain a disability plan complying with state law as a separate administrative unit.  Such a plan would be exempt under \xc2\xa7 4(b)(3).  The fact that state law permits employers to meet their state law obligations by including disability insurance benefits in a multibenefit ERISA plan, <em>see</em> N.Y. Work.Comp.Law App. \xc2\xa7 355.6 (McKinney Supp.1982-1983), does not make the state law wholly unenforceable as to employers who choose that option.</p>\n<p>In other words, while the State may not require an employer to alter its ERISA plan, it may force the employer to choose between providing disability benefits in a separately administered plan and including the state-mandated benefits in its ERISA plan.  If the State is not satisfied that the ERISA plan comports with the requirements of its disability insurance law, it may compel the employer to maintain a separate plan that does comply.  The Court of Appeals erred, therefore, in holding that appellants are not at all free to enforce the Disability Benefits Law against those appellees that provide disability benefits as part of multibenefit plans.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>We hold that New York\'s Human Rights Law is preempted with respect to ERISA benefit plans only insofar as it prohibits practices that are lawful under federal law.  To </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 463 U. S. 109</a></p><p> this extent, the judgments of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.  To the extent the Court of Appeals held any more of the Human Rights Law preempted, we vacate its judgments and remand the cases.</p>\n<p>We further hold that the Disability Benefits Law is not preempted by ERISA, although New York may not enforce its provisions through regulation of ERISA-covered benefit plans.  We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals\' judgment in the Airlines\' case on this ground and remand that case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>No costs are allowed.</p>\n<p><em>It s so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* Together with <em>Shaw, Acting Commissioner, New York State Division of Human Rights v.

In the Airlines\' case, the District Court enjoined appellants from enforcing the Human Rights Law against the Airlines\' benefit plans with respect to the period from December 20, 1976 (the date of the New York Court of Appeals\' decision in <em>Brooklyn Union Gas</em>) to April 29, 1979 (the effective date of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act).  <em>See</em> App. to Juris.Statement A75.

Although <em>Pervel</em> ordinarily would have been controlling, the court concluded that it was bound by this Court\'s dismissals, for want of a substantial federal question, of the appeals in <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v.

In those cases, the state courts had determined that state fair employment laws similar to the Human Rights Law were not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals observed that this Court had denied certiorari in <em>Pervel,</em> which reached the opposite result, only a week before dismissing the appeal in <em>Minnesota Mining.</em>  Understandably viewing this sequence of events as "rather mystifying," 650 F.2d at 1296, the court noted that dismissals of appeals are binding precedents for the lower courts, <em>see Hicks v.

The controversy about the Human Rights Law has not thereby become less significant, however; the Human Rights Law and other state fair employment laws may contain proscriptions broader than Title VII in other respects, <em>see, e.g.,</em> N.Y. Exec. Law. \xc2\xa7 296.1(a) (McKinney 1982) (prohibiting discrimination in employment based on marital status), and there is uncertainty about whether state fair employment laws may be enforced to the extent they prohibit the same practices as Title VII.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision today in <em>Franchise Tax Board v.

S. 1</a></span>, does not call into question the lower courts\' jurisdiction to decide these cases.  <em>Franchise Tax Board</em> was an action seeking a declaration that state laws were <em>not</em> preempted by ERISA.  Here, in contrast, companies subject to ERISA regulation seek injunctions against enforcement of state laws they claim <em>are</em> preempted by ERISA, as well as declarations that those laws are preempted.</p>\n<p>It is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.  <em>See Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U.

A plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation, on the ground that such regulation is preempted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331 to resolve.  <em>See Smith v.

Finding that Congress "meant to establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern," 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/504/case.html#523">451 U.

S. 524</a></span>, the Court held that the law was preempted.  The Court relied not on \xc2\xa7 514(a)\'s language and legislative history, but on the state law\'s frustration of congressional intent.  That kind of tension is not present in these cases; while federal law did not prohibit pregnancy discrimination during the relevant period, Congress, in enacting ERISA, demonstrated no desire to permit it.  <em>Alessi\'s</em> recognition of the exclusive federal role in regulating benefit plans, therefore, is instructive, but not dispositive.  <em>See also Franchise Tax Board v.

Such a formulation raised the possibility of endless litigation over the validity of State action that might impinge on Federal regulation, as well as opening the door to multiple and potentially conflicting State laws hastily contrived to deal with some particular aspect of private welfare or pension benefit plans not clearly connected to the Federal regulatory scheme."</p>\n<p>"Although the desirability of further regulation -- at either the State or Federal level -- undoubtedly warrants further attention, on balance, the emergence of a comprehensive and pervasive Federal interest and the interests of uniformity with respect to interstate plans required -- but for certain exceptions -- the displacement of State action in the field of private employee benefit programs."</p>\n<p>Senator Javits noted that the conferees had assigned the Congressional Pension Task Force the responsibility of studying and evaluating ERISA preemption in order to determine whether modifications in the preemption policy would be necessary.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>See</em> ERISA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3021, 3022(a)(4), 88 Stat. 999 (formerly codified as 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1221, 1222(a)(5)).  After a period of monitoring by the Task Force, and hearings by the Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, a Report was issued evaluating ERISA\'s preemption provisions.  The Report expressed approval of ERISA\'s broad preemption of state law, explaining that "the Federal interest and the need for national uniformity are so great that enforcement of state regulation should be precluded."  H.R.Rep. No. 94-1785, p. 47 (1977).  The Report recommended only that the exceptions described in \xc2\xa7 514(b) be narrowed still further.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Some state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law "relates to" the plan.  <em>Cf. American Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Merry,</em> 592 F.2d 118, 121 (CA2 1979) (state garnishment of a spouse\'s pension income to enforce alimony and support orders is not preempted).  The present litigation plainly does not present a borderline question, and we express no views about where it would be appropriate to draw the line.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also</em> \xc2\xa7 1104, 78 Stat. 268, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000h-4.  The Court of Appeals properly rejected the simplistic "double saving clause" argument -- that, because ERISA does not preempt Title VII, and Title VII does not preempt state fair employment laws, ERISA does not preempt such laws.  666 F.2d at 25-26.  Title VII does not transform state fair employment laws into federal laws that \xc2\xa7 514(d) saves from ERISA preemption.  Furthermore, since Title VII\'s saving clause applies to all state laws with which it is not in conflict, rather than just to nondiscrimination laws, and since many federal laws contain nonpreemption provisions, the double saving clause argument, taken to its logical extreme, would save almost all state laws from preemption.  The question whether preemption of state fair employment laws would "impair" Title VII, in light of Title VII\'s reliance on state laws and agencies, is the more difficult question we address in the text.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Preemption of this sort not only would eliminate a forum for resolving disputes that, in certain situations, may be more convenient than the EEOC, but also would substantially increase the EEOC\'s workload.  Because the EEOC would be unable to refer claims to state agencies for initial processing, those claims that would have been settled at the state level would require the EEOC\'s attention.  Claims that would not have been settled at the state level, but would have produced an administrative record, would come to the EEOC without such a record.  The EEOC\'s options for coping with this added burden, barring discoveries of reserves in the agency budget, would be to devote less time to each individual case or to accept longer delays in handling cases.  The inevitable result of complete preemption, in short, would be less effective enforcement of Title VII.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants argue that preemption of the Human Rights Law\'s prohibition of pregnancy discrimination would impair Title VII, because that law encourages States to enact fair employment laws providing greater substantive protection than Title VII.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7, 11.  We have found no statutory language or legislative history suggesting that the federal interest in state fair employment laws extends any farther than saving such laws from preemption by Title VII itself.  As the court stated in <em>Pervel,</em> 468 F.Supp. at 493, "Title VII did not create new authority for state antidiscrimination laws; it simply left them where they were before the enactment of Title VII."</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act does not assist appellants.  Although the House Report observed that many employers already were subject to state laws prohibiting pregnancy discrimination, H.R.Rep. No. 95-948, pp. 9-11 (1978); <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 95-331, pp. 10-11 (1977), this observation subsequent to ERISA\'s enactment conveys no information about the intent of the Congress that passed ERISA.  The conferees did not even mention ERISA; evidently, they simply failed to consider whether ERISA plans were subject to state laws prohibiting pregnancy discrimination.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>An employer with employees in many States might find that the most efficient way to provide benefits to those employees is through a single employee benefit plan.  Obligating the employer to satisfy the varied and perhaps conflicting requirements of particular state fair employment laws, as well as the requirements of Title VII, would make administration of a uniform nationwide plan more difficult.  The employer might choose to offer a number of plans, each tailored to the laws of particular States; the inefficiency of such a system presumably would be paid for by lowering benefit levels.  Alternatively, assuming that the state laws were not in conflict, the employer could comply with the laws of all States in a uniform plan.  To offset the additional expenses, the employer presumably would reduce wages or eliminate those benefits not required by any State. Another means by which the employer could retain its uniform nationwide plan would be by eliminating classes of benefits that are subject to state requirements with which the employer is unwilling to comply.  ERISA\'s comprehensive preemption of state law was meant to minimize this sort of interference with the administration of employee benefit plans.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Arizona Civic Rights Division v.
