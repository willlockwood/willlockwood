The order of the trial court, issued June 30, ordered the New York Times Co. and Myron Farber, a reporter for the New York Times, to produce certain documents covered by a subpoena served upon them in New York pursuant to the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, N.J.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2A:81-18 to 2A: 81-23 (West 1976).  The subpoena was issued at the behest of the defendant in the New Jersey murder trial; and the documents, which were sought for the purpose of cross-examining prosecution witnesses, included statements, pictures, recordings, and notes of interviews with respect to witnesses for the defense or prosecution.  The subpoena was challenged by applicants on the grounds that it was overbroad and sought irrelevant material, and hence was illegal under state law; that it violated the state Reporter\'s Shield Law; and that it invaded rights of the reporter and the press protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>In denying the motion to quash and in ordering <em>in camera</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1302">Page 439 U.
