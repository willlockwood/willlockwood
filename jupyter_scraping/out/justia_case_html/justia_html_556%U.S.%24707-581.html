PYETT et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93581.\xe2\x80\x83Argued December 1, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 1, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">Respondents are members of the Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ (Union).  Under the National Labor Relations Act, the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees within the building-services industry in New York City, which includes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons.  The Union has exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their \xe2\x80\x9crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7159(a), and engages in industry-wide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York City real-estate industry.  The agreement between the Union and the RAB is embodied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Contractors and Building Owners (CBA).  The CBA requires union members to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding arbitration under the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s grievance and dispute resolution procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB.  It owns and operates the New York City office building where respondents worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities.  Respondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Industries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.  After 14 Penn Plaza, with the Union\xe2\x80\x99s consent, engaged a unionized security contractor affiliated with Temco to provide licensed security guards for the building, Temco reassigned respondents to jobs as porters and cleaners.  Contending that these reassignments led to a loss in income, other damages, and were otherwise less desirable than their former positions, respondents asked the Union to file grievances alleging, among other things, that petitioners violated the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ban on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on the basis of their age in violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 <em>et seq</em>.  The Union requested arbitration under the CBA, but after the initial hearing, withdrew the age-discrimination claims on the ground that its consent to the new security contract precluded it from objecting to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reassignments as discriminatory.  Respondents then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that petitioners had violated their ADEA rights, and the EEOC issued each of them a right-to-sue notice.  In the ensuing lawsuit, the District Court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to compel arbitration of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 age discrimination claims.  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/index.html">415 U. S. 36</a>, forbids enforcement of collective-bargaining provisions requiring arbitration of ADEA claims. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A provision in a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Examination of the two federal statutes at issue here, the ADEA and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), yields a straightforward answer to the question presented.  The Union and the RAB, negotiating on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bargained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimination claims, including ADEA claims, would be resolved in arbitration.  This freely negotiated contractual term easily qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cconditio[n] of employment\xe2\x80\x9d subject to mandatory bargaining under the NLRA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7159(a).  See, <em>e.g., Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/190/index.html">501 U. S. 190</a>, 199.  As in any contractual negotiation, a union may agree to the inclusion of an arbitration provision in a collective-bargaining agreement in return for other concessions from the employer, and courts generally may not interfere in this bargained-for exchange.  See <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Magnavox Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/322/index.html">415 U. S. 322</a>, 328.  Thus, the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision must be honored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular class of grievances from the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s broad sweep.  See <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U. S. 614</a>, 628.  It does not.  This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration of claims brought under the statute.  See <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a>, 26\xe2\x80\x9333.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this appeal.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under the <em>Gardner-Denver </em>line of cases.  Respondents incorrectly interpret <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and its progeny as holding that an agreement to arbitrate ADEA claims provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement cannot waive an individual employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to a judicial forum under federal antidiscrimination statutes..  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The facts underlying <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and its progeny reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule they engendered.  Those cases \xe2\x80\x9cdid not involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe quite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gilmer, supra, </em>at 35.  <em>Gardner-Denver</em> does not control the outcome where, as here, the collective-bargaining agreement\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Apart from their narrow holdings, the <em>Gardner-Denver</em> line of cases included broad dicta highly critical of using arbitration to vindicate statutory antidiscrimination rights.  That skepticism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.  First, contrary to <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous assumption, 415 U. S., at 51, the decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek relief from a court in the first instance, see, <em>e.g., Gilmer</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 26.  Second, <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken suggestion that certain informal features of arbitration made it a forum \xe2\x80\x9cwell suited to the resolution of contractual disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9ca comparatively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of [employment] rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U. S., at 56<em>,</em> has been corrected.  See, <em>e.g., Shearson/American Express Inc.</em> v. <em>McMahon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/220/index.html">482 U. S. 220</a>, 232.  Third, <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s concern that, in arbitration, a union may subordinate an individual employee\xe2\x80\x99s interests to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit, 415 U. S., at 58, n.\xc2\xa019, cannot be relied on to introduce a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.  Until Congress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the <em>Gardner-Denver </em>dicta, there is \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitsubishi, supra,</em> at 628.  In any event, the conflict-of-interest argument amounts to an unsustainable collateral attack on the NLRA, see <em>Emporium Capwell Co. </em>v. <em>Western Addition Community Organization</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/50/index.html">420 U. S. 50</a>, 62, and Congress has accounted for the conflict in several ways: union members may bring a duty of fair representation claim against the union; a union can be subjected to direct liability under the ADEA if it discriminates on the basis of age; and union members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the National Labor Relations Board.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9323. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that the CBA does not clearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims were not raised in the lower courts, they have been forfeited.  Moreover, although a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be upheld, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mitsubishi, supra, </em>at 637, and n.\xc2\xa019, this Court is not positioned to resolve in the first instance respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the CBA allows the Union to prevent them from effectively vindicating their federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum, given that this question would require resolution of contested factual allegations, was not fully briefed here or below, and is not fairly encompassed within the question presented.  Resolution now would be particularly inappropriate in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation to invalidate arbitration agreements based on speculation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala.</em> v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/79/index.html">531 U. S. 79</a>.<em> </em>Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9325. </p>\n<p align="left">498 F.\xc2\xa03d 88, reversed and remanded. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.

Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as amended, the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees within the building-services industry in New York City, which includes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7159(a).  In this role, the Union has exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their \xe2\x80\x9crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Since the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, the Union has engaged in industry-wide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, Inc.

It owns and operates the New York City office building where, prior to August 2003, respondents worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities.  Respondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Industries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.  In August 2003, with the Union\xe2\x80\x99s consent, 14 Penn Plaza engaged Spartan Security, a unionized security services contractor and affiliate of Temco, to provide licensed security guards to staff the lobby and entrances of its building.  Because this rendered respondents\xe2\x80\x99 lobby services unnecessary, Temco reassigned them to jobs as night porters and light duty cleaners in other locations in the building.  Respondents contend that these reassignments led to a loss in income, caused them emotional distress, and were otherwise less desirable than their former positions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At respondents\xe2\x80\x99 request, the Union filed grievances challenging the reassignments.  The grievances alleged that petitioners: (1) violated the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s ban on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on account of their age; (2) violated seniority rules by failing to promote one of the respondents to a handyman position; and (3) failed to equitably rotate overtime.  After failing to obtain relief on any of these claims through the grievance process, the Union requested arbitration under the CBA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the initial arbitration hearing, the Union withdrew the first set of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 grievances\xe2\x80\x94the age-discrimination claims\xe2\x80\x94from arbitration.  Because it had consented to the contract for new security personnel at 14 Penn Plaza, the Union believed that it could not legitimately object to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reassignments as discriminatory.  But the Union continued to arbitrate the seniority and overtime claims, and, after several hearings, the claims were denied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2004, while the arbitration was ongoing but after the Union withdrew the age-discrimination claims, respondents filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that petitioners had violated their rights under the ADEA.  Approximately one month later, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights, which explained that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98review of the evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 fail[ed] to indicate that a violation ha[d] occurred,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and notified each respondent of his right to sue.  <em>Pyett</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania Building Co.</em>, 498 F.\xc2\xa03d 88, 91 (CA2 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents thereafter filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that their reassignment violated the ADEA and state and local laws prohibiting age discrimination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims pursuant to \xc2\xa73 and \xc2\xa74 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73, 4.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The District Court denied the motion because under Second Circuit precedent, \xe2\x80\x9ceven a clear and unmistakable union-negotiated waiver of a right to litigate certain federal and state statutory claims in a judicial forum is unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a.  Respondents immediately appealed the ruling under \xc2\xa716 of the FAA, which authorizes an interlocutory appeal of \xe2\x80\x9can order \xe2\x80\xa6 refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdenying a petition under section 4 of this title to order arbitration to proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U.

According to the Court of Appeals, it could not compel arbitration of the dispute because <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, which \xe2\x80\x9cremains good law,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>held \xe2\x80\x9cthat a collective bargaining agreement could not waive covered workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights to a judicial forum for causes of action created by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 92, 91, n.\xc2\xa03 (citing <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, 415 U. S., at 49\xe2\x80\x9351).  The Court of Appeals observed that the <em>Gardner-Denver</em> decision was in tension with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s more recent decision in <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a> (1991), which \xe2\x80\x9cheld that an individual employee who had agreed individually to waive his right to a federal forum <em>could</em> be compelled to arbitrate a federal age discrimination claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 91, n.\xc2\xa03 (citing <em>Gilmer</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 33\xe2\x80\x9335; emphasis in original).  The Court of Appeals also noted that this Court previously declined to resolve this tension in <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Universal Maritime Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/70/index.html"></a><a href="/us/525/70/index.html">525 U.

As a result, an individual employee would be free to choose compulsory arbitration under <em>Gilmer</em>, but a labor union could not collectively bargain for arbitration on behalf of its members.  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), to address the issue left unresolved in <em>Wright</em>, which continues to divide the Courts of Appeals,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The NLRA governs federal labor-relations law.

This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration of claims brought under the statute.  See <em>Gilmer</em>,<em> </em>500 U.

And \xe2\x80\x9cif Congress intended the substantive protection afforded by the ADEA to include protection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum, that intention will be deducible from text or legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U. S., at 29 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  The Court determined that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the text of the ADEA or its legislative history explicitly precludes arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The Court also concluded that arbitrating ADEA disputes would not undermine the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cremedial and deterrent function.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the end, the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralized attacks\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cthe adequacy of arbitration procedures\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient to preclude arbitration of statutory claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 30, because there was no evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress, in enacting the ADEA, intended to preclude arbitration of claims under that Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Gilmer </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the ADEA fully applies in the collective-bargaining context.  Nothing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.  This Court has required only that an agreement to arbitrate statutory antidiscrimination claims be \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly stated\xe2\x80\x9d in the collective-bargaining agreement.  <em>Wright</em>, 525 U. S., at 80 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The CBA under review here meets that obligation.  Respondents incorrectly counter that an individual employee must personally \xe2\x80\x9cwaive\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9c[substantive] right\xe2\x80\x9d to proceed in court for a waiver to be \xe2\x80\x9cknowing and voluntary\xe2\x80\x9d under the ADEA.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7626(f)(1).  As explained below, however, the agreement to arbitrate ADEA claims is not the waiver of a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is employed in the ADEA.  <em>Wright</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 80; see<em> infra</em>,<em> </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Indeed, if the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d referred to in \xc2\xa7626(f)(1) included the prospective waiver of the right to bring an ADEA claim in court, even a waiver signed by an individual employee would be invalid as the statute also prevents individuals from \xe2\x80\x9cwaiv[ing] rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7626(f)(1)(C).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Examination of the two federal statutes at issue in this case, therefore, yields a straightforward answer to the question presented: The NLRA provided the Union and the RAB with statutory authority to collectively bargain for arbitration of workplace discrimination claims, and Congress did not terminate that authority with respect to federal age-discrimination claims in the ADEA.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this appeal.  Congress has chosen to allow arbitration of ADEA claims.  The Judiciary must respect that choice.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under the <em>Gardner-Denver </em>line of cases.  Respondents interpret <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and its progeny to hold that \xe2\x80\x9ca union cannot waive an employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to a judicial forum under the federal antidiscrimination statutes\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9callowing the union to waive this right would substitute the union\xe2\x80\x99s interests for the employee\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 12.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccombination of union control over the process and inherent conflict of interest with respect to discrimination claims,\xe2\x80\x9d they argue, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided the foundation for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding [in <em>Gardner-Denver</em>] that arbitration under a collective-bargaining agreement could not preclude an individual employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to bring a lawsuit in court to vindicate a statutory discrimination claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The holding of <em>Gardner-Denver</em> is not as broad as respondents suggest.  The employee in that case was covered by a collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination against any employee on account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry\xe2\x80\x9d and that guaranteed that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o employee will be discharged \xe2\x80\xa6 except for just cause.\xe2\x80\x9d 415 U. S., at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The agreement also included a \xe2\x80\x9cmultistep grievance procedure\xe2\x80\x9d that culminated in compulsory arbitration for any \xe2\x80\x9cdifferences aris[ing] between the Company and the Union as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany trouble aris[ing] in the plant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 40\xe2\x80\x9341 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The employee was discharged for allegedly producing too many defective parts while working for the respondent as a drill operator.  He filed a grievance with his union claiming that he was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unjustly discharged\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98just cause\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d provision within the CBA.  Then at the final prearbitration step of the grievance process, the employee added a claim that he was discharged because of his race.  <em>Id.</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x9342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The arbitrator ultimately ruled that the employee had been \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discharged for just cause,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cmade no reference to [the] claim of racial discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 42.  After obtaining a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, the employee filed a claim in Federal District Court, alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court issued a decision, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which granted summary judgment to the employer because it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe claim of racial discrimination had been submitted to the arbitrator and resolved adversely to [the employee].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9chaving voluntarily elected to pursue his grievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of the collective-bargaining agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d the employee was \xe2\x80\x9cbound by the arbitral decision\xe2\x80\x9d and precluded from suing his employer on any other grounds, such as a statutory claim under Title VII.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court reversed the judgment on the narrow ground that the arbitration was not preclusive because the collective-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.  As a result, the lower courts erred in relying on the \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine of election of remedies\xe2\x80\x9d to bar the employee\xe2\x80\x99s Title VII claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat doctrine, which refers to situations where an individual pursues remedies that are legally or factually inconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d with each other, did not apply to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s dual pursuit of arbitration and a Title VII discrimination claim in district court.  The employee\xe2\x80\x99s collective-bargaining agreement did not mandate arbitration of statutory antidiscrimination claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs the proctor of the bargain, the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s task is to effectuate the intent of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 53.  Because the collective-bargaining agreement gave the arbitrator \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to resolve only questions of contractual rights,\xe2\x80\x9d his decision could not prevent the employee from bringing the Title VII claim in federal court \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of whether certain contractual rights are similar to, or duplicative of, the substantive rights secured by Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 53\xe2\x80\x9354; see also <em>id.</em>, at 50.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also explained that the employee had not waived his right to pursue his Title VII claim in federal court by participating in an arbitration that was premised on the same underlying facts as the Title VII claim.  See <em>id.,</em> at 52.  Thus, whether the legal theory of preclusion advanced by the employer rested on \xe2\x80\x9cthe doctrines of election of remedies\xe2\x80\x9d or was recast \xe2\x80\x9cas resting instead on the doctrine of equitable estoppel and on themes of res judicata and collateral estoppel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 49, n.\xc2\xa010 (internal quotation marks omitted), it could not prevail in light of the collective-bargaining agreement\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address arbitration of Title VII claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 46, n.\xc2\xa06 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e hold that the federal policy favoring arbitration does not establish that an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of a <em>contractual </em>claim is dispositive of a statutory claim under Title VII\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions following <em>Gardner-Denver </em>have not broadened its holding to make it applicable to the facts of this case.  In <em>Barrentine</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/index.html">450 U. S. 728</a> (1981), the Court considered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an employee may bring an action in federal district court, alleging a violation of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, \xe2\x80\xa6 after having unsuccessfully submitted a wage claim based on the same underlying facts to a joint grievance committee pursuant to the provisions of his union\xe2\x80\x99s collective-bargaining agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 729\xe2\x80\x93730.  The Court held that the unsuccessful arbitration did not preclude the federal lawsuit.  Like the collective-bargaining agreement in <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, the arbitration provision under review in <em>Barrentine </em>did not expressly reference the statutory claim at issue.  See 450 U. S., at 731, n.\xc2\xa05.  The Court thus reiterated that an \xe2\x80\x9carbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s power is both derived from, and limited by, the collective-bargaining agreement\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[h]is task is limited to construing the meaning of the collective-bargaining agreement so as to effectuate the collective intent of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 744.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>McDonald</em> v. <em>West Branch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/284/index.html">466 U. S. 284</a> (1984), was decided along similar lines.  The question presented in that case was \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a federal court may accord preclusive effect to an unappealed arbitration award in a case brought under [42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 285.  The Court declined to fashion such a rule, again explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority derives solely from the contract, <em>Barrentine</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 744, an arbitrator may not have authority to enforce \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x9d when that provision is left unaddressed by the arbitration agreement.  <em>Id.</em>, at 290.  Accordingly, as in both <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and <em>Barrentine</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>McDonald</em> hinged on the scope of the collective-bargaining agreement and the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s parallel mandate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts underlying <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, <em>Barrentine</em>, and <em>McDonald </em>reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule arising from that trilogy of decisions.  Summarizing those opinions in <em>Gilmer</em>, this Court made clear that the <em>Gardner-Denver </em>line of cases \xe2\x80\x9cdid not involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U. S., at 35.  Those decisions instead \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved the quite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.  Since the employees there had not agreed to arbitrate their statutory claims, and the labor arbitrators were not authorized to resolve such claims, the arbitration in those cases understandably was held not to preclude subsequent statutory actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Wright</em>, 525 U. S., at 76; <em>Livadas</em> v. <em>Bradshaw</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/107/index.html">512 U. S. 107</a>, 127, n.\xc2\xa021 (1994).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and its progeny thus do not control the outcome where, as is the case here, the collective-bargaining agreement\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that apart from their narrow holdings, the <em>Gardner-Denver</em> line of cases included broad dicta that was highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindication of statutory antidiscrimination rights.  That skepticism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>erroneously assumed that an agreement to submit statutory discrimination claims to arbitration was tantamount to a waiver of those rights.  See 415 U. S., at 51. (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here can be no prospective <em>waiver</em> of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s rights under Title VII\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  For this reason, the Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights conferred [by Title VII] can form no part of the collective-bargaining process since waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id.</em>, at 56 (\xe2\x80\x9cwe have long recognized that \xe2\x80\x98the choice of forums inevitably affects the scope of the substantive right to be vindicated\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>U. S. Bulk Carriers, Inc.</em> v. <em>Arguelles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/351/index.html">400 U. S. 351</a>, 359\xe2\x80\x93360 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court was correct in concluding that federal antidiscrimination rights may not be prospectively waived, see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7626(f)(1)(C); see <em>supra, </em>at 9, but it confused an agreement to arbitrate those statutory claims with a prospective waiver of the substantive right.  The decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek relief from a court in the first instance.  See <em>Gilmer</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 26 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[B]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em>, 473 U. S., at 628)).  This \xe2\x80\x9cCourt has been quite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can be enforced under the FAA without contravening the policies of congressional enactments giving employees specific protection against discrimination prohibited by federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc.</em>, 532 U. S., at 123. The suggestion in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>that the decision to arbitrate statutory discrimination claims was tantamount to a substantive waiver of those rights, therefore, reveals a distorted understanding of the compromise made when an employee agrees to compulsory arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this respect, <em>Gardner-Denver </em>is a direct descendant of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Wilko</em> v. <em>Swan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/427/index.html"></a><a href="/us/346/427/index.html">346 U. S. 427</a> (1953), which held that an agreement to arbitrate claims under the Securities Act of 1933 was unenforceable.  See <em>id.</em>, at 438.  The Court subsequently overruled <em>Wilko</em> and, in so doing, characterized the decision as<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cpervaded by \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98the old judicial hostility to arbitration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em> v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/477/index.html">490 U. S. 477</a>, 480 (1989).  The Court added: \xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that <em>Wilko</em> rested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants, it has fallen far out of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 481; see also <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 626\xe2\x80\x93627 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are well past the time when judicial suspicion of the desirability of arbitration and of the competence of arbitral tribunals inhibited the development of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution\xe2\x80\x9d).  The timeworn \xe2\x80\x9cmistrust of the arbitral process\xe2\x80\x9d harbored by the Court in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>thus weighs against reliance on anything more than its core holding.  <em>Shearson/American Express Inc.</em> v. <em>McMahon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/220/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/220/index.html">482 U.

Indeed, in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cradical change, over two decades, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s receptivity to arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wright</em>, 525 U.

According to the Court, the \xe2\x80\x9cfactfinding process in arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cnot equivalent to judicial factfinding\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cinformality of arbitral procedure \xe2\x80\xa6 makes arbitration a less appropriate forum for final resolution of Title VII issues than the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 57, 58.  The Court also questioned the competence of arbitrators to decide federal statutory claims.  See <em>id</em>., at 57 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he specialized competence of arbitrators pertains primarily to the law of the shop, not the law of the land\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Barrentine</em>, 450 U.

In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cthe resolution of statutory or constitutional issues is a primary responsibility of courts, and judicial construction has proved especially necessary with respect to Title VII, whose broad language frequently can be given meaning only by reference to public law concepts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 57; see also <em>McDonald</em>, 466 U.

For example, the Court has \xe2\x80\x9crecognized that arbitral tribunals are readily capable of handling the factual and legal complexities of antitrust claims, notwithstanding the absence of judicial instruction and supervision\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason to assume at the outset that arbitrators will not follow the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McMahon</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 232; <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em>, 473 U. S., at 634 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe decline to indulge the presumption that the parties and arbitral body conducting a proceeding will be unable or unwilling to retain competent, conscientious, and impartial arbitrators\xe2\x80\x9d).  An arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to resolve complex questions of fact and law extends with equal force to discrimination claims brought under the ADEA.  Moreover, the recognition that arbitration procedures are more streamlined than federal litigation is not a basis for finding the forum somehow inadequate; the relative informality of arbitration is one of the chief reasons that parties select arbitration.  Parties \xe2\x80\x9ctrad[e] the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 628.  In any event, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is unlikely \xe2\x80\xa6 that age discrimination claims require more extensive discovery than other claims that we have found to be arbitrable, such as RICO and antitrust claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gilmer</em>, 500 U. S., at 31.  At bottom, objections centered on the nature of arbitration do not offer a credible basis for discrediting the choice of that forum to resolve statutory antidiscrimination claims.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>raised in a footnote a \xe2\x80\x9cfurther concern\xe2\x80\x9d regarding \xe2\x80\x9cthe union\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive control over the manner and extent to which an individual grievance is presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.

The Court suggested that in arbitration, as in the collective-bargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests of an individual employee to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>McDonald</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 291 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe union\xe2\x80\x99s interests and those of the individual employee are not always identical or even compatible.

Absent a constitutional barrier, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for us to substitute our view of \xe2\x80\xa6 policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Florida Dept. of Revenue</em> v. <em>Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congress is fully equipped \xe2\x80\x9cto identify any category of claims as to which agreements to arbitrate will be held unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 627.  Until Congress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the <em>Gardner-Denver </em>dicta, and seized on by respondents here, there is \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read\xe2\x80\x9d simply because of an alleged conflict of interest between a union and its members.  <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, </em>at 628.  This is a \xe2\x80\x9cbattl[e] that should be fought among the political branches and the industry.  Those parties should not seek to amend the statute by appeal to the Judicial Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/438/index.html">534 U. S. 438</a>, 462 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conflict-of-interest argument also proves too much. Labor unions certainly balance the economic interests of some employees against the needs of the larger work force as they negotiate collective-bargain agreements and implement them on a daily basis.  But this attribute of organized labor does not justify singling out an arbitration provision for disfavored treatment.  This \xe2\x80\x9cprinciple of majority rule\xe2\x80\x9d to which respondents object is in fact the central premise of the NLRA.  <em>Emporium Capwell Co. </em>v. <em>Western Addition Community Organization</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/50/index.html">420 U. S. 50</a>, 62 (1975).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn establishing a regime of majority rule, Congress sought to secure to all members of the unit the benefits of their collective strength and bargaining power, in full awareness that the superior strength of some individuals or groups might be subordinated to the interest of the majority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(footnote omitted); see also <em>Ford Motor Co.</em> v. <em>Huffman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/330/index.html">345 U. S. 330</a>, 338 (1953) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe complete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly to be expected\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Pennsylvania R. Co.</em> v. <em>Rychlik</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/480/index.html">352 U. S. 480</a>, 498 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  It was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 verdict that the benefits of organized labor outweigh the sacrifice of individual liberty that this system necessarily demands.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they were deprived of the right to pursue their ADEA claims in federal court by a labor union with a conflict of interest is therefore unsustainable; it amounts to a collateral attack on the NLRA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Congress has accounted for this conflict of interest in several ways.  As indicated above, the NLRA has been interpreted to impose a \xe2\x80\x9cduty of fair representation\xe2\x80\x9d on labor unions, which a union breaches \xe2\x80\x9cwhen its conduct toward a member of the bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Marquez</em> v. <em>Screen Actors</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/33/index.html">525 U. S. 33</a>, 44 (1998).  This duty extends to \xe2\x80\x9cchallenges leveled not only at a union\xe2\x80\x99s contract administration and enforcement efforts but at its negotiation activities as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beck</em>, 487 U. S., at 743 (citation omitted).<em> </em>Thus, a union is subject to liability under the NLRA if it illegally discriminates against older workers in either the formation or governance of the collective-bargaining agreement, such as by deciding not to pursue a grievance on behalf of one of its members for discriminatory reasons.  See <em>Vaca</em> v. <em>Sipes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/index.html">386 U. S. 171</a>, 177 (1967) (describing the duty of fair representation as the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory obligation to serve the interests of <em>all</em> members without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Respondents in fact brought a fair representation suit against the Union based on its withdrawal of support for their age-discrimination claims.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.  Given this avenue that Congress has made available to redress a union\xe2\x80\x99s violation of its duty to its members, it is particularly inappropriate to ask this Court to impose an artificial limitation on the collective-bargaining process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, a union is subject to liability under the ADEA if the union itself discriminates against its members on the basis of age.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(d); see also 1 B.\xc2\xa0Lindemann &amp; P.\xc2\xa0Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1575\xe2\x80\x931581 (4th ed. 2007) (explaining that a labor union may be held jointly liable with an employer under federal antidiscrimination laws for discriminating in the formation of a collective-bargaining agreement, knowingly acquiescing in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination, or inducing the employer to discriminate); cf. <em>Goodman</em> v. <em>Lukens Steel Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/656/index.html">482 U. S. 656</a>, 669 (1987).  Union members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the National Labor Relations Board, which may then seek judicial intervention under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  See <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Waffle House, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/279/index.html">534 U. S. 279</a>, 295\xe2\x80\x93296 (2002).  In sum, Congress has provided remedies for the situation where a labor union is less than vigorous in defense of its members\xe2\x80\x99 claims of discrimination under the ADEA.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents offer a series of arguments contending that the particular CBA at issue here does not clearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims.  See Brief for Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9347.  But respondents did not raise these contract-based arguments in the District Court or the Court of Appeals.  To the contrary, respondents acknowledged on appeal that the CBA provision requiring arbitration of their federal antidiscrimination statutory claims \xe2\x80\x9cis sufficiently explicit\xe2\x80\x9d in precluding their federal lawsuit.  Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellees in No. 06\xe2\x80\x933047\xe2\x80\x93cv(L) etc. (CA2), p.\xc2\xa09.  In light of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 litigating position, both lower courts assumed that the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause clearly applied to respondents and proceeded to decide the question left unresolved in <em>Wright</em>.  We granted review of the question presented on that understanding.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWithout cross-petitioning for certiorari, a prevailing party may, of course, \xe2\x80\x98defend its judgment on any ground properly raised below whether or not that ground was relied upon, rejected, or even considered by the District Court or the Court of Appeals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Granfinanciera, S.

This is not an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional case.\xe2\x80\x9d  As a result, we find that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 alternative arguments for affirmance have been forfeited.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/338/index.html">551 U.

We will not resurrect them on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also argue that the CBA operates as a substantive waiver of their ADEA rights because it not only precludes a federal lawsuit, but also allows the Union to block arbitration of these claims.  Brief for Respondents 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  Petitioners contest this characterization of the CBA, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 23\xe2\x80\x9327, and offer record evidence suggesting that the Union has allowed respondents to continue with the arbitration even though the Union has declined to participate, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a.  But not only does this question require resolution of contested factual allegations, it was not fully briefed to this or any court and is not fairly encompassed within the question presented, see this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 14.1(a).  Thus, although a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be upheld, see <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp</em>., 473 U. S., at 637, and n.\xc2\xa019; <em>Gilmer</em>, 500 U. S., at 29, we are not positioned to resolve in the first instance whether the CBA allows the Union to prevent respondents from \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively vindicating\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9cfederal statutory rights in the arbitral forum,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.</em>-<em>Ala.</em> v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/79/index.html">531 U.

Moreover, reading the legislative history in the manner suggested by respondents would create a direct conflict with the statutory text, which encourages the use of arbitration for dispute resolution without imposing any constraints on collective bargaining.

But his criticism lacks any basis.  We are not revisiting a settled issue or disregarding an earlier determination; the Court is simply deciding the question identified in <em>Wright </em>as unresolved.  See<em> supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936; see also <em>infra</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.<em> </em>And, contrary to Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 accusation, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x94not an alleged preference for arbitration\xe2\x80\x94that dictates the answer to the question presented.  As <em>Gilmer </em>explained, nothing in the text of Title VII or the ADEA precludes contractual arbitration, see <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and Justice Stevens has never suggested otherwise.  Rather, he has always contended that permitting the \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d of employment discrimination claims conflicts with his perception of \xe2\x80\x9cthe congressional purpose animating the ADEA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gilmer</em>, 500 U. S., at 41 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also <em>id.</em>, at 42 (\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly, it would not comport with the congressional objectives behind a statute seeking to enforce civil rights protected by Title VII to allow the very forces that had practiced discrimination to contract away the right to enforce civil rights in the courts\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The <em>Gilmer </em>Court did not adopt Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 personal view of the purposes underlying the ADEA, for good reason: That view is not embodied within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Accordingly, it is not the statutory text that Justice Stevens has sought to vindicate\xe2\x80\x94it is instead his own \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d for mandatory judicial review, which he disguises as a search for congressional purpose.  This Court is not empowered to incorporate such a preference into the text of a federal statute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  It is for this reason, and not because of a \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy favoring arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>post</em>, at 1, 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), that the Court overturned <em>Wilko</em> v. <em>Swan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/427/index.html"></a><a href="/us/346/427/index.html">346 U.

S. 36</a> (1974), answers the question presented in this case.  My concern regarding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s subversion of precedent to the policy favoring arbitration prompts these additional remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the absence of change in any relevant statutory provision, the Court has recently retreated from, and in some cases reversed, prior decisions based on its changed view of the merits of arbitration.  Previously, the Court approached with caution questions involving a union\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to raise statutory claims in a federal judicial forum.  After searching the text and purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court in <em>Gardner-Denver</em> held that a clause of a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) requiring arbitration of discrimination claims could not waive an employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to a judicial forum for statutory claims.  See 415 U. S., at 51.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rested on several features of the statute, including the individual nature of the rights it confers, the broad remedial powers it grants federal courts, and its expressed preference for overlapping remedies.  See <em>id.</em>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9348.  The Court also noted the problem of entrusting a union with certain arbitration decisions given the potential conflict between the collective interest and the interests of an individual employee seeking to assert his rights.  See <em>id.</em>, at 58, n.\xc2\xa019. <em> </em>That concern later provided a basis for our decisions in <em>Barrentine</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/index.html">450 U. S. 728</a>, 742 (1981), and <em>McDonald</em> v. <em>West Branch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/284/index.html">466 U. S. 284</a>, 291 (1984), which similarly held that a CBA may not commit enforcement of certain rights-creating statutes exclusively to a union-controlled arbitration process.  Congress has taken no action signaling disagreement with those decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutes construed by the Court in the foregoing cases and in <em>Wilko</em> v. <em>Swan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/427/index.html">346 U. S. 427</a> (1953), have not since been amended in any relevant respect.  But the Court has in a number of cases replaced our predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 statutory analysis with judicial reasoning espousing a policy favoring arbitration and thereby reached divergent results.  I dissented in those cases to express concern that my colleagues were making policy choices not made by Congress.  See <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U. S. 614</a>, 640 (1985);<em> Rodriguez de Quijas</em> v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/477/index.html">490 U. S. 477</a>, 486 (1989); <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html"></a><a href="/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a>, 36 (1991); and <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc.</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/105/index.html">532 U. S. 105</a>, 124 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the majority\xe2\x80\x99s preference for arbitration again leads it to disregard our precedent.  Although it purports to ascertain the relationship between the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), the National Labor Relations Act, and the Federal Arbitration Act, the Court ignores our earlier determination of the relevant provisions\xe2\x80\x99 meaning.  The Court concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 verdict that the benefits of organized labor outweigh the sacrifice of individual liberty\xe2\x80\x9d that the system of organized labor \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily demands,\xe2\x80\x9d even when the sacrifice demanded is a judicial forum for asserting an individual statutory right.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  But in <em>Gard-\nner-Denver </em>we determined that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 verdict\xe2\x80\x9d was otherwise when we held that Title VII does not permit a CBA to waive an employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to a federal judicial forum.  Because the purposes and relevant provisions of Title VII and the ADEA are not meaningfully distinguishable, it is only by reexamining the statutory questions resolved in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>through the lens of the policy favoring arbitration that the majority now reaches a different result.<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the circumstances, I believe a passage from one of my earlier dissents merits repetition.  The Court in <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em> overruled our decision in <em>Wilko</em> and held that predispute agreements to arbitrate claims under the Securities Act of 1933 are enforceable.  490 U. S., at 484; see also <em>id.</em>, at 481 (noting <em>Wilko</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xe2\x80\x9cthe outmoded presumption of disfavoring arbitration proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  I observed in dissent:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn the final analysis, a Justice\xe2\x80\x99s vote in a case like this depends more on his or her views about the respective lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests.  Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of us who are inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters\xe2\x80\x99 representatives on nonconstitutional matters.  Cf. <em>Boyle</em> v. <em>United Technologies Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/500/index.html">487 U. S. 500</a> (1988).  As I pointed out years ago, <em>Alberto-Culver Co. </em>v. <em>Scherk</em>, 484 F.\xc2\xa02d 611 (CA7 1973) (dissenting opinion), rev\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/506/index.html">417 U. S. 506</a> (1974), there are valid policy and textual arguments on both sides regarding the interrelation of federal securities and arbitration Acts.  None of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em>, 490 U. S., at 487 (footnote and citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As was true in <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em>, there are competing arguments in this case regarding the interaction of the relevant statutory provisions.  But the Court in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>considered these arguments, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d 415 U. S., at 59, and held that Congress did not intend to permit the result petitioners seek.  In the absence of an intervening amendment to the relevant statutory language, we are bound by that decision.  It is for Congress, rather than this Court, to reassess the policy arguments favoring arbitration and revise the relevant provisions to reflect its views.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Referring to the potential conflict between individual and collective interests, the Court asserts that it \xe2\x80\x9ccannot rely on this judicial policy concern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  That potential conflict of interests, however, was a basis for our decision in several pertinent cases, including <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/36/index.html">415 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s derision of that \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy concern\xe2\x80\x9d is particularly disingenuous given its subversion of <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding in the service of an extratextual policy favoring arbitration.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962916">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\n14 PENN PLAZA LLC V.

One of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s arguments was that the CBA entered into by the union had waived individual employees\xe2\x80\x99 statutory cause of action subject to a judicial remedy for discrimination in violation of Title VII.  Although Title VII, like the ADEA, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak expressly to the relationship between federal courts and the grievance-arbitration machinery of collective-bargaining agreements,\xe2\x80\x9d 415 U. S., at 47, we unanimously held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights conferred\xe2\x80\x9d by Title VII (with no exception for the right to a judicial forum) cannot be waived as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the collective bargaining process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 51.  We stressed the contrast between two categories of rights in labor and employment law.  There were \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory rights related to collective activity,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9care conferred on employees collectively to foster the processes of bargaining[, which] properly may be exercised or relinquished by the union as collective-bargaining agent to obtain economic benefits for union members.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But \xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII \xe2\x80\xa6 stands on plainly different [categorical] ground; it concerns not majoritarian processes, but an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal employment opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, as the Court previously realized, <em>Gardner-Denver</em> imposed a \xe2\x80\x9cseemingly absolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\xe2\x80\x99 federal forum rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Universal Maritime Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/70/index.html">525 U. S. 70</a>, 80 (1998).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We supported the judgment with several other lines of complementary reasoning.  First, we explained that antidiscrimination statutes \xe2\x80\x9chave long evinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d and Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s statutory scheme carried \xe2\x80\x9cno suggestion \xe2\x80\xa6 that a prior arbitral decision either forecloses an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to sue or divests federal courts of jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, 415 U. S., at 47.  We accordingly concluded that \xe2\x80\x9can individual does not forfeit his private cause of action if he first pursues his grievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of a collective-bargaining agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that simply participating in the arbitration amounted to electing the arbitration remedy and waiving the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s right to sue.  We said that the arbitration agreement at issue covered only a contractual right under the CBA to be free from discrimination, not the \xe2\x80\x9cindependent statutory rights accorded by Congress\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  Third, we rebuffed the employer\xe2\x80\x99s argument that federal courts should defer to arbitral rulings.  We declined to make the \xe2\x80\x9cassumption that arbitral processes are commensurate with judicial processes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 56, and described arbitration as \xe2\x80\x9ca less appropriate forum for final resolution of Title VII issues than the federal courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we took note that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n arbitration, as in the collective bargaining process, the interests of the individual employee may be subordinated to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> n.\xc2\xa019, a result we deemed unacceptable when it came to Title VII claims.  In sum, <em>Gardner-Denver</em> held that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s statutory right of freedom from discrimination and access to court for enforcement were beyond a union\xe2\x80\x99s power to waive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis of Title VII in <em>Gardner-Denver</em> is just as pertinent to the ADEA in this case.  The \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation of Title VII \xe2\x80\xa6 applies with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA \xe2\x80\x98were derived <em>in haec verba</em> from Title VII,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and indeed neither petitioners nor the Court points to any relevant distinction between the two statutes.  <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thurston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/111/index.html">469 U. S. 111</a>, 121 (1985) (quoting <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 584 (1978)); see also <em>McKennon</em>, 513 U. S., at 358 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe ADEA and Title VII share common substantive features and also a common purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the unquestionable applicability of the <em>Gardner-Denver</em> rule to this ADEA issue, the argument that its precedent be followed in this case of statutory interpretation is equally unquestionable.  \xe2\x80\x9cPrinciples of <em>stare decisis</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 demand respect for precedent whether judicial methods of interpretation change or stay the same.  Were that not so, those principles would fail to achieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which the rule of law depends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>CBOCS West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Humphries</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14).  And \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsiderations of <em>stare decisis</em> have special force\xe2\x80\x9d over an issue of statutory interpretation, which is unlike constitutional interpretation owing to the capacity of Congress to alter any reading we adopt simply by amending the statute.  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 172\xe2\x80\x93173 (1989).

If this were a case of first impression, it would at least be possible to consider that conclusion, but the issue is settled and the time is too late by 35 years to make the bald assertion that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  In fact, we recently and unanimously said that the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal forum rights cannot be waived in union-negotiated CBAs even if they can be waived in individually executed contracts \xe2\x80\xa6 assuredly finds support in\xe2\x80\x9d our case law, <em>Wright</em>, 525<em> </em>U. S., at 77, and every Court of Appeals save one has read our decisions as holding to this position, <em>Air Line Pilots Assn., Int\xe2\x80\x99l</em> v. <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</em>, 199 F.\xc2\xa03d 477, 484 (CADC 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe see a clear rule of law emerging from <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and <em>Gilmer</em> [v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html"></a><a href="/us/500/20/index.html">500 U.

That is simply impossible to square with our conclusion in <em>Gardner-Denver</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII \xe2\x80\xa6 stands on plainly different ground\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory rights related to collective activity\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cit concerns not majoritarian processes, but an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal employment opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.

That, however, was merely one of several reasons given in support of the decision, see <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, 415 U. S., at 47\xe2\x80\x9359, and we raised it to explain why the District Court made a mistake in thinking that the employee lost his Title VII rights by electing to pursue the contractual arbitration remedy, see <em>id.</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  One need only read <em>Gardner-Denver</em> itself to know that it was not at all so narrowly reasoned, and we have noted already how later cases have made this abundantly clear.  <em>Barrentine</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>, 450 U. S., at 737, provides further testimony:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNot all disputes between an employee and his employer are suited for binding resolution in accordance with the procedures established by collective bargaining.  While courts should defer to an arbitral decision where the employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim is based on rights arising out of a collective-bargaining agreement, different considerations apply where the employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim is based on rights arising out of a statute designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees to individual workers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese considerations were the basis for our decision in <em>[Gardner-Denver]</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>Gilmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 35 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn important concern\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Gardner-Denver</em> \xe2\x80\x9cwas the tension between collective representation and individual statutory rights \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, if the Court can read <em>Gardner-Denver</em> as resting on nothing more than a contractual failure to reach as far as statutory claims, it must think the Court has been wreaking havoc on the truth for years, since (as noted) we have unanimously described the case as raising a \xe2\x80\x9cseemingly absolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\xe2\x80\x99 federal forum rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wright</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 80.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Human ingenuity is not equal to the task of reconciling statements like this with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s representation that <em>Gardner-Denver</em> held only that \xe2\x80\x9cthe arbitration was not preclusive because the collective-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor, finally, does the majority have any better chance of being rid of another of <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statements supporting its rule of decision, set out and repeated in previous quotations: \xe2\x80\x9cin arbitration, as in the collective-bargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests of an individual employee to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20 (citing 415 U. S.<em>,</em> at 58, n.\xc2\xa019), an unacceptable result when it comes to \xe2\x80\x9can individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal employment opportunities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 51.  The majority tries to diminish this reasoning, and the previously stated holding it supported, by making the remarkable rejoinder that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e cannot rely on this judicial policy concern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 20.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It is enough to recall that respondents are not seeking to \xe2\x80\x9cintroduc[e] a qualification into\xe2\x80\x9d the law; they are justifiably relying on statutory-interpretation precedent decades old, never overruled, and serially reaffirmed over the years.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McDonald</em> v. <em>West Branch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/284/index.html">466 U. S. 284</a>, 291 (1984); <em>Barrentine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 742.  With that precedent on the books, it makes no sense for the majority to claim that \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial policy concern[s]\xe2\x80\x9d about unions sacrificing individual antidiscrimination rights should be left to Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For that matter, Congress has unsurprisingly understood <em>Gardner-Denver</em> the way we have repeatedly explained it and has operated on the assumption that a CBA cannot waive employees\xe2\x80\x99 rights to a judicial forum to enforce antidiscrimination statutes.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa097 (1991) (stating that, \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Title VII in <em>[Gardner-Denver]</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cany agreement to submit disputed issues to arbitration \xe2\x80\xa6 in the context of a collective bargaining agreement \xe2\x80\xa6 does not preclude the affected person from seeking relief under the enforcement provisions of Title VII\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Congress apparently does not share the Court\xe2\x80\x99s demotion of <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding to a suspect judicial policy concern: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has had [over] 30 years in which it could have corrected our decision \xe2\x80\xa6 if it disagreed with it, and has chosen not to do so.  We should accord weight to this continued acceptance of our earlier holding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hilton</em>, 502 U. S., at 202; see also <em>Patterson</em>, 491 U. S.<em>,</em> at 172\xe2\x80\x93173.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On one level, the majority opinion may have little effect, for it explicitly reserves the question whether a CBA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of a judicial forum is enforceable when the union controls access to and presentation of employees\xe2\x80\x99 claims in arbitration, <em>ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, which \xe2\x80\x9cis usually the case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McDonald</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 291.  But as a treatment of precedent in statutory interpretation, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion cannot be reconciled with the <em>Gardner-Denver</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s own view of its holding, repeated over the years and generally understood, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>Gardner-Denver</em> also contained some language seemingly prohibiting even individual prospective waiver of federal forum rights, see 415 U.

But <em>Gardner-Denver</em> forbade union waiver of employees\xe2\x80\x99 federal forum rights in large part because of the importance of such rights and a fear that unions would too easily give them up to benefit the many at the expense of the few, a far less salient concern when only economic interests are at stake.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Barrentine</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/index.html"></a><a href="/us/450/728/index.html">450 U.

I agree that <em>Gardner-Denver</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mistrust of the arbitral process\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 has been undermined by our recent arbitration decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gilmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 34, n.\xc2\xa05 (quoting <em>Shearson/American Express Inc.</em> v. <em>McMahon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/220/index.html">482 U.

This answer misunderstands the law, for unions may decline for a variety of reasons to pursue potentially meritorious discrimination claims without succumbing to a member\xe2\x80\x99s suit for failure of fair representation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Barrentine</em>, 450 U. S., at 742 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if the employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim were meritorious, his union might, without breaching its duty of fair representation, reasonably and in good faith decide not to support the claim vigorously in arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d).  More importantly, we have rejected precisely this argument in the past, making this yet another occasion where the majority ignores precedent.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid.</em>; <em>Gardner-Denver</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 58, n.\xc2\xa019 (noting that a duty of fair representation claim would often \xe2\x80\x9cprove difficult to establish\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we were wise to reject it.  When the Court construes statutes to allow a union to eliminate a statutory right to sue in favor of arbitration in which the union cannot represent the employee because it agreed to the employer\xe2\x80\x99s challenged action, it is not very consoling to add that the employee can sue the union for being unfair.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
