It was admitted that the plaintiffs had an agent authorized to collect their debts, so far as the plaintiffs could authorize the same to be collected, during the whole time, from the date of the bond to the time of the suit, which agent resided in the county in which the defendant lived.  Open war existed between Great Britain and Virginia from 19 April, 1775, until September, 1783.

And when he returned in 1784 he received back the bond from William Hunter.

CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The only circumstance which could create a question in this case is that twenty years had not elapsed, exclusive of the period during which the plaintiffs were under a legal disability to recover, before the action was brought.</p>\n<p>The principle upon which the presumption of payment arises from the lapse of time is a reasonable principle, and may be rebutted by any facts which destroy the reason of the rule.</p>\n<p>That no presumption could arise during a state of war, in which the plaintiff was an alien enemy, is too clear to admit of doubt.  But it is not so clear that upon a bond so old as this, the same length of time after the removal of the disability is necessary to raise the presumption as would be required if the bond had borne date at the time of such removal.</p>\n<p>It appears from the decisions of the courts of Virginia, from the pleas in bar in the federal courts, and particularly from the observations of the chancellor of Virginia in the case cited, that it was the general understanding of the inhabitants of that state that British debts could not be recovered, and until the year 1793 there was no decision of the superior courts that such debts were recoverable.</p>\n<p>The only question is whether, in case of an old debt, the same time is required to raise the presumption as in the case of a debt accruing since the impediments have been removed.</p>\n<p>In such a case it is not easy to establish a new rule, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 6 U. S. 185</a></p><p> the Court thinks it best to adhere to the old decisions that twenty years must have elapsed exclusive of the period of the plaintiff\'s disability, and are of opinion that the circuit court erred in directing the jury that payment ought to be presumed.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the court is entered upon the minutes in the following terms:</p>\n<p>The Court, having heard the arguments of counsel and maturely considered the same, is of opinion (and doth adjudge, order, and decree accordingly) that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury</p>\n<p>"That from the length of time, it was to presume the bond in the record mentioned, to be satisfied unless they should find from the evidence that interest was paid on the bond within twenty years from 5 September, 1775 (the time of the last payment), or that a suit or demand was made on said bond within twenty years from the last mentioned time, exclusive, in both cases, of five years, five months, and twenty days, taken out of the act of limitations,"</p>\n<p>there being circumstances in this case which oppose the presumption which would have arisen from the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the bond.</p>\n<p>And this Court doth further adjudge, order, and decree that this cause be remanded to the said circuit court, to be there tried, with directions that there is no presumption of payment of the said bond, as directed by the said circuit court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
