Relying on Ninth Circuit cases holding that the University is "an arm of the state," 1 the District Court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment barred respondent from maintaining his breach-of-contract action in federal court.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Assuming that in some, but not all, of its functions the University is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity,2 the court addressed the narrow question whether it is an arm of the State when "acting in a managerial capacity" for the Livermore Laboratory. <i>Doe </i>v. <i>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/65/771/">65 F.3d 771</a>, 774 (1995).

S. 1140 (1994), and another holding that the University had waived its immunity in some cases, <i>In re Holoholo, </i>512 F. Supp. 889, 901-902 (Haw. 1981), for its conclusion that the "University is an enormous entity which functions in various capacities and which is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity for all of its functions." <i>Doe </i>v. <i>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/65/771/">65 F.3d 771</a>, 775 (1995). We have no occasion to consider questions of waiver or abrogation of immunity in this case. Nor is it necessary to decide whether there may be some state instrumentalities that qualify as "arms of the State" for some purposes but not others.</p><p>3 The five factors considered by the court in evaluating whether the University is an arm of the State were: "[1] whether a money judgment would be satisfied out of state funds, [2] whether the entity performs central governmental functions, [3] whether the entity may sue or be sued, [4] whether the entity has power to take property in its own name or only the name of the state, and [5] the corporate status of the entity." <i>Id., </i>at 774.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="428">428</a></p><p>for money judgment is the single most important factor in determining whether an entity is an arm of the state." <i>Ibid. </i>The majority opinion gave decisive weight to the terms of the University\'s agreement with the Department, which made it "clear that the Department, and not the State of California, is liable for any judgment rendered against the University in its performance of the Contract." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The dissenting judge did not take issue with the majority\'s emphasis on the importance of the defendant\'s liability for a money judgment, but he reasoned that the proper analysis should focus on the primary legal liability rather than the ultimate economic impact of the judgment. Noting that it was undisputed that a judgment against the University "is a legal obligation of the State of California," id., at 777, he discounted the significance of the indemnitor\'s secondary, or indirect, liability. For his conclusion, he relied on Ninth Circuit precedent suggesting that a State may not confer Eleventh Amendment immunity on an entity or individual who would otherwise not enjoy that immunity simply by volunteering to satisfy judgments against the entity, <i>Durning </i>v. <i>Citibank, </i>N. <i>A., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/950/1419/">950 F.2d 1419</a>, 1425, n. 3 (1991), or by passing a statute indemnifying individual officers from liability, <i>Blaylock </i>v. <i>Schwinden, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/862/1352/">862 F.2d 1352</a>, 1353-1354 (1988). "The question is not who pays in the end; it is who is legally obligated to pay the judgment that is being sought." 65</p><p>Because other Courts of Appeals agree with the dissent\'s focus on legal rather than financialliability,4 we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 518 U.

Thus, "when the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants." <i>Id., </i>at 464.</p><p>When deciding whether a state instrumentality may invoke the State\'s immunity, our cases have inquired into the relationship between the State and the entity in question.

In <i>Hess, </i>we evaluated the relationship between an entity created by a bistate compact and the States that had joined to create that entity in order to determine whether that entity could properly be denominated as an "arm" of either of its founding States for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. In addition to considering the position of the bistate entity as a unique creature within the federal system, 513 U. S., at 39-42, and the nature of the claims at issue in the underlying proceeding, id., at 42, we focused particular attention on the fact that "both legally and practically" neither of the relevant States would have been obligated to pay a judgment obtained against the bistate entity, id., at 51-52.</p><p>Respondent seeks to detach the importance of a State\'s legal liability for judgments against a state agency from its</p><p>6We relied in <i>Mt.

S. 693</a>,717-721 (1973). In <i>Moor </i>we made a "detailed examination of the relevant provisions of California law" defining counties, noting that the county "is liable for all judgments against it and is authorized to levy taxes to pay such judgments," that it is "empowered to issue general obligation bonds," and that it has other characteristics that provide "persuasive indicia of the independent status occupied by California counties relative to the State of California." <i>Id., </i>at 719-721.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="431">431</a></p><p>moorings as an indicator of the relationship between the State and its creation and to convert the inquiry into a formalistic question of ultimate financial liability. But none of the reasoning in our opinions lends support to the notion that the presence or absence of a third party\'s undertaking to indemnify the agency should determine whether it is the kind of entity that should be treated as an arm of the State.</p><p>Just as with the arm-of-the-state inquiry, we agree with the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals that with respect to the underlying Eleventh Amendment question, it is the entity\'s potential legal liability, rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it, or to discharge the liability in the first instance, that is relevant. Surely, if the sovereign State of California should buy insurance to protect itself against potential tort liability to pedestrians stumbling on the steps of the State Capitol, it would not cease to be "one of the United States."</p><p>Accordingly, we reject respondent\'s principal contentionthat the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to this litigation because any award of damages would be paid by the Department of Energy, and therefore have no impact upon the treasury of the State of California. The Eleventh Amendment protects the State from the risk of adverse judgments even though the State may be indemnified by a third party.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>As an alternative ground for affirmance, respondent invites us to reexamine the validity of the Ninth Circuit cases holding that the University is an arm of the State.
