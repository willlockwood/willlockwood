Initially, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s statutory authority in enforcement actions was limited to seeking an injunction barring future violations.  Beginning in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, federal district courts, at the request of the Commission, began ordering disgorgement in SEC enforcement proceedings.  Although Congress has since authorized the Commission to seek monetary civil penalties, the Commission has continued to seek disgorgement.  This Court has held that\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72462, which establishes a 5-year limitations period for \xe2\x80\x9can action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture,\xe2\x80\x9d applies when the Commission seeks monetary civil penalties.  See <i>Gabelli</i> v. <i>SEC</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442\n.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 2009, the Commission brought an enforcement action, alleging that petitioner Charles Kokesh violated various securities laws by concealing the misappropriation of $34.9 million from four business-development companies from 1995 to 2009.  The Commission sought monetary civil penalties, disgorgement, and an injunction barring Kokesh from future violations.  After a jury found that Kokesh\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated several securities laws, the District Court determined that \xc2\xa72462\xe2\x80\x99s 5-year limitations period applied to the monetary civil penalties.  With respect to the $34.9 million disgorgement judgment, however, the court concluded that \xc2\xa72462 did not apply because disgorgement is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that disgorgement was neither a penalty nor a forfeiture.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because SEC disgorgement operates as a penalty under \xc2\xa72462, any claim for disgorgement in an SEC enforcement action must be commenced within five years of the date the claim accrued.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cpunishment, whether corporal or pecuniary, imposed and enforced by the State, for a crime or offen[s]e against its laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Huntington</i> v. <i>Attrill</i>,\n\n146 U.\xc2\xa0S. 657\n, gives rise to two principles.  First, whether a sanction represents a penalty turns in part on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the wrong sought to be redressed is a wrong to the public, or a wrong to the individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 668.  Second, a pecuniary sanction operates as a penalty if it is sought \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of punishment, and to deter others from offending in like manner\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to compensate victims.  <i>Ibid.</i>  This Court has applied these principles in construing the term \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d holding, <i>e.g.</i>, that a statute providing a compensatory remedy for a private wrong did not impose a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Daly</i>,\n\n175 U.\xc2\xa0S. 148\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The application of these principles here readily demonstrates that SEC disgorgement constitutes a penalty within the meaning of \xc2\xa72462.  First, SEC disgorgement is imposed by the courts as a consequence for violating public laws, <i>i.e.</i>, a violation committed against the United States rather than an aggrieved individual.  Second, SEC disgorgement is imposed for punitive purposes.  Sanctions imposed for the purpose of deterring infractions of public laws are inherently punitive because \xe2\x80\x9cdeterrence [is] not [a] legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectiv[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Wolfish</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520\n, n.\xc2\xa020.  Finally, SEC disgorgement is often not compensatory.  Disgorged profits are paid to the district courts, which have discretion to determine how the money will be distributed.  They may distribute the funds to victims, but no statute commands them to do so.  When an individual is made to pay a noncompensatory sanction to the government as a consequence of a legal violation, the payment operates as a penalty.  See <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Warner Holding Co.</i>,\n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The Government responds that SEC disgorgement is not punitive but a remedial sanction that operates to restore the status quo.  It is not clear, however, that disgorgement simply returns the defendant to the place he would have occupied had he not broken the law.  It sometimes exceeds the profits gained as a result of the violation.  And, as demonstrated here, SEC disgorgement may be ordered without consideration of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s expenses that reduced the amount of illegal profit.  In such cases, disgorgement does not simply restore the status quo; it leaves the defendant worse off and is therefore punitive.  Although disgorgement may serve compensatory goals in some cases, \xe2\x80\x9csanctions frequently serve more than one purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Austin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 602\n.  Because they \xe2\x80\x9cgo beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers\xe2\x80\x9d as a consequence of violating public laws, <i>Gabelli</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 451\xe2\x80\x93452, disgorgement orders represent a penalty and fall within \xc2\xa72462\xe2\x80\x99s 5-year limitations period.

This case presents the question whether \xc2\xa72462 applies to claims for disgorgement imposed as a sanction for violating a federal securities law.  The Court holds that it does.  Disgorgement in the securities-enforcement context is a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72462, and so disgorgement actions must be commenced within five years of the date the claim accrues.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">After rampant abuses in the securities industry led to the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression, Congress enacted a series of laws to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthe highest ethical standards prevail in every facet of the securities industry.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.</i>,\n\n375 U.\xc2\xa0S. 180\n\xe2\x80\x93187 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The second in the series\xe2\x80\x94the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\xe2\x80\x94established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) to enforce federal securities laws.  Congress granted the Com-mission power to prescribe \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rules and regulations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Blue Chip Stamps</i> v. <i>Manor Drug Stores</i>,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 723,\n728 (1975)\n.

If an investigation uncovers evidence of wrongdoing, the Commission may initiate enforcement actions in federal district court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Initially, the only statutory remedy available to the SEC in an enforcement action was an injunction barring future violations of securities laws.  See 1 T. Hazen, Law of Securities Regulation \xc2\xa71:37 (7th ed., rev. 2016).  In the absence of statutory authorization for monetary remedies, the Commission urged courts to order disgorgement as an exercise of their \xe2\x80\x9cinherent equity power to grant relief ancillary to an injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>SEC </i>v.<i> Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.</i>, 312 F.

Generally, disgorgement is a form of \xe2\x80\x9c[r]estitution measured by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s wrongful gain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \xc2\xa751, Comment <i>a</i>, p. 204 (2010) (Restatement (Third)).

The Act left the Commission with a full panoply of enforcement tools: It may promulgate rules, investigate violations of those rules and the securities laws generally, and seek monetary penal-ties and injunctive relief for those violations.  In the years since the Act, however, the Commission has con-tinued its practice of seeking disgorgement in enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has already held that the 5-year statute of limitations set forth in\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72462 applies when the Commission seeks statutory monetary penalties.  See <i>Gabelli </i>v.<i> SEC</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442,\n454 (2013)\n.  The question here is whether \xc2\xa72462, which applies to any \xe2\x80\x9caction, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d also applies when the SEC seeks disgorgement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Charles Kokesh owned two investment-adviser firms that provided investment advice to business-development companies.  In late 2009, the Commission commenced an enforcement action in Federal District Court alleging that between 1995 and 2009, Kokesh, through his firms, misappropriated $34.9 million from four of those development companies.  The Commission further alleged that, in order to conceal the misappropriation, Kokesh caused the filing of false and misleading SEC reports and proxy statements.  The Commission sought civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and an injunction barring Kokesh from violating securities laws in the future.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After a 5-day trial, a jury found that Kokesh\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated the Investment Company Act of 1940,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9336; the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa780b\xe2\x80\x935, 80b\xe2\x80\x936; and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778m, 78n.  The District Court then turned to the task of imposing penalties sought by the Commission.  As to the civil monetary penalties, the District Court determined that \xc2\xa72462\xe2\x80\x99s 5-year limitations period pre-cluded any penalties for misappropriation occurring prior to October 27, 2004\xe2\x80\x94that is, five years prior to the date the Commission filed the complaint.

Stat. 1913, \xc2\xa71712 (now\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72462), which imposed a 5-year limitations period upon any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98suit or prosecution for a penalty or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, accruing under the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  236 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 423.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Rind</i>, 991 F.\xc2\xa02d 1486, 1491 (CA9 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]isgorgement actions further the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s public policy mission of protecting investors and safeguarding the integrity of the markets\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Teo</i>, 746 F.\xc2\xa03d 90, 102 (CA3 2014) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he SEC pursues [disgorgement] \xe2\x80\x98independent of the claims of individual investors\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in order to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98promot[e] economic and social policies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, SEC disgorgement is imposed for punitive purposes.  In <i>Texas Gulf</i>\xe2\x80\x94one of the first cases requiring disgorgement in SEC proceedings\xe2\x80\x94the court emphasized the need \xe2\x80\x9cto deprive the defendants of their profits in order to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. protect the investing public by providing an effective deterrent to future violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 F. Supp., at 92.  In the years since, it has become clear that deterrence is not simply an incidental effect of disgorgement.  Rather, courts have consistently held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he primary purpose of disgorgement orders is to deter violations of the securities laws by depriving violators of their ill-gotten gains.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Fischbach</i> <i>Corp</i>., 133 F.\xc2\xa03d 170, 175 (CA2 1997); see also <i>SEC</i> v. <i>First Jersey Securities, Inc.</i>, 101 F.\xc2\xa03d 1450, 1474 (CA2 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe primary purpose of disgorgement as a remedy for violation of the securities laws is to deprive violators of their ill-gotten gains, thereby effectuating the deterrence objectives of those laws\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Rind</i>, 991 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1491 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The deterrent effect of [an SEC] enforcement action would be greatly undermined if securities law violators were not required to disgorge illicit profits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Sanctions imposed for the purpose of deterring infractions of public laws are inherently punitive because \xe2\x80\x9cdeterrence [is] not [a] legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectiv[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Wolfish</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520,\n539, n.\n20 (1979)\n; see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bajakajian</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 321,\n329 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cDeterrence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has traditionally been viewed as a goal of punishment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, in many cases, SEC disgorgement is not compensatory.  As courts and the Government have employed the remedy, disgorged profits are paid to the district court, and it is \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to determine how and to whom the money will be distributed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fischbach Corp</i>., 133 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 175.  Courts have required disgorgement \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of whether the disgorged funds will be paid to such investors as restitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 176; see <i>id</i>., at 175 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough disgorged funds may often go to compensate securities fraud victims for their losses, such compensation is a distinctly secondary goal\xe2\x80\x9d).  Some disgorged funds are paid to victims; other funds are dispersed to the United States Treasury.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>id.,</i> at 171 (affirming distribution of disgorged funds to Treasury where \xe2\x80\x9cno party before the court was entitled to the funds and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the persons who might have equitable claims were too dispersed for feasible identification and payment\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Lund</i>, 570 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1397, 1404\xe2\x80\x931405 (CD Cal. 1983) (ordering disgorgement and directing trustee to disperse funds to victims if \xe2\x80\x9cfeasible\xe2\x80\x9d and to disperse any remaining money to the Treasury).  Even though district courts may distribute the funds to the victims, they have not identified any statutory command that they do so.  When an individual is made to pay a noncompensatory sanction to the Government as a consequence of a legal violation, the payment operates as a penalty.  See <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Warner Holding Co.</i>,\n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395,\n402 (1946)\n (distinguishing between restitution paid to an aggrieved party and penalties paid to the Government).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">SEC disgorgement thus bears all the hallmarks of a penalty: It is imposed as a consequence of violating a public law and it is intended to deter, not to compensate.  The 5-year statute of limitations in \xc2\xa72462 therefore applies when the SEC seeks disgorgement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s primary response to all of this is that SEC disgorgement is not punitive but \xe2\x80\x9cremedial\xe2\x80\x9d in that it \xe2\x80\x9clessen[s] the effects of a violation\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98restor[ing] the status quo.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17.  As an initial matter, it is not clear that disgorgement, as courts have applied it in the SEC enforcement context, simply returns the defendant to the place he would have occupied had he not broken the law.  SEC disgorgement sometimes exceeds the profits gained as a result of the violation.  Thus, for example, \xe2\x80\x9can insider trader may be ordered to disgorge not only the unlawful gains that accrue to the wrongdoer directly, but also the benefit that accrues to third parties whose gains can be attributed to the wrongdoer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Contorinis</i>, 743 F.\xc2\xa03d 296, 302 (CA2 2014).  Individuals who illegally provide confidential trading information have been forced to disgorge profits gained by individuals who received and traded based on that information\xe2\x80\x94even though they never received any profits.  <i>Ibid</i>; see also <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Warde</i>, 151 F.\xc2\xa03d 42, 49 (CA2 1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cA tippee\xe2\x80\x99s gains are attributable to the tipper, regardless whether benefit accrues to the tipper\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Clark</i>, 915 F.\xc2\xa02d 439, 454 (CA9 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is well settled that a tipper can be required to disgorge his tippees\xe2\x80\x99 profits\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, as demonstrated by this case, SEC disgorgement sometimes is ordered without consideration of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s expenses that reduced the amount of illegal profit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; see Restatement (Third) \xc2\xa751, Comment <i>h</i>, at 216 (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule, the defendant is entitled to a deduction for all marginal costs incurred in producing the revenues that are subject to disgorgement.  Denial of an otherwise appropriate deduction, by making the defendant liable in excess of net gains, results in a punitive sanction that the law of restitution normally attempts to avoid\xe2\x80\x9d).  In such cases, disgorgement does not simply restore the status quo; it leaves the defendant worse off.  The justification for this practice given by the court below demonstrates that disgorgement in this context is a punitive, rather than a remedial, sanction: Disgorgement, that court explained, is intended not only to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent the wrongdoer\xe2\x80\x99s unjust enrichment\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cto deter others\xe2\x80\x99 violations of the securities laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">True, disgorgement serves compensatory goals in some cases; however, we have emphasized \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Austin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 602,\n610 (1993)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A civil sanction that cannot fairly be said <i>solely</i> to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come to understand the term.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 621; cf. <i>Bajakajian</i>, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 331, n. 6 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] modern statutory forfeiture is a \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 for\n \nEighth Amendment purposes if it constitutes punishment even in part\xe2\x80\x9d).
