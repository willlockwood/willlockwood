JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The issue in this case is whether the North Carolina Supreme Court correctly declined to give retroactive application to this Court\'s decision in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/case.html">421 U. S. 684</a></span> (1975).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Hankerson was convicted after a jury trial of second-degree murder and sentenced to 20-25 years in prison.  It was conceded at his trial that petitioner killed a man named Gregory Ashe by shooting him through the heart with a pistol at 11 at night on September 29, 1974.  The issue at trial was whether petitioner acted in self-defense.  The relevant evidence is described below.</p>\n<p>Ashe and two friends, Dancy and Whitley, were, according to the testimony of the latter two, driving around in Ashe\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="235">Page 432 U. S. 235</a></p><p> car on the evening of September 20.  They went to a pool hall shortly before 11 p.m. and, on discovering that the pool hall was closed, returned to Ashe\'s car.  The car would not start.  Ashe asked his companions for a light for his cigarette, but neither had one.  Whitley began walking to his home, which was one block away.  Ashe and Dancy followed him.  Then Ashe decided to return to his car to try to "crank" it.  Dancy, according to his and Whitley\'s testimony, ran after Whitley.  Both testified that they then heard a gunshot, heard Ashe yell that he had been shot, and saw petitioner\'s car speed away.  Ashe\'s body was not found for an hour, and when it was, a fully burned cigarette was lodged between two fingers.</p>\n<p>Petitioner testified at trial that he had been driving his car very slowly because of holes in the road when someone asked him for a light.  Through his mirror he saw two men.  One, <em>i.e.,</em> Ashe, walked up to the driver\'s window.  Petitioner pushed his cigarette lighter in and gave it to Ashe.  When the lighter was returned, petitioner felt the car shake and saw the other man at the other door, which was locked.  Ashe then grabbed petitioner\'s shoulder with his right hand, and put a knife to petitioner\'s throat with his left hand.  Petitioner then grabbed his gun and shot Ashe.  The knife fell inside the car.  Petitioner then drove away.  Shortly after the murder, the knife was recovered by a policeman from petitioner\'s car.  Petitioner readily admitted the shooting at that time and told a story to the policeman which was roughly equivalent to his trial testimony.</p>\n<p>The State then introduced evidence tending to prove that Ashe had never been seen with a knife of the type found in petitioner\'s car; that petitioner falsely claimed to the policeman -- who questioned him shortly after the shooting -- no longer to have possession of the gun; that Ashe was right handed, even though petitioner testified that the knife was wielded with Ashe\'s left hand; and that although petitioner had told police that Ashe had left a grease mark on his shirt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 432 U. S. 236</a></p><p> when Ashe grabbed him, Ashe had no grease on his hand when his body was examined.  The State argued in its summation that Ashe would not still have had his cigarette in his hand when shot if he had, as petitioner testified, used two hands to attack petitioner.</p>\n<p>The jury was instructed, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p>"I charge that for you to find the defendant guilty of second degree murder, the State must prove two things beyond a reasonable doubt, first, that the defendant intentionally and <em>without justification or excuse</em> and with malice shot Gregory Ashe with a deadly weapon. . . . [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>App. 9 (emphasis added).  The judge instructed the jury that self-defense constituted an excuse for an intentional killing. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  However, he instructed the jury:</p>\n<p>"If the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt or it is admitted that the defendant intentionally killed Gregory Ashe with a deadly weapon, or intentionally inflicted a wound upon Gregory Ashe with a deadly weapon, that proximately caused his death, the law raises two presumptions; first, that the killing was unlawful, and second, that it was done with malice. . . .  Then there will be some other things I will charge you about, but, nothing else appearing, if you are satisfied of those two things beyond a reasonable doubt then you would find the defendant guilty of second degree murder."</p>\n<p>". . .  [I]n order to excuse his act altogether on the grounds of self-defense, the defendant must prove not beyond a reasonable doubt but simply <em>to your satisfaction</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 432 U. S. 237</a></p><p> that he acted in self-defense."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 10 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The judge proceeded to instruct on the elements of self-defense. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  No objection was made to any of these instructions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 432 U. S. 238</a></p><p> at the trial; and the jury found petitioner guilty of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p>Petitioner objected to the above-quoted portions of the instructions to the jury for the first time on direct review in the Supreme Court of North Carolina.  He argued that the instructions placed a burden on him to persuade the jury that he was not guilty, by proving that the killing was not unlawful; and he claimed that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as construed in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/case.html">421 U. S. 684</a></span> (1975), required that the State persuade the jury beyond a reasonable doubt as to all elements of the crime, including that of unlawfulness -- here the absence of self-defense.</p>\n<p>The North Carolina Supreme Court agreed that unlawfulness was an essential ingredient of the crime, 288 N.C. 632, 648-652, 220 S.E.2d 575, 587-589 (1975), and ruled that under this Court\'s recently decided cases, the Due Process Clause required that the jury be instructed in a case such as this that the State must persuade it beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not in self-defense.  Under the presumptions contained in the trial judge\'s instructions, once an intentional killing with a deadly weapon had been shown, petitioner had the burden to "satisfy" the jury that he had acted in self-defense.  The North Carolina Supreme Court held that a burden to "satisfy" the jurors of a fact is not "significantly less" than a burden to persuade them of the fact by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court therefore held that the charge was erroneous under this Court\'s decision in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, supra,</em> which required the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 432 U. S. 239</a></p><p> State to establish all elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt and which, despite longstanding practice to the contrary -- as in North Carolina since 1864 -- invalidated presumptions that shifted the burden of proof with respect to such elements to the defendant.  The North Carolina Supreme Court stated the rule for future cases:</p>\n<p>"If there is evidence in the case of all the elements of self-defense, the mandatory presumption of unlawfulness disappears, but the logical inferences from the facts proved may be weighed against this evidence.  If, upon considering all the evidence, including the inferences and evidence of self-defense, the jury is left with a reasonable doubt as to the existence of unlawfulness, it must find the defendant not guilty."</p>\n<p>288 N.C. at 651-652, 220 S.E.2d at 589.</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s conviction was nevertheless affirmed, for it was concluded that the constitutional rule announced in <em>Mullaney</em> was inapplicable in this case because it was handed down after the conclusion of petitioner\'s trial. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In declining to apply <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur</em> to trials occurring before the date on which it was decided, the North Carolina Supreme Court recognized that, in <em>Ivan V. v. City of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/203/case.html">407 U. S. 203</a></span> (1972), we held fully retroactive our earlier decision in <em>In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U. S. 358</a></span> (1970), to the effect that the Federal Constitution requires the States to apply the reasonable doubt standard of proof in juvenile proceedings.  It also recognized that, as in <em>Ivan V.,</em> it was dealing with a constitutional rule the primary purpose of which was to prevent the erroneous conviction of innocent persons.  Even so, the court concluded that the retroactive application of <em>Mullaney</em> would have a devastating impact on the administration of justice in this country in view of the number of murderers who would be released -- many of whom could not now be retried -- in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 432 U. S. 240</a></p><p> eight States that the court identified as placing the burden of proving self-defense on the defendant.  Accordingly, it declined to apply <em>Mullaney</em> to trials occurring before the date on which it was decided.</p>\n<p>This Court granted Hankerson\'s petition for a writ of certiorari, which raised the single question whether <em>Mullaney</em> should be held retroactive.  429 U.S. 815.  The State of North Carolina has filed an answering brief in which it argues (1) that the North Carolina Supreme Court was correct in holding <em>Mullaney</em> not retroactive; and (2) that, in any event, the judgment below should be affirmed because the instructions given in this case did leave the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt on the prosecution, or at least did not require the accused to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence in contravention of <em>Mullaney.</em>  These are the only two issues before this Court, and we treat them in order. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of North Carolina erred in declining to hold retroactive the rule in <em>Mullaney v.

S. 241</a></p><p> state juvenile proceedings -- was to be applied retroactively.  The Court there said:</p>\n<p>"\'Where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truthfinding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect.

S. 204</a></span>-205.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 432 U. S. 242</a></p><p> <em>Ivan V.</em> controls this case.  In <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</em> as in In re <em>Winship,</em> the Court held that due process requires the States in some circumstances to apply the reasonable doubt standard of proof, rather than some lesser standard under which an accused would more easily lose his liberty.  In <em>Mullaney,</em> as in <em>Winship,</em> the rule was designed to diminish the probability that an innocent person would be convicted and thus to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that "substantially impairs the truthfinding function."</p>\n<p>Respondent and the North Carolina Supreme Court seek to avoid the force of <em>Ivan V.</em> on two grounds.  First, the North Carolina Supreme Court thought that the State had justifiably relied upon the validity of the burden-shifting presumptions flowing from intentional killing with a deadly weapon before <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</em> whereas the State in <em>Ivan V.</em> should have known, even before <em>Winship,</em> that the reasonable doubt standard of proof would be held applicable to juvenile proceedings.  Second, it viewed the retroactive impact of the <em>Mullaney</em> rule on the administration of justice as far more devastating than the retroactive impact of <em>Winship.</em> <em>Winship</em> involved only juveniles, while <em>Mullaney</em> would affect the convictions of murderers.</p>\n<p>Respondent recognizes that <em>Ivan V.</em> did not rely on the absence of reliance by the State on pre-<em>Winship</em> law or on the absence of a devastating impact on the administration of justice.  However, respondent claims that in deciding whether a new constitutional rule is to be applied retroactively, the Court has traditionally inquired not only, as in <em>Ivan V.,</em> into the purpose of the rule, but also into the extent of the State\'s justified reliance on the old rule and the impact that retroactive application of the new rule would have on the administration of justice.  <em>See, e.g., Stovall v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html">388 U. S. 293</a></span> (1967); <em>Johnson v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html">384 U. S. 719</a></span> (1966); <em>Tehan v. United States ex rel.

Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span> (1965).  It claims that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 432 U. S. 243</a></p><p> even where the purpose of the new rule is to improve the "integrity of the factfinding process," the rule has been held nonretroactive when the impact of the new rule on the administration of justice would otherwise be devastating and when the States have justifiably relied on the old rule.  <em>See, e.g., Stovall v. Denno, supra,</em> (holding nonretroactive the requirement of <em>United States v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html">388 U.

S. 729</a></span>; and when the degree to which the rule enhances the integrity of the factfinding process is sufficiently small, we have looked to questions of reliance by the State on the old rule and the impact of the new rule on the administration of justice in deciding whether the new rule is to be applied retroactively.  <em>Stovall v. Denno, supra; Adams v. Illinois, supra; DeStefano v. Woods,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/631/case.html">392 U. S. 631</a></span> (1968).  But we have never deviated from the rule stated in <em>Ivan V.</em> that</p>\n<p>"\'[w]here the <em>major</em> purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that <em>substantially</em> impairs its truthfinding function, and so raises <em>serious</em> questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule [is] given complete retroactive effect.\'"</p>\n<p>407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/203/case.html#204">407 U.

Respondent\'s argument is squarely contrary to the construction given by the North Carolina Supreme Court to the jury charge in this case.  That court concluded that a burden to "satisfy" the jury of self-defense places a burden on a defendant "no greater and at the same time one not significantly less than persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence."  288 N.C. at 648, 220 S.E.2d at 587.  The Court has no basis for disagreeing with this interpretation of the charge, which is essentially a question of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 432 U. S. 245</a></p><p> state law.

This instruction was challenged in the North Carolina Supreme Court, along with the instruction on self-defense; but we do not reach the question because the state court, although ruling on it as a matter of its own convenience, held that the issue had not been "properly presented" to it in the absence of any evidence that the killing was in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.  288 N.C. 632, 648, 220 S.E.2d 575, 587 (1975).  <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/case.html">421 U.

The defendant testified that, at the time he shot Gregory Ashe or shot at Gregory Ashe, that Gregory Ashe was holding a knife at his throat and had his arm around him, and he contends that that should satisfy you that he believed it was necessary to shoot him in order to save himself from death or great bodily harm.  The second thing that you must be satisfied of -- excuse me -- that the defendant must satisfy you of is this, that the circumstances as they appeared to him at the time were sufficient to create such belief in the mind of a person of ordinary firmness, and it is for you, the jury, to determine the reasonableness of the defendant\'s belief from the circumstances as they appeared to him at the time.  In making this determination, you should consider the circumstances as you find them to have existed from the evidence, including the size, age and strength of the defendant as compared to Gregory Ashe, the fierceness of the assault, if any, upon the defendant, whether or not Gregory Ashe had a weapon in his possession.  And the third thing the defendant must satisfy you of is that he was not the aggressor.  If he voluntarily and without provocation entered into a fight with Gregory Ashe, he was the aggressor, unless he thereafter attempted to abandon the fight and gave notice to Gregory Ashe that he was doing so.  One enters a fight voluntarily if he uses towards his opponent abusive language which, considering all the circumstances, is calculated and intended to bring on a fight.  And the fourth thing that the defendant must satisfy you of is that he did not use excessive force, that is, more force than reasonably appeared to be necessary to the defendant at the time."</p>\n<p>App. 11-12.

We do not so readily assume that juries fail to understand the instructions they have been receiving in North Carolina.  <em>See In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U.

If the validity of such burden-shifting presumptions were as well settled in the States that have them as respondent asserts, then it is unlikely that prior to <em>Mullaney</em> many defense lawyers made appropriate objections to jury instructions incorporating those presumptions.  Petitioner made none here.  The North Carolina Supreme Court passed on the validity of the instructions anyway.  The States, if they wish, may be able to insulate past convictions by enforcing the normal and valid rule that failure to object to a jury instruction is a waiver of any claim of error.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 30.</p>\n<p>MR.

S. 666</a></span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Twelve years ago, this Court decided <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span> (1965).  In the intervening years, we have struggled with the question of retroactivity when new constitutional rules affecting the administration of the criminal law have been adopted.  <em>See</em> Beytagh, Ten Years of Non-Retroactivity:  A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va.L.Rev. 1557, 1558-1596 (1975).  The retroactivity doctrine that has emerged is far from satisfactory. Although on several occasions I have joined in its application, I am now persuaded that it would be wiser to adopt the view urged by Mr. Justice Harlan in <em>Mackey v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html">401 U. S. 667</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#675">401 U. S. 675</a></span>-702 (1971) (separate opinion).  <em>See also Desist v.

S. 665</a></span>-666 (1971) (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>When the Court declines to hold a new constitutional rule retroactive, one chance beneficiary -- the lucky individual whose case was chosen as the occasion for announcing the new principle -- enjoys retroactive application, while others similarly situated have their claims adjudicated under the old doctrine.  This hardly comports with the ideal of "administration of justice with an even hand."  <em>Desist v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#255">394 U. S. 255</a></span> (Douglas, J., dissenting). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the holding that a new constitutional principle is fully retroactive also may result in serious costs.  Convictions long regarded as final must be reconsidered on collateral attack; frequently they must be overturned for reasons unrelated to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, and in spite of good faith adherence on the part of police, prosecutors, and courts to what they understood to be acceptable procedures.  Society suffers either the burden on judicial and prosecutorial resources entailed in retrial or the miscarriage of justice that occurs when a guilty offender is set free only because effective retrial is impossible years after the offense.  Reopening a case also carries disadvantages for those who have been convicted:</p>\n<p>"Both the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error, but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community."</p>\n<p><em>Sanders v.

S. 262</a></span> (1973) (POWELL, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>A different approach to the retroactivity question is available.  Described in detail in Mr. Justice Harlan\'s separate opinion in <em>Mackey, supra,</em> it contemplates, in rough outline, that courts apply a new rule retroactively in cases still pending on direct review, whereas cases on collateral review ordinarily would be considered in light of the rule as it stood when the conviction became final. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Mr. Justice Harlan marshaled compellingly the reasoning supporting this view, 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#675">401 U. S. 675</a></span>-698, and for me to repeat the arguments here would be pointless.  I note simply that this approach is closer to the ideal of principled, evenhanded judicial review than is the traditional retroactivity doctrine.  At the same time, it is more attuned to the historical limitations on habeas corpus, <em>see Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span> (1976), and to the importance of finality in a rational system of justice.  <em>See Blackledge v. Allison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/63/case.html">431 U. S. 63</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/63/case.html#83">431 U. S. 83</a></span> (1977) (POWELL, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The case before us is here on direct review.  I therefore agree with the Court that Hankerson is entitled to retroactive application of the <em>Mullaney</em> rule.  Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, as Mr. Justice Harlan noted, the typical nonretroactivity decision often places the Court in the role of a legislature, rather than that of a judicial tribunal.  <em>Mackey v. United States,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#677">401 U.

The case he makes for these exceptions is persuasive, but I save for another day when the question is squarely presented a decision on when such exceptions are appropriate.  <em>See also Williams v.
