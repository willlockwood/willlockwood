Arguing that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 activities amounted in context to extortionate acts that created a pattern of racketeering activity, respondents based their claims on, <em>inter alia</em>, the Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to \xe2\x80\x9cobstruc[t], dela[y], or affec[t] commerce \xe2\x80\xa6 by \xe2\x80\xa6 robbery or extortion \xe2\x80\xa6 or commit[ting] or threaten[ing] physical violence to any person or property in<em> </em>furtherance of a<em> </em>plan or<em> </em>purpose to do anything in violation of this section,<em>\xe2\x80\x9d</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a), and on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which defines a proscribed \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71962(a), in terms of certain predicate acts that include extortion, see \xc2\xa71961(1).  After trial, the jury concluded that petitioners violated RICO\xe2\x80\x99s civil provisions, the Hobbs Act, and other extortion-related laws.  In <em>Scheidler</em> v. <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/393/index.html">537 U. S. 393</a> <em>(NOW II),</em> this Court reversed the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s award of damages and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of a permanent nationwide injunction.  The Court noted that the Hobbs Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d as necessarily including the improper \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obtaining of property from another,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 400 (quoting \xc2\xa71951(b)(2)); observed that the claimed \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d here consisted of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek clinic services and the rights of clinic staff to perform their jobs and of clinics to provide care free from wrongful threats, violence, coercion, and fear, <em>id.,</em> at 400\xe2\x80\x93401; decided that characterizing petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 actions as an \xe2\x80\x9cobtaining of property from\xe2\x80\x9d respondents went well beyond permissible boundaries, <em>id</em>., at 402; and held, therefore, that petitioners did not commit extortion as defined by the Hobbs Act, <em>id</em>., at 397.  The Court concluded that, because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a RICO violation had to be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed, <em>id., </em>at 411.  On remand, the Court of Appeals decided that, because this Court had not considered respondents\xe2\x80\x99 alternative theory that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s RICO verdict rested not only on extortion-related conduct, but also on four instances (or threats) of physical violence <em>unrelated</em> to extortion, the cases must be remanded to the District Court to determine whether these four acts alone might constitute Hobbs Act violations (sufficient, as predicate acts under RICO, to support the injunction).  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Congress did not intend to create a freestanding physical violence offense.  It did intend to forbid acts or threats of physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what the Act refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts or conspiracies).  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The more restrictive reading of the statutory text\xe2\x80\x94the one tying the prohibited violence to robbery or extortion\xe2\x80\x94is correct.  For one thing, it is the more natural reading.  The text preceding the physical violence clause does not forbid <em>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce; </em>rather, it forbids <em>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce</em> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>by robbery or extortion</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(a) (emphasis added).  This means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute only if it also involves robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies).  Consequently, the reference in the physical violence clause to actions or threats of violence \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of a plan or purpose <em>to do anything in violation of this section</em>\xe2\x80\x9d seems to mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose <em>to engage in robbery or extortion</em>, for that is the only kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a violation.  This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms as \xe2\x80\x9caffect commerce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin commerce\xe2\x80\x9d to be read as terms of art connecting the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) granting that authority.  See, <em>e.g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</em> v. <em>Dobson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/265/index.html">513 U. S. 265</a>, 273.  Such jurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behavior that the statute calls a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law.  Cf. <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/848/index.html">529 U. S. 848</a>, 854.  Moreover, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history supports the more restrictive reading: Both of the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor statutes made clear that the physical violence they prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce through coercion or extortion (1934 Act) or through extortion or robbery (1946 Act).  The Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history contains nothing to the contrary.  That the present statutory language is less clear than the 1946 version does not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime.  To the contrary, Congress revised the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language in 1948 as part of its general revision of the Criminal Code, which \xe2\x80\x9cwas not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/246/index.html">342 U. S. 246</a>, 269, n.\xc2\xa028.  The Court will not presume the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law absent a clearly expressed intent to do so.  <em>Keene Corp.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/200/index.html">508 U. S. 200</a>, 209.  Here there is no evidence of any such intent.  Finally, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation broadens the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope well beyond what case law has assumed.  It would federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, that typically is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution.  Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach.  See, <em>e.g., NOW II, supra</em>, at 405.  Other Courts of Appeals have rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 construction of the Act.  And in 1994, Congress enacted the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7248(a)(3), which was aimed specifically at the type of activity at issue in this litigation, thereby suggesting that Congress did not believe that the Hobbs Act already addressed that activity.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b) Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the canon of statutory construction favoring interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute, thereby avoiding linguistic superfluity, is misplaced.  They claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that take place through acts of violence (or related threats), see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71951(b)(1) and (2), there would be no reason for \xc2\xa71951(a) to contain its physical violence clause unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense.  Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the clause to do.  The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands payment from a business.  Those threats constitute attempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business by the mobster\xe2\x80\x99s subordinates might not constitute attempted extortion or be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mobster\xe2\x80\x99s plan, absent the specific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit extortion.  The Government adds that the clause permits prosecutors to bring multiple charges for the same conduct; <em>e.g.,</em> a robber who injured bystanders could be charged with the separate Hobbs Act crimes of robbery and of using violence in furtherance of the robbery.  While this additional work is concededly small, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent is clear.  Interpretive canons are designed to help courts determine what Congress intended, not to lead them to interpret the law contrary to that intent.

The dispute in these cases concerns the meaning of the underscored words, in particular the words, \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  Does this phrase refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect interstate commerce <em>through robbery or extortion</em>?  Or does it refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect interstate commerce, plain and simple?  If the former, the statute governs only a limited subset of violent behavior, namely, behavior connected with robbery and extortion.  If the latter, the statute governs a far broader range of human activity, namely, all violent actions (against persons or property) that affect interstate commerce.  In our view, the former, more restrictive reading of the Act is the correct interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are individuals (and organizations) who engage in pro-life, anti-abortion protest activities.  Respondents are health care clinics that perform abortions and a pro-choice national nonprofit organization that supports the legal availability of abortions.  In 1986, (pro-choice) respondents, believing that (pro-life) petitioners had tried to disrupt activities at health care clinics that perform abortions through violence and various other unlawful activities, brought this legal action, which sought damages and an injunction forbidding (pro-life) petitioners from engaging in such activities anywhere in the Nation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents based their legal claims upon the Hobbs Act, certain other laws that forbid extortion, and a federal antiracketeering statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71962.  Respondents argued that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 clinic-related protest activities amounted in context to extortion.  They added that these extortionate acts created a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a pattern that RICO defines in terms of certain predicate acts that include acts of extortion.  See \xc2\xa71961(1) (Supp. III).  And they sought a permanent injunction, which they believed RICO authorized. See \xc2\xa71964 (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Initially, the District Court dismissed their complaint.  It concluded that RICO requires proof that the alleged criminal acts were motivated by an economic purpose\xe2\x80\x94a purpose that is lacking here.  <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheidler</em>, 765 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 937 (ND Ill. 1991). <em> </em>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheidler</em>, 968 F.\xc2\xa02d 612 (1992).  But this Court held that the statute \xe2\x80\x9crequires no such economic motive,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore reversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case for further proceedings.  <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheidler,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/249/index.html">510 U. S. 249</a>, 252 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After trial, the jury found that petitioners had engaged in a host of extortionate, or extortion-related, acts.  It awarded treble damages to two of the respondents (a matter not at issue here) and the District Court entered a nationwide injunction.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71964(a), (c).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  267 F.\xc2\xa03d 687 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court again reversed.  <em>Scheidler</em> v. <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/393/index.html">537 U. S. 393</a> (2003) <em>(NOW II)</em>.  We noted that the Hobbs Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d as necessarily including the improper \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obtaining of property from another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 400 (quoting \xc2\xa71951(b)(2)).  We pointed out that the claimed \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d consisted of \xe2\x80\x9ca woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek medical services from a clinic, the right of the doctors, nurses or other clinic staff to perform their jobs, and the right of the clinics to provide medical services free from wrongful threats, violence, coercion and fear.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U. S., at 400\xe2\x80\x93401 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We decided that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever the outer boundaries may be, the effort to characterize petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 actions here as an \xe2\x80\x98obtaining of property from\xe2\x80\x99 respondents is well beyond them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 402.  Accordingly, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they did not \xe2\x80\x98obtain\xe2\x80\x99 property from respondents,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cdid not commit extortion\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by the Hobbs Act.  <em>Id</em>., at 397.  We found that the state extortion law violations, and other extortion-related violations, were flawed for the same reason and must also be set aside.  <em>Id</em>., at 410.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our opinion concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cBecause all of the predicate acts supporting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed.  Without an underlying RICO violation, the injunction issued by the District Court must necessarily be vacated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 411.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the Court of Appeals did not order the District Court to terminate the cases or to vacate its injunction.  Instead, the Court of Appeals considered respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s RICO verdict rested not only upon many instances of extortion-related conduct, but also upon four instances (or threats) of physical violence <em>unrelated</em> to extortion.  91 Fed. Appx. 510, 512 (2004).  The Court of Appeals decided that the parties had not presented this theory to this Court and, as a result, we had no occasion to consider whether these four acts alone might constitute Hobbs Act violations (sufficient, as predicate acts under RICO, to support the nationwide injunction).  See <em>id</em>., at 513.  The Court of Appeals remanded the cases to the District Court to make that determination.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners sought certiorari to review this ruling.  We granted the writ to consider the following three questions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) Whether the Court of Appeals improperly disregarded this Court\xe2\x80\x99s mandate in <em>NOW II </em>by holding that the injunction issued by the District Court might not need to be vacated;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2) Whether the Hobbs Act forbids violent conduct unrelated to extortion or robbery; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3) Whether RICO authorizes a private party to obtain an injunction.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe now answer the second question.  We hold that physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside the scope of the Hobbs Act.  And since our answer to the second question requires an entry of judgment in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor, we shall not answer the first or third questions.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first set forth the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The relevant statutory section imposes criminal liability on</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property <em>in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question, as we have said, concerns the meaning of the phrase that modifies the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical violence,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the words \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  Do those words refer to violence (1) that furthers a plan or purpose to \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] commerce \xe2\x80\xa6 by robbery or extortion,\xe2\x80\x9d or to violence (2) that furthers a plan or purpose simply to \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] commerce\xe2\x80\x9d?  We believe the former, more restrictive, reading of the text\xe2\x80\x94the reading that ties the violence to robbery or extortion\xe2\x80\x94is correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the language of the statute makes the more restrictive reading the more natural one.  The text that precedes the physical violence clause does not forbid <em>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce</em> (or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce); rather, it forbids <em>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce</em> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>by robbery or extortion</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).  This language means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute only if that behavior also involves robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies).  Consequently, the reference in the physical violence clause to actions or threats of violence \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of a plan or purpose <em>to do anything in violation of this section</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) would seem to mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose <em>to engage in robbery or extortion</em>, for that is the only kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms as \xe2\x80\x9caffect commerce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin commerce\xe2\x80\x9d to be read as terms of art connecting the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) that grants Congress that authority. See <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</em> v. <em>Dobson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/265/index.html">513 U. S. 265</a>, 273 (1995); <em>Russell</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/858/index.html">471 U. S. 858</a>, 859 (1985).  Such jurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behavior that the statute calls a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law.  Cf. <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/848/index.html">529 U.

Congress enacted the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in 1934.  See Anti-Racketeering Act, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979 (reproduced in Appendix, <em>infra</em>).  That predecessor Act prohibited coercion and extortion appropriately connected with interstate commerce, and placed these prohibitions in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(a) and 2(b), respectively.  48 Stat. 980.  The Act went on in \xc2\xa72(c) to impose criminal liability on anyone who, in connection with interstate commerce, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate sections (a) or (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>NOW II</em>, 537 U. S., at 407.  The 1934 Act explicitly linked \xc2\xa72(c), the physical violence subsection, with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(a) and 2(b).  It thereby made crystal clear that the physical violence that it prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce <em>through coercion or extortion</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1946, Congress enacted a superseding law, namely, the Hobbs Act.  Ch. 537, 60 Stat. 420 (reproduced in Appendix, <em>infra</em>).  The new law changed the old law in two significant respects: It added robbery while omitting coercion.  <em>NOW II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 407; see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Culbert,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/371/index.html">435 U. S. 371</a>, 377 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe bill that eventually became the Hobbs Act \xe2\x80\xa6 substituted specific prohibitions against robbery and extortion for the Anti-Racketeering Act\xe2\x80\x99s language\xe2\x80\x9d).  The new Act, like the old Act, was absolutely explicit in respect to the point here at issue, the necessary link between physical violence and other crimes (now extortion and robbery).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1946 Hobbs Act reads as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSec. 2.\xc2\xa0Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce, or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion, shall be guilty of a felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSec. 3.\xc2\xa0Whoever conspires with another or with others, or acts in concert with another or with others to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty of a felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSec. 4.\xc2\xa0Whoever attempts or participates in an attempt to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty of a felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSec. 5.\xc2\xa0Whoever commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property <em>in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of section 2</em> shall be guilty of a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  60 Stat. 420 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs \xc2\xa72 makes clear, the statute prohibits <em>robbery</em> and <em>extortion</em>.  As \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xc2\xa72 makes clear, the statute prohibits violence <em>only</em> when that violence furthers a plan or purpose to affect commerce by robbery or extortion.  Each of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s other sections reflects the same approach; each explicitly refers back to \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against robbery and extortion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history contains nothing to the contrary.  Indeed, the Committee Reports and floor debates emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of the bill was \xe2\x80\x98to prevent anyone from obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce, or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or extortion<em> as defined in the bill.</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Culbert</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 377 (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1945); emphasis added in <em>Culbert</em>); see <em>Culbert, supra,</em> at 376\xe2\x80\x93378 (discussing legislative history).  They nowhere suggested that Congress intended to make physical violence a freestanding crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present Hobbs Act language is less clear than the 1946 version.  But the linguistic changes do not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime.  To the contrary, Congress revised the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s language in 1948 as part of its general revision of the Criminal Code.  That \xe2\x80\x9c1948 Revision was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/246/index.html">342 U. S. 246</a>, 269, n.\xc2\xa028 (1952).  This Court has written that it will \xe2\x80\x9cnot presume that the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law \xe2\x80\x98unless an intent to make such [a] change[e] is clearly expressed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Keene Corp.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/200/index.html">508 U. S. 200</a>, 209 (1993) (alteration made in <em>Keene</em>; quoting <em>Fourco Glass Co.</em> v. <em>Transmirra Products Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/222/index.html">353 U. S. 222</a>, 227 (1957)).  And here there is no evidence of any such intent.  Rather, the Reviser\xe2\x80\x99s Notes indicate that the linguistic changes to the Hobbs Act simply amount to \xe2\x80\x9cchanges in phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A131 (1947).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Hobbs Act interpretation broadens the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope well beyond what case law has assumed.  It would federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, behavior that typically is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution.  Decisions of this Court have assumed that Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach.  See <em>NOW II</em>, 537 U. S., at 405 (noting that the Hobbs Act embodied extortion, which required the obtaining of property, not coercion); <em>id</em>., at 411 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (coercion, which is not covered by the Hobbs Act, \xe2\x80\x9cmore accurately describes the nature of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 [non-property-related] actions\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Enmons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/396/index.html">410 U. S. 396</a>, 410 (1973) (Hobbs Act does not reach violent activity by union members seeking higher wages because such violence is not extortion and Congress did not intend to \xe2\x80\x9ccover all overtly coercive conduct in the course of\xe2\x80\x9d a labor dispute).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not surprisingly, other Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 construction of the Act.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yankowski</em>, 184 F.\xc2\xa03d 1071 (CA9 1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Franks</em>, 511 F.\xc2\xa02d 25 (CA6 1975).  And in 1994, Congress enacted a specific statute aimed directly at the type of abortion clinic violence and other activity at issue in this litigation, thereby suggesting it did not believe that the Hobbs Act already addressed that activity.  See Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7248(a)(3) (imposing criminal liability on anyone who \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally damages or destroys the property of a facility, or attempts to do so, because such facility provides reproductive health services\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contrary claim rests primarily upon a canon of statutory construction that favors interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute, thereby avoiding linguistic superfluity.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Menasche,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/528/index.html">348 U. S. 528</a>, 538\xe2\x80\x93539 (1955) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our duty \xe2\x80\x98to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Montclair</em> v. <em>Ramsdell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/147/index.html">107 U. S. 147</a>, 152 (1883))).  They claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that takes place through acts of violence (or related threats), \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here would be no reason for the statute to include the clause prohibiting violence and threats of violence\xe2\x80\x9d unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense.  Brief for Respondents 25; see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(b)(1) (defining \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful taking or obtaining of personal property \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>by means of actual or threatened force, or violence</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa71951(b)(2) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of property from another \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the words to do.  Brief for Petitioners Scheidler et\xc2\xa0al. 33\xe2\x80\x9336; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands payment from a business.  Those threats constitute attempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business by the subordinates of that mobster may not constitute attempted extortion and may not be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mobster\xe2\x80\x99s plan.  A specific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit extortion would bring the subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 behavior within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  The United States adds that the physical violence clause permits prosecutors to bring multiple charges for the same conduct.  For instance, the clause would apply to a defendant who injured bystanders during a robbery, permitting the Government to charge that defendant with the Hobbs Act crime of robbery and the separate Hobbs Act crime of using violence in furtherance of the robbery.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We concede that this additional work is small.  But the need for language to cover such instances, or perhaps simply a desire to emphasize the problem of violence, led Congress in the original 1946 version of the Hobbs Act to make clear that the statute prohibited, not all physical violence, but only physical violence in furtherance of <em>a plan or purpose to engage in robbery or extortion</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  And it is similarly clear that Congress intended to carry this view forward into the 1948 recodification.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  The canons of interpretation cannot lead us to a contrary conclusion.  Those canons are tools designed to help courts better determine what Congress intended, not to lead courts to interpret the law contrary to that intent. <em>Chickasaw Nation</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/84/index.html">534 U. S. 84</a>, 94 (2001) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9ccanons are not mandatory rules\xe2\x80\x9d but guides \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to help judges determine the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cother circumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcome their force\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that Congress did not intend to create a freestanding physical violence offense in the Hobbs Act.  It did intend to forbid acts or threats of physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what the statute refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts or conspiracies).
