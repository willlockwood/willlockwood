The Court has examined all the federal questions raised by appellant.  Insofar as the appeal challenges the validity of Georgia Code \xc2\xa7 38-1604, which makes incompetent the testimony of a wife at the trial of her husband, the judgment of the court below rests upon a nonfederal ground adequate to support it -- namely that the failure to tender such testimony at the trial barred any later claim of the alleged constitutional right.  <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Mims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/242/532/case.html">242 U.

The Court finds that no other federal question presented by the appeal warrants review by this Court.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
