B. Jamesson, who held her until September, 1806, when he became insolvent under the insolvent act of the District of Columbia, and delivered her, as part of his property, to Auld, the plaintiff in error, who was appointed trustee under that act.  This suit was commenced on 19 September, 1806.</p>\n<p>Whereupon the plaintiff in error prayed the court to instruct the jury that if it found the facts to be as stated, the plaintiff below was not entitled to recover.  And if the court should not think proper to give that instruction, that they would instruct the jury that the plaintiff\'s suffering the slave to remain out of his actual possession for so long a time was fraudulent in law as to the defendant, which instructions the court refused to give, and the defendant Auld excepted.  The verdict and judgment being against him, he brought his writ of error.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
