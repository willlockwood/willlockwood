S. 109</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The charter of the appellant Democratic Party of the United States (National Party) provides that delegates to its National Convention shall be chosen through procedures in which only Democrats can participate.  Consistently with the charter, the National Party\'s Delegate Selection Rules provide that only those who are willing to affiliate publicly with the Democratic Party may participate in the process of selecting delegates to the Party\'s National Convention.  The question on this appeal is whether Wisconsin may successfully insist that its delegates to the Convention be seated, even though those delegates are chosen through a process that includes a binding state preference primary election in which voters do not declare their party affiliation.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the National Convention is bound by the Wisconsin primary election results, and cannot refuse to seat the delegates chosen in accord with Wisconsin law.  93 Wis.2d 473, 287 N.W.2d 519.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Rule 2A of the Democratic Selection Rules for the 1980 National Convention states:</p>\n<p>"Participation in the delegate selection process in primaries or caucuses shall be restricted to Democratic voters only who publicly declare their party preference and have that preference publicly recorded. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>Under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 450 U. S. 110</a></p><p> National Party rules, the "delegate selection process" includes any procedure by which delegates to the Convention are bound to vote for the nomination of particular candidates. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The election laws of Wisconsin [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] allow non-Democrats -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 450 U. S. 111</a></p><p> including members of other parties and independents -- to vote in the Democratic primary without regard to party affiliation and without requiring a public declaration of party preference.  The voters in Wisconsin\'s "open" [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] primary express their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 450 U. S. 112</a></p><p> choice among Presidential candidates for the Democratic Party\'s nomination; they do not vote for delegates to the National Convention.  Delegates to the National Convention are chosen separately, after the primary, at caucuses of persons who have stated their affiliation with the Party. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  But these delegates, under Wisconsin law, are bound to vote at the National Convention in accord with the results of the open primary election. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Accordingly, while Wisconsin\'s open Presidential preference primary does not itself violate National Party rules, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the State\'s mandate that the results of the primary shall determine the allocation of votes cast by the State\'s delegates at the National Convention does.</p>\n<p>In May, 1979, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin (State Party) submitted to the Compliance Review Commission of the National Party its plan for selecting delegates to the 1980 National Convention.  The plan incorporated the provisions of the State\'s open primary laws, and, as a result, the Commission disapproved it as violating Rule 2A. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Since compliance with Rule 2A was a condition of participation at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 450 U. S. 113</a></p><p> the Convention, for which no exception could be made, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the National Party indicated that Wisconsin delegates who were bound to vote according to the results of the open primary would not be seated.</p>\n<p>The State Attorney General then brought an original action in the Wisconsin Supreme Court on behalf of the State.  Named as respondents in the suit were the National Party and the Democratic National Committee, who are the appellants in this Court, and the State Party, an appellee here.  The State sought a declaration that the Wisconsin delegate selection system was constitutional as applied to the appellants and that the appellants could not lawfully refuse to seat the Wisconsin delegation at the Convention.  The State Party responded by agreeing that state law may validly be applied against it and the National Party, and cross-claimed against the National Party, asking the court to order the National Party to recognize the delegates selected in accord with Wisconsin law.  The National Party argued that, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, it could not be compelled to seat the Wisconsin delegation in violation of Party rules.</p>\n<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court entered a judgment declaring that the State\'s system of selecting delegates to the Democratic National Convention is constitutional and binding on the appellants.  93 Wis.2d 473, 287 N.W.2d 519.  The court assumed that the National Party\'s freedom of political association, protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, gave it the right to restrict participation in the process of choosing Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates to Democrats.  <em>Id.</em> at 511-512, 287 N.W.2d at 536.  It concluded, however, that the State had not impermissibly impaired that right.  The court said that the State\'s primary election laws were themselves intended to permit persons to vote only for the candidates of the party they preferred, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 450 U. S. 114</a></p><p> that, as a practical matter, requiring a public declaration of party affiliation would not prevent persons who are not Democrats from voting in the primary. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Moreover, the court reasoned that, to whatever extent appellants\' constitutional freedom of political association might be burdened by the Wisconsin election laws, the burden was justified by the State\'s "compelling . . . interest in maintaining the special feature of its primary . . . which permits private declaration of party preference."  <em>Id.</em> at 521, 287 N.W.2d at 541.</p>\n<p>The court declared that the votes of the state delegation at the National Convention for Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates must be apportioned and cast as prescribed by Wisconsin law, and that the State\'s delegates could not, for that reason, be disqualified from being seated at the Convention. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The National Party and the Democratic National Committee then brought this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2).</p>\n<p>Wisconsin held its primary on April 1, 1980, in accord with its election laws.  Subsequently, the State Party chose delegates to the 1980 Democratic National Convention, in compliance with the order of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Wis.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8.12(3)(b), (3)(c)5 (1977).  This Court noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal on July 2, 1980.  448 U.S. 909.  On the same day, the Court stayed the judgment of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 450 U. S. 115</a></p><p> the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  On July 20, 1980, the Credentials Committee of the National Convention decided to seat the delegates from Wisconsin, despite this Court\'s stay, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and despite the delegates\' selection in a manner that violated Rule 2A. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Rule 2A can be traced to efforts of the National Party to study and reform its nominating procedures and internal structure after the 1968 Democratic National Convention. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 450 U. S. 116</a></p><p> The Convention, the Party\'s highest governing authority, directed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to establish a Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection (McGovern/Fraser Commission).  This Commission concluded that a major problem faced by the Party was that rank-and-file Party members had been underrepresented at its Convention, and that the Party should</p>\n<p>"find methods which would guarantee every American <em>who claims a stake in the Democratic Party</em> the opportunity to make his judgment felt in the presidential nominating process."</p>\n<p>Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, Mandate for Reform:  A Report of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection to the Democratic National Committee 8 (Apr.1970) (emphasis added) (hereafter Mandate for Reform).  The Commission stressed that Party nominating procedures should be as open and accessible as possible to all persons who wished to join the Party, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] but expressed the concern that</p>\n<p>"a full opportunity for all Democrats to participate is diluted if members of other political parties are allowed to participate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 450 U. S. 117</a></p><p> in the selection of delegates to the Democratic National Convention."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 47. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1972 Democratic National Convention also established a Commission on Delegate Selection and Party Structure (Mikulski Commission).  This Commission reiterated many of the principles announced by the McGovern/Fraser Commission, but went further to propose binding rules directing state parties to restrict participation in the delegate selection process to Democratic voters.  Commission on Delegate Selection and Party Structure, Democrats All:  A Report of the Commission on Delegate Selection and Party Structure 2, 15 (Dec. 6, 1973) (hereafter Democrats All).  The DNC incorporated these recommendations into the Delegate Selection Rules for the 1976 Convention.  In 1974, the National Party adopted its charter and by-laws.  The charter set the following qualifications for delegates to the Party\'s national conventions:</p>\n<p>"The National Convention shall be composed of delegates who are chosen through processes which (i) assure all Democratic voters full, timely and equal opportunity to participate and include affirmative action programs toward that end, (ii) assure that delegations fairly reflect the division of preferences expressed by those who participate in the presidential nominating process, . . . [and] (v) <em>restrict participation to Democrats only.</em> . . ."</p>\n<p>Democratic National Committee, Charter of the Democratic Party of the United States, Art. Two, \xc2\xa7 4 (emphasis added). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 450 U. S. 118</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Rule 2A took its present form in 1976.  Consistent with the charter, it restricted participation in the delegate selection process in primaries or caucuses to "Democratic voters only who publicly declare their party preference and have that preference publicly recorded."  But the 1976 Delegate Selection Rules allowed for an exemption from any rule, including Rule 2A, that was inconsistent with state law if the state party was unable to secure changes in the law. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1975, the Party established yet another commission to review its nominating procedures, the Commission on Presidential Nomination and Party Structure (Winograd Commission).  This Commission was particularly concerned with what it believed to be the dilution of the voting strength of Party members in States sponsoring open or "crossover" primaries. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Indeed, the Commission based its concern in part on a study of voting behavior in Wisconsin\'s open primary.  <em>See</em> Adamany, Cross-Over Voting and the Democratic Party\'s Reform Rules, 70 Am.Pol.Sci.Rev. 536, 538-539 (1976).</p>\n<p>The Adamany study, assessing the Wisconsin Democratic primaries from 1964 to 1972, found that crossover voters comprised 26% to 34% of the primary voters; that the voting patterns of crossover voters differed significantly from those of participants who identified themselves as Democrats; and that crossover voters altered the composition of the delegate slate chosen from Wisconsin. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The Winograd Commission </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 450 U. S. 119</a></p><p> thus recommended that the Party strengthen its rules against crossover voting, Openness, Participation and Party Building:  Reforms for a Stronger Democratic Party 68 (Feb. 17, 1978) (hereafter Openness, Participation), predicting that continued crossover voting</p>\n<p>"could result in a convention delegation which did not fairly reflect the division of preferences among Democratic identifiers in the electorate."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  And it specifically recommended that</p>\n<p>"participation in the delegate selection process in primaries or caucuses . . . be restricted to Democratic voters only who publicly declare their party preference and have that preference publicly recorded."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 69.  Accordingly, the text of Rule 2A was retained, but a new Rule, 2B, was added, prohibiting any exemptions from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 450 U. S. 120</a></p><p> Rule 2A.  Delegate Selection Rules for the 1980 Democratic Convention, Rule 2B. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The question in this case is not whether Wisconsin may conduct an open primary election if it chooses to do so, or whether the National Party may require Wisconsin to limit its primary election to publicly declared Democrats. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Rather, the question is whether, once Wisconsin has opened its Democratic Presidential preference primary to voters who do not publicly declare their party affiliation, it may then bind the National Party to honor the binding primary results, even though those results were reached in a manner contrary to National Party rules.</p>\n<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court considered the question before it to be the constitutionality of the "open" feature of the state primary election law, as such.  Concluding that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 450 U. S. 121</a></p><p> open primary serves compelling state interests by encouraging voter participation, the court held the state open primary constitutionally valid.  Upon this issue, the Wisconsin Supreme Court may well be correct.  In any event, there is no need to question its conclusion here.  For the rules of the National Party do not challenge the authority of a State to conduct an open primary, so long as it is not binding on the National Party Convention.  The issue is whether the State may compel the National Party to seat a delegation chosen in a way that violates the rules of the Party.  And this issue was resolved, we believe, in <em>Cousins v. Wigoda,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html">419 U. S. 477</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cousins,</em> the Court reviewed the decision of an Illinois court holding that state law exclusively governed the seating of a state delegation at the 1972 Democratic National Convention, and enjoining the National Party from refusing to seat delegates selected in a manner in accord with state law although contrary to National Party rules.  Certiorari was granted</p>\n<p>"to decide the important question . . . whether the [a]ppellate [c]ourt was correct in according primacy to state law over the National Political Party\'s rules in the determination of the qualifications and eligibility of delegates to the Party\'s National Convention."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html#483">419 U.

The Court reversed the state judgment, holding that</p>\n<p>"Illinois\' interest in protecting the integrity of its electoral process cannot be deemed compelling in the context of the selection of delegates to the National Party Convention."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html#491">419 U.

That election is conducted without advance party registration or any public declaration of party affiliation, thus allowing any registered voter to participate in the process by which the Presidential preferences of the Wisconsin delegation to the Democratic National Convention are determined.  The question in this case is whether, in light of the National Party\'s rule that only publicly declared Democrats may have a voice in the nomination process, Wisconsin\'s open primary law infringes the National Party\'s First Amendment rights of association.  Because I believe that this law does not impose a substantial burden on the associational freedom of the National Party, and actually promotes the free political activity of the citizens of Wisconsin, I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Wisconsin open primary law was enacted in 1903.  1903 Wis. Laws, ch. 451.  It was amended two years later to apply to Presidential nominations.  1905 Wis Laws, ch. 369.  <em>See</em> 93 Wis.2d 473, 492, 287 N.W.2d 519, 527 (1980).  As the Wisconsin Supreme Court described in its opinion below:</p>\n<p>"The primary was aimed at stimulating popular participation in politics, thereby ending boss rule, corruption, and fraudulent practices which were perceived to be part of the party caucus or convention system.  Robert M. La Follette, Sr., supported the primary because he believed that citizens should nominate the party candidates; that the citizens, not the party bosses, could control the party by controlling the candidate selection process; and that the candidates and public officials would be more directly responsible to the citizens."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>As noted in the opinion of the Court, the open primary law only recently has come into conflict with the rules of the National Democratic Party.  The new Rule 2A was enacted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 450 U. S. 128</a></p><p> as part of a reform effort aimed at opening up the party to greater popular participation.  This particular rule, however, has the ironic effect of calling into question a state law that was intended itself to open up participation in the nominating process and minimize the influence of "party bosses."</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The analysis in this kind of First Amendment case has two stages.  If the law can be said to impose a burden on the freedom of association, then the question becomes whether this burden is justified by a compelling state interest.  <em>E.g., Bates v. Little Rock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/516/case.html">361 U. S. 516</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/516/case.html#524">361 U. S. 524</a></span> (1960).  The Court in this case concludes that the Wisconsin law burdens associational freedoms.  It then appears to acknowledge that the interests asserted by Wisconsin are substantial, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#120">450 U. S. 120</a></span>-121, but argues that these interests</p>\n<p>"go to the conduct of the Presidential preference primary -- not to the imposition of voting requirements upon those who, in a separate process, are eventually selected as delegates,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#125">450 U. S. 125</a></span>.  In my view, however, any burden here is not constitutionally significant, and the State has presented at least a formidable argument linking the law to compelling state interests.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In analyzing the burden imposed on associational freedoms in this case, the Court treats the Wisconsin law as the equivalent of one regulating delegate selection, and, relying on <em>Cousins v. Wigoda,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html">419 U. S. 477</a></span> (1975), concludes that any interference with the National Party\'s accepted delegate selection procedures impinges on constitutionally protected rights.  It is important to recognize, however, that the facts of this case present issues that differ considerably from those we dealt with in <em>Cousins.</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Cousins,</em> we reversed a determination that a state court could interfere with the Democratic Convention\'s freedom to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 450 U. S. 129</a></p><p> select one delegation from the State of Illinois over another.  At issue in the case was the power of the National Party to reject a delegation chosen in accordance with state law because the State\'s delegate selection procedures violated party rules regarding participation of minorities, women, and young people, as well as other matters.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html#479">419 U. S. 479</a></span>, n. 1.  The state court had ordered the Convention to seat the delegation chosen under state law, rather than the delegation preferred by the Convention itself.  In contrast with the direct state regulation of the delegate selection process at issue in <em>Cousins,</em> this case involves a state statutory scheme that regulates delegate selection only indirectly.  Under Wisconsin law, the "method of selecting the delegates or alternates [is] determined by the state party organization," Wis.Stat. \xc2\xa7 8.12(3)(b) (1977).  Wisconsin simply mandates that each delegate selected, by whatever procedure, must be pledged to represent a candidate who has won in the state primary election the right to delegate votes at the Convention. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, Wisconsin merely requires that the delegates "vote in accordance with the results of the Wisconsin open primary."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#126">450 U. S. 126</a></span>.  While this regulation affecting participation in the primary is hardly insignificant, it differs substantially from the direct state interference in delegate selection at issue in <em>Cousins.</em>  This difference serves to emphasize the importance of close attention to the way in which a state law is said to impose a burden on a party\'s freedom of association.  <em>Cf. Marchioro v. Chaney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/191/case.html">442 U. S. 191</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/191/case.html#199">442 U. S. 199</a></span> (1979).  All that Wisconsin has done is to require the major parties to allow voters to affiliate with them -- for the limited purpose of participation in a primary -- <em>secretly,</em> in the privacy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 450 U. S. 130</a></p><p> of the voting booth. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The Democrats remain free to require public affiliation from anyone wishing any greater degree of participation in party affairs.  In Wisconsin, participation in the caucuses where delegates are selected is limited to publicly affiliated Democrats.  Brief for Appellee Democratic Party of Wisconsin 19.  And, as noted above, the State\'s law requires that delegates themselves affirm their membership in the party publicly.</p>\n<p>In evaluating the constitutional significance of this relatively minimal state regulation of party membership requirements, I am unwilling -- at least in the context of a claim by one of the two major political parties -- to conclude that every conflict between state law and party rules concerning participation in the nomination process creates a burden on associational rights.  Instead, I would look closely at the nature </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 450 U. S. 131</a></p><p> of the intrusion, in light of the nature of the association involved, to see whether we are presented with a real limitation on First Amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that nomination of a candidate for President is a principal function performed by a national political party, and Wisconsin has, to an extent, regulated the terms on which a citizen may become a "member" of the group of people permitted to influence that decision.  If appellant National Party were an organization with a particular ideological orientation or political mission, perhaps this regulation would present a different question. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In such a case, the state law might well open the organization to participation by persons with incompatible beliefs, and interfere with the associational rights of its founders.</p>\n<p>The Democratic Party, however, is not organized around the achievement of defined ideological goals.  Instead, the major parties in this country "have been characterized by a fluidity and overlap of philosophy and membership."  <em>Rosario v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/752/case.html">410 U. S. 752</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/752/case.html#769">410 U. S. 769</a></span> (1973) (POWELL, J., dissenting).  It can hardly be denied that this Party generally has been composed of various elements reflecting most of the American political spectrum. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The Party does take positions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 450 U. S. 132</a></p><p> on public issues, but these positions vary from time to time, and there never has been a serious effort to establish for the Party a monolithic ideological identity by excluding all those with differing views.  As a result, it is hard to see what the Democratic Party has to fear from an open primary plan.  Wisconsin\'s law may influence to some extent the outcome of a primary contest by allowing participation by voters who are unwilling to affiliate with the Party publicly.  It is unlikely, however, that this influence will produce a delegation with preferences that differ from those represented by a substantial number of delegates from other parts of the country.  Moreover, it seems reasonable to conclude that, insofar as the major parties do have ideological identities, an open primary merely allows relatively independent voters to cast their lot with the party that speaks to their present concerns. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 450 U. S. 133</a></p><p> By attracting participation by relatively independent-minded voters, the Wisconsin plan arguably may enlarge the support for a party at the general election.</p>\n<p>It is significant that the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, which represents those citizens of Wisconsin willing to take part publicly in Party affairs, is here defending the state law.  Moreover, the National Party\'s apparent concern that the outcome of the Wisconsin Presidential primary will be skewed cannot be taken seriously when one considers the alternative delegate selection methods that are acceptable to the Party under its rules.  Delegates pledged to various candidates may be selected by a caucus procedure involving a small minority of Party members, as long as all participants in the process are publicly affiliated.  While such a process would eliminate "crossovers," it would be at least as likely as an open primary to reflect inaccurately the views of a State\'s Democrats. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In addition, the National Party apparently is quite willing to accept public affiliation immediately before primary voting, which some States permit. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  As Party affiliation becomes this easy for a voter to change in order to participate in a particular primary election, the difference between open and closed primaries loses its practical significance. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 450 U. S. 134</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In sum, I would hold that the National Party has failed to make a sufficient showing of a burden on its associational rights. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court does not dispute that the State serves important interests by its open primary plan.  Instead, the Court argues that these interests are irrelevant, because they do not support a requirement that the outcome of the primary be binding on delegates chosen for the convention.  This argument, however, is premised on the unstated assumption that a nonbinding primary would be an adequate mechanism for pursuing the state interests involved.  This assumption is unsupportable, because the very purpose of a Presidential primary, as enunciated as early as 1903, when Wisconsin passed its first primary law, was to give control over the nomination process to individual voters. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Wisconsin cannot do this, and still pursue the interests underlying an open primary, without making the open primary binding. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 450 U. S. 135</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If one turns to the interests asserted, it becomes clear that they are substantial.  As explained by the Wisconsin Supreme Court:</p>\n<p>"The state\'s interest in maintaining a primary and in not restricting voting in the presidential preference primary to those who publicly declare and record their party preference is to preserve the overall integrity of the electoral process by encouraging increased voter participation in the political process and providing secrecy of the ballot, thereby ensuring that the primary itself and the political party\'s participation in the primary are conducted in a fair and orderly manner."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"In guaranteeing a private primary ballot, the open primary serves the state interest of encouraging voters to participate in selecting the candidates of their party which, in turn, fosters democratic government.  Historically, the primary was initiated in Wisconsin in an effort to enlarge citizen participation in the political process and to remove from the political bosses the process of selecting candidates."</p>\n<p>93 Wis.2d at 512-513, 287 N.W.2d at 53537 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The State\'s interest in promoting the freedom of voters to affiliate with parties and participate in party primaries has been recognized in the decisions of this Court.  In several cases, we have dealt with challenges to state laws restricting voters who wished to change party affiliation in order to participate in a primary.  We have recognized that voters have a right of free association that can be impaired unconstitutionally if such state laws become too burdensome.  In <em>Rosario v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/752/case.html">410 U. S. 752</a></span> (1973), the Court upheld a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 450 U. S. 136</a></p><p> registration time limit, but emphasized that the law did not absolutely prevent any voter from participating in a primary, and was "tied to a particularized legitimate purpose" of preventing "raiding," [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/752/case.html#762">410 U. S. 762</a></span>.  In <em>Kusper v. Pontikes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html">414 U. S. 51</a></span> (1973), we struck down an Illinois law that prevented voters who had participated in one party\'s primary from switching affiliations to vote in another party\'s primary during the succeeding 23 months.  We concluded that such a law went too far in interfering with the freedom of the individual voter, and could not be justified by the State\'s interest in preventing raiding.</p>\n<p>Here, Wisconsin has attempted to ensure that the prospect of public party affiliation will not inhibit voters from participating in a Democratic primary.  Under the cases just discussed, the National Party\'s rule requiring public affiliation for primary voters is not itself an unconstitutional interference with voters\' freedom of association.  <em>Nader v. Schafer,</em> 417 F.Supp. 837 (Conn.) (three-judge court), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 429 U.S. 989 (1976).  But these cases do support the State\'s interest in promoting free voter participation by allowing private party affiliation.  The State of Wisconsin has determined that some voters are deterred from participation by a public affiliation requirement, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] and the validity of that concern is not something that we should second-guess.

In the process,</p>\n<p>"the States have evolved comprehensive, and in many respects complex, election codes regulating in most substantial ways, with respect to both federal and state elections, the time, place, and manner of holding primary and general elections, the registration and qualifications of voters, and the selection and qualification of candidates."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html">Storer v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 450 U.

[<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Today, the Court departs from this process of accommodation.  It does so, it seems to me, by upholding a First Amendment claim by one of the two major parties without any serious inquiry into the extent of the burden on associational freedoms and without due consideration of the countervailing state interests.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The delegates selected must be approved by the candidate they are to represent, Wis.Stat. \xc2\xa7 8.12(3)(b) (1977), and must pledge that they are affiliated with the candidate\'s party and will support their candidate until he or she fails to receive at least one-third of the votes authorized to be cast at the Convention, \xc2\xa7 8.12(3)(c).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>It is not fully accurate to say, as the Court does, that the</p>\n<p>"election laws of Wisconsin allow non-Democrats -- including members of other parties and independents -- to vote in the Democratic primary."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#110">450 U.

Thus, the act of voting in the Democratic primary fairly can be described as an act of affiliation with the Democratic Party.

Too simple a distinction ignores the range of nuances and varieties within the closed primary states, which, after all, do account for 82 percent of the states.  Take the case of Illinois.  Voters do not register as members of a party; at the polling place, they simply state their party preference and are given the ballot of that party, no questions asked.  Because Illinois voters must disclose a party preference before entering the voting booth, their primary is generally considered \'closed.\'   One would be hard put, however, to argue that it is, in operation, much different from an open primary."</p>\n<p>F. Sorauf, Party Politics in America 206 (4th ed.1980) (hereinafter Sorauf).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, the National Party could decide that it no longer wishes to be a relatively nonideological party, but it has not done so.  Such a change might call into question the institutionalized status achieved by the two major parties in state and federal law.  It cannot be denied that these parties play a central role in the electoral process in this country, to a degree that has led this Court on occasion to impose constitutional limitations on party activities.  <em>See Smith v. Allwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/649/case.html">321 U. S. 649</a></span> (1944); <em>Terry v. Adams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/461/case.html">345 U. S. 461</a></span> (1953).  Arguably, the special status of the major parties is an additional factor favoring state regulation of the electoral process even in the face of a claim by such a party that this regulation has interfered with its First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> Sorauf 204 ("it was an article of faith among [the Progressives] that, to cure the ills of democracy, one needed only to prescribe larger doses of democracy").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>Any argument that a nonbinding primary would be sufficient to allow individual voters a voice in the nomination process is belied by the fact that such a primary often will be ignored in later, nonprimary delegate selection processes.  In 1980, for example, Vermont\'s nonbinding open primary produced a lopsided victory, 74.3% to 25.7%, for President Carter over Senator Kennedy.  38 Cong.Q.Weekly Rep. 647 (1980).  Party caucuses then produced a state delegation to the Democratic Convention that favored Kennedy over Carter by 7 to 5.  <em>Id.</em> at 1472.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>"Raiding" refers to primary voting by members of another party who are seeking to encourage their opponents to select a less desirable or strong candidate.  It does not appear to be a problem in Wisconsin.  <em>See</em> 93 Wis.2d at 506, 287 N.W.2d at 533 ("The petitioner and respondents agree that raiding is not a significant problem, and that neither the Wisconsin open primary nor the declaration required by Rule 2A prevents <em>raiding\'") .\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/13" name="F2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>A related concern is the prevention of undue influence by a particular political organization or "machine."  The Progressives who promoted the idea of a primary election perceived a need to combat political professionals who controlled access to governmental power.  <em>See</em> A. Lovejoy, La Follette and the Establishment of the Direct Primary in Wisconsin 7-8 (1941) ("avowed purpose" was "the elimination of the boss from the American political scene"); <em>id.</em> at 97 ("Because of their faith in the American people, the Progressives sought to cure the ills of democracy with more democracy. . . .  For the first time, the middleman was eliminated between the people and their representatives"); Sorauf 203-204.  The open primary carries this process one step further by eliminating some potential pressures from political organizations on voters to affiliate with a particular party.  Although one well may question the wisdom of a state law that undermines the influence of party professionals and may tend to weaken parties themselves, the state interests involved are neither illegitimate nor insubstantial.  As noted <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#133">450 U. S. 133</a></span>, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin has filed a brief in support of the validity of the Wisconsin plan.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/14" name="F2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p>A more difficult question in this case is whether Wisconsin can satisfy the second component of the "compelling interest test" -- whether it can show that it has no "less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests."  <em>Kusper v. Pontikes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html">414 U. S. 51</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html#59">414 U. S. 59</a></span> (1973).  The answer to this question depends in many cases on how the state interest is conceived.  Here, a state interest in protecting voters from the possible coercive effects of public party affiliation cannot be satisfied by any law except one that allows private party affiliation.  On the other hand, if the state interest is described more generally, in terms of increasing voter freedom or participation, there may well be less "drastic" alternatives available to Wisconsin.  Because of my conclusion that there is no significant burden on the associational freedoms of appellant National Party in this case, and because the Court\'s analysis does not reach this question, I express no view on whether the State has shown a sufficient interest in this particular method of regulating the electoral process to satisfy a "less drastic means" inquiry.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court concedes that the States have a substantial interest in regulating primary elections.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/107/case.html#124">450 U.
