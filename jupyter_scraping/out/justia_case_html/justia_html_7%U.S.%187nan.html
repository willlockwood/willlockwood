No parol testimony appears to have been offered to explain the report or to apply it to the time of commencing the risk.  The bill of exceptions is repugnant.  It asks an opinion predicated upon the unsoundness of the vessel on 24 October, and relies upon the report of the surveyors which applies only to 31 October.  If it was intended to bring before this Court the propriety of admitting parol evidence to explain the report, that question does not appear to arise from the record.</p>\n<p>I see no reason for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p>I do not, however, mean to be understood that if parol evidence had been offered, it would have been proper to receive it.  I give no opinion upon that point.</p>\n<p>PATERSON, J.</p>\n<p>No parol evidence appears upon the record to show that the report of the surveyors referred to 24 October.  The conclusiveness of the report therefore did not come before the Court.  It is not a point in the cause.</p>\n<p>CUSHING, J.</p>\n<p>This is an action on a policy of insurance.  The defense set up is that the vessel was unsound and rotten on 24 October, when the risk commenced, and it is alleged that the report of the surveyors is conclusive evidence of that fact.  But the report does not apply to that time.  Let the judgment be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
